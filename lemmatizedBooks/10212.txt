be not a good little boy nobody ever keep a diary except a boy that want to be a angel and with the angel stand or a girl that be in love or a old maid that can not catch a man unless she write down she emotion and leave they around so some man will read they and swallow the bait and not feel the hook in he gill or a truly good bank cashier who teach Sunday school and skip out for canada some Saturday night after the bank close and on Monday morning they find the combination of the lock on the safe changed and when they hire a reform burglar to open the lock the money be all go with the cashier those be the only people that ever keep a successful diary but i have to promise ma that i would keep a diary so she could read it or i never could have get she consent for I to go with pa on the road with a circus all ma ask of I be to tell the truth about everything that happen to I and to pa during the whole summer and i have consent and i can see my finish and pa 's finish and ma 's finish and the finish of the circus that be go to take we along gee but we have have a hot time at we house since pa and i get back from we trip abroad i bring pa back in better health than he be when he go away but he have get so accustomed to excitement that i know something would be do pretty soon so i be not surprise when he tell we at the breakfast table that he suppose he should have to go and travel with a circus this summer ma look at pa as though she want to call the police and be ambulance to take he to the emergency hospital he look at ma and at I spear another waffle and say : i know you will think i be nutty but for almost ten year i have have a block of stock in a circus and menagerie i go into it to help some young circus fellow and put up quite a bunch of money because they be honest and poor and for a few year thing go wrong and i think my money be go but for the last six year the circus have pay dividend bigger than standard oil and today it stand away up among the financial success and the dividend on my citrus stock be better than any bank stock i have get and it come just like find money the company decide at its annual meeting to invite I to take the position of one of the manager and i shall soon go to the winter quarter of the show to arrange to put it on the road about the 1st of may now any remark may be make pro or con in regard to my sanity see well ma swallow something crosswise down she Sunday throat and choke and pa swat she on the back so she would cough it up and when she could speak she say : pa do you have to wear tights and jump through hoop on the back of a horse and cut up dido at you time of life for if you do i can never live to witness any such performance -lrb- illustration : pa swat she on the back -rrb- pa be calm and do not fly off the handle but he just say kindly : mother you have vague idea of the duty of the owner of a circus the owner hire performer to do stunt and break they neck while we manage they and take in the shekel from the reuben who come into town on circus day we proprietor touch the button and the actor and animal do the rest i shall be a director who direct a man who set a dignified and pious example to the man and woman who adorn the profession come as they do from all clime and you pa will be the guide philosopher and friend of all who belong to the grandest aggregation of talent ever gather under one canvas at one price of admission and do not fail to witness the concert which will be give under this canvas after the main performance be over ma look at pa pretty savage and say : o i see you be go to be ringmaster but what be to become of hennery and I while you be crack you whip around the hind leg of the fat woman and ogle the circassian beauty pa put he hand on my head and say : mother hennery will go with I to see that i do not get into any trouble as a circus financier and general manager of the menagerie and wild west aggregation and hippodrome in the great three-ring circus and you can stay home and give we absent treatment for what ail we and pack the money i shall send you in bale with a hay press and put it in cold storage till we come back in the fall it be settle we go to conquer and the world will lay at we foot before the middle of August and you will be a proud woman to own a husband who will be point at as the most successful amusement purveyor the world have ever witness and a son who will start in at the bottom round of the circus ladder and rise step by step until he will stand beside the great barnum ma think seriously for a few minute and then she say : o pa if it be anything but the circus business you and hennery go into like sell soap or be a bank defaulter or something respectable i could look the neighbor in the face but of course if there be money in it and you feel that the good lord have call you to the circus field and you will see that hennery do not stay out night and hennery will promise to see that you put on a clean collar occasionally and you will promise I that you will not let any of those circus woman in spangle make eye at you i will consent to you go with the circus just this once as the doctor have advise that you lead a active life and i guess you will get it travel with a circus for it nearly kill I that time i take hennery to see the animal and the tent blow down and we get separated and the sacred cow chase ma up the church step and hennery and a monkey be bring home by a policeman about daylight the next morning that time you be off fishing and i never tell you about go to the circus when you be away so we be circus proprietor be we well it be not so bad and ma go upstairs to cry at we success and pa and i go out to walk off the effect of the break the news to ma -lrb- illustration : sacred cow chase ma up the church step -rrb- i have a long talk with pa about we change circumstance and ask he what i would be expect to do in the show and he say i will fit in anywhere he say that a boy who know as much about everything as i think i know but do not know a blame thing about will be invaluable about a show and that go into a new business be like go to college as a freshman as all the old circus man will haze we and we must not expect a easy life but one full of excitement sleepless night ginger the glare of the torchlight the race the fly trapeze the smell of the sawdust and tanbark the howling of the wild beast and the plaudit of the multitude of jay and jayess and it will be like one grand circus day spread all over the summer and fall he say he want I to learn the circus business from the ground up from the currying of the hyena with a currycomb and brush to go up into the roof of the tent on the trapeze and fall into the net while the audience faint with excitement i ask pa if he want I to keep on play trick on he while we be on the road and he say he have get so use to my trick that he could not live without they and he do not want I to let a chance escape to make he have a good time April 11 -- ma and pa have have several discussion about what kind of a position it be go to leave she in among the neighbor for pa and i to go off with a circus and ma want to withdraw from the church and board up the window of the house and make folk think we have go to the seashore but pa convinced she that we would have preach in the main tent every Sunday and he say there be no more pious lot of people on earth than those who travel with a circus and then ma want to go along she say she could do the mending of the long sock that the woman wear when they ride bareback but we have to shut down on ma 's go with the show cause we never could have any fun with a woman to look after pa say nowadays the man and woman who ride on bareback horse in the ring dress in regular evening costume the woman with low-necked dress and long train and the man with swallow-tail coat and patent leather shoe and they be as polite as dance master we have compromise with ma and she be to meet the show at kalamazoo and go with we to kankakee and keokuk until she be overcome by nervous prostration when we shall have she go home pa think ma would last about two day with the show but i guess if she take a course of treatment with peanut and red lemonade one afternoon and evening she would want to throw up she job and go back home in charge of a stomach specialist well pa show up at the house in he circus clothes this afternoon and he certainly be a peach pa have be let he chin whisker grow for about six week and today he have they color black and he look as though he have swallow the black brush and leave the bunch of bristle outside on he chin he look fierce then he have get a new brand of silk hat with a wide curling brim and he have have a vest make of black and blue check goods the check as big as the check on a checker board and a pair of pants that look like a diamond-back rattlesnake and he have get a imitation diamond stud in he white shirt that look like a paper weight ma want to know if there be any law to compel pa to dress like that 'cause he look as though he be a gambler or a train robber pa say that a circus proprietor have get to look different from anybody else in order to inspire fear and respect on the part of the hand around the show as well as the audience that flock to the arena and he ask ma if she do not remember old dan rice and old john robinson ma do not remember they but she remember barnum because barnum lecture on temperance and she say she hope pa would emulate barnum 's example and pa say he would and then he take a watch chain with link as big as a trace chain and spread it across he checkered vest from one pocket to the other with a life-size gold elk hang down the middle and ma almost have a convulsion gee but if pa wear that rig in the menagerie tent the animal will paw and bellow like a drive of cattle that smell blood pa be go to wear a sack coat with he outfit so as to look tough and he would not hear to ma when she try to get he to wear a frock coat he say a frock coat be all right in society or among the crown head but when you have to mingle with lion and elephant one minute that would snatch the tail off a coat and chew it and the next minute you be mix up with a bunch of freak or a lot of bareback rider or trapeze performer you have get to compromise on a coat that will fit any climate and not cause invidious remark whatever that be i will have to stand up beside the giant once in a while to show the difference in the size of man and at other time i will have to stand beside the midget and look like a giant myself we be all pack up and in two day we start for the winter quarter of the show to pound it into shape for the road by ginger i can not hardly wait to get there and see pa boss thing chapter ii the bad boy visit the circus in winter quarter -- he meet the circus performer -- dad ride a horse and get toss in a blanket -- the bad boy go kangaroo -- pa 's clothes cause excitement among the animal -- a monkey steal he watch April 15 -- we be now at the winter quarter of the show in a little town on a farm just outside where the tent be put up and the animal be be care for in barn and the performer be limber up they joint wear overcoat to turn flip-flap and everybody have a cold and look blue and all be anxious for warm weather pa create a sensation when we arrive by he stunning clothes he jet black chin whisker and he watch chain over he checkered vest and when the proprietor introduce pa to the performer and hand as a old stockholder in the show who would act as assistant manager during the season and pa smile on they with a frown on he forehead and say he hope he relation with they would be pleasant one of the old canvasman remark to a girl who ride two horse at once with the horse strap together so they can not get too far apart and cause she to break in two say that old goat with the silk hat would last just about four week and that he remind the canvasman of a big dog which bark at people as though he would eat they and at the same time wag he tail so people would not think he be so confound dangerous the principal proprietor of the circus tell pa to make himself at home around the tent and not be offend at any pleasantry on the part of the attach of the show for they be full of fun and he go off to attend to some business and leave pa with the gang they be practice ride bare-backed horse around the ring with a rope hitch in a belt around the waist of the rider and a arm swing around from the center pole so if they fall off the horse the rope would prevent the rider from fall to the ground a practice that the best rider adopt early in the season the same as new beginner 'cause they be all stiffen up by be out of practice one man ride around a few time and pa get up close to the ring and be make some comment such as : why any condemn fool could ride a horse that way when the circus gang as quick as you could say scat fasten a belt around pa 's stomach that have a ring in it and before he know it they have hitch a snap in the ring and pa be haul up as high as the horse and he foot rest on the horse 's back and the horse start on a gallop well say pa be never so surprised in he life but he dig he heel into the horse 's back and try to look pleasant and the horse go half way around the ring and just as pa be get confidence some one hit the horse on the ham with a piece of board and the horse go out from under pa and he begin to fall over backwards and i think he circus career would end right there when the man who have hold of the rope pull up and pa be suspend in the air by the ring in the belt back up and stomach hang down like a pillow he watch dangle about a foot down towards the ring and the horse come around the ring again and as he go under pa pa try to get he foot on the horse 's back but he could not make it work and pa say as cross as could be : lookahere you feller you let I down or i will discharge every mother 's son of you -lrb- illustration : pa be suspend in the air -rrb- but they do not seem to be scare for one man catch the horse and let it out of the ring and the man who handle the rope tie it to the center pole by a half hitch and the fellow all go into the dress room to play cinch on the trunk leave pa hang there just then the boss canvasman come along and he say : hello old man what you do up there and pa say some of the pirate in the show have kidnap he and seem to be hold he up for a ransom and he say he would give ten dollar if some one would let he down the boss canvasman say he could fix it for ten all right and he blow a whistle and the gang come back and the boss say : bring a blanket and help this gentleman down so they bring a big piece of canvas with handle all around it and about a dozen fellow hold it and the rope man let pa down on the canvas and unhitch the ring and when pa be in the canvas he laugh and say : thanks gentleman i guess i be mot much of a horseback rider and then the fellow pull on the handle of the canvas and by gosh pa shoot up into the air half-way to the top of the tent and when he come down they catch he in the canvas and toss he up a whole lot of time until pa say : o let up and make it $ 20 just then the proprietor who have introduce pa to the man come in and see what be go on and he say : here you heathen you quit this hazing right here and they let pa down on the floor of the ring and he get up and pull he pants down that have get up above he knee and shake himself and take out he roll and peel off a $ 20 bill and give it to the canvasman and he shake hand with they all and say he like a joke as well as anybody and for they to spend the money to have a good time and they all laugh and pat pa on the back and say he be a dead game sport and would be a honor to the profession and that now that he have take the first degree as a circus man he could call on they for any sacrifice or any work and he would find that they would be johnny on the spot then he go out to the dining tent and take dinner with the crowd and have a jolly time there be a woman trapeze performer on one side of pa at dinner and she begin to kick at once about the meal and when the waiter bring a piece of meat to we all -- a great big piece that look like corn beef she say : for heaven 's sake be not that elephant that die all be eat up yet and then she tell pa that they have be feed on that deceased elephant until they all feel like they have trunk grow out of they head and pa poke the meat with he fork and think it be elephant and he lose he appetite and everybody laugh i eat some of it and if it be elephant it be all right well when dinner be about over all fill they glass to drink to the health of pa the old stockholder and new manager and pa get up and bow and make a little speech and when he sit down one of the circus girl be in he chair and he sit in she lap and the crowd all yell except a spanish bull-fighter who seem to be the husband of the woman pa sit on and he want pa 's blood but the old circus manager take he away to save pa from trouble and he glare back at pa and i think he will stab pa with a dirk knife we get out of the dining tent and go to the barn where the animal be keep all winter and pa want I to become familiar with the habit of the beast 'cause they be to be in pa 's charge with the keeper of the different kind of animal to report to pa nobody need tell I that animal have no human instinct and do not know how to take a joke we be apt to think that wild animal in captivity be worry over be confine in cage and gaze at and comment on by curious visitor and that they dream of the free life they live in the jungle and sigh to go back where they be capture and prowl around for food but you can not fool I animal that formerly have to go around in the wood hungry half the time and occasionally gorge themselves on a dead animal and sleep out in the rain in all kind of weather know when they have strike a good thing in a menagerie with clean straw to sleep in and when they be hungry all they have to do be to sound they bugle and they have pre-digested beefsteak and breakfast food bring to they on a silver platter and if the food be not to they liking they set up a kick like a star boarder at a board house they condition in the show in its changed condition from that of they native haunt be like take a hobo off the truck of a freight train and take he to the dining car of the limited and let he eat to a finish people talk about animal escape from captivity and go back to the jungle and humane society shed tear over the poor sad-eyed captive sigh for they home but you turn they loose at south bend and run you circus train to new albany without they and they would follow the train and overtake it before the evening performance the next day and you would find they try to break into they cage again and they would have to be feed when pa and i go into the barn where the cage be to take a account of stock and get acquaint with we animal they act just like the circus man do when they see pa 's clothes the animal be about half asleep when we go in but a big lion bent one eye on pa and then he rise up and shake himself and give a roar and a cough that sound like he have the worst case of pneumonia and he snort a couple of time as though he be say to the other animal : here 's something that will kill you dead and i want you all to have a piece of it raw and he bray some more and all the animal join in the chorus the big tiger lie down on he stomach and wave he tail and snarl and show he tooth like a cat that have locate a mouse hole and the tiger seem to say : o i see it first and it be mine the hyena set up a laugh like a man who be not tickled but feel that it be up to he to laugh at a funny story that he can not see the point of at a banquet where chauncey depew tell one of he cripple joke and pa be get nervous a big grizzly bear be walk delegate in he cage and he look at pa as much as to say : hello teddy i be not at home when you call in colorado but you get in this cage and i will make you think the spanish war be a Sunday school picnic beside what you will get from you uncle ephraim and a bob cat jump up into the top of he cage and snarl and show he tooth and seem to say : bring on you whole pack of dog and i will eat they alive pa throw out he chest in front of a monkey cage and a monkey snatch he watch and then all the animal begin to laugh at pa just like a lot of bad boy in school when visitor make a call pa go around to visit all the animal officially while i get interested in a female kangaroo with a couple of baby not more than three week old and i notice the mother kangaroo make the old man kangaroo she husband stand around and he act just like some man i have see who be afraid to say they soul be they own in the presence of they wife the female kangaroo be surely a wonder and seem to be build on plan and specification different from any other animal cause she have get a fur-lined pouch on she stomach just like a vest that she carry she young in when the baby be frighten they make a hurry-up move towards ma the pouch open and they jump in out of sight like a gopher go into its hole and the mother look around as innocent as can be as much as to say : you can search I i do not know honestly where those kid have go but they be around here not more than a minute ago and when the fright be over the two head peep out of the top of the pouch and the old man grunt as much as to say : o come on out there be no danger and let you ma have a little rest 'cause she be nervous and then the baby come out and run around the cage and sit up on they hind foot and look wise that kangaroo pouch be a success and i wonder why nature do not provide pouch for all animal to carry they young in i think pullman must have get he idea for the upper and lower berth of a sleep car by see a kangaroo pouch i be go to study the kangaroo and make friend with the old man kangaroo 'cause he look as though he have trouble of he own pa show up without any coat while i be kangaroo and there be a rip in he pants and i ask he what be the trouble and he say he get too near the cage of a leopard that seem to be asleep and the traitor reach out he paw and gather in the tail of pa 's coat and just snatch it off he back as though it be make of paper -lrb- illustration : a leopard reach out he paw and gather in the tail of pa 's coat -rrb- pa be a little discourage about he experience in the circus the first day but he say it will be great when we get the run of the business he say every day will have its excitement tomorrow they be go to extract a tooth from the boa-constrictor and pa and i be go to help hold he while the animal dentist pull the tooth and then we scrub the rhinoceros and oil the hippopotamus and get everything ready to start out on the road and i can not write any more in my diary until after we fix the snake gee but he be as long as a clothesline chapter iii pa reprove the fat woman for lose flesh -- the bearded lady faint in pa 's arm -- the bad boy introduce into animal society -- they pull the boa constrictor 's ulcerated tooth winter quarter of the only circus April 20 -- pa have have a hard job today the boss complain to pa that the fat woman have be take anti-fat or dieting or something 'cause she be lose flesh and the living skeleton be begin to fat up he want pa to call they into the office and have a diplomatic talk with they about they condition 'cause if this thing continue they would ruin the show so pa go to the office and send for they and i be there as a witness in case of trouble the fat woman come in first and there be no chair big enough for she so she sit down on a leather lounge which break and let she down on the floor and pa try to help she up but it be like lift a load of hay so he lean she against the wall and say : madame the management have detail I to censure you for lose flesh and i be instruct to say if you do not manage to take on about fifty pound more flesh before the show start on the road you do not go along what you want to do be to eat more starchy food and sleep more at night they tell I you go out night to dance and drink high ball and this have get to stop drink beer and eat cheese sandwich at night or it be all off this show can not afford to take along no 400-pound fairy for a fat woman when the contract call for a 500-pound mountain of flesh see and pa look just as stern as could be the fat woman begin to cry and sob so it sound like a engine blow off steam and she tell pa that the cause of she losing flesh be that she be in love with the living skeleton and that he have be pay attention to the bearded woman and she would scratch she eye out if she could catch she just then the living skeleton come in and when he see the fat woman sit on the floor cry and pa talk soothing to she and tell she he could appreciate she condition 'cause he have be in love some hisself the skeleton push pa away and try to lift it and say : what

illustration : i will hold you responsible for this -rrb- pa yell for help and i think it be time for I to be do something so i go outside the office to the fire alarm box and touch a button and then i run like thunder for the police and the fireman come with the extinguisher and begin to throw chemically charge water into the room and the police drag out the fat woman who have faint and the living skeleton whom she have pull down into she lap and lay they out in the ring and then they get hold of pa and pull he out and the bearded woman have faint in pa 's arm and the stove be tip over and be set fire to the furniture and they bring the bearded woman and the fat woman to they sens by pour water on they from a hose finally they be send to they quarter and the other owner of the show come to pa and say he hope this would be the last of that kind of business as long as pa remain with the show that one of the rule be that no man in a executive capacity must under any circumstance take any liberty with any of the female connect with the show pa be hot and say when woman get crazy in love no man be safe and the other owner of the show say that be all right this time but not to let it occur again and pa try to explain how the bearded woman come to jump on to he and faint in he arm but the owner say : that be all right but you can not hold 'em in you arm before folk and then pa offer to whip any man who say he be in love with any bearded woman and he pull off he coat just then i come along and tell the whole story and then the crowd all have a good laugh and pa take they all out and treat i guess it be all settle now 'cause the living skeleton and the fat woman have get permission to get marry the bearded lady be sweet on pa and a girl have just join the show who walk a wire and she say i be about the sweetest thing that ever come down the pike and i guess this show business be all right all right April 21 -- we be get acquaint with the animal and it be just like go into society there be the aristocracy which consist of the high bear animal the middle class and the low down common herd and when you go among the animal as stranger you be receive just as you would be in society if you be properly introduce to the elephant by the elephant keeper who vouch for you standing and honor the elephant take to you all right and extend to you certain courtesy same as society people would invite you to dinner but if you wander around and sort of butt in the elephant be on to you in a minute and roll they eye at you and look upon you as a common person and if you attempt any familiarity they look at you as much as to say : sir i be not allow to associate with any except the 400 then they turn they back and act so much like shoddy aristocracy that you would swear they be human i remember when pa be first in the elephant corral the keeper forget to tell the big elephant who pa be and when the keeper raise up one foot of the elephant and examine a corn pa go up and pinch a bunch on the elephant 's leg and say to the keeper : that look to I like a spavin and he nebb it hard well the elephant groan like a boy with a stone bruise on he heel and before pa know what be come the elephant wind he trunk under pa and raise pa upon he tusk and be go to toss he in the air and catch he as he come down and walk on he when pa yell murder and the keeper take a iron hook and hook it into the elephant 's skin and say : let that man down and he let pa down easy and the keeper some way show the elephant that pa be one of the owner of the show and that elephant act just as human as could be for he fairly toady to pa like a society leader that have give the cold shoulder to some one that be as good or better than they or like a impudent employee who have insult he employer and be afraid of lose he job after that whenever pa and i go around the elephant they bow down to we and i think i could take a iron hook and drive a elephant anywhere there be all class among the animal in a menagerie the same as human society the lion be like the leader of society who be well bear and proud but poor they be always invite everywhere but never entertain though they kick and find fault and ogle everybody and look wise and distinguish the sacred cattle be too good to live and pose as the pious animal who do not want to associate with the bad animal and be constantly wear a air of i be holier than any of you but they will reach through the bar of they cage and steal alfalfa from the yak and the mule deer and if they kick about it the sacred cattle look hurt and act like it be part of they duty to take up a collection and they bellow a sort of hymn to drown the kick the different kind of goat in a menagerie be the butters-in or the new rich who get in the way of the society leader and try to outdo they in society stunt but they smell so that the other animal be make sick and the goat be only tolerate because animal society be afraid to offend they for fear the leader may some time go into bankruptcy and the goat will take they place and never let they get a smell of the good thing of life the bear be the work people of the show and the big grizzly be the walk delegate who control the amalgamated association of work bear and the occupant of the other cage have get to cater to uncle ephraim the walk delegate or be place on the unfair list and slug the hyena and the jackal and the wolf represent the anarchist who be down on everybody in the show who will not do a thing to help along and will not allow any other animal to do anything and who seem to want to burn and slay to carry a torch by night and poison by day and want everything in the show to be chaos those animal be never so happy as when the wind and lightning strike the tent and blow it down and kill people and create a panic and then these anarchist sing and laugh and enjoy they peculiar kind of animal religion the zebra and giraffe be the dude of the show and you can imagine if they be human they would play tennis and golf drive four in hand and pose to be admire while the royal bengal tiger if they be half human would drive automobile at the rate of a mile a minute on crowded street run over people and never stop to help the wound but skip away with a sneer as much as to say : what be you go to do about it the hippopotamus be like the lazy fat man that groan from force of habit sit down as though it be the last act of he life and only get up when the bell ring for meal and he sweat blood for fear he will lose he meal ticket and starve to death the seal be the clean-cut baptist of the show who believe in immersion and they have more brain than any animal in the show because they live on a fish diet though they have a pneumonia cough that make you feel like send for a doctor gee but last night when we think spring have come and we could start on the road pretty soon the snow fall about a foot deep and it be so cold that all the animal howl all night and shiver and go on a regular strike we have to put blanket on they and no one of they seem to be comfortable except the polar bear the arctic fox and the fat woman the other owner of the show think it be a good time to take the boa constrictor and pull a ulcerated tooth 'cause he be sort of dumpish so pa and i help hold the snake which be about twenty foot long pa be up near the snake 's head and when the man with the forceps get hold of the tooth and give it a yank the confound snake come to and begin to stand on he head and thrash around and pa drop he hold and start to climb the center pole but he get catch in a gasoline torch and they have to turn a hose on pa and he be awful scared 'cause he always do hate snake but they give the snake chloroform and get he quiet and pa come down and they give he a pair of baggy trousers belong to the clown to go to dinner in and pa be a sight -lrb- illustration : they have to turn the hose on pa -rrb- chapter iv pa find the fat lady a burden -- the bad boy make he first public appearance -- he talk politics with the midget -- pa meet with numerous accident may 1 -- we have the darndest time get pack up and start on the road how in the name of heaven we ever get half the thing on the car be more than i know but it seem as though the circus company have a man to look after everything and he have man under he to look after he regular share of thing so when the car be load and the boss clap he hand and the engineer toot he whistle there be not a tent stake or a rope or a board seat or anything leave behind every man know exactly where the thing be that he be responsible for so he could lay he hand on they in the dark and he know just what wagon he stuff be to go in gee but you talk about system there be no business in the world that have a system like a show on the road every performer be in he or she section in the sleeper and pa and i get a end section with the freak the fat woman across the aisle from we that fat woman be go to make life a burden for pa i can see that plain enough she be engage to the living skeleton and he sleep in the upper berth over she and he be jealous of pa while the fat woman have get to depend on pa to do little thing for she of course the first night out be always the worst on a sleeper and the poor woman be nervous and when the animal train in the second section run on a side track beside we train of sleeper and rajah the boss lion get wake up and explode one of he roar within six foot of the fat woman 's berth she just give one yell and rear up and come down hard in the berth something break and she go right through the bottom of the berth to the floor double up like a jackknife pa get up and go to she berth though i tell he to keep away 'cause he would get into trouble first he stumble over one of she shoe and say he think he have tell everybody to keep they telescope valise in the baggage car and that make she mad then he reach in the berth and get hold of one of she foot and pa get the man to help and they get she out but she seem all sqush together she sit up all night and want to lean on pa but the skeleton keep he head over the rail of the upper berth and he snake-like eye never leave pa all night the bearded woman get up out of she berth about daylight to go to the toilet room for a shave or a hair cut or something and when she see pa try to soothe the fat woman and hold she from break in two she scream and slap pa 's face and have a mess of hysteric the fat woman grab a couple of handful of female whisker and be go to pull they out by the root when the bearded woman beg she not to pull they out as to lose she whisker would destroy she means of livelihood then the bugle blow for everybody to get up and go to the show lot and put up the tent for the first show of the season when we get out of the sleeper we ask where we be and a man tell pa we be at peorium ill and he want pa to give he a complimentary ticket for tell what town we be in but pa look fierce at the man and ask what kind of a easy mark he take he for and the man slink away you would not think they could unload those two train of car about 80 in all in a week but when we get out the horse be hitch on the wagon and in 15 minute they be load and on the way to the lot and pa and i get on the first wagon talk about system the surveyor be there ahead of we and have measure off the lot and push wire stake in the ground where the grub tent be to be and when the first wagon of the grub outfit arrive which contain a big range big enough to cook for a thousand man stove pipe be put on which telescope up into the air and in two minute a fire be build and bacon and potato and coffee be cooking local bread wagon be unload bread on the grass 50 man put up pole and spread the tent on and other set up table in the tent and in half a hour breakfast be serve to the first 500 man pa and i draw up to the first table but there be a yell to put 'em out and we find we have sit down to the table of the negro canvasman and they strike because they would not associate on a equality with white trash gee but pa be mad he say he be as good as any nigger and that make they mad and they throw boil potato and scramble egg at pa and we have to retire but when pa complain to the boss canvasman he tell pa to go and eat with the freak and try and keep in he place -lrb- illustration : they throw boil potato and scramble egg at pa -rrb- we get breakfast at another table and then we go out on the lot to superintend the put up of the big tent the greatest thing be a wagon contain a miniature pile driver run by steam which be drive around outside of where the big tent be to be and it drive down the big stake so quick it would make you head swim and the grounds be cover with peorium people who want to see how it be do pa imitate the boss canvasman by walk around the lot with he coat over he arm and a dirty shirt on try to look tough and he boss the sightseer about and act cross and tell a man and woman with a baby wagon to get off the lot but pa be call down by the principal owner of the show good and plenty say the owner to pa : remember the success of we show depend on the friendship and good will of the people who think enough of we to come out to see we set up keep house and that they be all we guest and if they get in we way we should go around they and look pleasant we must not get the big head and show that we hair pull and that we be tired and cross this be a place of amusement and all connect with the show be expect to heal up sore instead of cause bruise and if you ever see a employee of this show treat a visitor unkindly send he to the ticket wagon to get he wages and tell he to go away quick and stay away long you could have light a match to pa 's face it be so red hot but he learn a lesson for i see he hold a tired mother 's baby up on he shoulder so it could see the drive of camel come up to the lot from the train soon after it be great to see all the tent go up as if raise by machinery and after all be erect and the ring be grade and the animal in the menagerie tent all feed and water and the performer in the dressing-room ready for the afternoon performance pa be the proudest man ever be he walk all around inspect everything and kick occasionally at something that get ball up and when the crowd come to buy ticket he stand around the grand entrance look wise and he be so good natured that he bet ten dollar he could guess which walnut shell a bean be under which a three-card monte man be lose money at and pa lose he ten with a smile he say he want to be kind to the patron of the show this be my first appearance in the show business i have to stand up beside the giant to show how little i be and then i have to stand up beside the midget to show how big i be compare with he it go all right with the giant because he be so big i be afraid of he but i think the midget be about my age and need protection and when the crowd surge around we i say : do not be afraid little fellow i will see that no one harm you the look he give I be enough to freeze water when the crowd have go into the big show tent what do you think that confound midget begin to ask I how i stand on the tariff question and he argue for free trade whatever that be for half a hour and make I think of bryan during a campaign and then he branch off on to the monroe doctrine which i suppose be something connect with a rival show and i guess he would be talk yet only a big husky fellow come along a fellow about 25 year old and he stoop over and put he hand on the midget 's shoulder and say : hello dad and by gosh the midget introduce I to the big galoot as he youngest son would not that skin you the first day of the season be great only all the performer have not get limber up one of the girl on the fly trapeze fall off into the net from the roof of the tent and break she suspenders so when they get she down in the ring it seem as though everything she have on be go to shuck loose and leave she with nothing but a string of bead and pa go up to wrap he coat around she and she kick he hat off and run into the dressing-room the audience just yell and pa blush scarlet 'cause he see it be a put-up job to make he ridiculous -lrb- illustration : she kick pa 's hat off -rrb- during the chariot race pa have to jump like a box car to keep from be run over by a four-horse chariot drive by a one-horse girl and the attendant drag pa out from under a bunch of horse be ridden bareback like fury then two horse hitch together with a strap be be ride by a woman the strap break and the horse spread apart and some one yell that she have split clear in two pa rush in to help carry one half of she into the dressing-room but she be not hurt at all 'cause the peanut boy tell I she be a rubber woman and you could stretch she half way across the ring and she would come together all right and eat a hearty meal gee but a circus be a great place to study human nature in the evening performance at peorium there come up a windstorm which blow down part of the menagerie tent where the freak be and when the storm be over and the tent top be pull up again they find pa all right he start to crawl under the canvas and skip out for fear of the animal but the fat lady catch he and sit down on he with the circus chapter v the rogue elephant create a panic and pa prove himself a hero -- the bad boy get scold for be tough -- he find that audience like accident may 6 -- we have the worst time at akron last week and pa prove himself a hero though he be swat good by the rogue elephant before he get he second wind and go for the animal we have a male elephant that be almost human 'cause he get on a tear about once a month like a regular ugly husband you can not tell when he mind be in condition for run amuck but suddenly he will whoop like a drunken man strike he poor patient wife over the back with he trunk and grab she tail and try to pull it out by the root and jump up and crack he heel together like a drunken shoemaker and bellow as though he be say he be a bad man from bitter creek well at akron the keeper of this elephant bolivar have to go and see a girl that he meet when the show be here last year and settle a case of breach of promise before a justice of the peace and the boss tell pa to look after the elephant for a hour or so so pa take a pole with a hook in it and sit down on a bale of hay to watch bolivar it be one of those hot day and bolivar stand droop and perspire and wish the show be in alaska and pa be kind of sleepy like everybody in the show when suddenly that elephant whoop and swat jeanette he wife a couple of time and she cry pitiful and pa put the hook in bolivar 's hide and give a jerk and tell he to hush up that noise but bolivar just rear and pitch and walk right through the side of the menagerie tent and seem to say to the other animal : come on boy there be go to be something do and the animal all set up a howl in they own language as though they be say : whooper up old man and do not let they monkey with you bolivar go out in the street and mow a wide swath with pa after he hook he all the time but he pay no attention to pa he put he head under the side of a street ear load with negro that have come to see the show dress in they Sunday clothes and tip the car over on the side and the negro crawl through the window and go uptown yell murder while bolivar go in front of a grocery store where there be a pile of watermelon and begin to throw they at the people in the street and the negro think a elephant be not so bad so they come back and have a feast pa try to head off bolivar at the grocery but bolivar take half a watermelon and put the red side on top of pa 's head and squashed it down so the seed and juice and pulp run down pa 's shirt and neck and he look as though murder have be commit but pa wipe he face on he shirt sleeve and show game because he keep maul bolivar with the hook bolivar break up a millinery store by throw tomato at the woman in the window and he go into a yard where a woman be wash and squirt the bluing water all over the woman and all over pa and then he chew the clothes on the line and drive the family over the fence -lrb- illustration : bolivar take half a watermelon and put the red side on top of pa 's head -rrb- you would a die to see those milliner climb over a high board fence head first and bolivar actually seem to laugh bolivar run one of he tusk through a barrel of gasoline and it run out on the street car track and a electric spark set it on fire and the fire department turn out but the engine have to all go around bolivar 'cause he would not budge a inch but seem to say : let ` er rip boy this be the fourth of July the circus man begin to come with rope and club to tie bolivar and throw he but he escape into a side street and watch the engine put out the fire and he swing around with he trunk and tusk and would not let anyone come near he but pa with the hook and he seem to enjoy the prodding but i guess that give he courage to keep on do thing the principal proprietor of the show come along and when he see pa with watermelon and bluing water all over he and perspiration roll down he face he say to pa : why do not you take you elephant back to the lot 'cause the afternoon performance be about to begin and that make pa mad and he say : you go on with you afternoon performance and i will have bolivar there all right and then everybody laugh but pa know what he be about pa drop he hook and go to a hose cart and take a babcock extinguisher and strap it on he back and go up to bolivar who be tip over some dummy in front of a clothing store and pa say : bolivar you lay down but bolivar throw a seven-dollar suit of clothes at pa and bellow as much as to defy pa pa turn the cock of the extinguisher and point the nozzle at bolivar 's head and begin to squirt the medicated water all over he for a moment bolivar act as though he could not take a joke and be go to start off again but pa keep squirting and when the chemical water begin to eat into bolivar 's hide the big animal weaken and trumpet in token of surrender and kneel down in front of pa and finally get down so pa could get on he back and pa take the hook and hook it in the flap of bolivar 's ear where be a tender spot and he tell bolivar to get up and go back to the tent and bolivar be as meek as a lamb and he get up with pa on he back and the fire extinguisher on pa 's back and march back to the tent through the hole he have make come out thousand of people follow and cheer pa and when they get in the tent pa say to the principal owner of the show who have make fun of he : here 's you elephant and whenever any of you old animal get on the warpath and you want 'em round up do not forget my number 'cause i can knock the spot out of any animal except a giraffe the crowd cheer pa again and he get down off the elephant take off he fire extinguisher and hand bolivar a piece of rag carpet and say : eat it you old catamaran or i 'll kill you and bolivar be so scared of pa he eat the carpet which show the power of brain over avoirdupois pa say -lrb- illustration : pa turn the cock of the extinguisher and point the nozzle at bolivar 's head -rrb- the regular keeper of bolivar hear he be on the rampage and he come back on the run to conquer he after pa have get he back in the tent but bolivar look at he with a faraway look in he eye as much as to say : seem to I i have meet you somewhere before but a new king have be crown and he take he old keeper by the back of he coat and throw he toward the monkey cage the monkey give the keeper the laugh and bolivar put he trunk lovingly on pa 's shoulder and seem to say : old man you be it from this time out pa look proud and the old keeper look sick the people in the show be go to present pa with a loving cup and i guess he can run the menagerie part of the show when the freak hear of pa 's bravery the fat woman and the bearded lady want to hug pa but pa wave they away and say he like the elephant business best may 7 -- i use to think that if i could belong to a circus and go away with it when it leave the town i live in that it would be pretty near go to heaven i use to hope for the time when i would get nerve enough to run away and go with a circus and wear a dirty shirt and be around a tent and wash off the leg of a spotted horse with castile soap and when people gather about I to watch the proceedings to look tough and tell they in a hoarse voice way down my throat sort of husky from sleep in the wet straw with the spotted horse that they must go on about they business and not disturb the horse i have think if i should run away and go with a circus some day when i get far enough away from ma that i would up and swear and be tough and when i come home in the fall and the neighbor boy would come around I i would chew tobacco and tell they of the joy of circus life well maybe i will some day but at present i be sleepy all the time we have show six time the last week and travel a thousand mile and it seem as though there be nothing do but put up and take down tent and go to and from the car and you can not be tough 'cause there be always some boss around to tell you to look pleasant if you be cross and to tell you to change you shirt or get out of the show and if you swear at anything you be call down pa and i put in a good deal of time during the afternoon and evening performance in the dressing-room near the door lead to the main tent that be the nearest to be in a insane asylum of any place i be ever in the performer get ready for they several act in bunch or family all in one spot and they act serious and jaw each other and each bunch act as though they act be all there be to the show and if it be cut out for any reason the show would have to lay up for the season when in fact each one be only a cog in the great wheel and if one cog should slip the wheel would turn just the same these people never smile before they go in the ring but just act as though too much depend on they to crack a smile when a bunch be call to go in the ring they all look at each other as though it be the parting of the way and they clasp hand and go out of the dressing-room as though walk on egg when they get in the ring they look around to see if all eye be upon they and bow to people who be look at something go on in another ring and who do not see they and then they go through they performance with everybody look somewhere else when the act be over the audience seem glad and clap they hand because they be polite and it do not cost anything to clap hand and the performer turn some more flip flap and go run out to the dressing-room and take a peek back into the big tent as though expect a encore but the audience have forget they and be look for the next mess of performer and the one who have just be in go and lie down on straw and wonder if they can hit the treasurer for a advance on they salary so they can go to a beer garden and forget it all a average audience never get its money 's worth unless some one be hurt do some daring act pa suggest that they have some one pretend to be hurt in every act and have they pick up and carry out on stretcher with doctor wear red cross on they arm in attendance give medicine and restorative the show try it at bucyrus o and have seven man and two woman injure so they have to be carry out and the audience go wild and almost mob the dressing-room to see the doctor operate on the injure it be such a great success that next week we be go to put in a automobile ambulance and have a operating table in the dressing-room with a gauze screen so the audience can see we cut off leg like they do in a hospital maybe we shall put in a dissect room if the people seem to demand it chapter vi the bad boy put fly-paper in the bob cat 's cage -- the bob cat cause a panic in the main tent -- the midget quarrel with the giant -- pa be almost arrest for kidnaping and the ostrich swallow he diamond stud may 14 -- this have be a week that would kill anybody and pa and i talk of resign though pa feel as though he do not want to break up the show by go away right in the middle of the harvesting of shekel from the country man and i do not know what would happen if pa and i should both be take sick at the same time the boss of the menagerie get a new animal by express from colorado when we be leave akron o and we get it in one end of a cage occupy by a happy family of rabbit coon a spotted leopard and a hound dog and a house cat the new animal be a bob cat such as roosevelt shoot when the man have the camera ready to catch he in the act say but that bob cat be a terror and crosser than any animal we get except the hyena the bob cat just walk around and snarl and spit at the happy family through the bar and keep they awake all night on the road and the happy family hold a sort of convention and i could see by the way they all look at I that they be pass resolution invite I to break up the bob cat business the manager of the menagerie tell pa he wish the confound bob cat would escape 'cause he be a bloom nuisance so i think i would help get rid of the beast and save the show from disgrace so when we get to oberlin i think that be a pious community that could stand a wild bob cat so i put several sheet of sticky tanglefoot fly paper in the bob cat 's cage and open the door of the cage after the crowd have go into the main tent to the big show and the menagerie tent be empty except the keeper they be all asleep under the wagon and the animal have all curl down for a nap and the freak be on they platform loll around wait for the main show to be out so they could do they stunt over again the bob cat get all he four foot in the tanglefoot fly paper then he grab a sheet in he mouth and roll over in a few more sheet and when he be entirely harmless and you could not tell what he be i open the door of the cage and he go out like a rocket and roll over a few time in the sawdust and then jump on the platform with the freak run over the fat woman who be lay back in a morris chair and leave one of the sheet of fly paper on she low neck and it stick like a porous plaster she yell that she have be stab and pa come along just as the bob cat jump off the platform and strike pa on the back and the cat spit at pa and pa fall over among the sacred cattle and roll under a cow and get on he knee when the animal all begin to roar and pa crawl behind a bale of hay and a zebra step on pa 's face and pa yell hey rube which be a grand hail sign of distress when circus man want to fight and about a hundred of the canvasman come run with tent stake to hit people with -lrb- illustration : the bob cat strike pa on the back -rrb- pa crawl out from the bale of hay which he have pull over he and the hay stick to the fly paper on pa and a camel begin to eat the hay and he chew pa 's shirt until the hand pull pa away the bob cat escape into the main tent just as the japanese juggler be juggle in no 1 ring and the elephant be stand on they head in no 2 ring and the fly trapeze artist be jump from one trapeze to another and the bob cat rush through the japanese and amongst the elephant with the fly paper all over he and the audience fairly yell 'cause they think it be a clown dress up to do some stunt but the japanese leave the ring in a panic while the elephant get down off they head and stand on they hind foot and cry like child the audience see that something have happen that be serious and they all rise to they foot and be go off into a panic when pa and a few brave man come and drive the bob cat up a centerpole away up above the torch and make speech to the audience and quiet they down and the performance go on but pa be a sight and the head circus man tell pa he would have to dress better or forever after hold he peace and pa say if any man could be more patient than he be with a bob cat on he neck a sacred cow walk on he and a camel try to eat he whisker and shirt they better hire that man but it be all fix up and everybody apologize to everybody and the bob cat go on up the center pole and out on top of the canvas and escape into ohio where it will probably be hold office before next fall gee but the giant be a coward when the bob cat begin to run up the giant 's leg and then up he back and then jump from he shoulder onto the fat lady the giant turn pale and cry and the midget say to he : o you big stiff why do not you have sand enough to hold the kitty till the keeper come i have a good mind to get on a stepladder and kick you and the cowardly giant cry again and say if the midget ever strike he he would report he to the management just then pa come along and ask what the row be about and when pa find that the midget be try to pick a quarrel with the giant he take the midget across he knee and give he a few spank and tell he to quit bully the freak the midget get up on a barrel and call he son who be bigger than pa when i step in between they and tell the midget 's son if he strike my father i would have he heart 's blood and he quail and then i bully the giant who be a coward and now they be all afraid of I i do not see how a big fellow like a giant can be afraid of thing smaller than he be and shy when a dog bark and be afraid some one be go to smash he in the jaw but pa say the size of a man do not make any difference 'cause it be the heart that do the business a man may be big enough and strong enough to tip over a box car load with pig iron but if he heart be one of these little one intend for a miser with no pepper sauce run from the heart to the artery and thing and a liver that be white and nerve that be trembly and no gall to speak of why a big man be liable to be walk all over by a nervy little man who be spunky and get mad and froth at the mouth i have be have great time with the monkey and i guess the manager will make I superintendent of monkey 'cause they all seem to be stick on I and will do anything i tell they to pa say they think i be some new kind of a monkey and they look up to I i lead out the big monkey that ride the goat and dog and have a horse race in the ring and fasten they on the little animal and when they ride around the ring on the dog and goat and pony they keep look at I as though they want my approval there be one little monkey that sleep nearly all the time and i play a trick on pa with it that like to get I arrest and lick by a man who be mad a man and woman with a baby in a little wagon be go through the menagerie and it be crowd and they leave the baby and wagon in pa 's charge near the monkey cage while they go to see the hippopotamus pa be the most accommodate man about hold baby that ever be the baby be asleep when its folk leave it in the wagon with pa but it wake up while they be go and pa take it out of the baby wagon and carry it around just as he would at home and show it the animal and hold it up on he shoulder and i take the little monkey and put it in the baby wagon and it go to sleep and i put a veil over it and be stand by the wagon talk with a peanut butcher when the parent of the baby come back and the woman raise up the veil to see if the child be asleep when the monkey wake up and put its hairy hand up to rub it eye the monkey look up at the woman with beady eye and begin to chatter and she yell and she husband take a look at the monk

they would not do a thing to the preacher when he come on to do he stunt they idea be to wait until he get well on he sermon and then begin to interrupt he and ask question and finally to get a blanket and toss he up a few time for luck and then chase he out and have the circus bulldog that chew the clown 's pants catch the minister 's coat tail and just scare he plum to death the boy say it would be the biggest picnic that ever be -- a regular barbecue the boss canvasman say he be oppose to mix religion with the circus business because the fellow could get all the religion they need in

how you go to open this jack pot the crowd laugh and the preacher pull he long blue gun up out of he pocket and lay it on the barrel and then pick it up and point it at the big canvasman and say : this game be go to be open with this hand seven of a kind all 45 caliber dum-dum bullet and unless you sit down quick i will send a mess of bullet into you carcass right where you heart ought to be if you open you mouth again before i say ` aman ' real loud at the close of the service i will shoot all you front tooth out do you comprehend if so be seat the big fellow drop on to the blue seat as though he have be hit with a piledriver and the crowd be so tickled to have the bully 's bluff call that they cheer the preacher then he say we will now open this jack pot with singing and i shall

start it and every man sing -lrb- illustration : after scratch he head a minute ike turn and walk toward the preacher -rrb- when it be end the boy clap and stamp for a encore and they sing it through again and the face of the preacher beam with joy and i see there be not go to be any fight and i crawl out from under the seat pa come in the tent just then with a new suit of clothes on have be discharge from the hospital as cure of yellow fever and i give he my seat and he hold I in he lap the preacher then preach a sermon that do they all good he dwell upon the hard life of the showman and give they such good advice that when it be all over and he say he want to shake hand with every man in the bunch ike marshal they all up to the ring and introduce they and no minister ever be more cordially congratulate and they want he to go along with the show and preach every Sunday the preacher say he could not join the show but he travel around a good deal and he would probably be in the same town with the show several time during the summer and he would drop in on they occasionally and keep they straight pa be watch the crowd for the sailor who prescribe cayenne pepper for yellow fever and when he see the sailor come up to the minister with tear in he eye and say : parson i have be a bad man and kill a man once but he be a portuguese sailor and he have the drop on I the same

row start but pa say every man in kentucky carry a blue gun and a bottle of red licker and they wear white hat so the red white and blue business be all right only it be a combination that be death on a circus i think one of the usher at the afternoon performance tell a old colonel that he must move along quicker when the colonel begin to talk back and say who be you talkin ' too sah and the usher stand it as long as he could when he take the colonel by the collar and sit he down so quick he do not come to for a couple of minute and when the colonel get he sens and find that the usher have

people make a rush for the colonel the colonel say man of kentucky to the rescue and before i could crawl under the seat the air be full of baggage seat tent pin and white hat gun be fire and blood flow and the police pull everybody and the evening performance be give up one of the proprietor of the show get a wen on he head as big as a football from be strike by a handle of a revolver and the colonel who start the row be knock silly by a tray of red lemonade which the butcher smash he with and the colonel cry because the lemonade be all water and he be afraid it would soak into he and cause he to warp when the lemonade butcher apologize and the usher tell he it be all a mistake he be seat with the nigger the colonel weep on they neck and invite the whole crowd to go to he distillery and help themselves when we get to the next town every man in the show have a grouch and a katzenjammer and they hair be so sore it be murder and suicide combine to comb it the way pa escape injury be 'cause he have to take the place of the fat woman on the platform with the freak as the fat woman be overcome with the heat and have to stay in the car the way they fix pa up to resemble the fat woman be scandalous they have some rubber thing in the wardrobe tent that you can blow up and make a big arm and a big leg and a big stummick so anybody could not tell the difference and they fix pa up with blow up clothes of flesh color rubber and but for he chin whisker you could not tell he from the fat woman he say he would not cut off he whisker for anybody 's circus so they fix a veil to cover part of he face and put the fat woman 's dress on pa and put he up beside the skeleton the midget and the giant pa say he do not want to do it 'cause it seem too much like fraud but they tell he the fate of the show depend on we all be willing to take any part assign to we and so pa sit down and begin to fan himself and try to look flirty like a woman the other freak never notice but what it be the fat woman until the show be half over it be too much for I and i just laff at pa i get up behind he and tell he in a whisper that i want a dollar to play the slot machine and he tell I to go to thunder and get out of there i could not stand it to be insult by my own father so i take a hat pin out of the hat of the bearded lady and punch it into pa 's blow up rubber shirt and pa begin to sis like a soda fountain and the wind strike the living skeleton and blow he over like a cyclone and by that time pa be blow off wind in a dozen place that i have puncture and he be scare for fear there would not be anything left of he and the giant see the fat woman slowly fading away and the coward have heart failure and lay down on the platform somebody shout that the fat woman be all melting away and a fellow who be water a camel out of a bucket come to the rescue and throw the bucket of dirty water all over pa and then i think i better go away into the tent and see the fight but pa be take to the dress room and rescue from the shrink rubber balloon that be bust and he say he would hunt the man that puncture he tire to he die day but he do not know it be I -lrb- illustration : i punctured pa 's tire -rrb- gee it look to I as though pa have be engage to act as the easy mark in this show say they get pa to practice on roar like a lion so he could stand behind the cage when the lion have a sore throat and roar and scare folk and pa have be go around behind the cage every evening when the menagerie be close and the crowd in the main tent make noise that have make the animal look at each other as much as to say well what do you think of that the rhinoceros be so disgusted at paducah that he reach out he nose and take pa on he horn and hold he up to the scorn of the other animal until pa 's pants give way and he be a sight and he be so scared that he get out of the tent and make a run for we train chase by the police who think he be a burglar that have be eat by a house dog -lrb- illustration : chase by police -rrb- the worst thing we have have on pa be at louisville where we stay over Sunday another fellow and i get a system on slot machine and one day we beat the machine out of a shotbag full of nickel and when we show up at the tent all the fellow want to know how we do it and pa say it be gamble and we ought not to do it but he also want to know how we manage to win and when we tell pa about it pa say it be no sin to beat a slot machine 'cause it be a inanimate thing just a machine and anybody who could beat a nickel in the slot machine at he own game be equal to a rockefeller so after everybody have get excite about we nickel i tell they how to beat the machine i tell they i do not get excite and go rush in where angel fear to tread and feed the slot machine on good hard earn nickel of my own but wait until the countryman and tenderfoot have feed it on nickel until it be too full for utterance when the machine swell out like it be blow up and it kind of wheeze like it be ready to cough up and be only wait for a excuse i put a cough lozenger about the size of a nickel in the slot and turn the diaphram the machine shudder a minute and then have a regular hemorrhage and cough up a tin cupful of nickel into my hand and the machine seem to rest easy and take nourishment again from the silly fellow who think they could beat it well sir the whole crowd be so excited they could hardly wait to find a slot machine and finally they buy nearly all my cough lozenger and go out into the night and pa and i go along 'cause pa say he understand all the slot machine be own by rockefeller and he make more money on they than he do on standard oil and the money that he give away to school and church be from he rake-off on he slot machine pa say it would be a good thing if someone could break up the reprehensible practice by beat the blast machine to a finish so pa he get a bag to bring back the nickel in and a bunch of we go to a store where one whole side of the place be fill with slot machine and the way the people be play the game be scandalous pa watch a machine until the player have feed it so it seem as though it would die unless it get air and he step up and put in a lozenger and turn the wheel and hold the bag under the spout for the coin but it do not come some more fellow put in nickel and the machine give little hacking cough and cough up three or four nickel but nothing that seem at all in the nature of a financial hemorrhage when pa take another lozenger and put it in and by ginger the machine begin to heave up nickel like it be in the trough of the sea pa be so excited he forget to hold the bag and nickel go all over the floor and everybody make a grab for they and pa be shove aside and he swear he would have the place pull and just then a law officer take pa in charge because he have put a cough lozenger in the slot machine and he search pa and find a lot more bronchial trochee and pa be in for it on a charge of malpractice for give cough medicine for the stomach trouble of the slot machine instead of pepsin tablet they take pa in a back room and search he some more and find he roll and then a man who say he be a lawyer offer to help pa and keep he out of the penitentiary he tell pa the law of kentucky make the crime of trifle with a slot machine the same as breach of promise or arson and that he would be lucky if he get off with ten year in the pen with 30 day ' solitary confinement in a turkish bath cell with nigger for companion pa turn blue and ask the lawyer if there be no way out of it and the lawyer tell he that for $ 120 in spot cash he would let he go and fight the case after the show have get out of the state a hundred and twenty-five dollar be the amount they find on pa and he tell they that inasmuch as they already have it they better keep the money and let he go and he would be always a living example of the terror of gamble so they let pa go and all the way to the train he tell we he hope this experience would be a lesson to we not to covet the money of the rich and as far as he be concerned john d rockefeller could go plum to thunder with he money after this then we get to the car and find about a dozen of the circus man who have be out to beat the slot machine break flat and i have to divide my shot bag of nickel with they that i have win before i let they into the game before they would let I go to bed dad say this circus life be make I pretty tough chapter ix the bad boy feed cayenne pepper to the sacred cow -- he and he pa ride in a circus parade with the circassian beauty -- a tipsy elephant land they in a public fountain -- pa make the acquaintance of john l sullivan i be learn more about animal every day and when the season be over i will be a expert animal man animal naturally have a language of they own and lion understand each other and bear can converse with bear but in a show all animal seem to have a common language so they understand each other a little i find that out when i put a paper of cayenne pepper into a head of lettuce and give it to the sacred cow she chew the lettuce as peacefully as could be and swallow the cayenne pepper and then stop to think you could tell by the expression on she face that when the pepper begin to heat she up inside she want to swear although she be a sacred cow she hump herself and shiver and then bellow like a calf who have be leave in the barn to be wean while its mother go out to pasture and the sacred bull she husband he come and put he nose up to she nose as much as to say : what be the matter dearie and she talk sacred cattle talk to he for a minute and then the bull turn to I and chase I out of the tent now as sure as you live that cow tell the bull that i have give she something hot all the animal within hearing be onto I and they would snarl and make noise when i come along and act as though they want to make I understand that they know i give that cow a hot box and they all want to get a chance at I they do not like pa any better than they do I and the big elephant seem to have be lay for pa ever since he run the sharp iron into he the time he get on a tear and try to run a town when the elephant be perform in the ring they all have a eye on pa so everybody notice it i know something would happen to pa so when the man who play the sheik and ride the elephant in the street parade in a howdah with a canopy over it with some female houri in it and they call for a volunteer to do the sheik act at steubenville and pa offer to do the stunt i go along as a egyptian girl 'cause i know there would be something do the elephant eye pa when he get up into the bungalow on top of he with the circassian woman and I and wink at the other elephant as much as to say : watch my smoke as he go out from the lot on the way downtown ahead of the bunch all the other animal act peculiar and seem to say : he will get he before we get through this parade the big elephant be one of the best ring performer but he have always be steady in the street parade with the light of asia on he back we get to the edge of town and stop to let the rear wagon close up and be in front of a saloon where the bartender have be empty stale beer out of the bottom of keg into a washtub which be stand on the sidewalk ready to be sell to people who buy it in pail well sir that confounded elephant get he trunk in that tub of stale beer and he never take it out till the beer be all go i look down from the pagoda and tell pa the elephant be drink again and have drink a washtub of beer but pa could not say anything 'cause he be do the arab sheik act and have to look dignified as though he be pray to allah but just then the band strike up and we start down the main street of steubenville the people begin to cheer 'cause we elephant begin to hippity-hop and waltz sideways across the street and back again and i think pa would die in the parade one man on a horse attend to the elephant so the sheik do not have anything to say and pa remain like a statue and tell I and the circassian beauty to be calm and trust in he and allah this allah business be all right when the elephant waltz but when we get to the next block the beast begin to stand on he hind foot and pa and the houri roll to the back end of the howdah and be all pile in a heap while i hold on to the cloth of gold over the elephant 's head pa yell to the people on horseback to kill the elephant and the crowd cheer think it be the best performance they ever see in a free street parade and the animal in the cage behind be yap as though they know what be go on the elephant get down on all fours and we straighten up in the pagoda and for a block or so the beast only waltz around as we get to some sort of a public square where there be thousand of people the stale beer seem to be get in its work for the elephant look at the people as much as to say : now i will show you something not down on the bill and by ginger if he do not raise up he hind quarter and stand on he front foot right by the side of a big fountain and he reach in he trunk for a drink when all of we on the pagoda cling to pa and we all slide right off into the big basin of water the fountain play on we and pa be under water with the four circassian beauty and when we roll or slide down over the elephant 's head he look at we and seem to chuckle : what you get off here for the show be not half out well the parade go on and leave the elephant and the rest of we at the fountain and to show that animal understand each other and can appreciate a joke every animal that pass we give we the laugh even the hippopotamus which open he mouth as big as a tunnel and show he tooth and act as though he would like to exchange tank with we the circus people that could be spare from the wagon come to help we and the citizen help out the circassian beauty who be pray to allah and wring out they clothes and i crawl up on the neck of a cast-iron swan in the fountain pa yell and talk profane and tell 'em to bring a cannon and kill the elephant which keep duck he with he trunk and swab out the bottom of the fountain basin with pa it seem as though he never would get through use pa for a mop but finally the people get a rope around pa and a keeper get a iron hook in the elephant 's ear and they pull pa out on one side and get the elephant away on the other side and just then the callipoe that end the parade come by we and play the blue danube and the elephant get on he hind foot and waltz on the pavement they put pa and the circassian beauty in a patrol wagon and take they to the show lot and i sit by the driver and he let I drive the team -lrb- illustration : the elephant keep duck pa and swab out the bottom of the fountain -rrb- pa have he sheik clothes roll up around he waist and be wring they out and talk awful sassy and when we get to the lot it take a long time to convince the policeman that we be not guilty of disorderly conduct and just then the elephant come tear by we with the keeper on horseback behind he prod he in the ham every jump with a sharp iron and he go through the side of the tent as though he be mighty sorry he do not kill we all they make he get down on he knee and bellow in token of surrender and then we all go and change we clothes for the afternoon performance as we pass through the menagerie tent drip every animal set up a yell as much as to say : there maybe you will give cayenne pepper to a pious sacred cow again confound you and that convince I that animal be human the last week have be the hardest on pa of any week since we have be out with the circus the trouble with pa be that he want to be johnny on the spot as the boy say and if anything break he volunteer to go to work and fix it and if anybody be sick or disabled he want to take they place as he say so he will learn everything about the circus and be competent to run a show alone next year but it be a mean trick the principal owner of the show play on pa at canton o you see john l sullivan use to do a boxing act with this show year ago and everybody like john and when he show up where the show give a performance he have the freedom of the whole place and everybody about the show be ready to fall over themselves to do john l a service

circus man for help but they just laugh -lrb- illustration : john l slatt pa just as though he be a child -rrb- pa get a chance at the fat man and he hit he in the jaw but it do not hurt sullivan only make he mad he take pa up by the collar and whirl he around until pa be dizzy and then he start with he for the menagerie tent and call to the boss canvasman : bill come on and tell I which be the hungriest lion and i will feed he with this cold meat pa yell 'cause he think he be in the hand of a escape lunatic and the circus hand come and take he away then the owner tell pa who sullivan be and pa almost faint but finally after breathe hard for awhile pa go up to sullivan and shake he hand and say : mr sullivan you must excuse I if i have know you be the great john l i would not have lick you sullivan look at pa and say : well you be a wonder old man and you do do I up and pa and sullivan become great friend since then pa be pretty chesty 'cause the circus man point he out to the jay

to do they know he could drive four horse because he say he be a old stage driver and when he get in the chariot with the roman suit on gleam with gold and the brass helmet and the cloth of gold gauntlet and stand up like a senator gee i be proud of he and when he and the female drive out of the dressing-room and halt by the door for the announcer to announce the great ben hur chariot race i get into the chariot behind pa and tell he he must win the race or the people of scranton would mob he for they know these race be usually fix beforehand but since he be to drive one of the team all he friend be bet on he and if he pull the team and let that livery stable lady win the race they would accuse he of give free ticket to get they in the show and skin they out of they money pa say to I : this race be go to be on the square and you watch my smoke do you think i would let that red-headed dish washer beat I not on you life the play be to have a little boy kiss the male driver good-by and a little girl kiss the female driver good-by as though they be take they life in they hand i have climb up to pa and put my arm around he neck and kiss he and a girl kiss the female when the gong sound and both four-horse team make a jump before i could get out of the chariot so i get right in front of pa and peek over the dashboard of the chariot and gee but do not we fairly whizz by the pole and the audience look like a panorama pa get the pole and keep it and we go around three time and find the female chariot ahead of we cause pa have go around twice to she once she turn out a little right by the band-stand and pa run he team right inside she chariot and catch she wheel and when he yell to he team she cart team and all be throw right into the band which scatter over the back of the seat the horse be all mix up with the instrument and the female driver be throw into the air and come down in a sit position right into the bass drum she go right through the sheepskin so she head and hand and foot be all of she that remain outside the drum -lrb- illustration : she cart team and all be throw right against the band -rrb- she yell for help and the circus hand roll the drum with she in it into the dressing-room where they have to cut the side of the drum with a ax to get she out while other catch she horse and pull the chariot out of the band and the music stop but pa go on forever he go around six time yell like a indian at a green corn dance and when he think it be time to let up because he have miss the other chariot he pull so hard he break the line on the two inside horse and then it be a runaway for sure and the audience stand up on the seat and yell and woman faint finally the circus hand grab some hurdle and throw they across the track near the main entrance and when we come around the last time two of the horse jump the hurdle all right but two fumble and fall down and there be a crash and i do not know anything until i feel cold water on my face that taste sour and color my shirt red and i find the lemonade butcher be bring I to by pour a tray of lemonade over I when my eye open i see a sight that i shall never forget it seem that when the horse fall down the chariot and the other two horse and pa and i have land all in a heap right on top of the lemonade and peanut concession and carry it up onto a row of seat near the main entrance from the menagerie the elephant that be to come on next be in the door wait for they signal and they be scare at the crash and they come in bellow the keeper have lose all control of they the audience be stampede and the circus man be try to straighten thing out pa strike on he head against a wagon wheel and he brass helmet be drive down over he face so when he yell to be pull out of the helmet he voice sound like a coon song come from a phonograph it be the closest call from death pa ever have 'cause they have to cut the helmet with a can opener to let pa out like you open a can of lobster when they get the helmet open so pa could come out he look just like a boil lobster and when the chief owner of the circus come up on a run and ask if pa be dead pa say : not much mary ann do i win and the manager say it be a pity they ever open that helmet and let pa out the man tell pa he win in a walk but the chief of police of scranton be go to arrest pa for exceed the speed limit -lrb- illustration : pa strike on he head against a wagon wheel -rrb- they take pa to the dressing-room on a piece of board and when the woman driver see he she get a ax and want to cleave he from head to foot but the bearded woman step in front of she and say : not on you life and she shield pa from death with she manly form which pa say he shall never forget pa 's old friend in scranton give he a banquet that night but pa could not eat anything cause the rim of the brass helmet cut a gash in he adam 's apple after the chariot race the manager conclude they would not let pa have any position of importance again very soon and i make up my mind you would not ever catch I in any game that pa be in but in the circus business you can never tell what be go to happen from one day to another on the train on the way to wilke barre there be a hot box on one of the sleeper and the car be side-track all night when we arrive at the town about 40 wagon driver that be in the car do not show up and they have to press everybody that could drive a team into the service to haul the stuff to the lot and pa drive four horse so well with a load of tent pole that the manager compliment pa and that give pa the big head when the parade be all ready to start through town and the driver have not arrive the manager ask pa if he think he could drive the ten gray horse on the band wagon to lead the procession and pa say drive ten horse be he best hold and he get up on the driver 's seat and call I to get up with he and i hate a boy that will disobey a parent so i climb up and begin to jolly the band about the chariot race and i tell they pa would not do a thing to they this time the manager of the show always ride ahead of the parade with the chief of police of the town and the band horse follow he so it be easy enough to drive ten horse cause all you have to do it to hold on to the 20 line and look savage at the crowd on the sidewalk and the horse go right along and the people think the driver be a wonder so when the manager start in he buggy pa pull up on all the line he could hold on to which fill he lap and make he look like a harness maker and he yell : ye-up and the procession move and the ten team pa be drive go along all right and pa look as though he own the show and the town we get downtown to a wide street and there be a fire alarm ahead or something and the procession stop and the manager and chief of police disappear and there be a wagon load of green corn stalk right beside the lead team which a farmer be take to a silo but he have stop he team to see the parade the three team of pa 's leader six horse begin to eat the corn stalk and the camel that be behind we work along up by the band wagon and begin to eat and the farmer get scare to see he corn stalk disappear so he drive off on a side street and start for the silo and by ginger pa 's team turn onto the side street and follow the wagon of corn stalk and pa could not hold they and the band play in the good old summer time there will be a hot time in the old town the camel keep up with the farmer 's wagon too and the whole parade follow the band the farmer start he horse into a run and the team of ten horse that be drive pa start to gallop and i look back and the elephant be begin to gallop and all the cage be come whooping and it be a picnic the band stop play and the player be scare and as we be cross a little bridge over a small stream on the edge of town i turn around to the band and tell they to jump for they life and they all make a jump for the stream and the air be full of uniform and instrument and they land in the stream all right we go on up a hill and be in the country and the farmer turn into a farmyard and the band wagon follow and the farmer jump off the corn stalk wagon and rush for the house and pa 's ten-horse team surround the wagon and every horse be eat corn stalk and the team be all mix up the camel and the elephant crowd in for the nice green lunch and the farmer 's wife come out with she apron wave and say shoo but none of the animal shoo worth a cent and pa pull on the line and yell while the rest of the parade come into the farm and line up the driver yell at pa to know where in thunder he be go and pa say : damfino just then the manager and chief of police come up and the way they talk to pa be awful pa could not explain how it be that he take the parade out in the country and you never see such a time by this time the regular driver have arrive on a special from where we leave they with a hot box and they take possession of the team and we get back to the circus lot in time for the afternoon performance i do not know what they be do to pa but they have he in the manager 's tent all the afternoon with some doctor who seem to be examine he for insanity everybody about the show think pa have hoodoo the aggregation but pa say such thing be always happen and it be wrong to blame he the farmer get pay for he corn stalk and it be to be charge up to pa chapter xi the bad boy and he pa in a railroad wreck -- pa rescue the other freak -- they spend the night on a meadow -- a near-sighted claim agent settle for damages -- pa play deaf and dumb and get ten thousand it have come at last everybody about the show expect that the show have get to have a railroad wreck every season and all hand lay awake night on the car to brace themselves for the shock sometimes it come early in the season and again a show go along until almost the end of the season without a shake-up and fellow think maybe there be not go to be any wreck but the engineer be only wait till everybody have forget about it and then biff bang and they have run into another train or be run into and you have to be pull out of a window by the heel and lay out in a marsh until the claim agent can settle with you i always think in reading of railroad accident that the railroad send out a special trainload of doctor and nurse to care for the injured but the special train never have a doctor until the lawyer give first aid to the wound in the way of financial poultice for the cripple people in we business be on the railroad and we work they for all there be in it and the man that be hurt the least make the biggest howl and get the biggest slice of indemnity some circus people spend all they salary as they go along and live all winter on the damages they get from the railroad when the wreck come the night of the wreck we train be whoop along at about 90 mile a hour on a hippity-hop railroad in pennsylvanium and the night be hot and the mosquito from across the line in new jersey be sing they solemn tune and pa who attend a lodge meeting that night at the town we show in be asleep and talk in he sleep about password and grip and the freak and trapeze performer in we car have get through kick about how the show be run into the ground when suddenly there be a terrific smash-up ahead a engine boiler explode a freight car of dynamite on a side track explode and there be a grind and bump of car then they roll down a bank over and over so the upper berth be the lower berth half the time and finally the whole business stop in a hay marsh and the bilge water in the marsh leak into the hold of we car people scream and some one yell fire and i pull on pa till he wake up i think pa 's head be all cave in because he talk nutty the first thing he say be : say i pronounce you name and repeat after I and then he say : i promise and swear that i will never reveal the secret of this degree and then the conductor pull pa 's leg and say : crawl out of the window old man 'cause the train be in the ditch the car be afire and if you do not get out in about a minute with the other freak you will be a burnt offering pa say you could not fool he 'cause he know he be be initiate into the 20-steenth degree of the mason and he guess he could tell a degree from a train wreck 'cause the degree be a darn sight worse than a wreck but the conductor take one of those long glass fire extinguisher and sprinkle the medicated water on the freak in the next berth and then turn it on pa and pa taste it and think he be at a banquet and he say that sauterne be not fit to drink then when the bearded woman yell that the fire have almost reach she whisker and would nobody save she pa begin to get ready to move on 'cause he conclude he have not be ride a goat after all and he tell I to hand he he pants pa be a man that will never go out among people no matter how dark the night be without he pants and i admire he for it some of the circus man do not care for dress that night but get out just as they be and the result be that when daylight come they have to tie hay around they leg we car be bottom-side up but i find pa 's pants and he get he leg in and i button he in but i feel all the time as though i have button they in the back so the seat be in front but the fire be crackle and pa push I out of a transom and then he crawl out and we sit down in the mud the bearded woman come next with she whisker do up in curl papers and then the fat woman get one foot through the transom and she could not get it back in and the train hand get a ax and be go to cut she leg off and save one foot at least when pa get a move on he and take the ax and break out the side of the car and get she out eight or nine man lift she tenderly onto a stack of hay and she wrap it around she 'cause she leave she clothes in she berth -lrb- illustration : pa get a ax and cut the fat woman out -rrb- well it be a sight when the people be get out of we car and they let it burn to light up the scene and pa and i and the boss canvasman go along the ditched train and help people out the giant be in two upper berth and he get one leg out of the transom over one berth and one leg out of the transom over the other berth and we pull he leg but he could not make it so pa take a ax and make both berth into one and get he out the giant shake himself and start on a run across the marsh but he mire up to he neck and a farmer who hear the noise come to order we off he hay field for trespass and yell : here be a head of some of you performer cut off away over here and he be go to bring it in when the farmer find the head be alive and he run away from it in a hour we have everybody out and make bed for they by spread out hay cock and nobody seem to be hurt so very much we hear a locomotive whistle up the road and some one say the relief train be come with doctor and nurse but the show owner who be with we say : relief doctor nothing that be a train-load of lawyer and claim agent to settle with we the doctor will not come till to-morrow now everybody pretend to be hurt awful bad and strike the shark for $ 10000 apiece and come down to $ 100 if you can not do any better it be get daylight and the relief train stop and the good samaritan come wade into the hay marsh bent on settle with we cheap the first lawyer ask the principal owner how many be kill 'cause they could figure exactly how much they have to pay for a dead one but the live one be the one that make trouble for a railroad 'cause they can kick and argue the boss say nobody be dead but the giant who be mire in out of sight the giant hear what be say and he yell that he be alive and would not settle for less than $ 20000 but the claim agent say the giant would be dead in 15 minute in that quicksand so he would let he sink and pay for he as a dead one the giant say if they would pull he out of the mud he would settle for $ 100 and they pull he out and the rest of the injure be go to mob he for settle so cheap one of the claim agent find the bearded woman sit on a hay cock comb out she whisker and ask what it would take to settle and she say $ 10000 and she get up and walk over to another hay cock where the circassian beauty be dry she hair and the claim agent look at how spry the bearded woman walk and he say to the boss : i will not give that fellow with the curly whisker a single kopeck and the bearded woman come back and swat the claim agent for call she a fellow so they compromise on $ 200 and she go behind the haystack and put it in she stock which convince the claim agent that she be not a man a near-sighted claim agent come to the haystack where the fat woman be and the boss tell she now be she time to have a mess of hysteric so she set up a cry that scare the agent who think there be at least six woman on the haystack and he say : what will all of you people up there on the haystack settle for in a lump for i be in a hurry the fat woman catch on at once and say : we will all settle for $ 10000 then she yell and the agent think she back be break and he offer $ 7500 and she cry and say : make it $ 10000 and the agent say : i will go you and he make out a check and the fat woman have some more hysteric i have watch the settle all around and i tell pa to be deaf and dumb when they come to he and just point to the seat of he pants in front and button up behind and look as though he be suffer the torture of the inquisition and let I do the talking and i would make the old railroad go into a receiver 's hand so pa say : you be the boss and he look so pitiful that i almost cry when the near-sighted claim agent come to pa i tell he that pa 's last word be to beg to be shoot and the man look at pa 's pants and then at he face and say : what hit he that be the worst case i ever see in a railroad wreck -lrb- illustration : what hit he that be the worst case i ever saw -rrb- i put my handkerchief to my eye and say : well when the shock come pa be all right as handsome a man as you would often see i think there must have be a pile driver on the train that strike he and change side with he knock he stomach around on the back side of he and place he spinal column around in front of he where he stomach be and cause he to lose the sense of speech think of a middle-aged man go through life mix up in that manner have to sit down on he stomach and have he backbone stare he in the face how do he know when he take food in he mouth that it can corkscrew around under he arm and eventually find he stomach how a man can be ground and twist and maul and stamp on by a reckless locomotive with a crazy engineer and a drunken fireman roll over by box car and walk on by elephant and still live be beyond I as he tell I before he lose the power of speech not to be too hard on the railroad company though some railroad would be glad to pay he $ 20000 and no question ask he beg I as heir to he estate to let you off for a paltry $ 10000 pa make up the darndest face and groan the agent call another agent and they whisper together and finally the first one come to I and ask pa 's full name and then the two of they get out a fountain pen and they make out a check and he say : this be the first case in the history of railroad wreck that the agent have not have the heart to try to beat the injured party down this be certainly the most pitiful case that have ever be know and if you father ever come to he sens you can tell he he be welcome to the money the agent shake hand with pa and i and go away to they train and pa wink at I and a wreck train come and we get on a special and get to pittsburg before breakfast and pa be go to buy I a dog out of the money gee but there be all kind of money in the circus business pa be go to wear he pants hind side before until we get out of pittsburg chapter xii the bad boy cause trouble between the russian cossack and the jap juggler -- a jap tight-rope walker jiu-jitsu 's pa -- the animal go on a strike -- pa run the menagerie for a day and win they gratitude i do not mean any harm when i tell the japanese juggler that they ought to kick against have those russian cavalryman in the show the fellow who ride horse stand up in the wild-west department 'cause i have listen to they russian talk and it seem to I they be spy who be look for a chance to do injury to the poor little jap i could see that i make the jap mad the first thing and then i tell they that pa and all the manager of the show feel sorry for the little jap 'cause some day the big russian would ride right over they and kill they right in the ring i say that everybody think the jap ought to resign from the show for fear of a clash with the russian or else they ought to have some grown person to act as chaperone you ought to have see the look of scorn on the face of the jap juggler when the interpreter tell they that the circus people be afraid the russian would hurt they they jabber awhile and then the interpreter tell I that the ten little jap could whip the 20 russian in four minute probably it be none of my business and i never ought to have repeat it but in a circus everybody want to know everything that be go on so when the big leader of the russian ask I what those brown monkey be talk about i tell he : nothing particular only they say the ten of they could lick you 20 russian in four minute gee do not that russian talk kopec and damskus and froth at the mouth then he call he russian together and the talk sound as though a soda fountain have burst then they all yell : killovitch the monkey-ouskis -lrb- illustration : gee but do not that russian talk kopec and damskus -rrb- i go and tell pa there be go to be a riot between the jap juggler and the russian horseman and probably the fight would take place when the jap come out of the ring at the afternoon performance and the russian go in right near the dressing-room i ask pa not to mix in it but keep away in the animal tent pa say not much he would not be away and he tell all the manager and they all get around the dressing-room to stop the muss if one start well to show how the jap be organize as soon as they feel there be go to be a row they keep they eye on the russian all the time they be in the ring do they pole balancing and the little jap up on the bamboo pole with a fan keep jabber to the fellow down on the ground and i could see that trouble be come when they act be over the jap bow to the audience and start out where the russian be line up to come ride in the big russian say : look at the little monkey but he have not get the word out of he mouth before the jap turn and every man grab the tail of every other horse and jump up behind the russian and each of the ten jap take a russian by the neck with a jiu jitsu strangle hold and reach out he leg and wound it around the russian on the next horse and in ten seconds they have unhorse the 20 russian the whole 30 man be on the ground rolling in the sawdust the jap roll over and under the russian twist they leg and arm in a unknown manner and make they yell for help like a mastiff that have trifle in a overbearing manner with a little bulldog until the bulldog get mad and begin the chewing act on the mastiff 's fore leg it be the worst mix-up ever be and the manager tell pa to put a stop to it and pa pull off he coat and grab the first jap he could dig out and begin to pull he like you would take hold of the leg of a dog in a fight pa say : here quit this foolishness 'cause there be a armistice and the war be over anyway o o but the jap do not do a thing to pa he grab pa by the wrist and he seem to be have a epileptic fit and pa 's leg shoot out so he foot hit a guy pole and then the jap pull he back like he be a rubber ball on a string and then he take pa by the elbow and hold he out at arm 's length and then swing he around a few time and let go of he and he fall down among the reserved seat which representative of the press occupy pa stand on one ear on a crushed chair with he leg over the railing and when he come to the newspaper man want to interview pa pa say all he remember be that the air ship be sail over the town and they throw he out for ballast and he strike a church spire and bound onto a warehouse fill with dynamite which explode when he strike it and the neighbor pick he remain up on a dustpan and empty they in here then he ask if he head be on straight and the circusman take he away to the hospital tent -lrb- illustration : o but the jap do not do a thing to pa -rrb- the circus hand separate the russian and jap or at least pull off the jap and the russian limp to the dressing-room and they act be cut out unless the term of peace between japan and russium include the belligerent in we show there will be row every day pa come to the car on crutch that night just before the train pull out for philadelphium and want to know where i be during the fight he say he rush right in and grab a jap in one hand and a russian in the other and bump they head together and throw one of they towards the ring and the other up among the seat and he want to know if i think he kill either or both of they i hate a boy that will deceive he father but i tell he there be talk about two performer one a russian and the other a jap that be leave at the morgue but i do not know anything sure about it and pa say : i be afraid i should hurt they but they bring it on themselves by break the rule of the show against fight during a performance and pa roll over and groan in he berth and go to sleep and snore so the freak want to have a nose bag such as horse eat out of pull over pa 's face the queerest thing that ever happen in the circus business in this country take place at germantown pa the teamster go on a strike at pittsburg for increase in wages and shorter hour and for two day the management have a great time we have to get dray to haul the stuff from the train to the lot and then we teamster get the local drayman to join they and when we get ready to haul the stuff back to the train nobody would do any work and the walk delegate from the teamster ' union just take possession of the show and we be stick like a automobile when the gasoline give out we have get to look at the teamster as of no particular account when they walk out but when they would not work they become the most important part of the show and after the show be over the manager who have tell the striking teamster to go plumb find that they have go plumb and they have to rush all over pittsburg and find they and grant they demand and get they to go to work pa be send out to find a bunch of they and it cost pa over $ 30 to get they out of a beer garden and back to the lot and it be almost daylight before we get we train start for the next town well at the next town we could see there be something the matter with the animal they act as though they have lose all interest in the success of the show and would not do any of they stunt worth a cent the elephant go through they act carelessly and when they be scold or prod with the iron hook they get mad and want to fight and when they get back from the ring to the animal tent they would not eat the bale hay but throw it all over the tent and act riotous the kangaroo would not do they boxing act the horse kick at they hay and would not eat they oats the camel growl at they food and scare the people who pass by where they be tie to stake the sacred cattle get they back up and act as though they be pious could not swear but would like to hire the hyena to swear for they the giraffe lay down and curl they neck so they be no attraction to the show 'cause a giraffe be no curiosity unless he stretch himself away up towards the top of the tent the zebra roll in the mud and spoil they stripe so people could not tell they from common mule the grizzly bear walk he cage and keep give vent to bear language and the big lion be howl all the time the show be a failure at that town and when we load the train the manager hold a meeting in we car to decide what in thunder be the matter with the animal all kind of theory be advance such as poison malaria from indiana and pure cussedness after they have discuss the matter awhile pa come in and they ask he what he think about it and that tickled pa 'cause as foolish as he look he help the show out of lot of bad hole pa light a cigar and put it in one side of he mouth put he hat up on one side of he head like he be tough and look wise and say : fellow fakir i have be watch the animal all day and while i do not say they understand enough of the way of human being to be post on labor union and all that i want to tell you they be on a strike and that grizzly and that lion be the walk delegate that be stir they up to mischief they may not know anything about the teamster ' strike but they know something have happen and they be displeased at something and they have lose respect for the employer they be on a strike and the very devil be go to pay to-morrow unless the cause of the dissatisfaction be discover mutual concession make and arbitration resort to gentleman you hear I say pa and he sit down on the edge of the arm of the car seat they give pa the laugh but finally tell he to take charge of the strike and settle it quick but they want to know what he think animal would be dissatisfied about as long as they get food enough to eat pa say : i 'll tell you you feed the horse and other hay-eating animal on musty bale hay buy from contractor that may have have it on hand for five year how would you like it if you be serve with breakfast food that have be store in a warehouse until it be mildew a horse or a elephant have feeling give they bale hay and when they be try to pick out a mouthful that be not spoil you drive along with a load of nice new-mown timothy or alfalfa and see they make a rush for that load of hay the way my ten-horse team do the other day for that load of cornstalk then the sacred cattle be hot under the collar because of the fellow who use profanity can you imagine a sacred cow try to be good and set a pious example to the heathen animal be patient when they have to listen to swearing you buy meat that be taint for the lion who like fresh meat and the jackal that only love bad meat get the only sirloin in the lot let I run the menagerie to-morrow and i will have mr lion the walk delegate declare this strike off well they tell pa to arbitrate the strike and the next day he have a couple of load of timothy hay such as mother use to make drive in and unloaded and the horse elephant camel and thing almost set up a cheer for pa the meat-eating animal be give a picnic of the freshest beef with a little so decayed that it be only fit to be bury for the hyena and jackal and every animal be happy they do they turn better than ever and the sacred cattle almost act devilish now the animal have declare the strike off and they want to lick pa 's hand the owner of the show appreciate genius and they have raise pa 's salary and give he full charge of the menagerie chapter xiii the circus strike the quaker city -- they go on a ginger ale jag -- pa break up a indian war dance and come near be burn alive -- the world 's fair cannibal have a roast dog feast ever since we know the show be bill for philadelphium for a Saturday and that we should have to stay over Sunday in that town there have be symptom of a revolt everybody connect with the show have a horror of be find dead in philadelphium they claim it be too dead for live people and not very satisfactory to dead people a performer who be with the show last year say that nobody but the newspaper people who have free ticket attend the performance and some of they would not go in the tent unless the press agent promise to set up a free lunch with devilish ginger ale to drink and that the press people get riotous on ginger ale a ginger ale jag be terrible when a man be full of ginger ale he intestine loop the loop and tie up in knot and gripe like cholera infantum and unless he friend hold he he go out into the world and want to kill the woman and child and non-combatant last year we press agent fill up the member of the local press with ginger ale and when we strike philadelphium this time the newspaper have swear out warrant for we show on the charge of compound a felony which i suppose be the legal name for ginger ale the way the quaker patronize a show be to put on they gray clothes and they big white hat and stand on the corner when the parade go by and never crack a smile or act interested and when the parade have pass they go to the circus lot and see the balloon ascension and stand on wagon wheel and try to look over the side of the tent at the performance and then they kick because the audience on the back seat cut off they view from the wagon wheel last year we show kill a quaker and the community be down on we the quaker get in the show because he own a half inch of ground that its tent be on and he stand right by the ring and when the champion female rider be suspend in the air between two bareback horse he lean over too far inside the ring and she kick he hat clear up to the roof of the tent and a female trapeze performer up there catch it and sit down on it on the trapeze the old quaker have heart disease and fall dead what the quaker complain of be that after the quaker 's remains have be remove from the ring that the show go right on they claim that we ought to have show proper respect for the dead by close the show for 30 day and wear crape on we arm but a circus be not build that way ordinarily it may be quiet enough in philadelphium on Sunday but pa find that he have more of a run for he money than at any place we have be so far we have have a tribe of indian with we wild west department all summer and pa have not stand very well with the indian since he be in charge of the show at fort wayne and they all get drunk and he have they tie up to the pole around the ring until they get sober they have lay for pa ever since and it be only a matter of time when they get he then at pittsburg we manager pick up a company of cannibal that have get left over from the st loui fair and who agree to perform for they board and clothes and as they do not wear any clothes to speak of and only eat dog week day and hope to get a human be to roast on Sunday it seem a pretty good bargain well the indian get permission to hold a green corn dance in a piece of wood near the circus lot and the management get they a wagon load of corn and they have build a fire and be roast the corn and dancing and pa do not know about it and just after dark the quaker who own the wood complain to pa who be on watch Sunday night that he indian have get off the reservation and be prepare to go on the warpath and he want they to get off he premise pa say he would go right over and drive they back to the tent i try to get pa to let the police go and drive they off but he say he have not no time to go and wake up the police and they would not get around anyway before the middle of the week so pa take a tent stake and start for the green corn roast the indian be take turn dance and eat roasted corn and they have a barrel of beer and i know enough about indian to keep away from they when they mix beer with green corn for it have about the same effect as commit suicide with carbolic acid pa put he hat on one side of he head and go right into the midst of the indian and grab a chief call one ear at a time and hit he with the tent stake and knock he down and say now you git well sir that indian have no more than strike the fire in a sit position and fill the air with the odor of fry buckskin before the whole tribe jump on pa and they kick he with they moccasin and be go to murder he while the chief who act as the burnt offering get out of the fire and sit down in the cold mud to cool himself he hold up he hand as a signal of attention and he call a council of war while the squaw sit on pa to hold he down the council of war sentence pa to be burn at the stake and they tie he to a tree and begin to pile stick around he and pa tell I to go to the circus lot and give a alarm and send the hand to rescue he gee but do not i run though and yell a alarm big enough for a massacre i tell the hand who be sleep under the seat or play card on the trunk that the indian be burn pa at the stake and some of the hand say that would serve he right and the fellow that be play card say they do not want to break up the game when they be loser to rescue no baldheaded curmudgeon i think pa be a goner sure 'cause i could hear the indian yell and i think i could smell flesh burning oh but i be scare for fear they would burn pa alive -lrb- illustration : the indian tie pa to a tree and begin to pile stick around he -rrb- just then the man who have charge of we cannibal who each have a dog that they be look for a place to roast come along and i tell he about the indian ' corn roast and he order the cannibal to go drive the indian away from they fire and roast they dog well it work like a charm and the cannibal make a rush for the indian and drive they away just as they have light the fire around pa and we be not a minute too soon after the indian have skedaddle for the wood and we cut the cord that bind pa the cannibal go to work and skun the dog and begin to cook they and pa look on until it make he squirmish but he be so tickled at be save from the indian that he try to be a good fellow with the cannibal i guess it would have be all right only the cannibal get to drink the philadelphium beer and then it be all off cause roast dog be not good enough for they and they want to roast pa first they offer pa dog to eat but he have swear off on dog and pass on it and that make the cannibal mad and they get ready to roast pa and i guess they would have eat he half cook if it have not be for the performer and freak who have miss they pet dog and the circus hand tell they the cannibal have just go to the wood with a mess of dog to roast for a dog feast well they be just get a fire around pa and he be give the grand hail sign of distress when the performer head by the fat woman whose peel mexican dog be lose in the shuffle come in amongst the cannibal and pa and the other dog be rescue in the darnedest fight i ever see the performer just walk right over the cannibal and maul they with stake and all the dog that have not be kill be pull away from the heathen and save the fat woman get she dog all right and when pa come up from the stake where they be go to burn he and congratulate she on recover she dog she turn on pa and accuse he of be the lead cannibal and that he be the one who put up the whole job to steal the dog she jab he with a parasol but pa be innocent -lrb- illustration : the fat woman jab pa with she parasol -rrb- the indian get back to the tent along towards morning and the cannibal go back with we and we have to feed they on wiener which be the nearest to roast dog we could get for they at that time of night pa seem to get it in the neck in this show 'cause everything that go wrong be lay to he and if anything go right somebody else get the credit and i think he would resign if it be not for he pride after the trouble about the indian and the cannibal the manager call pa up and reprimand he for indulge the tribe in they wild orgy and say he could not maintain discipline as long as pa mix up with they and encourage they in such thing pa try to explain that he be the victim instead of be the cause of the dog roast but the manager dismiss pa by tell he not to let it occur again then to show the inconsistency of the manager he order pa to go on ahead of the show to new york and advertise that the cannibal in we show would give a exhibition of roast and eat a human being and to offer a reward for anybody that would consent to be roasted and eat in public pa have go to new york to look for somebody who will take the position of meat for the cannibal and he be instruct to spare no expense to find such a man he think he may find somebody connect with the life insurance scandal who have lose all desire to live any longer and who will gladly go into this mutual scheme i do not know this circus business be too much for I 'cause i be lose friend all the time even the monkey have get so they seem to be ashamed to be see talk to I and when i pass the monkey cage they turn they back on I as though i do not belong to they set when a fellow get so low that monkey feel above he and throw out sarcastic remark when he go by it be time to change you luck some way chapter xiv a newport monk be add to the show -- the boy teach he some manly trick -- the tent blow down and a panic follow -- pa manage the animal act which end in a novel manner we have add to the show the most remarkable animal that ever be -- a baboon that dress like a man and eat at a table use a knife and fork and a napkin this baboon have be play a engagement with the four hundred at newport dining with the crown head at that resort but the confound baboon get to be too human and he fall in love with a heiress and scare one of the willie boy that be also in love with she he friend be afraid that the baboon would cut willie out entirely or get jealous and injure willie so the manager of the four hundred show decide to banish the baboon and we show send pa to newport to buy the baboon and bring he to we show at new york we have the darndest time get he away from newport pa could not do any with he but he take to I 'cause he think i be he long-lost brother and i could do anything with he we get he in we stateroom on the boat and take he clothes away from he 'cause he only wear he clothes when he be be dine and wine and we chained he in the upper berth he just raise the very deuce on the way down to new york after pa and i get to sleep that baboon get my clothes and put they on slip the chain over he head jump through the transom and go into every berth where the transom be open and chat with the people who occupy the berth there be a old man and woman from new hampshire in one berth and when the monk get in they berth and begin to talk the newport language the old man think it be I and he say : now bub you go away to you pa the monk go out and get into another berth and crawl under the bunk and when the woman come in to go to bed she look under it to see if any man be there when she see we baboon she yell fire and the officer of the boat pull he out by the hind leg and tear my pant leg off pa and i have to sit up the rest of the night with he and when we land he with the show at madison square garden we feel relieved -lrb- illustration : when she see the baboon she yell fire -rrb- one woman on the boat have follow we ever since to collect damages from pa 'cause he oldest son the monk propose to she gee it seem to I a woman ought to know the difference between a baboon and a man but some woman will marry anything that wear clothes the monk take to I so pa say i must teach he everything i could that man do so i think it would do no harm to teach he to chew tobacco 'cause he could already smoke cigarette so i borrow a chew from the boss canvasman a great big chew of black plug tobacco and the monk grab it and chew it awhile just before the afternoon performance and swallow it i know that settle the monk and when the audience come along by he cage and pa be try to get he to perform as he do at newport eating dinner like a man the monk turn pale and he stomach ache and he stand on he head and hold he stomach in both hand and kick the table over then he hit pa a swat with he foot and wind he tail around pa 's neck and lay he head on pa 's shirt bosom and be seasick pa say : well this beat everything what do you do to he i tell pa i have only be teach the monk manly trick and pa say : well you have overdo it and then the humane society have pa arrest for cruelty to animal but the monk get over it and now he try to be a masher and wink at woman and flirt with they just as the man do at newport \* \* \* \* \* we think we be smart when we hold up the railroad for damages back in pennsylvanium after the wreck but we be get a dose of we own medicine at poughkeepsie there come up a wind and rainstorm that blow the tent down right in the midst of the evening performance and scared everybody half to death several people be hit by tent pole and hurt some and it be the wildest scene i ever see and people who get out alive run away in the dark and somebody say the animal have all get loose and some of the people never stop run till daylight the next morning some run into the river and the ambulance carry the injure to hospital pa stampede with the elephant and never show up till noon the next day by that time at least 1000 people have file claim for damages and all the lawyer from albany to new york be on we trail the manager appoint pa to settle with the injured and the way he argue with those people be a caution one old woman be kill and pa try to show she relative that as she be old and helpless and more or less a burden to the family they ought to pay the show something for get she off they hand one tramp have he foot cut off and pa try to show he how much he would save in shoe the rest of he life and that he be in big luck we leave pa at poughkeepsie to settle the case and go on to new york and we hear the people have lynch he but he show up in a couple of day with money left now all the lawyer in new york be after we with claim and they have attach most everything and the show be up against it what a difference it make who want damages when we be work the railroad for damages it be a cinch and like get money from home but now that the people be work we for damages for be smash up under we tent we look upon it as a crime and tell they it be a act of providence and that the show be not to blame for a windstorm but the lawyer can not be very pious for they will not believe in the act of providence racket and we shall have to cough up all the profit of the season since we get settle in new york for a two week ' stand in madison square garden we be have the tent repair and do not have to put up and take down tent and ride all night on train we be all stop at hotel and get rest and pa be have a chance to shine the manager think pa be try to commit suicide for he want to take the place of anybody who be sick or drunk and be the understudy of everybody we get one act that just curdle you blood a cage in the ring with lion and tiger and leopard who go through all kind of stunt one lion ride a horse and jump through hoop and land on the back of the horse and jump on a staging and let the horse go around the ring and then jump on again the horse be blindfold so he do not know it be a lion that jump on he back but think it be a man the tiger ride bicycle and the leopard jump about wherever the trainer tell they to a monkey act as clown and a little elephant run a make-believe automobile that act alone be worth the price of admission well the regular trainer go to coney island and get drunk and we either have to cut out that performance or give back the money and the manager be wail about it 'cause nothing make a circus man wail like give back good money then pa say he would save the day by take charge of the animal act he say he have watch it every day and know how to do it and he could dress up in the clothes of the regular trainer and the animal would not know the difference gee but i be scare to have pa try to run that animal show and i think everyone in the show believe it would be pa 's finish i feel like a orphan when pa come out of the dressing-room with the trainer 's clothes on though pa 's stomach be so big you would think a blindfold horse would know pa be no trainer well pa go in the round cage make of bar iron and motion to the attendant to send the animal into the cage through the chute from the animal quarter the first to come be two tiger that be to ride velocipede i tremble for pa when they go in and wave they tail and look at pa as much as to say : o we will not do a thing to you they actually look at each other and wink but pa motion to the velocipede and look fierce and when they hesitate about get on pa say : you will not will not you and he take a club fill with lead and start for the biggest tiger he hesitate a moment and then he jump on the machine and the other follow and they race around and then pa make they get off and jump hurdle finally he motion to a shelf for they to jump up onto and when they hesitate he kick one in the slat and hit the other with the club and they go up on that shelf too quick but they stay there and snarl at pa and i be afraid they would jump on he when he back be turn then they bring in the blind horse and the lion and the lion be onto pa and he strike right off he get up on the pedestal from which he be to jump onto the horse 's back but when the horse come around the lion would not jump and pa say : i 'll give you one more chance and the horse go under the lion and he would not jump so pa stop the horse and take a iron bar and knock the lion off onto the floor and he growl at pa but pa keep maul he and finally the lion jump up on the pedestal and seem to say : bring on you horse and pa start the horse and mr lion make he jump all right and the audience cheer pa -lrb- illustration : pa keep maul the lion -rrb- all the animal go through they stunt all right but i think i could see they be lay for pa and i wish he be out of the cage the wind-up come when the lion be seat on bench and the elephant be between they and the tiger and leopard make a pyramid and the monkey be claw around pa 's leg the signal be about to be give for the animal to return through the chute when the monkey tackle pa 's leg like a football player the elephant push pa over and the lion paw he and snarl and the tiger take a mouthful out of pa 's pants and the leopard snatch he red coat off and the signal be give for they to get out of the cage and they go out like boy at recess leave pa in the cage with the blind horse with not clothes enough leave on he to wad a gun he be not even scratch however the animal have just combine to humiliate pa the audience cheer pa say well would not that skin you they throw he a overcoat to put on and he bow like a hero and quit the ring cage and be meet outside by the whole show management and congratulate on have more nerve than any man alive pa say : if you will give I a shotgun load with bird shot i will make those animal get on they knee at the next performance and beg my pardon you can discharge you trainer and i will teach they a lot of new stunt say pa be a wonder and he have already get old barnum beat a block chapter xv the bad boy feed the menagerie scotch snuff -- pa get maul by the sneeze animal -- pa take a midnight ride on a mule to escape punishment well i s ` pose i have do it now and it would not surprise I to be kill and feed to wild animal ' the manager of the show be talk to pa and I before we leave new york about the condition of the show its finances be all ball up on account of settle with people who pretend to be injure when the tent blow down at poughkeepsie and the hand and performer be kick because we be a month behind on salary and they get drunk whenever any jay will buy for they everybody give pass to everybody that want to get in the show so the box office man have a sinecure and people chase we from town to town for money for board and hay and everything all through new jersey we show to claim agent and creditor and do not take in money enough to buy meat for the animal he say the animal have all take cold and lay around dormant and do not take any interest in the business and the manager tell pa he must think of something to wake the animal up pa say he would leave it to I to wake 'em up and get some ginger into they i tell pa if i have five dollar to spend i could make every animal jump like a box car pa give I the money and i go and buy five pound of scotchsnuff and divide it up into ounce package and start during the afternoon performance at wilmington del to wake up the animal there be something peculiar about animal if you try to give they anything that they think you want they to take you can not drive it down they with a pile driver but if you try to hide something where they can reach it they watch you out of one eye and when you go away they look at you as much as to say : o you think you be smart do not you then they will go and dig it up and play with it and eat it if they want to i take my first package of snuff to the lion 's cage and he be the sickest and most disgusted look lion you ever see act like a man who have take a severe cold and want to kill anybody that look at he the lion lay on the straw stretch out full length pay no attention to the crowd that pass he cage and act as though he want a hot whisky and he foot soak in mustard water when he be not look i hide the package of snuff under the straw and rattle the straw a little and he open he eye and look at I as much as to say : you can not fool old shadrack for i be onto you i walk away behind the hyena cage and mr lion get up and stretch himself and walk to the place where i put the paper of snuff put he foot on it and break the paper and then he put he nose down and sniff a sniff that draw the whole of the snuff up into he nose and lung and inside generally gee but you never see such a change in a lion the crowd of visitor be right near he cage when he sniff and when he get the snuff into he he begin to heave he side like a man who be prepare to sneeze catch he breath a few time and let out a sneeze that sound like the explosion of a automobile tire it throw cut feed all over the audience and everybody run away yell that the lion bust he keep on sneeze and look so astounded as though he could not make out what have get into he pa hear the commotion and come run up to the cage to find out what ail the lion after i have go around to the other cage and put snuff in all of they i come up to the lion 's cage the lion have stop sneeze and be roar and jump up and down with he mouth open try to catch he breath like a man who have take too big a dose of fresh horse-radish pa say : what have you be do to shadrack i tell pa i have wake shadrack up and that in about a minute he would find that the whole animal kingdom have get a bellyful and would join in the chorus pa try to soothe the lion by go up to the cage and stroke he mane but the lion look cross-eyed and stop prance and give a sneeze right at pa which blow pa clear across the tent to where the sacred cow have just get hers when the stuff begin to work on that cow it be simply scandalous 'cause she bellow and cry and sneeze all at once and paw pa he get up and tell I i be overdo this wake up act on the animal by that time the cage of hyena begin to sneeze a quartette and fight each other and the atmosphere about they cage be full of hair and language that would be much like cuss if it could be translate into english pa try to quiet the crowd and silence the hyena by take a iron bar and maul they but the hyena just back up against the rear of the cage and howl and sneeze at pa and dare he to come on -lrb- illustration : the lion sneeze and blow pa clear across the tent -rrb- one of they catch he by the shirt sleeve and tear pa 's shirt off and eat it pa be a sight with no shirt on and he ought to have go to the dress room and slick but just then the camel and the giraffe who have inhale they snuff begin to sneeze and beg to be kill and pa have to go over there and quiet they a camel be the solemnist look beast on earth when he try to be good natured but when he be sick and mad and full of snuff he be a fiend one such camel be enough for a man to handle but when 14 camel be all sneeze at once and try to locate the person that be responsible for they trouble it be the safest to keep away and when pa go in amongst they with no shirt on and the arab keeper have run away in fright it be a dangerous thing to do but pa be brave even to rashness he go up to mahomet the double-humped leader of the herd who be the leader of the sneezer and kick he in the slat and tell he to hush up he noise he club he on the hump with a tent stake then there be a rebellion in egypt and mahomet bit pa and would not let go and the other camel sneeze all over pa and have he down walk on he with they padded foot the circus hand have to pull pa out and it be not so bad because the crowd remain and they think it be a part of the show and that the animal be train to sneeze that way the worst case be the hippopotamus he be so big and have such big nostril that i lay about half a pound of snuff on the side of he tank and when he snuff it up he nose he get it all i hear a howl from the tank and the herd who be the leader of the sneezer and i tell pa to come on 'cause vessuvious be go to erupt pa come on the run just as he be and then the worst happen i think the hippo go under water when he find the sneeze be come for just as pa get to the tank the water fly into the air like a torpedo have explode under a battle-ship and the hippo have sneeze all right and pa and the audience which have follow he be drench and deafen by the explosion the hippo have blow the water all out of he tank and he lay at the bottom on he side sneeze little sneeze not louder than the report of a six-pound cannon and panting for breath then he raise he head get up on he foot and open he mouth like a gash cut in a steer by a cow catcher of a engine and he yawn and i guess he get the lockjaw 'cause he keep he mouth open all the afternoon to get the air like a soprano singer in a choir who have be feed a cayenne pepper lozenger by the tenor just before she get up to sing : a charge to keep i have we go around and inspect the sneeze animal with the manager and he compliment I by say i have save the show from become a aggregation of stuff animal only fit for a taxidermist studio and make every animal show that he have ginger in he he want I to try my snuff cure on the performer and freak 'cause they be get to be dead one well before the day be over at wilmington del pa be scared worse than he ever be in all he life before the state of delaware be the only state that punish criminal by tie they up and whipping they on the bare back with a cat-o ' - nine-tail and all we man have be warn to be good while they be in delaware 'cause if they commit any crime there be no power on earth that could save they from be publicly horsewhip pa himself impress it on the man to look out that they do not get into any trouble gee but the fear of a public whipping make man good twenty year ago some hold-up man from new york rob a bank in delaware and be catch and give 50 lash apiece on the bare back by a big negro and there have never be a burglary in delaware since we think we would play a joke on pa so the manager tell pa that constable be look for he to arrest he for cruelty to animal for kick a camel in the stomach and hit the camel with a iron bar and that if pa do not want to be publicly horsewhip on the bare back he better skip out for washington dc where we would show in a couple of day and wait for we pa be so frightened he could not get supper and everybody talk about cat of nine tail and how prisoner be cut to piece and every time pa see a jay with a slouch hat he think it be a constable after he after dark he put on a old suit of clothes and say he be go to washington they tell he if he go to take a train he would surely be arrest at the depot so pa put a saddle on one of the mule and ride out of town and ride all night and all the next day he buy oats of farmer to be deliver at wilmington for the circus finally he get out of delaware and the next day the farmer come in with the oats but the show be go and they will not do a thing to pa if he ever show up in delaware again -lrb- illustration : pa ride out of town and ride all night -rrb- pa meet we at the depot in washington but he be ever so change from he long ride and anxiety over the possibility of be arrest and pillory and lambast by a negro in delaware he say to I with a tremble voice : hennery this ` ere show business be too much for you pa i would rather be a mormon in utah with 40 wife and several hundred child and long whisker i be a changed man hennery and afraid of my shadow chapter xvi a senator 's son bet the bad boy that elephant be coward -- they let a bag of rat loose at the afternoon performance -- the elephant stampede pa fracture a rib and general pandemonium reign gee but i must be a easy mark i have get so i bet on a sure thing and when a fellow bet on a sure thing he be bind to lose it be this way the show arrive in washington d c on a Sunday morning and as usual all the boy in town come to the lot to see we put up the tent i be around with pa and the boss canvasman and the town boy could see i belong to the show and they envy I and want to get acquaint with I so i would let they walk around with I and go into the tent Sunday afternoon and see the animal there be one boy with a sort of rough rider hat on and buckskin fringe on he pants and everybody say he be a senator 's son but the other boy have rather be acquaint with I because i belong to the show and i take pity on the senator 's son and let he talk to I without look cross at he or snub he as i do most boy who try to butt in on I i get to like the senator 's son and have he come in the tent and we put in the afternoon look at the animal the elephant be chew hay and look fierce and the senator 's boy say elephant be the greatest coward on earth and i say not on you life the giant in we show be the greatest coward and the behemoth of holy writ be next the senator 's son say elephant be such coward they be afraid of mouse and we could take a trap full of mouse and turn they loose in the ring and the elephant would stampede and he would bet five dollar on it i excused myself for a moment and tell pa what the senator 's son offer to bet and pa say : here 's $ 50 and you can take all the bet you can get why this herd of elephant would walk on mouse and rat too you bet with he and tell he to bring along all the rat and mouse he can find in the white house and you can turn they into the ring Monday afternoon when the elephant do they turn and if a elephant bat a eye i will eat he ear for mushroom i go back to young mr senator and take he bet and tell he i have plenty more money to bet the same way and he say the next afternoon he would come with he mouse and rat and a lot of money to bet that you could not hold that flock of elephant with log chain when he open he bag of rat and mouse well how it get into the papers i do not know but the next morning they all say a interesting experiment would be make the next afternoon at the great and only circus to determine once and for all whether elephant be afraid of mouse and that a senator 's son and a son of one of the proprietor of the show would conduct the experiment by turn loose a lot of mouse and rat in the ring at precisely 3:30 pm well you never see such a crowd in a circus as we have that afternoon it seem as though the whole population turn out foreign minister negro society people and clerk that senator 's son and the whole family and the neighbor must have be up all night catch mouse and rat and it take nine boy and three servant to carry the basket and trap and bag of mouse and rat i pass they all in and we line up on a front seat to wait for the elephant stunt and when the thing be ripe we be to empty the whole mess of vermin into the ring i feel as though something be wrong 'cause i see the new moon over my left shoulder the night before and now i wish i have die before this thing happen when the japanese juggler go out of the ring i know that be the cue for the elephant to come in and when the dress room curtain be pull aside and old bolivar come out at the head of the herd and they march around the outside of the ring clear around the tent my heart jump up into my throat and i feel sick the senator 's son say : when these rat and thing begin to chase you old elephant you will not be able to see they tail for the dust they will kick up then i thought of the money pa have give I to bet and i offer to bet it all and a negro produce fund and take all my bet like a bookmaker well after do a turn around the big ring the trainer steer the elephant into the middle ring and the great audience lean forward to catch every trick the elephant do we boy hold on to the bag that the mouse and thing be in wait for we cue the elephant stand on they head and hind foot and fore foot lay down fire pistol and do everything just right without make a mistake finally the trainer form the whole herd into a grand pyramid with old bolivar in the center each elephant hold a american flag with he trunk and wave it and the audience break out into a cheer that fairly rip the canvas then i say to young mr senator : come on with you rat now and i win $ 50 all hand pick up the basket and bag and go to the side of the ring and empty the whole bunch of more than 500 into the ring the rat and mouse rush for the elephant and then turn and make a rush for the reserved seat oh dear what a time we have the elephant get down off that pyramid so quick it would make you head swim and old bolivar trumpet in abject fear and try to break away but pa come along with a tent stake and hit bolivar over the head and tell the trainer to put the elephant back into the pyramid and hold they there till the bell ring for they to cease they stunt the trainer could not do anything with they and they bellow and dodge mouse and shy at rat and bolivar take he trunk and swat pa clear across the ring -lrb- illustration : bolivar swat pa clear across the ring -rrb- the elephant follow bolivar to the main entrance each elephant try to walk on the heel of the one ahead of he and all the circus hand try to head off the elephant but they would not head off they be simply scare to death and they break out the side of the tent near the lemonade stand and go whoop out into the open air and freedom while the audience yell with joy young mr senator say to I : what do you think of elephant now i tell he to take he money and he darned the audience be get nervous so the band strike up a hot time in the old town and they be quiet down as the curtain raise and the horse for the chariot race come out just then a woman with red sock get up on she chair in the press seat and pull she dress away up and yell rat and another woman scream and jump up on a seat with she clothes at half mast and yell that there be mouse on the seat in less than two minute every woman in the audience and the bearded woman and the fat woman be stand up on something hold up they dress and shake they skirt and scream and when the fat woman fall into the arm of the bearded woman in a faint and the bearded woman drop the fat woman pa tell the bearded woman he be ashamed of she scream 'cause she ought to be more of a man than that well every mouse and rat in the bunch seem to be look for woman to scream at they and there be no use try to run a show with such a excited audience so pa have the band play good night lady and he announce that the performance might be consider over for the afternoon everybody make a rush for the exit each woman hold up she skirt and fairly gallop to get away from the mouse and rat they all get out of the tent finally and then the manager have a meeting to find out who start the trouble and what it be best to do about it i be sit alone on a front seat think over the scene of the afternoon and wonder what the young senator 's son would do with the money he have win of I and whether he have depopulate the white house of rat and mouse so the president would notice it i be think about elephant and wonder if they be coward by nature or have acquire cowardice by associate with mankind when pa come along and sit down by I a picture of despair 'cause bolivar have fracture one of he rib and the fat woman have paralyze he knee sit on he lap while they bring she to after she faint when she think a rat be climb into she sock pa sigh and say : hennery i want a exciting life to keep I from brood over advance age and i choose the circus business but i find it be rather too strenuous for I each day something occur to try my nerve i do not claim that you be to blame for it all but i think i could enjoy my position with the show if you would take the first train that go north and leave I for awhile what i need be rest go boy go i feel sorry far pa but i put my arm around he and i say : pa do not fear i will never desert you until the season be over wherever you go

strike virginium and the educate ourang outang have the whooping cough -- the bad boy play the part of a monkey but they forget to pin on a tail well i have break the show all to piece just by not be able to stand grief everything be all ball up the manager be sore at I and afraid of be send to jail and pa think i ought to be maul it be this way : when we leave washington we cut loose from every home tie and plunge into virginium and the trouble begin at once we meet a lawyer on the train on the way to richmond and fed he in we dining car and get he acquaint with all the performer and freak and he tell we that we would have to be careful in virginia 'cause all the white people be first family and aristocratic and if any man about we show should fail to be polite to the white people they would be shoot or lynch but if we want to shoot nigger the game law be not very strict about it 'cause the open season on nigger run the year around but you could not shoot white people only two month in the year he say another thing that scare pa and the manager he say that if a travel show do not perform all it advertise the owner be liable to go to state prison for 20 year and that each town have man on the lookout to see that show do not advertise what they do not carry out pa and the manager hold a consultation and could not find that we advertise anything that we do not have except the ourang outang that we take on at new york which eat and dress like a man 'cause that animal get whooping cough in delaware and have to be send to a hospital but we hear he be well again and would join the show in a week pa ask the richmond lawyer how it would be if one of the animal that be advertise be sick and could not perform and he tell pa the people would mob the show if anything be leave out when we get to richmond the whole population principally nigger be at the lot when we put up the tent and everybody want to catch a sight of denni the ourang outang and the poster all over town that picture denni smoking cigarette with a dress suit on and eat with a knife and fork and a napkin tuck under he chin be surround by crowd it be plain that all the people care for be to see the monk the manager hold a council of war and decide the show would be ruin if we do not make a bluff at have a ourang outang so it be decide that i be to be dress up in denni ' clothes and put on a monkey mask and go through he stunt at the afternoon performance gee but i hate to do it but pa say the fate of the show depend on it and if i do not take the part he would have to do it himself and i know pa be not the build of man to play the monkey and so i say i would do it but i will never do it again for any show the wardrobe woman fix my up like denni and i have see he go through he stunt so often i think i could imitate he and of course there be no talk to do but just to grunt once in awhile the way denni do and have a animal look well sir the keeper who train the ourang outang take I in hand and in a hour i be perfect i have rubber foot and wear black glove and have a tail fasten with a safety pin that would deceive the oldest showman in the business when the crowd be the biggest in the middle ring the keeper lead I out of the dress room with a chain the announcement be make by the barker that denni the educate ourang outang that have perform before crown head in europe and saphead in newport the only man-monkey in the known world would now entertain the most select audience that have ever be under the tent then i be drag into the ring and put on the platform -lrb- illustration : the keeper who train the ourang outang take I in hand -rrb- they do not put on my dress clothes at first but have a little screen on the platform for I to go behind to dress and i appear first in the natural state of the ourang outang with a suit of buffalo robe stuff that look exactly like a big monkey i bow and the audience cheer and i stand on my hand and scratch at a imaginary flea and pa who be lean against the platform whisper to I that i be make the hit of the season then the attendant set the table and the keeper take I behind the screen and dress I and the old fool forget to put on my tail he lead I out and i sit up to the table hitch up my cuff put a napkin under my chin take a knife and fork and begin to eat just like a human be the audience cheer and the circus people crowd around and say i be just as good as denni himself i go through the whole of denni ' performance and never skip a note until a smart white man yell : where be the tail of you ourang outang and the crowd begin to be suspicious and more than a thousand yell there be no tail on you monkey that rattle the trainer and he remember that he have forget to pin the tail on I so while i be use the finger bowl he go to the screen and get the tail and come out and be pin it on to my dress pants when the audience begin to yell : fraud fraud kill the monk and a lot of stuff then pa get on a barrel the elephant have be perform on and get the attention of the audience and tell they not to be unreasonable he say the management have find by experience that after the ourang outang have be train to eat like a man and wear man 's clothes that he tail be in the way so at a great expense the management have cause denni ' tail to be amputate at a new york hospital and while we always carry the tail along it be only use when a critical audience demand it but if this refine audience so desire the tail would be attach to the intelligent animal the crowd yell : pin on the tail the tail go with the hide and the trainer begin to pin it on say i could have kill that trainer he run that safety pin about a inch into my spine and i jump into the air about four foot and i be go to use a cuss word that i learn in philadelphium but i have presence of mind enough to grunt just as denni use to and chatter like a monkey and the day be save the tail be on and i turn my back to show that it be on straight like a woman 's hat when pa say to hurry the performance to a conclusion because he could see that there be a spirit of unrest in the audience and he would not be surprise any moment to see virginia secede and go out of the union there be nothing more for I to do except to drink my cup of after-dinner coffee and smoke my cigarette and quit and i be pat myself on the back at my success and squirm around in the chair 'cause the pin in my tail hurt my back but i never say a word the attendant bring in the coffee and i take a couple of swallow when i realize that somebody have put cayenne pepper into it and i be hot under the collar but though i be burn up inside i never peep but just choke and take a swallow of water and vow to kill the person that make the coffee i keep my temper till the trainer hand I the cigarette and a match and the first puff i realize that they have fill the cigarette with snuff and after blow out the smoke i begin to sneeze and the audience fairly go wild i sneeze about eight time and at every sneeze the pin in my spine hurt like thunder but i never lose my temper till about the seventh sneeze when my monkey mask fly off and then a boy about my size right in front of I yell : it be not a monkey at all it be a little nigger and he throw a ripe persimmon and hit I right in the eye i say right out in plain english : you be a liar and i can knock the stuff out of you -lrb- illustration : he hit I right in the eye -rrb- i pull off my dress coat and start for he but pa grab I on one side and the monkey trainer on the other and they try to get I to return to the monkey character and chatter and pa put my monkey mask on I but i strike right there and pull it off and tell he and the manager that i would not play monkey any more with a tail pin to my spine my stomach full of cayenne pepper and my nostril full of scotch snuff and my face all pucker up with persimmon the crowd yell : fraud fraud kill the bald-headed old man who be the father of the monkey and they be make a rush to clean out the show when the dressing-room door open to let the hippodrome chariot racer out and the way the chariot scatter the crowd be a caution that save we from serious trouble for the chariot run over a lot of negro which please the audience and they let we off without kill we they get I back to the dressing-room and have to take a pair of pincher to get that safety pin out of my spine and on the way to the dressing-room some one walk on my monkey tail and pull it off and that be a dead loss pa sit by I and fan I 'cause i be faint and then he say : my boy you play you part well until the persimmon hit you and then you forget that you be a actor and become yourself and i do not blame you for want to punch that boy who call you a little nigger and say i be you pa after this chariot race be over we will go around in front of the seat and find the boy and you can do he up you monkey business be the feature of the show to-day we go out and find a boy that look like the one that sass I but he must have be he big brother 'cause when i go up to he and swat he on the nose he give I a black eye and i be a sight that evening at the performance we cut out the educate ourang outang and the lawyer we meet on the car come to the show and say we would all be arrest for not perform all we advertise but he could settle it for a hundred dollar and pa pay he the money and he go out and get a jag and come in the show and be go to make trouble when pa take he to the cage where the 40-foot boa constrictor be uncoil itself and the virginian get one look at the snake and go through the side of the tent yell : i have get 'em again catch I somebody we get out of town before morning and nobody be arrest except the negro that get run over in the chariot race chapter xix the circus people visit a southern plantation -- pa the giant and the fat woman be chase by bloodhound -- the bad boy run the gauntlet gee but pa be sore at I he have be disgust with I before but he never have it in for I so serious as he have now i guess the whole show would breathe easier if i should fall off the train some dark night when it be stormy and we be cross a high bridge over a stream that be out of its bank on account of a freshet it be all on account of we take a afternoon off on a Sunday at richmond a old planter that use to be in the circus business before the war think it would bring back old recollection to he and give we a taste of country life in the south if he invite all of we performer manager freak and everything to spend the day on he plantation and go nutting for chestnut and hickory nut pick apple and run they through a cider mill and drink self-made cider and have a good time we all appreciate the invitation and after breakfast we ride out in the country to he plantation in carriage and express wagon and begin to do the plantation the fat lady and the midget ride out together in a load of cotton and when they get to the house they have to be pick like duck and they look as though they have be tar and feathered the planter give we a fine luncheon of fried chicken and corn pone and cider and pa act as the boss of the circus folk while the planter and he family with about 100 negro pass thing around they all seem to be interested in see how much stuff the giant and the fat lady could hold without put up sideboard to keep the food from fall off if pa have not tell the negro not to feed the fat lady and the giant any more there would have be two circus funeral next day i get acquaint with a boy that be the planter 's son and while the rest be eat and drink the boy show I a pack of hound that be keep for trail criminal and negro who have look sassy at white woman the trouble with negro be that they all look alike and if one commit a crime they can prove a alibi 'cause every last negro will swear that at the time the crime be commit the suspect man be attend a prayer meeting so they have to have hound that can be take to the place where the crime be commit and they find the negro 's track and they follow it till they tree he the hound do not bite the negro like we use to hear about but they just follow he till he be treed and then they bark as much as to say : ah there mr nigger you just stay where you be till the sheriff come to fetch you and mr negro just turn pale and stay on a limb till the sheriff come with he lynching tool when the sheriff pull a gun the negro confess right there and the deputy sheriff bring the rope i ask the boy if the hound would trail a white man without hurt he and he say if you put anise seed on they shoe the hound will trail 'em all right so we put up a job to have some fun the boy give I some anise seed and tell I to put it on the shoe of anybody i want trail and after they get out in the wood he would put the hound on the trail and the people would have to get up tree or have they pants chew but the dog would not hurt anybody well it make I laugh to think about it i go to pa and tell he he shoe be all cover with red virginium dust and i take my handkerchief and dust they off and make he hold up he foot like a horse that be be shod then i put a handful of anise seed around the sole and in he shoe he say it be mighty kind in I to do it then i go to the giant and brush the dust off he shoe and put two handful of anise seed in they and he say i be a nice boy i tell the fat woman about the dust on she telescope valise and i rub it off and give she foot a dose of anise seed that ought to have paralyze a pack of hound she want to hug I and let I kiss she but i say i pass and she say she would do as much for I some time about this time the planter take the lead and they all go across a pasture into the wood and begin knock nut off the tree all through the wood there be sign : no tresspassing and beware of the dog but the planter say to never mind the sign i tell the boy to let the dog loose on the trail in about half a hour and i go along with the folk and i tell pa i have see a pack of bloodhound that would eat people alive and if he hear hound bark to run like a whitehead and climb a tree i get with the giant who be a coward in he own right and tell he the only trouble about these great plantation in the south be the wild dog that inhabit the mountain that would not hesitate to attack a man if they get good and hungry but there be no danger to he because he be a good sprinter and could outrun a jack rabbit the giant want to go back to the house 'cause he say he do not want to run no foot race with hound and he have see the sign to beware of the dog i never ought to have do it 'cause the fat woman look as though she be build a purpose for apoplexy but i tell she as a friend not to load herself down with nut but to travel light so if the wild dog come down to raid the plantation she could crawl in a hole out of sight till the dog have eat some of the man she come near faint right there before the dog get busy there be about 20 negro throw club at the nut and everybody be have a big time the trapeze performer be squirrel up among the limb when suddenly in the distance come the bay of the pack of bloodhound and every negro turn pale and get ready to climb a tree the planter stop to listen and when one of the manager of the show ask he what be the matter he say : you can search I sah if that be my pack of hound a crime have be commit and the sheriff have start the pack on the trail of the criminal sah because the dog be never turn loose except for business then the planter yell to the nigger and say : if any of youall be guilty of crime you best get scarce or pick out you tree and get up it mighty sudden 'cause the hound have not be feed lately every color man pick a tree and the hound keep come finally show up jump the fence and enter the wood and the planter cut a club to beat off the dog pa look as innocent as john wanamaker 's picture address a Sunday school the giant see the dog and start for a tall tree and the fat lady say she could not find any hole big enough to hide in and the idea if there be not man enough to protect a lady well i never expect to see anything so fine as the way those hound run with they nose to the ground scatter in three pack one pack on the trail of each of the three whose shoe i have doctor when they get near we they break up and go around everywhere that pa and the giant and the fat lady have walk and fall over each other but finally one pack go to the tall tree where the giant have climb to the first limb and stand on they hind leg and bark a salute to he he tremble so i be afraid he would fall off but he wind he arm and leg around the tree and begin to cry the planter tell he whatever crime he have commit it be all up with he the part of the pack that be on pa 's trail begin to close in on pa and i say : pa if you do not want to be dog meat it be up to you to climb and you better get a move on or i shall be a orphan mighty quick 'cause the dog be starve pa make a couple of quick jump and grab a limb of a hickory tree and be pull himself up and repeat prayer when the lead dog reach up he nose and smell pa 's shoe when the intelligent animal give a bark and a yell to the other dog as much as to say : that be the identical cuss eat he alive he grab about a double handful of the cloth of pa 's clothes right below where he suspenders button on and hold on and shake pa real hard but the cloth be tough and do not tear pa suddenly seem to be endow with superhuman strength for he draw himself up on the limb and raise the dog from the ground and all the pack come around the tree and set up a howl that scare pa so the perspiration roll off he and he have a chill so he shake like the ague pa yell to the planter who be hold up the fat lady and say : here mr confederate i be not a union prisoner and i want you to unlock you dog 's jaw and free I 'cause i can not hold up a 90-pound dog by my suspenders much longer if this be southern hospitality i do not want to be entertain no more the planter lean the fat lady against a tree and take the dog by the hind leg and pull he off -lrb- illustration : here mr confederate i be not a union prisoner -rrb- the planter yell to the negro to come down and help handle the dog but just then the boy who start the dog on the trail at my request come up whistle with a dog whip in he hand and all the dog surround he and he make they lay down and roll over all of the scared people come down from they perch in the tree and surround the boy and the dog and the dog pant and loll as though they have be have a nice run for they money the old planter ask he boy how the dog have happen to get loose and that fool boy tell the whole thing how i have ask he to let the pack run and how i have put anise seed in the shoe of pa the giant and the fat lady then you ought to have see what they do to I the planter say they usually have a lynching when the dog make a run but that be impossible in this case so he suggest that they make I run the gauntlet i do not know what run the gauntlet be but after pa have tell I he should disown I from that moment i say i be willing to run any gauntlet so they all cut switch and form in two line and let I run down between they i think it would be fun but when i start and every last man give I a cut across the end of my back with a hickory switch i yell murder and run between the giant 's leg and tackle he like football i topple he over against the next man and that man hit the giant in the stomach and everybody begin to fight and the festivity break up -lrb- illustration : i yell murder and run between the giant 's leg -rrb- i go to the house with the boy and the dog and we set the dog on a mess of cat and treed everything alive on the plantation finally the whole crowd come back to the house and have another lunch with mint julep and champagne and then everybody be hug some one and cry on each other 's neck and swearing that the war be over and that the north and the south be one and inseparable and the two together could whip the whole world pa somehow see double i be stand alone smart from the switching i get when pa come up to I and say : i want you two boy to understand that i do not want any more experiment play on I i can take a joke we well as anybody but when you set a hundred dog on my trail i be no gentleman see now we will go back to the show chapter xx the bad boy go after a mess of white turnip for the menagerie -- he feed the animal horseradish but get the worst of the deal you can learn something new and interesting every day in a circus and a boy particularly can store he mind with useful knowledge that will be valuable to he in after year gee but i have learn some thing that i could never have learn in college 'cause at college you only learn thing that have to be verify by actual experience in business pa say one year in the circus will be better for I than ten year in a reform school but i learn something yesterday that make such a impression on I that i will not be able to sit down comfortably before the season be over you see it be this way once a week it be the custom to feed all the animal that be vegetarian a mess of ground white turnip 'cause it open up the pore and make the animal feel good like a politician who go to french lick spring and have the whisky boil out of he after the animal have eat the turnip mush they become agreeable and will rub against the keeper and eat out of you hand i have be with pa a dozen time to find a place where we could get a few barrel of turnip grind up fine and so yesterday when the boss animal keeper be sick and turn he job over to pa pa tell I to go out in town at lynchburg va and get a couple of washtub full of ground turnip and have the stuff send in to the menagerie tent in time for the afternoon performance i get a boy to go with I we hunt all the grocery and could not find turnip enough to make a first payment but we find a place where they grate horseradish and bottle it for the market and i order two washtub full of horseradish grate nicely and send to the tent but i make the man bill it as ground turnip the boy and i play all the forenoon and when the man start with the ground horseradish for the tent we go along and i introduce the man to pa and pa o k have the bill and send he to the treasurer after the money i be go to get on a back seat and watch the animal eat but pa say : here you boy get out those pan and portion out the turnip and pass 'em around just as the crowd come in 'cause after the animal have have a mess of cut feed they be better natured and show off better i be pretty leery about feed the animal horseradish and would have prefer to have some one else do it who do not care to live any longer but i say : yes sir just like that and touch my hat to pa and he say to the boss canvasman : there be a boy you can swear by the boss canvasman say : you be right old man but if he be mine i would kill he so quick it would make you head swim and he and pa go off laugh but i think they laugh too soon well we take a spud and put about a quart of horseradish in each pan and put the pan in front of each animal and you ought to have see they rush for the suppose turnip like a drive of cattle after salt the boy and i get up on the platform with the freak to be in a safe place and watch the animal and see how they digest they food the first animal to open up the chorus be the hippopotamus 'cause we give he about four quart of horseradish on account of he mouth and he swallow it at one mouthful first he look as though he feel hurt and stop chew and seem to be think like a horse that wake up in the night with colic and raise the whole family to sit up with he all night and pour thing down he neck out of a long-neck bottle the hippo hold he breath for about a minute and then he open he mouth so you could drive a wagon in and give the grand hail sign of distress and say : wow wow wow as plain as a man could then he roll over into he tank and yell murder and wallow around and stand on he head till one of the keeper go in the cage to try to soothe he he chase the keeper out and the crowd that have just begin to come in fall back in terror there be quite a crowd around the camel watch they peacefully chew they cud as they do at evening on the dessert and the arab who have charge of the camel be stand around pose as though they be the whole thing when the old black double-hump camel get he quart of horseradish down into one of he stomach as he be kneel down on all fours he yell : o mamma and get up on all he foot and kick a arab off a prayer rug and bellow and groan then the rest of the herd of camel seem to have swallow they dose and they make rome howl this scare the people over to where the sacred cattle be try to set a pious example to the rest of the animal by they meek and lowly conduct -lrb- illustration : the camel kick a arab off a rug -rrb- the sacred cow get she horseradish first and i could see she be try to hold it without give the snap away till she husband the bull get he well it be pitiful and i make up my mind i would never play a joke on the sacred cattle again 'cause it seem like sacrilege the bull finally get he horseradish down and he be the most astonished animal i ever see he swell up and then bellow until the cow look as though she would sink through the ground say excuse I dear but i be not to blame because i too have a hot box the bull act just as human as could be 'cause he look mad at she and be go to gore she to death when pa and some of the hand come up and hit he with a tent stake and swear at he and he quit fight he wife just like a man pa want to know what in thunder be the matter with the animal and want to know if i have feed they the turnip and i tell he they have all be feed and just then the giraffe whose neck be so long the horseradish do not reach a vital spot as quick as it do with the hippo begin to yell for the police and dance around finally he stand on he head and neck with he heel against a cage and cough like he have catch pneumonia pa say to the boss canvasman : well what do you think of that the zebra have they inning next and after they have swallow they ration of horseradish they never say a word but begin to run around like dance the lancer and when they get to go it look like a kaleidoscope and the six zebra look like a million pa say : i never see such a sight since i use to drink but i have either get the jim-jam or something awful have happen to this menagerie the educate hog get a double dose and he squeal and could not pick out the right card and then the llama get busy on they portion of horseradish and they cry in spanish and stand on they hind leg and shed tear pa get so rattled he look ten year older than he do when the afternoon performance open the manager of the big show come in to know why the elephant have not be send into the dressing-room to be get ready for the grand entree just then the elephant begin to eat they horseradish and when they be drive into the big tent they be complain about something be wrong inside of they and as they come by the lemonade stand they seem to be yell fire then they all stop at the stand and begin to drink the lemonade out of the barrel which seem to put out the fire the animal quiet down a little and pa go into the big tent to consult the manager and i think it be a shame that the lion and hyena and tiger could not have any fun so i go to the table where the meat be lay out ready to feed they and cut a hole in each piece of meat and put in a double handful of horseradish and just then the feeder come along and begin to throw the meat in the cage gee but those carnivorous animal be bad enough even if you give they nice boil sirloin steak and they fight enough over it at any time but when they begin to chew and tear the meat and get horseradish hot from the griddle they do not do a thing the audience think the animal would kill everybody the big lion get he meat down but it do not set well and he turn a somersault and snarl and pull the bar of the cage while the grizzly bear roll up in a ball and roll over in he cage till the man have to hold on to the wheel to keep the shebang from go over the hyena who be always mad go on a tear that could be hear in all the tent pa and the manager come back into the menagerie tent with the animal keeper who have be send for and they begin to try to find out what ail the animal and the animal keeper ask what pa have be feed they and pa say he have give they they ground turnip turnip indeed say the keeper as he take up some of the turnip and taste of it and he hand a handful to pa pa taste it and pa have a hot box and the manager taste of it and they say : no wonder then they ask pa where he get it and pa say he send I to order it and then they all say : that settle it -lrb- illustration : pa taste of it -rrb- i think i would go ` way and jump in the river but pa say : hennery come here my angel and he spit on he hand and pick up a barrel stave i go right up to pa as innocent as could be just as any dutiful son should and right there before the animal and freak pa -- well that be the reason i be not sit down very much these day so long chapter xxi the bad boy and he pa inject a little politics into the show -- rival band of atlanta citizen meet in the circus tent -- a bunch of angry hornet cause much bitter feeling i expect that next year i shall be one of the manager of this show 'cause they tell I i have get the greatest head of any boy that have ever travel with the show we have not be have a very big business in the south because the negro have not money enough to patronize show and a lot of the white people be either too high-toned or else they be politician and want a pass the manager and head of department hold a meeting to devise some way to get both class interested and everybody be ask to state they view after they all get through talk pa ask I what i think would be the best way to get the people excite about the show and i tell he there be no way except to inject a little politics into it i say if they would give I $ 50 or so to buy chinese lantern and about a hundred complimentary ticket to give away pa and i could go to atlanta a couple of day ahead of the show and we could organize a roosevelt club among the negro and a bryan club among the white fellow and at the evening performance we could have the two club march into the main tent one from the main entrance and one from the dress room with chinese lantern and one could yell for roosevelt and the other for bryan and advertise that a great sensation would be spring at the evening performance i say the tent would not begin to hold the people every one of the manager and head of department say it would be great stuff pa be the only one that kick he say the two procession might get into a fight but i say what if they do we would not be to blame let 'em fight if they want to and we can see fair play so they all agree that pa and i should go to atlanta ahead and organize the political procession and say we have such a time that the circus come near never get out of the town alive we overdo the thing so they want to lynch I and pa want to help the way it be be this way : pa be to organize the white man for bryan and i be to organize the negro for roosevelt and we go to work and buy 600 chinese lantern and pa store he half of the lantern in a barn on the circus lot and i store mine in another barn own by a negro that i give five dollar to be my assistant with a promise that he should have a job travel with the show to milk the sacred cow i tell this negro what the program be and that i want 200 negro who have a ambition to be politician and hold office and i would not only pass they into the show free but see that they get a permanent office what we have get to do i say be to stampede the white procession that would be lead by pa and the way to do it be for every negro in my party to skirmish around in the wood and find a hornet 's nest and bring it to we barn and fit it into one of the chinese lantern and fix a candle on top of the nest while the hornet be asleep then when we meet the bryan procession we be to shout and wave we lantern and if necessary to whack the white man over the head with the lantern with the hornet ' nest and the hornet would wake up and do the rest the negro want to know how i could prevent the hornet from sting we own man and i tell he that we have be in the hornet business all the season and never have one of we own man sting i say we take some assafoetida and rub it on we clothes and face and the hornet would not touch we but just go for the other fellow to beat the band say negro be easy mark you can make they believe anything but if i ever get to be president i be go to appoint my negro assistant to a position in my cabinet 'cause he be the greatest political organizer i ever see he round up over 200 cotton picker and negro man who work in the freight depot once in a while and start they out after hornet ' nest he give they some change to get a drink and promise they free pass into the show next night and the next morning they show up with hornet ' nest enough to scare you they put they in a dark place in the barn so the hornet would not get curious and want to come out of the nest before they get they cue that afternoon we fit they into the chinese lantern and tie stick on the lantern and fix the candle and when night come there be more negro than i could use but i tell they to follow along and the door tender would let they in and all they need to do be to yell for teddy when i do and so we march to the main tent about the time the performance get to go i see pa with he gang of white man go into the dress room at about the same time the manager have time it for we to come in about 8:30 into the main tent when the elephant be in they pyramid act so my crowd of negro stop in the menagerie tent half a hour wait to be call i wish i be not so confound curious but i suppose i be bear that way i take one of the chinese lantern that be not light and just think i would like to see what the hyena and the big lion who be in the same cage with a iron partition between they would do if a chinese lantern be put in the cage so i get the fellow that watch the cage to open up the top trap door and i drop a chinese lantern with a hornet ' nest in it right between the two hyena gee but you ought to have see they pounce on it and bite it and tear it up and then the hornet wake up and they do not do a thing to that mess of hyena the hyena set up a grand hail sign of distress and howl pitiful and the lion raise up he head and look at they through the bar as though he be say in a snarling way what you grave robber howl about can not you keep still and let the czar of all the animal enjoy he after dinner nap just then the hyena kick what be leave of the hornet ' nest under the bar into he side of the cage and he put he foot on it and growl and about a hundred hornet give he he he give a abyssinian cough that wake all the animal and then the hornet scatter and before i know it the zebra be dance a snake dance and all of they be howl as though they be in the ark hungry and the ark have land on mount ararat just then one of the assistant manager beckon to I to lead in my procession and we light the candle in we chinese lantern i do not stop to see how the animal get along with the hornet but i could not help think that if one hornet ' nest could raise such a row what would a hundred or so do when we get to go in the other tent oh if i have only die when i be young i never would have witness that sight the band play there 'll be a hot time in the old town to-night and pa 's crowd of white trash march around the big outside ring shout bryan bryan what be the matter with bryan and the audience get up on its hind leg and yell -- that be the white folk do -- and then we march around the other way and yell teddy be the stuff teddy be the stuff and the negro in the audience yell then my crowd meet pa 's crowd right by the middle ring where the elephant have form the pyramid that close they act and the japanese juggler be in the right-hand ring and a party of female tumbler with low-necked stocking be stand at attention in the left-hand ring there be no intention of have a riot but when pa yell what be the matter with bryan a negro in my crowd yell that be what be the matter with bryan and he hit pa over the head with he chinese lantern load with a warm hornet ' nest as big as a football which have take fire from the candle pa drop he lantern and begin to fight hornet and then all the white trash in pa 's bunch rush up and begin to whack my poor downtrodden negro with they chinese lantern of course my fellow could not stand still and be maul and the candle have warm we hornet ' nest so the hornet be crawl out to see what be the trouble then every negro whack a white man with a hornet ' nest and the audience fairly go wild with excitement -lrb- illustration : he hit pa over the head with he chinese lantern -rrb- the hornet get busy and go for the elephant and the japanese juggler and they stampede like they never meet a hornet before -lrb- illustration : the stampede like they never meet a hornet before -rrb- the female tumbler find hornet on they stocking and everywhere and they give a female war whoop and rush for the dress room the elephant get sting and they come down off they pyramid and go out to the menagerie tent trumpet and switch they trunk the negro and the white politician be get into a race war so the circus hand rush in and separate they and my negro find that the fetty i have they rub on themselves do not keep the hornet from sting they so they stampede then the hornet begin to go for the audience and the woman yell murder and pull down they dress to cover they shoe and the man get sting and the whole audience stampede into the open air then i meet pa and he be a sight and i never get sting once the manager try to get the band to play some tune that would soothe and hold the audience till a explanation could be make but somebody have throw a hornet ' nest under the band seat and the horn player get sting on the lip so they could not play and the band all light out for a beer garden before i realize it the show be over and a detective that detect for the show have I collar and bring I up before a meeting of the manager pa be the prosecute attorney and tell they that i do not run my politics fair 'cause i have bring in a lot of ringer the manager ask I how the hornet ' nest come to be in the chinese lantern i tell they they would have to ask the negro for how be i to know what weapon they have conceal about they person any more than pa be responsible if he politician carry revolver they say that look reasonable but they believe i know more about it than anybody but as we have to pack up the show and make the next town they would not lynch I till the next day pa get I to put cold cream on he sting and then he say hennery you be the limit chapter xxii the show do poor business in the south -- pa side track a circus car fill with creditor -- a performance give for the poor fill the treasury -- a wild west man bunco the show gee but this show have be up against it the last week we have not make a pay stand anywhere the show business be all right when you have to turn people away or let they in on standing room then you can snap you finger at fate and drink foolish water out of four-dollar bottle of fizz that have the cork train so it will pop out clear to the top of the tent and make a noise that make you think you own the earth but when you strike the southern country where the white man have not sell they cotton and the negro have not be pay for pick it the audience look like a political caucus in a off year when there be nobody with money enough to stimulate the voter when the audience be small and half the people in attendance get in on bill-sticker 's pass and you can not pay the help regularly but have to stand they off with promise you be liable to have a strike any minute the people you owe for hotel bill and horse feed and supplies follow you from one town to another threaten to attach the ticket wagon and levy on the animal it take diplomacy and unadulterated gall to run a show we be play now to get back into the northern state but we have to leave a animal of some kind in the hand of a sheriff every day which have be all right so far 'cause we have steer the sheriff on to elephant that have corn so they be no good except to eat one zebra that be make up by a painter who paint stripe on a white mule and one lion that be so old he will never sell at forced sale for enough to pay for the beef tea the sheriff will have to feed he when creditor in a town get too mad and threaten to attach thing we invite they to go along with we for a few day and get they money when we strike a pay stand and we agree to furnish they a pullman car and all they can eat that be rather tempting to country people so we have a full car load of creditor with we for a week and we give they plenty to drink so they have the time of they life but they do not get they money after go with we all through georgium they hold a indignation meeting in the car and between high ball and cheese sandwich they get sleepy and we side track they car in the wood at a station in mississippus where there be a post office see mill and a cotton gin i guess they be there yet unless mr pullman 's lose car expert have find the car and drive they out with fire extinguisher pa come pretty near be leave in that car with the creditor in mississippus he be help to entertain the guest and jolly they up to believe they would get they money when we get to memphi the next day when he notice the car have be sidetrack and he know that be the way we be go to dispose of the creditor he think some one would tell he when to get off but he be sit up with a landlady from some place in georgium that we owe a lot of money for feed the freak and she be threaten that if she do not get she money she would have the heart 's blood of some one so pa be afraid to leave for fear she would stab he but when the car stop on the siding pa take off he coat and hat and yawn and say he guess he would turn in and she let he go to he berth and he get out on the platform and just then the second section of we train come along and stop for water and pa crawl into a animal car and lay down in the straw with the sacred cow she bellow all night 'cause the sacred bull she husband have be attach for debt at vicksburg but when pa get in the car in he shirt sleeve and hump he shoulder up on account of the cold the cow think maybe she have be unnecessarily alarmed and maybe pa be she husband so she quit bellow and lay down and chew she cud till daylight then when she see that pa be another person she get mad and chase he up into the rafter of the car and he have to ride there until the train get to memphi the hand rescue pa but he get away from the creditor all right -lrb- illustration : the sacred cow chase pa up into the rafter of the car -rrb- we make a new lot of creditor at memphi and they propose to go along with we but we shake they off gee but we make a killing in memphi and do not you forget it we have handbill on all the wagon in the parade tell the people that the proceeds of the afternoon and evening performance would be give to deserving person in charity and the intention be to use the money to pay off the hand my but how the people turn out the tent be all full and we have more money than we have have in a month before and after the performance at night the mayor and some prominent citizen wait on the management and ask when and where we be go to distribute the money to the deserving person the manager appoint pa to stand off the committee pa say he have notice in walk about the city a beautiful park in the center of the town and he tell the committee that he idea be to have the deserving people gather at the park the next morning which be Sunday and wait there until the manager of the show could count the money and prepare to distribute it honestly and impartially with the advice of the local committee that seem all right and the committee notify the citizen to meet in the park at nine o'clock the next morning and receive the money the citizen have so kindly contribute to such a noble cause and they go away we show have get out of a good many tight place but we never get out of a town so quietly and unostentatiously as we get out of memphi during that early Sunday morning there be not noise enough make get we stuff to the train to wake up a policeman and before daylight the different section of the train have cross the big bridge into arkansa and be on the way to the indian territory pa and the other manager be on the platform of the last car of the last section as it pull out across the river at daylight and even that early it seem as though the whole color population of memphi be on the way to the park to secure good position so they could receive they share of the money as the train get to the middle of the river and safe into arkansa the whole management breathe a sigh of relief the boss canvasman say : it be like get money from home and pa say : it be like take money from the tin cup of a blind organ grinder and the treasurer of the show say as he put the day 's receipt in the safe in the business car : it look good to I then they all turn in to sleep the happy hour away that beautiful Sunday on the way to indian territory and oklahoma well sir you can never make I believe that money obtain dishonestly will stay by a person or do he any good and that be demonstrate in the case of we show the next day we get acquaint with a old showman who be out of luck who use to run a wild west show but get bust up and as he do not care where he go we take he with we on the train and all day Sunday he talk about he show experience and finally he say if we have any horse with we show that could run race we could make a barrel of money at guthrie where we be to make we next stand he say the indian and half breed all have indian pony that they think could beat any horse that ever wear shoe and that they would bet every cent they have on they pony and as they have just be pay they annuity by the government they have money in bale and we could get it all if we have horse that be any good and money to back they he idea be to give out that owe to some accident we could not give a afternoon performance and just get out the horse and bet the indian to a standstill and win all they money and give a free evening show as a sort of consolation to the indian well it look good to pa and he talk to the other manager and the result be when we get to guthrie we have make up we mind that as money be what we be after the easiest way be to get it by race we horse so when we get settle in guthrie and get the tent up we announce that part of the show be in a wreck down the road in arkansa and we should have to abandon the afternoon performance but in the meantime there would be a little horse racing on the side if anybody in oklahoma have any horse they think could run some well i think there be indian and pony and squaw enough before the announcement be make but in less than two hour more than a thousand pony be be bring in and we get we chariot racer and we bareback hippodrome horse and they be be lead around and admire and we all laugh at the little runt of indian pony and the indian get mad and back they pony pretty soon the race begin in the vacant lot just outside the town the old showman we have bring up from memphi be make master of ceremony 'cause he could talk choctaw and comanche and other indian jargon and thing get busy the indian would not run they pony more than a eighth of a mile or a quarter and we consent because the poor little thing do not look as though they could run a block they be so thin and sleepy pa be afraid the humane society would have we arrest for cruelty to animal all we fellow be provide with money and they flash roll of bill in the face of the indian and finally mr indian would reach down under he clothes and pull out a roll and wet he thumb and peel off big bill and before we know it we be invest a fortune in the racing game then the racing begin and the horse be send off at the drop of a hat or the firing of a pistol i be give some money to bet with the little indian 'cause pa say we want to get every dollar in the tribe for if we do not get it the indian would spend it for fire water the first race be between one of we best runner and a sleepy little spotted pony and when the hat be drop the pony make a few jump and be off like a rabbit and we horse could not see he for the dust and we horse be distance the next race result the same and all day long we never win a race and the indian take we money and put it in they pants and never smile the old showman we have befriend seem crushed -lrb- illustration : the pony be off like a rabbit -rrb- when we money be nearly all go to the confound indian and the sun be go down he go up to pa and say : uncle what do this all mean i think you horse could run pa say : damfino i never be no horse racer nohow when we money be all go and we horse be nearly dead from fatigue the manager all get together in the big tent for a consultation on finances and it be the saddest sight i ever see pa try to be cheerful and he say : well we will give the evening performance and when the indian be all in the tent we can turn out the light and turn the boy loose on they and maybe they will find some of the money in they breech clout you do not mean to rob they do you say the boss canvasman and pa say : no no far from it we will borrow it of they it be no harm to borrow from a indian just then the treasurer come in with a empty tin box he have carry the money out in and he say there would be no use of have a evening performance 'cause the indian have take they pony and squaw and money and go towards the setting sun and pa say : where be that old showman and the treasurer say : he have go with they he be they legal adviser and go down to memphi to rope we into the game chapter xxiii the circus have bad luck in indian territory -- a herd of animal turn out to graze be stampede by indian -- they go dash over the plain and the circus tent follow pick up by a cyclone no more horse racing for this circus the manager hold a meeting at guthrie oklum after we have lose we money horse racing with the indian and pa say the consensus of opinion be that we better stick to the legitimate show business and not try to work in any side line pa say he make a speech at the manager ' meeting in which he show that the business man who attend strictly to the business which he know all about would make money while the man who know about dry goods but work in a millinery store or a stock of tinware get it in the neck he would either get stick on the head milliner or buy a stock of tinware that would not hold water so a resolution be pass to the effect that hereafter no temptation could be great enough to get we show to go into anything outside of the business no matter how good it look as a get-rich-quick affair so we gather up we show and play a whole week in oklahoma and have full house all the time and make money enough to redeem we animal that have be attach by creditor we have pay up we debt and we get out of oklahoma with fly color if we have go right on to kansas we would have show sense but some cowboy from the indian territory tell pa and the other manager that if we would take the show to the indian territory we could not get car enough to haul the money away as the indian have get round-shouldered and bow-legged carry the money they have make grazing cattle and the territory be full of cowboy that have money to burn and they have not see a circus since the war well it seem a shame to go by the indian territory and allow those poor indian to break they back carry money around and so we send a carload of bill paster into the territory and bill town that would hold we about a week and we figure that we would clean up enough money to last we all a life-time i wish i do not have to write about the result 'cause we be break up so we can not look pleasant to have we picture take it be a bright beautiful Sunday morning that we arrive at muskoka and soon after daylight we have we tent pitch as we have all day Sunday to rest pa suggest that it would be a good idea to take all we animal that eat grass out on the grazing ground on the edge of the town and let they fill up on the nice blue grass that be knee-high all over the country so after breakfast we detail man to take charge of the different animal and herd they out in the tall grass it be a beautiful sight to see those rare animal gather from all over the world eat grass together in perfect peace in this new country the animal that we think would stand without hitch like the elephant be care for by they attendant but the animal that might wander from they own fireside be picket out or hold by long rope the deer the buffalo the zebra the sacred cattle the elk the yak the camel and that kind be tie with long lariat and hold by the man detail by the manager for a couple of hour the animal just gorge themselves after they have kick up they heel a spell and roll in the grass then one of the elephant get up on he hind foot and hold up two toe like boy in school hold up two finger when they want to go in swimming and the elephant start for a creek and go in the water and the whole herd follow and they spatter each other and duck and roll around just like school boy the whole population of the town whites and indian come to the bank of the river to watch the fun pa be hold he elk by a rope and one of the manager have a rope around the neck of a giraffe : the treasurer and the ticket taker be lead the zebra and everybody be busy with some kind of animal and i have a rope around a antelope and some of we man on horseback be herd the buffalo it do not seem as though anything wrong could happen the elephant would not come out of the creek so the boss canvasman go over to where there be about 500 cowboy and indian on horseback and ask they to ride into the creek and drive the elephant out where the rest of the animal be on the prairie gee but that be the greatest mistake he could have make the man on horseback do not want any better fun so they make a charge in line of battle just like sheridan 's cavalry down the bank into the creek yell and wave lariat rope and snap whip and the elephant get out of that creek in a hurry the cowboy throw lasso over the hind foot of the elephant and try to hold they and the elephant bellow and drag the cowboy and they pony right amongst the other animal and in about a minute as the boss canvasman say when he come to and they be pick the cactus thorn out of he : hell be just plumb out for noon the buffalo smell the indian and they start to stampede like they use to do when they live on the plain and all the animal follow drag the man who have hold of they rope and away we all go over a rise of ground the zebra in the lead and the elephant fetch up the rear the cowboy and indian behind yell and ki-i-ing and more than 500 indian dog bark well pa be the foolishest man in the lot 'cause he have tie the lariat rope that he hold he elk by around he belt and when the elk go over the hill pa be only hit the high place and he be yell for I to head off he elk but i be busy try to keep up with my antelope which be scared worse than any animal in the race when the antelope and i overtake the boss canvasman who be digging he heel into the ground try to hold he zebra i think it be a good time to say something pleasant so i say : this be a lovely country we be pass through but i never hear he reply 'cause just then the zebra jump over a big cactus and the boss canvasman go into it and stay there yell for a piece of ice while the zebra that be drag the treasurer and the ticket taker pass we i yell to the treasurer and tell he i should have to have my salary raise if i be expect to keep up with my antelope but he tell I where to go to get a increase of salary some place in arkansa -- maybe hot spring -lrb- illustration : dad be only hit the high place -rrb- -lrb- illustration : the boss canvasman go into a cactus -rrb- then my antelope hear the indian and cowboy come behind and he get he second wind and i never do touch the ground no more and i must have look like a buzzard sailing through the air when my antelope get up to where pa be try to keep up with he elk i tell pa he better let go he elk and get the cowboy and indian to ride around ahead of the stampede and head they off pa say he could not let go of he elk 'cause the rope be tie to he belt but for I to hit the ground somewhere ahead and let go of that jack rabbit i be chase and tell the cowboy to head off the stampede so when i light again i let go the rope and the antelope get ahead of everything and i wish i have bet on he when the cowboy and indian get up to I i deliver the message from pa and they divide and go around the flank of the stampeder and in another mile they head they off in a nice pasture and keep ride around the animal so they could not get away they soon have the whole bunch under control and we all get together to see if anybody be hurt well pa be the worst sight of all if he belt have break he never would have lose he pants 'cause more than a million cactus thorn have go through and pin they on we have to cut they off and pull out the thorn with pincers one at a time and pa yell murder for every thorn the boss canvasman be in the same fix and everybody that try to hold a animal be pin together with thorn and they have gravel up they trousers from stick they heel into the soil everybody be mad and they threaten to lynch pa when they get back to the tent for suggest let the animal out to graze we start back to town the cowboy and indian drive the animal and the zebra and giraffe kick up and act as though they have get out of school on account of the death of a dear teacher like schoolboy before we get to town a wind come up so strong that we have to walk edgewise to go against it and finally we meet the tent come out to meet we 'cause a cyclone have take it bodily and be blow it all over the prairie and when we get to town the animal in the cage that can not eat grass be have a indignation meeting and howl awful pa be the first man to get back to the lot and he ask I what i think he better do and i tell he he better get in the porcupine cage 'cause he look with the cactus thorn stick out of he like the father of all porcupine he say i think i be smart and he ask I if i be hurt any and i tell he all i could find be a stone bruise on my spine where i strike a prairie dog house well we get the animal into a livery barn and it take we almost the whole week to have the tent haul back and sew together and we have to pay the cowboy and indian more than the animal be worth to bring they back and let they into the show free the manager have a meeting and resolve to get out of the indian territory and into kansa just as quick as possible chapter xxiv pa be send to a hospital to recuperate -- the bad boy discourage other boy from run away with the circus -- he make they water the camel curry the hyena and put insect powder on the buffalo this be the first time since we start out with the circus in the spring that pa and i have not be two johnny on the spot ready for anything that the manager tell we to do oklahoma though and the indian territory have be too much for pa and they send he on to kansas city to recuperate in a hospital for a week while the show do kansa to a finish and make a triumphal entry into missourus i wonder how the show will get along without we for a week 'cause they sentence I to go along with pa so i could be handy to hold he hand when the doctor be pull cactus needle out of he hide i guess pa be willing enough to jump kansa in the night from what he tell we once he say when he be a young man he and a railroad brakeman get bust at topeka and they have a order book print and go all over kansa take order for osier willow which they warrant to grow so high in two year they would make fence for the farm that no animal or blizzard could get over or through and make shade for the house and the whole farm it be the year when the osier willow craze be on and every farmer on the plain want to transform he prairie into a forest pa say the farmer fight with each other to sign order and some pay in advance so as to get the willow cutting in a hurry well pa and the railroad man canvass kansa and sell more than forty thousand million of osier willow cutting and put in the whole winter in the spring when it be time to deliver the goods they go into the river bottom and cut a whole lot of pussy willow cutting deliver they to the farmer and get they money and go away when the pussy willow cutting die in they track or grow up just plain pussy willow that never get high enough to hide a jack rabbit the farmer of kansa load they gun and wait for pa and the brakeman to come back to kansa but they never go back the brakeman become president of a great railroad but when he have to go across the continent in he special car he dodge kansa and go across by the northern or southern route pa have so far dodge the farmer but money would not have hire he to stay with the circus and meet those farmer that they sell the willow gold brick to and yet when i bunco anybody around the show pa take I one side and tell I that honesty be the best policy and to never lie 'cause my character as a man will depend on the start i make as a boy he do not want I to go through life regret the past and be afraid of the car for fear some act of my younger day will become known and queer I i guess pa know how it be hisself well if there be one thing i be proud of it be that i have always be good when i grow up to be a man prosperous in business and belong to a church and married and have child grow up around I i can put on a innocent face and a bold front and point to my past with pride if i should go to live among stranger where nobody take the papers and the people be not on to I pa say as long as you conscience be clear and you pore open life be one glad sweet song well i do not know but if pa 's conscience be clear he must have strain it the way they do rain water to get the wiggler out or else he have use a egg to settle he conscience the way they settle coffee if he pore be open he have open they in the old way with a corkscrew but with all i have have to contend with in the way of a frightful example from pa i be not so worse how many boy of my age do you suppose could put in a season with a circus and have all the facility i have have to go wrong and come out as well as i have the way the freak just dote on I would have turn the head of most boy but when i find out that all of they from the fat woman and the bearded woman to the trapeze performer eat onion three time a day i say : nay nay hennery will camp with the animal whose smell be natural and not acquire say do you know i have save hundred of boy this summer from ruin 'cause in every town there be lot of boy who want to run away from home and go off with a circus and 'cause i belong to the show they all come to I and pa appoint I to discourage the boy and drive they away from the show i know in virginium all the boy want to run away and but for I the state would not have boy enough to grow up and shoot the negro but when i find boy who want to skip away from home i would give they a job and they would have sleep in the straw with the horse and eat at the second table after the negro have be feed if they could only shake they comfortable home and loving friend and join a travel circus well i always give such boy a job water the camel and after they have carry water from daylight till dark and have see it disappear down a camel and the camel grumble because they do not bring water faster the boy would ask I how long it look to fill up a camel anyway i would tell they that if they keep right at work the camel ought to be fill up full along in the fall the boy would reluctantly resign we camel have be the making of hundred of boy by they tank-like capacity to hold water one boy at richmond va get it on I by get a section of fire hose and hitch it to a hydrant and let the water run into a trough at the camel stand in the menagerie and before i know it the camel have fill up until they be swell four time as big as they ought to be then they lay down and could not march in the grand entree and pa send for a plumber to have the camel fix with faucet that boy be a genius and we keep he and put he into the lemonade privilege you can fill a camel with a hydrant all right but if you bring the water in pail he will beat the game i remember one boy at wilmington del who insist on go along with the show 'cause he mother make he work after school and my heart be touch 'cause i know how a boy hate to work after school so i give he a job sprinkling insect powder on the buffalo that be scratch themselves against the tent pole so much that i feel they have something alive conceal about they person that boy start in with he can of insect powder on a buffalo calf and then he fill the cow 's hair full of the powder and when he start on the bull the bull take a sniff of the powder on the cow and get it up he nose and he hold he head up kind of scare like and turn he upper lip wrong-side out and begin to paw the ground then he make a charge on that boy and toss he through the tent and i look through the hole and see the boy scratch gravel towards town if he be not run yet he be probably do chore for he mother both before and after school -lrb- illustration : the bull toss the boy through the tent -rrb- i have discourage most of the boy who want to run away and go with the show by give they a curry comb and brush and tell they they could have a permanent job curry off the hyena most boy would look sort of dubious about it but would think it be up to they to be game and they would take the curry comb and brush all right i would take they to the cage and tell they to just talk soothing to the hyena through the bar and when the hyena begin to get tame and act as though it would give they pleasure to be curry off and lay down and roll over and purr like a cat that want to be scratch and act as though they would eat out of one 's hand the boy might call I and i would have the cage open and they could go in and curry they off well it would kill you dead to see a fool boy side up to a hyena cage and try to hypnotize a hyena by kind word and a pious example say soothing word like : soo boss or o come off now and be a good fellow and see the hyena snarl and show he tooth like a anarchist that a multi-millionaire might try to tame so he would take a roll of money out of he hand without bite the hand i have have boy stand in front of a hyena cage with a curry-comb and brush all day try to get on good term with the hyena and occasionally the hyena would forget to snarl and the boy would think the animal be begin to weaken and the boy would work up closer to the cage and say : pretty pussy and hold out he hand and say : good fellow then the whole cageful of hyena would make a rush for he howl snap and scratch with they bristle up and the boy would fall backwards over a sacred cow about this time i would come along and ask the boy if he have get the hyena curry 'cause if he have i want he to curry the grave robber -- the jackal then the boy would reluctantly give up he tool and say if i want the hyena and jackal curry off i could do it myself i would tell they they would never do for the circus business 'cause faint heart never win fair hyena then they would go home and sell they mother 's copper boiler to get money to pay they way in the show gee but i have save lot of boy from a circus fate pa have a awful time in the hospital 'cause twice a day the doctor strip he and pull a mess of cactus thorn out of he and he yell and do not talk very pious the doctor tell I i must try and think of something to divert pa 's mind from he suffer so i get some telegraph blank and envelope and i have write message from the show manager twice a day the morning message would tell about the business of the day before and how they miss pa then i would add something like this : the farmer around olathe be all inquire for you or the farmer around topeka wish you be here 'cause they want to give you a reception or about 200 farmer at parson think we ought to let they in free on account of be old friend of yours the last one break pa all up the message say : many farmer from atchison be go to come with we to kansas city to confer with you on a old matter of business pa jump like a box car off the track and want the doctor to send he to a hospital at st loui and he tell the doctor the reason but they cheer he up by say that if any mob come to the hospital after he they would hide he in the pickling vat and make the mob believe he be dead that be the way it stand now but pa be not so darn happy as i have see he though i try to do all i can to keep he mind off he trouble i tell he as long as he conscience be clear he be all right but he say : but hennery that be the trouble it be not clear well let we have peace at any price -lrb- illustration : pa jump like a box car -rrb- chapter xxv pa break in the zebra and drive a six-in-hand team in the parade -- the freak have a narrow escape from drown pa be stick on the zebra i do not know what there be about a zebra unless it be the wail paper effect of he exterior decoration that should make a man leave all the other animal and cleave unto the zebra but pa have be put in he leisure time all summer break the zebra to harness and drive they single and double in the ring sunday everybody about the show know pa be go to spring some surprise on we i have try to reason pa out of he unnatural infatuation for zebra but you might as well talk to a rich old man who get stick on a chorus girl and give she all he money and have to go and live at the poor house a zebra always look to I like a joke that nature have play who but nature would ever think of lay out a plan for a zebra and painting it in stripe like a barber 's pole and yet we must admit that few human artist could paint a million zebra and get the stripe on as perfect as nature do with she eye shut the mule and the zebra be distant relative 'cause lot of mule have a few stripe on they leg but the zebra be the eldest son who be aristocratic and inherit the stuff while the mule be the younger son who never get a look in for the money but have to work for a living so it be no wonder to I that the mule kick the zebra be the dude of the family and the mule look up to he when he ought to kick he slat in and rub out he stripe with a mule shoe eraser while pa be in the hospital at kansas city he form a plan to paralyze the town by drive six zebra to a tally-ho coach in the parade and the reporter interview pa and the papers be full of it and the people be wild with excitement and everybody want to see a six-in-hand zebra team drive by alkali ike one of the greatest western stage driver that be ever hold up by road agent pa be to be alkali ike the show strike kansa city Sunday morning and the management be scare at what pa have advertise to do and they all want to call off the zebra stunt but pa say if they cut it out the people would mob the show so all day Sunday we hook up the six zebra and the hand lead they around the tent with a mule with a bell on ridden in the lead they seem to go pretty well but i could see pa 's finish when he get out on the street with that crazy team pa want all the freak to ride on the tally-ho and he have invite nine newspaper fellow to ride with he pa think the zebra team would follow the bell mule ahead like a 20-mule borax team would well Monday morning the parade start and along about the middle of the parade just ahead of the calliope be pa and he six zebra team he freak and reporter and pa handle the ribbon like a pirate the fat woman sit on the driver 's seat with pa for ballast and the rest of the freak be sandwich in between the reporter we go along all right for half a mile the circus hand walk beside the zebra to kill they if they try to jump over a house while i ride the bell mule if i have be plan the zebra business i would have pick out a level town to try it on but kansas city be all hill and ravine and go up hill the zebra ' tally-ho have to be push by a couple of elephant 'cause the zebra would not pull the load and go down hill we have to lock the wheel and slide down when we get on the main street where the crowd fill both side almost up to the team and the people begin to cheer the zebra begin to waltz and kick and try to jump over each other but the hand get they untangled and we worry along though pa be pale and look like a man smoking a cigar while sit on a open powder keg the fat woman grab pa every little while and scream that she want to get off and walk but pa tell she to hush up and try to be a man well as we be go down hill by a park near the midland hotel that confound calliope have get right up behind the tally-ho and the organist cut she loose with the tune : a life on the ocean wave every zebra jump into the air the brake footpiece escape pa 's foot and the tally-ho run on to the heel of the wheel zebra and it be all off there never be such a runaway since the day of ben hur pa have presence of mind enough to make the fat lady get down off the seat and he put he foot on she to hold she down the crowd yell and we zebra run into the cage ahead contain the behemoth of holy writ and knock off a hind wheel and every wagon ahead be either tip over or disabled the people fairly go wild think the runaway be a part of the show the giant faint from fright 'cause he always be a coward the bearded woman throw she arm around a reporter and scratch he face with she whisker while the circassian girl get she white wig catch in the branch of a tree and lose it and she be as bald as a ostrich egg pa take out the whip and larrup the zebra to put some new stripe on they -lrb- illustration : there never be such a runaway since the day of ben-hur -rrb- when we pass the camel they think they be in the race and they buckle in to keep up and the chariot horse get the best of the driver and they join in my mule keep up all right and we go down the hill on to the level ground that run to the missourus river when we get to the river the zebra turn short and tip the tally-ho over into the water and the whole bunch on the coach be flounder in the muddy water but there happen to be a sandbar under the water so nobody be drown though we have to bail out the fat woman she swallow so much of the muddy river the giant be senseless and two reporter get astride of he think it be a rail and drift ashore while pa lay on he back and float like a duck and when we get he out we find he have a life-preserver under he coat and he say he put it on because he have a hunch that those zebra would make for run water if they ever get beyond control well the crowd follow down to the river and everybody be rescue and the rest of the parade go over the route and in the afternoon the tent be so full there be thousand stand up -lrb- illustration : the zebra turn short and tip the tally-ho over into the water -rrb- when pa come into the main tent with the zebra in the grand parade around the ring the crowd give he three cheer which probably cause the management to refrain from discharge he on the spot pa be like a cat 'cause he always fall on he foot all right and he think the zebra tally-ho in the parade be the feature that cause the crowd to visit the show but he say he will never drive zebra again on account of the excitement the fat woman talk of have pa arrest for break one of she rib when he hold she down with he foot but pa say he foot do not sink into she more than a foot or so and he could not have hit a rib nohow well i be glad to be back in the show 'cause there be more go on than there be in the hospital where i put in a week while the doctor be pull the cactus pin feather out of pa that grow out on he in indian territory gee but if i have to leave the circus business and go back to school i know i should die of lonesomeness i get a chance to talk with pa at supper and ask he if he be really crazy as the hand say he be and how he like zebra anyway and he say : hennery zebra be just people they stampede just like politician and banker and business man generally and never know enough to let well enough alone the mule be the only draft animal that always pull straight and get there right side up if i be go to run a circus for easy money and a picnic i would not have any menagerie connect with it 'cause the animal make more trouble than all the rest of the show they be just like a lot of child in a reform school they do not want to work and they be just look for a chance to fight when you back be turn or to escape they do not know where they would go if they do escape but they do not want anybody over they to teach they moral though when meal time come the reform school boy and the menagerie animal eat like tramp because the food be so good and then kick because it be not better if you performer in the circus proper do not suit you can discharge they and if they be sick you can leave they in a hospital and go on with the show and forget about they until they show up in a week or two pale as ghost and weak as cat and demand back salary but you animal have to be take along and pet and when you give he medicine to save he life he will try to bite you hand off and yet you can not help get stick on the animal and a man get stick on the kind of animal that be most like he the grizzly old granger who never button the collar of he shirt and whose adam 's apple look like a hen 's head will stay by the camel hour at a time the pious church man feel at home among the sacred cattle the strong-arm holdup man will linger by the grizzly bear the prize-fighter will haunt the lion ' den the garroter will gaze lovingly at the tiger the sneak thief seem to love the hyena and the big game hunter watch the deer and elk some of we who have brain love the monkey they be so human chapter xxvi the ring be so muddy the performer have to wear rubber boot -- the freak present pa with a big heart of rose -- the show close and the bad boy start west with he pa in search of attraction for the come season well missourus be the state to teach a circus humility and we have take the thirty-third degree in the last ten day it have rain nine day and a half out of a possible ten day and the mud be something we never dream of before the wagon have be mire in the mud on the way from the train to the lot every day in the street of city big enough to have street car and electric light the city have one or two main street pave but the rest of the street be just virgin soil and you have get to swim to get to the paved street when you start away for the lot it be like washington cross the delaware and yet the people come from mile around to see the show and everybody ride a web-footed mule that can wallow in the mud they hitch the mule to fence outside the tent and while the performance be go on the mule bray in concert and drown the band pa have be wild ever since we strike missourus and no wonder 'cause everybody seem to lay everything in the way of weather on he every place we show the lot be one sea of mud and when we get the ring make they seem like a chain of lake and in gallop around the ring the horse splash mud and water clear to the reserved seat the rider of the horse have to come out in rubber hunting boot and when they get on the horse we have to pull they boot off and hold they until the act be over then the rider sit on the horse and pull the boot on and get down in the mud of the ring and bow to the audience the woman rider be the worst to wear rubber boot 'cause they fall down in the mud and spoil they dress and kick scandalous the trapeze performer have to be carry out of the dress room on stretcher and hoist up to the net 'cause they can not do stunt up on the trapeze with wet foot and we have work ourselves to death get thing in shape the confound elephant just glory in the mud and the minute they get in the ring they all lay down and roll in the mud and water so when they be ready to do they act they look like walk mud pie the freak be awful to handle the giant be the only one that can wade through and look pleasant and the fat woman would make you weary she have to be carry back and forth to the platform by half a force of hand pa have have shawl strap and coffin handle fasten to she clothes so there will be something to grab hold of to move she around i do not think that another year we will have any fat woman 'cause pa say it cost more to get this 500-pound female from one place to another than all the rest of the show he think that people who visit the show do not care much about a fat woman anyway but just guy she and ask she what kind of breakfast food she live on he think if we have three reasonably fat woman that weigh about 200 pound apiece it would give better satisfaction and they would be easier to handle but when she hear what pa say and feel that she be go to be shake next year she begin to cry and it be like turn on water in a bathtub pa have to pet she and then the bearded woman get jealous at jefferson city there come a cold wave and everything be freeze stiff and you could skate in the ring and the management decide to get to st loui and send the show to winter quarter and organize for next season so we have have a time close up for the season and send the animal to the barn on we farm up north and discharging and pay off the performer and bidding everybody good-by we have buy present for everybody and it have be a picnic pa have a big heart with rose all around it make of a horse collar cover with flower which come from the freak and the performer remember he with present and pa give everybody something and everybody get together in the main tent and make speech the manager thank everybody and promise that next year we would have the greatest show on earth he say the management have decide that what we lack this year be a wild west show as the people everywhere seem to dote on bust bronco and rope cattle and chase buffalo and see indian and rough rider chase up and down the arena he feel that in justice to we rough-riding president it be proper to have a wild west show that would make thing hum next year he say he take pleasure in inform the people of the show that pa have be commission to go out west at once and secure the indian and cowboy horse that buck and bounce off the rider cattle that would stand it to be lasso and throw down for the amusement of the public buffalo that would bellow and act like old time on the plain stage coach and robber and he promise that next year they would have no cause to be ashamed of the show he say pa be authorize to spare no expense to round up a wild west show second to none the performer and hand cheer the manager and then they yell for pa for a speech pa get up on the tub that the elephant stand on and say that it be true what the manager say about a wild west show and that he be proud of the confidence repose in he he should be glad to take a expedition and go out into the far west and beard the wild west indian in he tepee and engage indian by the hundred to come with we next year he would pierce the wilderness of the west in search of the wildest red man and would hunt the cowboy in he lair and secure those who could make the most trouble for cattle and horse and shoot up a audience if necessary to keep the peace and he would buy buffalo enough so every performer could ride one if he want to he say while we have this year have some attempt at a wild west department in we show it be only a tame imitation of what we would have next year and he want they all to pray for he that he might come out of the wild far west without be kill he say he should take hennery along with he as a mascot and if the worst come he could trade I to a indian tribe for pony or leave I as a hostage with some tribe until he return the indian at the close of next season pa close he remark by hope that nothing have occur during the past season that would cause anybody to have it in for he 'cause he have try to be impartial in he cussedness and while he feel that he have be consider a interloper in the profession at first he have find that everybody look upon he later in the season as the main guy in the show and that all have feel at liberty to give it to he in the neck on every proper occasion and he feel that he have take he medicine like a thoroughbred -lrb- illustration : i will search for the wildest of red man -rrb- they give three cheer for pa and then they bring in the blanket and toss everybody up until they lose everything out of they pocket and yell that they have enough and they wind up by toss pa up in the blanket until he could see star they be go to give the fat woman a hoist when the boss canvasman give the signal to take down the tent and all be in a hubbub for about 15 minute -lrb- illustration : they toss pa up in the blanket -rrb- when everything be down and everybody go to the train after join hand around the middle ring and singing old lang sine pa and i and the manager go to a hotel to organize we expedition to the far west in search of talent for a wild west show that shall be the greatest ever put under canvas after all have go away and only pa and i and the manager be leave it seem as we think over the incident of the past season as though there have be a earthquake and the whole show have be blot out of existence pa choke up and be go to cry and i get my throat full of something so i could not speak and the manager begin to wipe they eye and pa save the day by say : oh what be the use let 's order up some highball and when they come with a red lemonade for I pa say : well here be to the people that crowd around the ticket wagon and fight to get the first ticket when the window be open and go away after the show and say it be the greatest show ever hey rube say the manager and we drink standing and pa go out and buy ticket for cheyenne and some bead to give to the indian we shall visit in the west end of project gutenberg 's peck 's bad boy at the circus by george w peck
