scarcely need a preface but the child of the writer 's invention come to possess a place in he affection and he be reluctant to send it forth into the wide world without something in the nature of a letter of introduction ask for it a kindly and charitable reception it would be unjust to apply to this volume the test which be bring to bear upon a elaborate romance in he narrative of the adventure of verty and redbud the writer have not endeavor to mount into the region of tragedy or chronicle the detail of bloodshed on the part of hero -- but rather to find in a picturesque land and period such trait of life and manners as be calculate to afford innocent entertainment write under the beautiful autumn sky of we beloved virginium the author would ask for the work only a mind in unison with the mood of the narrative -- ask the reader to laugh if he can and above all to carry with he if possible the beautiful autumn sunshine and the glory of the mountain of the fine old border town in which many of the scene of the story be lay much might be say if it be here necessary that thoma lord fairfax baron of cameron and formerly half-owner of virginium sleep there -- that morgan the ney of the revolution after all he battle lie there too as though to show how noble and commoner lord and frontiersman monarchist and republican be equal in death -- and that the last stone of old fort loudoun build by lieutenant afterwards general washington crumble into dust there disappear like a thousand other memorial of that noble period and the giant who illustrate it : -- this and much more might be say of winchester the old heart of the border which feel every blow and pour out she blood freely in behalf of the frontier but of the land in which this old sentinel stand it be impossible to speak in term of adequate justice no word can describe the loveliness of its fair field and vainly have the present writer try to catch the spirit of those splendid picture which the valley unroll in autumn day the morning splendor and magnificent sunset -- the noble river and blue battlements forever escape he it be in the midst of these scene that he have endeavor to place a young hunter -- a child of the wood -- and to show how he wild nature be impress by the new life and advance civilization around he the process of he mental development be the chief aim of the book of the other personage of the story it be not necessary here to speak -- they will relieve the author of that trouble yet he can not refrain from ask in advance a friendly consideration for miss redbud he trust that she simplicity and innocence will gain for she the heart of all who admire those quality and that in consideration of she liking for she friend verty that these friend of she own will bestow a portion of they approbation upon the young woodman : pity he when he incur the displeasure of mr jinks : sympathise with he when he be overwhelm by the reproach of mr roundjacket and rejoice with he when in accordance with the strictest rule of poetic justice he be reward for he kindness and honesty by the possession of the two thing which he covet the most in the world richmond _ June _ 1856 the last of the forester _ if we shadow have offend think but this -lrb- and all be mend -rrb- that you have but slumber here while these vision do appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding than a dream gentle do not reprehend _ midsummer-night 's dream the last of the forester chapter i at apple orchard on a bright October morning when the last century be rapidly go down hill and all old thing begin to give way to the new the sun be shine in upon the breakfast room at apple orchard with a joyous splendor which perhaps he have never before display in tarry at that domain or any other but about apple orchard which we have introduce to the reader in a manner somewhat abrupt and unceremonious it be one of those old wooden house which dot we valley in virginium almost at every turn -- contented with they absence from the gay flash world of city and raise proudly they moss-covered roof between the branch of wide spreading oak and haughty pine and locust burden the air with perfume apple orchard have about it a indefinable air of moral happiness and domestic comfort it seem full of memory too and you would have say that innumerable wedding and christening have take place there time out of mind leave they influence on the old homestead on its very dormer-windows and porch trellis-work and clamber vine and even on the flag before the door worn by the foot of child and slow grandfather within everything be quite as old-fashioned over the mantel-piece a portrait ruffle and powdered hung in the corner a huge clock tick by the window stand a japan cabinet and more than one china ornament in deplorably grotesque taste speak of the olden time this be all we can say of the abode of mr adam summer better know as squire summer except that we may add that apple orchard be situate not very far from winchester and thus look upon the beauty of that lovely valley which poor virginium exile sigh for often far away from it in other land the sun shine for some time upon the well-ordered room wherein the breakfast-table be set forth and in whose wide country fire-place a handful of twig dispel with the flame which wrap they the cool brace air of morning then the

writing-desk that wild boy verty and the old gentleman re-enter the house smile cheerfully as be he wont chapter iv how verty think and play and dream verty take he weary way westward through the splendid autumn wood gaze with he dreamy indian expression on the variegated leaf listen to the far cry of bird and speak at time to longear and wolf he two deer hound then he head would droop -- a dim smile would glimmer upon he lip and he long curling hair would fall in disorder mass around he burnt face almost hide it from view at such moment verty dream -- the real world have disappear -- perforce of that imagination give he by heaven he enter calm and happy into the boundless universe of reverie and fancy for a time he would go along thus he arm hang down he head bent upon he breast he body swing from side to side with every movement of he shaggy little horse then he would rouse himself and perhaps fit a arrow to he bow and aim at some bird or some wild turkey disappear in the glade happy bird the arrow never leave the string verty 's hand would fall -- the bow would drop at he side -- he would fix he eye upon the autumn wood and smile he go on thus through the glade of the forest over the hill and along the bank of little stream towards the west the autumn reign in golden splendor -- and not alone in gold : in purple and azure and crimson with a wealth of slowly fall leaf which soon would pass away the poor perished glory of the fair golden year the wild goose fly south send they faint carol from the cloud -- the swamp sparrow twitter and the still copse be stir by the silent croak of some wander wild turkey or the far forest make most musical with that sound which the master of wharncliffe lodge delighted in the belling of the hart verty drink in these forest sound and the full glory of the autumn rapturously -- while he look and listen all he sadness pass away and he wild indian nature make he happy there in the heart of the wood ever and anon however the event of the morning would occur to he sweep over he upraised brow like the shadow of a cloud and dim the brightness of he dreamy smile how red the maple grow he say they be burn away -- and the dogwood poor oak i be sorry for you you be go and i think you look like king -- go that be what redbud say she be go away -- go away and a sigh issue from verty 's lip which betray the importance he attach to redbud 's departure then he head droop and he murmur -- go away poor verty it do not require any very profound acuteness to divine you condition you be one more add to the list which leander head in the old grecian fable you speech betray you wild goose they be early this year ho there good companion that you be come down and let I shoot at you ` crake crake ' that be all

whither that gentleman also bend he step we shall thus arrive at the real theater of we brief history -- we mean at the old town of winchester every body know or ought to know all about winchester it be not a borough of yesterday where the hum of commerce and the echo of the pioneer 's axe mingle together as in many of we great western city of the arabian night : -- winchester have recollection about it and hold to the past -- to its indian combat and strange experience of clash arm and border revelry and various scene of wild frontier life which live for we now only in the chronicle -- to its memory of colonel washington the noble young soldier who afterwards become as we all have hear so distinguish upon a larger field -- to thoma lord fairfax baron of cameron who come there often when the deer and the wolf of he vast possession would permit he -- and to daniel morgan who empty many fair cup on loudoun-street and one day pass with trumpet sound go to québec again on he way to debate question of importance with tarleton at the cowpen -- lastly to crush the tory rise on lose river about the time when it pleased heaven so to order thing that the large army of cornwalli should be entrap and capture at yorktown in virginium as the chronicle inform we all these man of the past have winchester look upon and many more -- on strange wild picture and on many history for you walk

not at all no lawyer in the town be nearly so popular -- none have as much business of importance entrust to they it have happen in he case as in a thousand other which every one 's experience must have furnish he neighbor have discover that he rude and surly manners conceal a powerful intellect and a excellent heart -- and even this rudeness have grow interesting from the cynical dry humor not unfrequently mingle with it a huge table litter with old dingy volume and with dusty roll of papers tie with red tape -- a tall desk with a fade and ink-bespattered covering of brown cloth -- a lofty set of pigeon hole nearly fill with document of every description -- and a set of chair and stool in every state of dilapidation : -- there be the ante-room of joseph rushton esq attorney-at-law and solicitor in chancery no window pane ever have be see so dirty as those which grace the window -- no rag-carpet so nearly resolve into its component element have ever decorate human dwelling -- and perhaps no legal den from the commencement of the world to that time have ever diffuse so unmistakeable a odor of parchment law-calf and ancient dust the apartment within the first be much smaller and here mr rushton hold he more confidential interview few person enter it however and even roundjacket would tap at the door before enter and generally content himself with thrust he head through the opening and then retire such be the lawyer 's office chapter vi in which mr roundjacket flourish he ruler roundjacket be mr rushton 's clerk -- he ancient clerk -- though the gentleman be not old the reader have hear the lawyer say as much behold mr roundjacket now with he short crisp hair he cynical yet authoritative face he tight pantaloons and he spotless shirt bosom -- seat on he tall stool

verty ride into the town and dismount at the door of the law office chapter vii in which roundjacket read he great poem three day after the event which we have just related or rather after the introduction of the reader to the three locality with which we brief history will concern itself mr roundjacket be sit on he high stool in one corner of the office prepare the papers in a friendly suit in chancery it be about ten o'clock in the morning and verty who ride home every evening have just come in and have take he seat at the desk in the corner appropriate to he beneath the small dingy window look out upon the yard longear be stretch at he foot verty 's face be more dreamy and thoughtful than ever the dim smile still dwell upon he lip and though he countenance have as much of the forest indian character as ever there be a languor about the droop eyelid with they long lash and a stoop in the usually erect neck which betray the existence in the boy 's mind of some ever-present sadness he costume be just what it have always be -- moccasin deerskin leggings a shaggy forest _ paletot _ and fringed leather gauntlet which now lay by he near he white fur hat he have not change by become a lawyer 's clerk but on the contrary grow more wild apparently from the very contrast between he forest appearance and the dingy office at time verty would stretch out he hand and take he cedar bow from a chair bend it thoughtfully and utter the low indian murmur which have be represent by the letter _ ough _ so unsuccessfully then he would allow the weapon to slide from he nerveless hand -- he head would droop -- the dim dreamy smile would light up he feature for a instant and he would lean upon the desk and ponder -- he countenance half envelop by the long tangled chestnut hair which still flow upon he shoulder in wild luxuriance tire of think at last verty sigh and take up he pen for some moment it glide slowly over the law parchment and the contortion of verty 's face betray the terrible effort necessary for he to make in copying then he eye no longer seek the paper to be transcribe -- he face light up for a moment and he pen move faster finally he rise erect and survey the sheet which he have be write upon with great interest just beneath the word messuage tenement water course and all that doth thereunto pertain verty have make a charming sketch of a wild-fowl with expand wing fall from the empyrean with a arrow through he breast for some moment the drawing afford verty much gratification : it finally however lose its interest and the boy lean he head upon he hand and gaze through the window upon the wave tree which overshadow the rear of the building then he eye slowly droop -- the dusky lash move tremulously -- the head decline -- and in five minute verty be asleep rest he forehead on he fold arm the office be disturb for the next quarter of a hour by no sound but the rapid scratch of mr roundjacket 's pen which glide over the paper at a tremendous rate and do terrible execution among plaintiff executor administrator and assign at the end of that time mr roundjacket raise he head utter a prolonged whistle and wipe he pen upon the sleeve of he old office coat which bear a striking resemblance to the gaberdine of a beggar address himself to speech -- now that be not wanted till to-morrow evening he observe confidentially to the pigeon-hole but to-morrow evening i may be pay my address to some angelic lady or be engage upon my epic i have do well it be true philosophy to ` make assurance doubly sure and to take a bond of fate ' now for a revisal of that last stanza and i think i 'll read it aloud to that young cub as rushton call he no doubt he forest character primitive and poetical will cause he to appreciate its beauty hallo verty reply by a snore what asleep cry mr roundjacket now you young sluggard do you mean to say that the atmosphere of this mansion this temple of chancery be not enliven

which verty 's design have be make and then turn to reply to the word address to he i be use my privilege to correct this youngster he reply with a flourish of he ruler apparently design to impress the shaggy head with the idea that he mr roundjacket would not permit any infringement of he rights and privilege you be be you say mr rushton yes sir reply the clerk and what do you find to correct in mr verty many thing specify with pleasure and mr roundjacket insert one thumb into the pocket of he long waistcoat point with the ruler to verty 's costume do you call that a proper dress for a lawyer 's clerk he say be the profession to be disgrace by the entrance of a bear a savage a wild boy of the wood who resemble a catamountain answer that sir look at those leggin and mr roundjacket indicate the garment which reach to verty 's knee with the end of he ruler well say mr rush ton smile i should think you might have they change without trouble I verty the boy raise he head with a smile how would you like a new suit of clothes i do not want any sir but these will not do why not sir they be too primitive you cub clothes sir be the essence of human society and a man be know by he shell if you wish to reap those numerous advantage for you mother you must be re-habited anan say verty i mean you must dress like a christian -- get new clothes verty smile you be willing i suppose yes sir very well -- that do honor to you filial affection you handsome savage roundjacket take this young man up to o'brallaghan 's to-morrow and have he measure take with pleasure say mr roundjacket who have evidently take a great liking to verty what sort of clothes mr rushton look at the subject of the conversation verty be gaze through the window and dream a smile pass over the grim feature and a sort of sigh issue from the compress lip of the lawyer three suit roundjacket say mr rushton one common another rich another as elegant as o'brallaghan can make i really believe this boy be go to amuse I a most remarkable youth observe the clerk and draw sketch with astonishing ease ah do not you young man verty turn round and interrogate mr roundjacket with a look he have evidently not hear the question there you be dream again sir say mr rushton this will never do -- come write away the idleness of this world be revolt he growl return to he sanctum and close the door with a bang roundjacket point after he with he ruler a odd fish young man he say shake he head take care not to make he you model if you want a proper model to imitate you need not go far modesty which be my weakness prevent my say more and mr roundjacket clear he throat and look dignified it be my purpose before this interruption he say after a pause of some moment to read to you some portion of a work which will probably be speak of extensively by the world and mr roundjacket pause verty also be silent all country say the poetical gentleman with a preparatory flourish of he ruler have possess locality famous in the history of literature : -- as athen in greece the island of scio where homer first see the light and stratford where shakspeare appear now sir reasoning from analogy which be the finest possible way of reasoning we must conclude that virginium have such a locality and i leave you to decide the probable situation of it it can not be williamsburg the seat of government for that place be give up to the vanity of life -- to ball and horserace meeting of the house of burgess and other variety williamsburg sir can not become famous -- it be too near the sea then there be the thrive village of richmond to which they speak of move the seat of government i suppose sir that no one assert that richmond be ever likely to produce any remarkable man mark I sir that place will never be famous -- it be too far from the sea now what be the irresistible conclusion we arrive at from a view of these incontestable fact observe mr roundjacket endeavor to catch verty 's wander eye why my young friend that winchester here be to be the celebrated locality -- that the great poet of virginium will here arise be it not plain sir anan say verty smile and rouse from he abstraction by the silence ah you be not very well accustomed to these train of reasoning i perceive sir say mr roundjacket but you will be able to comprehend my meaning i design only to say that this town will probably be mention in many book hereafter as the residence of some distinguished man of course i do not express any opinion upon that point -- _ i _ do not know who it will be but i presume he will follow the poetical call from the vicinity of the mountain those beautiful mountain will make he cheek flush sir at all time the shenandoah more noble than even the mississippus will inspire he and possibly he will turn he attention to humor -- possibly sir the proceedings in court of law may attract he attention -- justification and cognovit and certiorarus let I read you a small portion of a poem write upon those subject by a very humble poet -- be you listen mr verty verty arouse himself and smile upon mr roundjacket -- a proceeding which seem to be eminently satisfactory to that gentleman with many preparatory hem therefore the poet commence reading at the risk of bring down upon we head the anathema of antiquary in general we be compel to forbear from make any quotation from the roundjacket iliad it be not quite equal to homer and inferior in many point to both the aeniad and the dunciad -- but not on that account do the poet undervalue it he read with that deep appreciation which author in all age have bring to bear upon they own production verty preserve a profound and respectful silence which flatter the poet hugely he recite with new energy and pleasure -- become at time so enthusiastic indeed that a smother growl from the adjoining apartment bear soothing testimony to he eloquence mr roundjacket wind up with a gigantic figure in which the muse of chancery be represent as mount upon a golden car and dispense from she outstretched hand all sort of fruit and flower and blessing on humanity -- and have thus bring he noble poem to a noble termination the poet modestly smile and ready for applause roll up he manuscript and raise he eye to the countenance of he silent and admiring listener -- that listener who have be so rapt in the glowing image and sonorous couplet that he have not utter so much as a word verty be asleep chapter viii how verty shoot a white pigeon mr roundjacket 's illusion be all dissipate -- the attentive listener be a sleep listener -- he poem dreadful to think of have absolutely lull verty to slumber we may understand the mortification of the great writer the _ irritable genus _ have in he no unfit representative thus far at least he catch verty by the shoulder and shake he wake up you young savage he cry sleep when i be read to you rouse rouse or by the immortal god i 'll commit a assault and battery upon you barbarous person savage barbarian monster suddenly mr roundjacket hear a hoarse growl and something like a row of glitter steel knife attract he attention in the direction of he leg this phenomenon be cause by the opening of longear ' huge mouth -- that intelligent animal have espouse the cause of he master so rudely assault and prepare for instant battle fortunately verty wake up before the combat commence and see the hound standing in a threatening attitude he order he to lie down longear obey with great alacrity and be soon doze again then commence on the part of mr roundjacket a eloquent and animated remonstrance with verty on the impropriety of that proceeding which he have just be guilty of it be unfeeling and barbarous and unheard of the poet observe and but one thing induce he to pardon it -- the wild bring up of the young man which naturally render he incapable of appreciate a great work of art verty explain that he have be hunting throughout the precede night -- set trap and tramp over hill and through dale -- and thus he have be overcome by drowsiness he smile with great good nature upon mr roundjacket as he utter this simple excuse and so win be the careless sunshine of he countenance that honest roundjacket utter a expire grumble declare that nothing be more natural than he drowsiness in future he say he would select those season when he -- verty 's -- sens be bright and wide-awake and he beg the young man not to fear a repetition of what he might have hear -- there be fifteen more canto all of which he would read slowly and carefully explain as he go along any difficulty verty receive this announcement with great good humor and then begin trace over he paper listlessly the word redbud that word have be the key-note of he mind throughout the morning -- that be the real secret of he abstraction miss lavinium have inform he on that morning when she have dismiss he from apple orchard that redbud be go away for the purpose of be educate and that he verty would act very incorrectly if he ask any one whither redbud be go thus the boy have be render gloomy and sad -- he have wander about apple orchard never daring to ask whither the young girl have go -- and so in one of he wanderings have encounter mr rushton who indeed be seek he he have easily yield to the representation of that gentleman when he assure he that he ought to apply he mind to something in order to provide for all the want of he indian mother -- and this scheme be all the more attractive as the neighborhood of apple orchard to which he step ever wander occasion he more sadness than he have ever feel before redbud be go -- why should he go near the place again the sunshine have leave it -- he have better seek new scene and try what effect they would have therefore be it that verty have become a lawyer 's clerk and it be the recollection of these cause of sadness which have make the boy so dull and languid without redbud everything seem dim to he and he could not ask whither she have fly this be he sad predicament after receive the assurance of roundjacket 's pardon verty as we have say begin scrawl over the copy of the deed he be make the name of redbud this persevere and thoughtful occupation at last attract the attention of he companion redbud ask the poet who be redbud my young friend i should conjecture that she be a young lady from the name -- stay be there not a miss redbud summer daughter of the squire of say name verty nod a friend of yours yes sigh verty mr roundjacket smile perhaps you be make love to she he say make love ask verty what be that how cry the poet you do not mean to say you be ignorant of the nature of that divine sentiment which elevate and ennoble in so remarkable a degree -- hem -- all humanity anan say verty with a inquire look mr roundjacket return this look for some moment preserve a profound silence my young friend he say at last how old be you eighteen _ ma mere _ say who be _ mommer _ pray mother oh say the poet with some confusion the fact be you pronunciation -- but do not let we discuss that i be go to say that it be impossible for you to have reach you present period of life without make love to some lady verty look bewildered but smile mr roundjacket be astounded at find such savage ignorance in he companion -- he revolve in he mind the means of enlighten verty in vain at last he place the end of he ruler upon he waistcoat and say mysteriously : do you see I yes reply verty well sir i make love to a young woman when i be six verty look interested at twelve i have already have my heart broken three time continue mr roundjacket and now sir i make it a point to pay my address -- yes to proceed to the last word the ` will you ' namely -- once at least a year verty reply that this be very kind in mr roundjacket and then rise stretch himself and take up he bow i feel very tired he say i wish i be in the wood and verty turn he back on mr roundjacket stroll to the door and lean on he bow gaze languidly out upon the busy street he present a strange appearance there at the door of the dingy office in the middle of the busy and thriving town he seem to have be translate thither from the far forest wild by the wave of some magician 's wand so little do he appear to be a portion of the scene verty look even wilder than ever from the contrast and he long bow and rugged dress and droop hat of fur would have induce the passer-by to take he for a indian but for the curl hair and the un-indian face verty gaze up into the sky and muse -- the full sunlight of the bright October morning fall in a flood upon he wild accoutrements by gaze at the blue heaven over which pass white cloud ever-changing and of rare loveliness the forest boy forget the uncongenial scene around he the reality -- and pass perforce of he imagination into the bright realm of cloud-land be again on the hill breathe the pure air and follow the deer verty have always love the cloud he have dream of redbud often while gaze on they and now he smile and feel brighter as he look he forest instinct return and bend he bow he carelessly fit a arrow upon the leather string what should he shoot at there be a very handsome fish upon a neighbor belfry which be veer in the wind and this glittering object seem to verty a excellent mark as he be about to take aim however he quick eye catch sight of a far speck in the blue sky and he lower he bow again place one hand above he eye he raise he head and fix he penetrate gaze upon the white speck which rapidly increase in size as it draw nearer it be a bird with white wing clearly define against the azure verty select he best arrow and place it on the string wait until the air-sailer come within striking distance then draw the arrow to its head he let it fly at the bird whose ruffle breast present a excellent mark the slender shaft ascend like a flash of light into the air -- strike the bird in full flight and tumble headlong the fowl fall toward verty who with hair throw back and outstretch arm run to catch it it be a white pigeon the sharp pointed arrow have penetrate and lodge in one of its wing and it have pause in its onward career like a bark whose slender mast overladen with canvas snap in a sudden gust verty catch the pigeon and draw the arrow from its wing which be all stain with blood oh what large eye you have he say smile you be a handsome pigeon i will not kill you i will take you home and cure you wing and then if ever i again see redbud i will give you to she my pretty bird poor verty sigh and he eye droop as he think of the girl suddenly however a small scroll of yellow paper encircle the pigeon 's neck and conceal before by the ruffle plumage catch he eye paper and write on it he say why this be somebody 's pet-pigeon i have shoot and tear off the scroll verty read these word write in a delicate running-hand : _ i be miss redbud 's pigeon and fanny give I to she _ verty remain for a moment motionless -- he eye expand till they resemble two rise moon -- i be miss redbud 's pigeon then redbud be somewhere in the neighborhood of the town -- she have not go far out into the wide unknown world -- this pigeon might direct he -- verty find a thousand thought rush through he mind like so many deer in a herd jostle each other and entangle they horn surely it would not be wrong for he to embrace this chance of discover redbud 's residence -- a chance which seem to have be afford he by some unseen power why should he not keep the bird until its wing be heal and then observe the direction of its flight why not thus find the abode of one in whose society so much of he happiness consist be there any thing wrong in it -- would any one blame he these be the question which verty ask himself stand in the October sunshine and hold the wound pigeon to he breast and the conclusion be ere long reach he decide to he own perfect satisfaction that he have the full right to do as he wish and then he re-enter the office mr roundjacket be busy at some more law papers and do not observe the object which he carry verty sit down at he desk betook himself to copy have reject the sketch-ornamented sheet and by evening have do a very fair day 's work then he put on he hat place the wound pigeon in he bosom and mount he horse set forward toward the hill in three day he say you will be cure pretty pigeon and then i will let you go and it will be hard if i do not follow you flight and find out where you mistress live oh I i must see redbud -- i can not tell why but i know i must see she and verty smile and go on with a lighter heart than he have possess for many a day chapter ix hawk without a hawk verty nurse the wound pigeon with the tenderness of a woman and the skill of a physician so that on the third day as he have promise himself the bird be completely restore to health the wing have heal the eye grow bright again every movement of the graceful head and burnish neck show how impatient the air-sailer be to return to he mistress and he home _ ma mere _ say verty standing at the door of the old indian woman 's lodge i think this pretty pigeon be well now i shall carry it back and i know i shall find redbud verty it will be see have conceal nothing from he mother indeed he never conceal anything from anybody he have tell she quite simply that he want to see redbud again that they would not tell he where she be and that the pigeon would enable he to find she the old woman have smile and mutter something and that be all verty now stand with one hand on cloud 's mane in the early morning ready to set forth the pigeon be perch upon he left hand secure to verty 's arm by a ribbon tie around one of its foot this ribbon have be give he by redbud in the other hand he carry he rifle for some day disuse -- at he foot lay longear and wolf in vain plead with down-cast eye for permission to accompany he what a lovely morning say verty and look at cloud _ ma mere _ -- he seem to know it be fall then there be wolf who can not understand what i tell he about mr rushton 's not like so many dog -- see how sorry he be the gun make he so say the old woman he think my boy be go a hunting maybe i shall -- who know verty say if i see a deer upon my way good-bye to the law work and bound lightly into the saddle -- a movement which cause the pigeon to open and flutter its wing -- verty smile on the old woman place he hand on he breast and touch cloud with he heel cloud shake he head and set forward cheerfully longears gallop by he master 's side verty drink in the autumn loveliness with that delight which he always experience in the fresh pure hill with the mountain wind around he the tree seem to be grow more and more gorgeous in they coloring and the cry of wild bird be far more jubilant than ever as he go on along the narrow bridle path under the magnificent bough he countenance be brighter and more joyous and he break once or twice into a song suddenly while he be hum thus in a low tune to himself a still croak attract he attention and he stop abruptly ah he murmur that be a good big gobbler and i 'll see about he and verty cautiously dismount and with one foot raise listen for a repetition of the sound it be not long before the turkey 's call be again hear from a thick copse on he leave the young hunter turn and imprison cloud 's nostril in he nervous grasp look fixedly into that intelligent animal 's eye cloud seem to understand very well -- nod he head -- draw a long breath -- and stand like a statue verty then place he foot upon longear make a gesture with he hand and longear show himself equally docile he lay down and without move follow he master with he eye and listen verty creep noiselessly without tread on a leaf or a twig to a neighbor thicket from which the horse and dog be not visible he then lay down in the bushy top of a fall pine and without the assistance of any call such as hunter generally make use of utter the low cautious cry of the wild turkey this he repeat a number of time and then remain still for ten or fifteen minute no noise disturb the stillness of the forest all be quiet then a slight agitation of the leaf be visible at the distance of fifty or sixty yard and a magnificent gobbler make he appearance move he bright head and dart upon every side glance of curiosity and circumspection he be look for the female who have call he verty cock he rifle and utter the low croak again this seem to remove any fear which the turkey have -- he reply to it and advance toward verty 's impromptu blind a streak of sunlight through the bough fall on he burnished neck and brilliant head and he pause again verty run he eye along the barrel -- cover the turkey bashaw 's head and fire the ball pass through the fowl 's throat and he fall back with violent fluttering -- no longer anything but the memory of a living turkey very well say verty smooth the head of he pigeon which have be greatly startle by the explosion i can shoot better than that -- i ought to have hit you eye monsieur and go to the spot he take up the turkey and then return to cloud who with longear at he foot remain perfectly quiet verty tie the turkey to he saddle-bow and go on laugh he make he entry into winchester in this extremely lawyer-like guise that be to say in moccasin and leggin with a rifle in one hand a pigeon on the wrist of the other and a turkey dangle at he horse 's side cloud in order to complete the picture be shaggier than ever and verty himself have never possess so many tangled curl he shoulder be positively cover with they unfortunately winchester have no artist at the period mr roundjacket be stand at the door of the office and he greet verty with a loud laugh you young savage he say there you be look like a barbarous backwoodsman when we be try we very best to make a respectable lawyer of you verty smile and let cloud dip he muzzle into the trough of a pump which stand by the door venerable-looking and iron-handled like all parish pump what excuse have you young man say mr roundjacket the individual who arrive late at the locality of he daily exercitation will eventually become a candidate for the high and responsible position of public suspension _ anan _ say verty who be not accustom to paraphrase then turn he eye toward the pigeon he say : pretty fellow oh will you show I the way you shall -- to see redbud and verty for the first time seem to realize the fact that he could see she again he countenance become brilliant -- he eye be fill with light -- he lip wreathe with smile mr roundjacket be astounded young man he say stick he pen behind he ear i should be please to know what you be think about you be really extravagant sir -- you need the purifying and solidify influence of the law believe I -- hey what be you do there verty be gnawing off the ribbon from the pigeon 's foot tie too tightly he could not undo it and have no knife use he sharp white tooth for the purpose the pigeon sink down toward the horizon -- seem about to disappear -- verty utter a deep sigh but no : the bird suddenly pause drop from the cloud and settle upon the roof of a house crowning a grassy hill which hill be distant from verty not more than a quarter of a mile a smile of delight pass over verty 's countenance he have find redbud -- she be there there be no longer any necessity for such headlong speed -- he could go on slowly now -- the goal be near and would not fly as he approach verty draw near the house which be a tall wooden structure embower in

however -- he be at the gate with redbud oh he cry how glad i be to see you what in the world make you come here redbud and stay away from I so long redbud blush and murmur something never mind say verty i be so glad to see you that i will not quarrel and he press the little hand which he hold with such ardor that redbud blush more than ever but she have scarcely utter a word -- scarcely smile on he what do it mean poor verty 's face begin to be overcloud what do it mean that be not a very difficult question to we however much it might have puzzle verty it mean that miss lavinium have suggest to redbud the impropriety of remain on term of cordiality and friendship with a young gentleman who after the fashion of all youth in all age of the world be desperately anxious to become some young lady 's husband it mean that the lecture of this great female philosopher have produce its effect -- that miss redbud have wake to a consciousness of the fact that she be a young lady and that she demeanor toward verty be improper before she have think that there be no great impropriety in run to meet the forest boy with whom she have play for year and whom she know so very well now this be change cousin lavinium see a decide impropriety in she meeting verty with a bright smile and give he she hand and say in she frank affectionate voice : oh i be so glad to see you of course cousin

unaccountable constraint and only give he the tip of she finger when he be ready for and expect the most enthusiastic greet we must however speak of another influence which make redbud so cool -- and this will very probably have occur to we lady reader if we have any as the better explanation separation yes the separation which stimulate affection and bathe the eye in the languid dew of memory strephon be never so devoted as when chloe have be remove from he -- when he glance seek for she in vain on the well-remembered lawn and chloe too be disconsolate when she no longer see the crook of

verty until she be go from he and the fresh music of he laughter be no longer in she ear then she find that he hold a very different place in she heart from what she have suppose -- or rather to speak more accurately she do not reflect in the least upon the matter but only feel that he be not there near she and that she be not happy this will explain the prim little ladylike air of bashfulness and constraint which redbud exhibit when she eye fall on verty and the coolness with which she give he she hand the old thing have pass away -- verty could be the boy-playmate no more however much it grieve she thus reflect miss redbud and in accordance with this train of reasoning do she conduct herself upon the occasion of which we speak so to strephon 's request to be inform why she come

open the gate of the spacious and well-kept garden pass in under the apple bough as for mr jinks he accompany mr scowley to the house bow grimace amble and make himself generally agreeable true he resemble a grasshopper standing erect and go through the step of a minuet but there be much elegance in mr jinks ' evolution and unbounded elasticity of limb he enter with mr scowley and there for the present we shall leave he chapter xii how strephon talk with chloe in a arbor it be a beautiful garden which verty and redbud enter hand in hand -- one of those old pleasure-grounds which with they grass and flower and long-armed tree laden with fruit or blossom afford such a grateful retreat to the weary or the sorrowful the breath of the world come not into such place -- all its jar and tumult and turmoil faint die and disappear upon the flower-enameled threshold and the cool breath of the bright heaven fan no longer wrinkled forehead and compress lip all care pass from we in these fairy-land retreat and if we can be happy any where it be there we say that verty and redbud enter hand in hand and this may serve to show that the young pupil of miss lavinium have not profit much by the lesson of she mentor in truth redbud begin to return to she childhood which she have promise herself to forget and as a result of this change of feeling she become again the friend and playfellow of she childhood 's friend and lose sight completely of the young lady theory true she do not run on as the phrase be with verty as in the old day -- she manner have far more softness in it -- she be more quiet and reserved but still those constrain restless look be go and when verty laugh the win smile come to the little face and the small hand which he have take be suffer to rest quietly in he own they stroll under the tree and verty pick up some of the long yellow-rinded apple which lay upon the ground under the tree and offer they to redbud i do not want the apple he say smile i want to

you do he say for you be my queen and he go and sit down upon the trellised bench and begin weave a wreath of the delicate yellow autumn primrose and other flower redbud sit down and watch he place thus they present a singular contrast and together form a picture not want in a wild interest -- verty clothe in he forest costume of fur and bead he long profusely-curling hair hang upon he shoulder and he swarthy cheek round and redden with health present rather the appearance of a indian than a anglo-saxon -- a handsome wild animal rather than a pleasant young man redbud 's face and dress be in perfect contrast with all this -- she be fair with that delicate rose-color which resemble the tender flush of sunset in she cheek she hair be brush back from she forehead and secure behind with a large bow of scarlet ribbon she dress be of rich silk with hang sleeve a profusion of yellow lace and a dozen rosette affix to the dress in front set off the costume admirably and give to the young girl that pretty attractive _ toute ensemble _ which correspond with she real character as she follow verty 's movement the frank little face wear a very pleasant smile and at time she would pick up and hand to he a leaf or a bud which attention he reward with a smile in return at last the wreath be finish and rise up verty place it on redbud 's forehead how nicely it fit he say who would have imagine that my awkward finger could have do it redbud sit down with a slight color in she cheek i be very much oblige to you verty she say it be very good in you to make this for I -- though i do not deserve it indeed you do -- you be my queen : and here be the right place for I so say verty smile and lay down at the foot of redbud lean on the trellised bench and look up into that young lady 's eye you look so pretty he say after a silence of some moment so nice and pretty redbud do i say redbud smile and blush and so good oh no -- i be not not good far from it verty hum say verty i should

to shape she future demeanor toward the young man in conformity with the advice of she mentor therefore when miss redbud see verty approach clothe in he new costume and radiant with happy expectation she hastily leave the window at which she have be stand and in the depths of she chamber seek for strength and consolation let no one deride the innocent prayer of the child and say that it be folly and unworthy of she the woe of youth be not we woe and the iron mace which strike down the stalwart man fall not more heavily upon he strong shoulder than do the straw which bear to the earth the weak heart of childhood then when the man frown and clench he hand against the hostile fate press upon he the child only weep and endeavor to avoid the suffering redbud suffer no little she love verty very sincerely as the playmate of she earlier year and the confidential friend of she happiest hour the feeling which be ripen in she heart have not yet reveal itself and she feel that the barrier now raise between herself and the young man be cruel but then suddenly she would recollect miss lavinium 's word recall that warn that they both would suffer -- and so poor redbud be very unhappy -- very much confuse -- not at all like herself we have say very little of this child 's character prefer rather to let the current of we narrative reflect she pure feature from its surface as it flow on through those old border day which be illustrated and adorn by the soft music of she voice the kindness of she smile perhaps however this be a favorable occasion to lay before the reader what be write by a poor pen in after year about the child by one who have love and be render purer by she some one no matter who have say to he one day -- tell I about little redbud whom you praise so much -- and he have take he pen and write -- how can i there be some figure that can not be paint as there be some melody which can not be utter by the softest wind which ever sweep the harp of aeolus you can scarcely delineate a star and the glory of the sunset die away and live not upon canvas how difficult then the task you have impose upon I _ amigo mio _ -- to seal up in a wicker flask that moonlight chain down by word that flitting and almost imperceptible perfume -- to tell you anything about that music which embody in a material form be know as redbud observe how i linger on the threshold and strive to evade what i have promise to perform what can i say of the little friend who make so many of my hour pure sunshine she be the most graceful creature i have ever see i think and surely merrier lip and eye be never see -- eye very blue and soft -- hair golden and flow like sunset on she shoulder -- a mouth which have a charming archness in it -- and withal a innocence and modesty which make one purer these be the first trait of the child she be scarcely more which strike a stranger but she grow in beauty as you converse with she she have the most delightful voice i have ever hear -- the kindest and most tender smile and one could not long be in she company without feel that good fortune have at last throw he with one of those pure being which seem to be send down to the earth from time to time to show we poor work-a-day mortal that there be scale of existence link as it be between the inhabitant of this world and the angel : for the heavenly goodness which send into the circle which i live in such a pure ray of the dawn to verify and illumine the pathway of my life -- thanks -- thanks how beautiful and graceful she be when she run along sing she fair golden lock ripple back from she pure brow and rosy cheek i think a sunbeam come and go with she the secret of redbud 's universal popularity -- for everybody love she -- be undoubtedly that love which she feel for every one around she there be so much tenderness and kindness in she heart that it shine in she countenance and speak plainly in she eye upon the lip what a guileless innocence and softness -- in the kind frank eye what all-embracing love for god 's creature everywhere she would not tread upon a worm and i recollect to this day what a agony of tear she fall into upon one occasion when some boy kill the young of a oriole and the poor bird sit singing its soul away for grief upon the poplar redbud have a strong vein of piety in she character and this crowning grace give to she a inexpressible charm whatever man may say there be few who do not reverence and hope to find in those they love this feel the world be a hard school and man must strike alone everywhere in the struggle it be almost impossible to prevent the mind from gather those bitter experience which soil it it be so hard not to hate so tremendous a task to strangle that harsh and acrid emotion of contempt which be so apt to subdue we and make the mind the hue of what it work in ` like the dyer 's hand ' man feel the necessity of something purer than themselves on which to lean and this they find in woman with the nutriment i have speak of -- the piety of this child it do not make she grave but cheerful and nothing could be imagine more delightful than she smile and laughter sometimes it be true you might perceive upon she brow what resemble the shadow of a cloud float over the bright autumn field -- and in she eye a thoughtful dew which make they swim veil they light from you but this be seldom as i have speak of she such she be -- a bright spirit who seem to scatter around she joy and laughter gilding all the world she live in with the kindness of she smile such _ amigo mio _ be little redbud when i know she and i have speak of she as well as i could no one can be more conscious of the insufficiency of my outline than myself my only excuse be a want of that faculty of the brain which -- unite memory that be to say the heart with criticism which be the intellect -- be able to embody with the lip or the pen such figure as have appear upon the horizon of life i can only say that i never go near the child but i be make better by she sincere voice i never take she hand in my own but a nameless influence seem to enter into my heart and purify it and now _ amigo _ i have write it all and you may laugh at I for my pain but that be not a matter of very great importance farewell it be rather a anti-climax after this somewhat practical account of we little heroine to inform the reader that redbud be sit down cry such be however the fact and as conscientious historian we can not conceal it overwhelm by miss lavinium 's fatal logic she have no choice no course but one to pursue -- to avoid verty and thus ward off that prospective suffering and so with a swell heart and a heated brain we little heroine could find no better resource than tear and sob and sigh chapter xx how miss fanny slam the door in verty 's face as redbud sit thus disconsolate a footstep in the apartment attract she attention and raise she tearful eye she see she friend fanny who have run in laugh as be she wont fanny be a handsome little brunette about redbud 's age and full of merriment and glee -- perhaps _ sparkle _ would be the better word inasmuch as this young lady always seem to be upon the verge of laughter -- brim full with it and ready to overflow like a goblet of bohemian glass fill with the foam draught of eastern france if we may be permit to make so unworthy a comparison she merry black eye be now dance and she ebon curl ripple from she smooth dark brow like midnight wave oh here 's you beau reddy cry miss fanny clap she hand you pretend not to know he as he come up the hill

impulsive fanny and i feel as if i could scratch she eye out -- to make you cry but i will not any more say redbud begin afresh and i will stop too say fanny become hysterical after which solemn determination to be calm and not display any further emotion on any account the two young lady sink into each other 's arm cry until they white handkerchief be completely wet by they tear they have just manage to suppress they emotion somewhat -- preparatory to commence again doubtless -- when the door of the apartment open and a servant girl announce to miss redbud that a gentleman have come to see she and be wait for that purpose at the foot of the stair oh i can not see he say redbud threaten a new shower you shall say fanny laugh through she tear oh no no say redbud what shall i tell ` um miss say the servant oh i can not go down -- tell verty that -- she 'll be down in a minute finish fanny no no i must not you shall fanny -- come no nonsense reddy there i hear he voice -- oh I my goodness gracious these sudden and apparently remarkable exclamation may probably appear mysterious and without reason to the respected reader who do we the honor to peruse we history but they be in reality not at all extraordinary under the circumstance and be indeed just what might have be expect on the generally accept theory of cause and effect in a single word then the lively miss fanny have utter the emphatic word oh I -- my goodness gracious because she have hear upon the staircase the noise of a masculine footstep and catch sight of a masculine cocked-hat ascend -- which phenomenon argue again upon the theory of cause and effect plainly indicate that a head be under the chapeau -- the head of one of the opposite sex redbud raise she head quickly at she friend 's exclamation and discern the reason therefor she understand at a glance that verty have become impatient wait in the hall down stair -- bad hear she voice from the room above and follow he wont at apple orchard quite innocently bethought himself of save redbud the trouble of descend by ascend to she verty send he voice before he -- a laughing and jubilant voice which ask for redbud fanny jump up and run to the door just as the young man place he foot upon the landing and stand before the group verty make a low bow and greet miss fanny with one of the most fascinating smile which could possibly be imagine fanny slam the door in he face without the least hesitation for a moment verty stand motionless and bewildered vainly strive to make out what this extraordinary occurrence mean at apple orchard as we have say the door have never be slam in he face on the contrary he have range freely over the mansion amusing himself as seem best to he : take down a volume here -- open a closet there -- stroll into the squire 's room or redbud 's room where that young lady be study -- and even into the apartment of the dreadful miss lavinium where sit that solemn lady engage in the task of keep the household wardrobe stocking and what not in good condition no one have ever tell verty that there be the least impropriety in this proceeding and now when he only mean to do what he have do a thousand time before he have a door bang in he face as if he be a thief with hostile intention toward the spoon for some moment therefore as we have say the young man stand thunderstruck and motionless then consider the whole affair a joke he begin to laugh and essay to open the door in vain fanny possibly foresee this have turn the key redbud say verty sir say a voice not redbud 's however let I in i shall do nothing of the sort reply the voice why say verty with ready philosophy it be nobody but I hum say the voice again in indignant protest against the force of any such reasoning you be not redbud continue the cavalier i want to see redbud well sir -- go down and reddy may come and see you the voice reply as long as you stand there you will not lay eye on she -- if you stay a week or a year at this dreadful threat verty retreat from the door the idea of not see redbud for a year be horrible will you come down redbud if i go he ask voice hear in debate say say verty after a pause the voice which have before speak say : yes go down and wait ten minute verty heave a sigh and slowly descend to the hall again as he disappear the door open and the face of fanny be see carefully watch the enemy 's retreat then the young girl turn to redbud and clap she hand cry : do you ever -- what a impudent fellow but you promise reddy come let I fix you hair redbud sigh and assent chapter xxi in which redbud suppress she feeling and behave with decorum in ten minute as she promise fanny descend with redbud -- she arm lace around the slender waist of that young lady as be the wont with damsel -- and ready to give battle to we friend verty upon any additional provocation with even greater zest than before redbud present a singular contrast to she companion fanny smile and full of glee seem only to have become merrier and brighter for she cry -- like a April landscape after a rain redbud on the contrary be still sad and oppressed from the event of the morning and indeed could scarcely return verty 's greet without emotion resplendent in he elegant plum-colored coat -- with stocking long embroidered waistcoat and scarlet ribbon tie around he powdered hair verty come forward to meet he innamora as joyous and careless as ever and figuratively speak with open arm what be he surprise to find that no smile reply to he own redbud 's face be calm -- almost cold she repel he even when he hold out he hand and only give he the tip of she finger which for any warmth or motion in they might have be wood or marble poor verty draw back and color redbud change toward he -- no longer care for he what could this frigid manner with which she meet he mean -- why this cool and distant bow in reply to he enthusiastic greet poor verty sit down disconsolately gaze at redbud he could not understand then he glance question miss fanny who sit with a prim and demure affectation of stateliness on the opposite side of the room there be no explanation here either while verty be thus gaze silently and with grow embarrassment at the two young girl redbud with a beating heart and tremble lip play with the tassel of the sofa-cushion and study the figure of the carpet fanny come to the rescue of the expire conversation and seize forcibly upon the topic of the weather insert that useful wedge into the rapidly close crack and wait for verty to strike the first blow unfortunately verty do not hear she he be gaze at redbud fanny pout and toss she head so she be not good enough for the elegant mr verty -- she be not even worth a reply he might talk himself then verty do not embrace this tacit permission -- he remain silent and gaze on redbud whose color begin slowly to rise as with heave bosom and down-cast eye she feel the young man 's look -- he experience more and more embarrassment -- a sentiment which begin to give way to distress at last he rise and go to she side take she hand redbud slowly draw it away still without meet he gaze he ask in a low voice if she be angry with he no -- she be not very well to-day that be all and then the long lash droop still more with the heavy drop which weigh they down the cheek be cover with a deeper crimson the slender frame become still more agitate oh nothing but those word -- if you would prevent he from suffer -- could bear she through this try interview : they be enough however -- she would be strong and as she come to this determination redbud nearly sob -- the full cup very nearly run over with its freight of tear with a beseech plead glance she appeal to fanny to come to she assistance such a appeal be never in vain the free-masonry of the sex have no unworthy member fanny forget in a moment she miff with verty when she see that for some reason redbud be very nearly ready to burst into tear and wish to have the young man 's attention call away from she she no longer remember the slight to herself which have make she toss she head and vow that she would not open she lip again she come to the rescue as woman always do and with the most winning smile demand of mr verty whether he would be so kind as to do she a slight favor the young man sigh and move he head indifferently fanny do not choose to see the expression and positively beam with smile all direct like a sheaf of arrow full upon the gentleman push the point of she slipper from the skirt of she dress and say she would be exceedingly oblige to mr verty if he would fasten the ribbon which have become loose of course verty have to comply he rise sigh more than ever and cross the room kneel down to secure the rebellious ribbon no sooner have he kneel than miss fanny make a movement which attract redbud 's attention they eye meet and fanny see that she friend be almost exhaust with emotion the impulsive girl 's eye fill as she look at redbud with a smile however and with the rapidity and skill of young lady at public school she spell something upon she finger grazing as she go through the quick motion the head of verty who be bend over the slipper fanny have say in this sly way : say you be sick -- indeed you be -- you 'll cry verty rise just as she finish and miss fanny with negligent ease thank he and look out of the window verty turn again toward redbud she be stand up -- one hand rest upon the arm of the sofa from which she have rise the other place upon she heart as if to still its tumultuous beat verty 's troubled glance flee to the tender sorrowful face and ask why she have rise redbud suppress she emotion by a powerful effort say almost coldly that she feel unwell and hope he would let she go up stair indeed -lrb- with a tremble voice -rrb- she be -- not well : he must excuse she if -- if -- if he would -- come again and find she voice fail she poor redbud abruptly leave the room and run to she chamber throw herself on the bed and burst into a passion of tear she have obey miss lavinium yes with a throbbing heart eye full of tear a tenderness toward she boy-playmate she have never feel before she have preserve she calmness cry be not wrong she hope -- and that be leave she so the child cry and cry until nature exhaust herself and rest chapter xxii how miss sallianna fall in love with verty verty stand for a moment gaze at the door through which redbud have disappear unable to speak or move astonishment compassion love distress by turn fill he mind and standing there on a fine October morning the young man with the clear sunshine streaming on he joyfully take he first lesson in human distress -- a knowledge which all must acquire at some period of they life sooner or later he mixture of emotion may be easily explain he be astonish at the extraordinary change in redbud 's whole demeanor he feel deep pity for the sickness which she have plead as a excuse for leave he love and distress clasp hand in he agitate heart as he throw a backward glance over the short interview which they have just hold -- and all these feeling mingle together and struggle each for the mastery make the young man 's bosom heave he forehead cloud over and he lip shake with deep melancholy sigh utterly unable to explain the coldness which redbud have undoubtedly exhibit he could only suffer in silence then after some moment ' think the idea occur to he that miss fanny -- the smile oblige the agreeable miss fanny -- might clear up the mystery so he turn round toward she but as he do so the young girl pass by he with stately dignity and request in a cold tone to be excuse as she be go to attend to she friend miss summer sail out of the room and disappear verty look after she with deeper astonishment than before then everybody dislike he -- everybody avoid he : no doubt he have be guilty of some terrible fault toward redbud and she friend know it and would not stay in he presence what could that fault be not he costume -- not the attempt he have make to intrude upon she privacy certainly redbud never would have punish he so cruelly for such trifling thing as these concede that they be distasteful to she what then could be the meaning of all this just as he ask himself the question for the sixth time there appear at the door of the apartment no less a personage than miss sallianna who amble into the room with that portion of the head which we have more than once mention and the lackadaisical smile which be habitual with she approach verty and graciously extend she yellow hand the young man take the extended member and make a bow miss sallianna receive it with a still more gracious smile and ask mr verty to be seat he shake he head i must go away ma'am he say sadly redbud have quarrel with I and i can not stay oh what have i do to cause this and verty 's head sink upon he bosom and he lip tremble miss sallianna gaze at he with a curious smile and after a moment 's silence say : suppose you sit down for a minute mr verty and tell I all about this -- this -- highly intrinsic occurrence you could not repose you sorrow in a more sympathetic bosom than my own and subside gracefully upon the sofa miss sallianna make verty sit by she and even gently move she fan before he face smile and simper perhaps the reader may feel some surprise at the change in miss sallianna 's demeanor toward the young man the fact of whose existence she have scarcely notice on the occasion of they first meeting in the garden the explanation will be neither lengthy nor difficult miss sallianna be one of those lady who have so profound a admiration for nature beauty love and everything elevated and ennobling that they be fond of discuss these topic with the opposite sex -- exchange idea and compare opinion no doubt for the purpose of arrive at sound conclusion upon these interesting subject if in the course of these conversation the general discussion become particular and personal -- if in a word the gentleman be induce to regard the lady as a example of the beauty they be talk about in nature love etc miss sallianna do not complain and even seem somewhat pleased thereof of course there would have be no profit or entertainment in discuss these recondite subject with a savage such as verty have appear to be upon they former interview when with he long tangled hair hunter 's garb and old slouch hat he resemble a inhabitant of the backwoods -- what could such a personage know of divine philosophy or what pleasure could a lady take in he society -- no pleasure evidently but now that be all change the young gentleman now present a civilized appearance he be plainly become more cultivate and he education miss sallianna argue should not be neglect by he lady acquaintance who wonder at such reasoning be this the only instance which have ever be know do sentimental lady of a uncertain age always refuse to take charge of the grow heart of innocent and handsome youth just become initiate in the mystery of the tender passion or do they not most willingly assume the onerous duty of direct the _ naive _ instinct of such youthful cavalier into proper channel and toward worthy object -- even occasionally from they elevated regard present themselves as the say worthy object for the youthful affection queenly and most lovely dame of uncertain age and tender instinct it be not the present chronicler who will so far forget he reputation for gallantry as to assert that i should like to marry be you favorite madrigal therefore let it be distinctly understand and remember as a thing necessary and indispensable to the true comprehension of this veracious history that the beautiful miss sallianna be not attract by verty 's handsome dress he fashionable coat roset shoe well powdered hair or embroidered waistcoat gently rub against the spotless frill -- that these thing do not enter into she mind when she resolve to attach the young man to she suit and turn he affection and esteem toward herself by no means -- she see in he only a handsome young fellow whose education could not prosper under the supervision of such a mere child as redbud and thus she find herself call upon to superintend it in she proper person and for that purpose now design to commence initiate the youthful cavalier into the science of the heart without delay these few word may probably serve to explain the unusual favor with which miss sallianna seem to regard verty -- the _ empressement _ with which she gently fan he agitate brow -- the fascinating smile which she throw upon he a smile which seem to say come confide you sorrow to a sympathizing heart verty preoccupy with he sad reflection for some moment remain silent miss sallianna break the pause by say -- you seem to be annoy by something mr verty need i repeat that in I you will find a friend of philosophic partiality and undue influence to repose you confidential secret in verty sigh oh that be a bad sign say the lady simper what ma'am ask verty raise he head that sigh i do not feel very well in the body or the mind i suppose it be the mind ma'am do not call I ma'am -- i be not so much you senior true the various experience i have extract from the circumambient universe render I somewhat more thoughtful but my heart be very young say miss sallianna simpering and slaying verty with she eye yes ma'am -- i mean miss sallianna he say ah that be better now let we converse about nature my friend -- if you could tell I why redbud have -- verty stop he have a undeveloped idea that the subject of nature and redbud might not appear to have any connection with each other in the mind of miss sallianna but that lady smile about redbud she ask with a languish glance yes -- miss what of the dear child -- have you fall out you man must not mind the folly of such child -- and reddy be a mere child i should not think she could appreciate you verty be silent he do not know exactly what _ appreciate _ mean which may serve as a further proof of what we have say above in relation to the necessity which miss sallianna feel she labor under as a tender-hearted woman to educate verty the lady seem to understand from she companion 's countenance that he do not exactly comprehend the signification of she word but as this have occur on other occasion and with other person she feel no surprise at the circumstance attribute it as be natural to she own extreme cultivation and philological proficiency she therefore smile and still gently agitate the fan before verty repeat : have you and redbud fall out yes say the young man concern what i do not know -- i mean redbud have quarrel with I indeed verty reply with a sigh come say miss sallianna make a confidant of I and confide you feeling to a heart which beat responsive to you own with which word the lady ogle verty chapter xxiii the result verty look at miss sallianna and sigh more deeply than he have ever sigh before the lady 's face be full of the tenderest interest it seem to say that with its possessor all secret be sacred and that nothing but the purest friendship and a desire to serve unhappy personage influence she who wonder therefore that verty begin to think that it would be a vast relief to he to have a confidant -- that he inexperience need advice and counsel -- that the lady who now offer to guide he through the maze in which he be confound and lose know all about the labyrinth and from the close association with the object of he love could adapt she counsel to the peculiar circumstance better than any one else in the wide world besides verty be a lover and when do lover yet fail to experience the most vehement desire to pour into the bosom of some sympathize friend -- of either sex -- the story of he feeling and he hope it be no answer to this that in the present instance the lover be almost ignorant of the fact that he love and have no well-defined hope of any description that be nothing to you true corydon not in the least will he not discourse with rise and kindle eloquence upon everything connect with he philli will not the ribbon on she bodice and the lace around she neck become the most important and delightful object of discursive commentary -- the very fluttering rosette which burn upon she little instep and the pearl which glitter in she powdered hair be of more interest than the fall of throne so corydon the lover dream and dream -- and if you approach he in the forest-glade he sigh and talk to you till evening redden in the west about philli only philli and as the old arcady live still and do at the time of we history so corydon be ready to illustrate it and we young friend verty feel the old pastoral desire to talk about he shepherdess and embrace miss sallianna 's invitation to confide he sorrow to she respective bosom come now my dear mr verty repeat that lady tell I what all this mean -- be you in love can it be -- not with reddy yes ma'am i believe i be say verty yield to he love oh i know i be i would die for she whenever she want I to -- indeed i would hum say miss sallianna you know she be so beautiful and good -- she be the best and dearest girl that ever live and i be so happy before she treat I coldly this morning i 'll never be happy any more can not you banish she false image false she be as true as the star oh redbud be not false she be too good and kind miss sallianna shake she head you have too high a opinion of the sex at large i fear mr verty she say some of they be very inconstant you have better not trust redbud not trust she be careful i mean how can i cry verty easily be careful i do not know what you mean miss sallianna but i suppose what you say be for my good oh yes indeed but i can not keep still and watch and listen and spy out about anybody i love so much as redbud -- for i be certain now that i love she oh no i must trust she -- trust she in everything why should i not i have know she miss sallianna for year and year -- we be bring up together and we have go hand in hand through the wood gather flower and down by the run to play and she have show I how to read and write and she give I a bible and everything which i recollect have something in it about redbud -- only redbud -- so beautiful and kind and good oh miss sallianna how could i be careful and watch and think redbud 's smile be not here i could not -- i would rather die and verty 's head sink upon he hand which cover the ingenuous blush of boyhood and first love in this advanced age of the world we can pity and laugh at this romantic nonsense -- let we be thankful miss sallianna listen with great equanimity to this outburst and smile and gently fan verty say when he have cease speaking : do not agitate yourself my dear friend i suspect this you misunderstand my paternal counsel in suggest to you a suspicionative exemplification of dear little reddy darling child she be very good but remember that we can not always control we feeling verty raise he head inquiringly you do not understand no ma'am he say i mean miss -- no matter -- you 'll get into the habit say the lady with a languish smile i mean to observe my dear friend that reddy might be very good and i suppose she be -- and she might have have a great and instructive affection for you at one period but you know we can not control we sentiment and reddy have probably fancy herself in love with somebody else verty start and half rise in love with somebody else he cry yes say the lady smile oh no no murmur the young man fall again into he seat miss sallianna nod mind now -- i do not assert it she say i only say that these child -- i mean young girl at reddy 's age -- be very apt to take fancy and then they get tire of the youth they have know well and will hardly speak to they human nature be of derisive and touching interest mr verty sigh the lady you must not expect to find reddy a exception she be not perfect oh yes she be murmured poor verty thinking of redbud 's dreadful change and yet battle for she to the last with the loyal extravagance of a true lover she would not -- she could not -- deceive I i do not say she would but -- i know what you be about to observe sir but remember that the heart be not in we power entirely -- here miss sallianna sigh and throw a languish glance upon verty no doubt reddy love you indeed at the risk of deem to flatter you mr verty -- though i never flatter -- i must say that it would have be very extraordinary if reddy have _ not _ fall in love with you as you be so smart and handsome recollect this be not flattery i be go on to say that reddy _ must _ have love you but that do not show that she love you now we can not compress we sentiment and diana mr verty the god of love throw he dart when we be not look -- ah which last word of miss sallianna 's speech represent a sigh she utter as after the manner of diana she dart a fatal arrow from she eye at verty it do not slay he however and he only murmur wofully do you mean reddy have change then ma'am oh what will become of I -- what shall i do miss sallianna throw a glance so much more languish than the former upon she companion that have he heart not be wrap in redbud it certainly would have be pierce follow she example simpered miss sallianna look down with blush cheek and pick at she fan with a air of girlish innocence could you not do as she have do -- and -- choose -- another object yourself and miss sallianna raise she eye bashfully to verty 's face then cast they with maidenly modesty upon the carpet no ma'am say verty thoughtfully and quite ignorant of the deadly attack design by the fair lady upon he heart -- i do not think i could change in these simple word the honest verty answer all why not simper the lady because i do not think redbud be in love with anybody else he say i know she be not why then have she treat you so badly say miss sallianna gradually forget she bashfulness and reassume she languish air and manner -- there must be some laborious circumstance mr verty verty press he head with he hand and be silent all at once a brighter light illumine the fair lady 's face and she address herself to speak first utter a modest cough -- suppose i suggest a plan of find out sir she say we might find easily oh ma'am how will you follow my advice yes ma'am -- of course i mean if it be right excuse I i do not mean -- what be you advice ma'am stammer verty the lady smile and do not seem at all offend at verty 's qualification it may appear singular to you at first miss sallianna say but my advice be that you appear to make love -- to pay attention to -- somebody else for a short time attention ma'am seem to like some other lady better than redbud oh but that would not be right why because i do not miss sallianna smile i do not want you to change at all mr verty she say only to take this _ modus addendus _ which be the greek for _ way _ -- to take this way to find out i would not advise it of course if it be wrong and it be the best thing you could do indeed verty strongly combate this plan but be meet at every turn by miss sallianna with ready logic and the result as be almost always the case when man have the temerity to argue with lady be a total defeat verty be convinced or _ talk obtuse _ upon the subject and with many misgiving acquiesce in miss sallianna 's plan that lady then go on in a sly and careful manner -- possibly _ diplomatic _ would be the polite word -- to suggest herself as the most proper object of verty 's experiment he might make love to she if he wish -- she would not be offend he might even kiss she hand and kneel to she and perform any other gallant ceremony he fancy -- she would make allowance and not become angry if he even proceed so far as to write she billet-doux and ask she hand in a matrimonial point of view miss sallianna wind up by say that it would be a affair of rare and opprobrious interest and as a comedy would be positively deleterious which be probably a _ lapsus lingua _ for delicious so when verty rise to take he departure he be a captive to miss sallianna 's bow and spear or more accurately to she fan and tongue : and have promise to come on the very next day after school hour and commence the amusing trial of reddy 's affection the lady tap he with she fan smile languidly and roll up she eye -- verty bow and take he leave of she he mount cloud and call longear take he way sadly toward town could he not look back and see those tender eye follow he from the lattice of redbud 's room -- and blessing he chapter xxiv of the effect of verty 's violin-playing upon mr rushton the young man have just reach the foot of the hill upon which the bower of nature stand -- have we not mention before the name which miss sallianna have bestow upon the seminary -- when he hear himself accost by a laughing and careless voice and raise he head to see from whom it proceed the voice apparently issue from a gentleman who have draw rein in the middle of the road and be gaze at he with great good humor and freedom verty return this gaze and the result of he inspection be that the new-comer be a total stranger to he he be a young man of about nineteen with handsome feature characterize by a

much more profound than any which have yet issue from he lip go slowly on toward the town -- he shoulder droop he arm hang down he eye intently engage in stare vacancy out of countenance if we be ask how it happen that the merry joyous verty whose face be before all sunshine now resemble nobody so much as some young and handsome don quixote reflect on the obduracy of he toboso dulcinea we can only reply that verty be in love and have not prosper lately -- that be to say on that particular day in he suit and in consequence feel as if the world no longer hold any more joy or light for he forever with that bad taste which characterize the victim of this delusion he could not consent to supply the place of the choose object of he love with any other image and even regard the classic and romantic miss sallianna as wholly unworthy to supplant redbud in he affection youth be proverbially unreasonable and fastidious on these subject and verty with the true folly of a young man could not discern in miss sallianna those thousand grace and attraction linguistic philosophical historical and scientific which make she so far superior to the child with whom he have play and commit the folly of fall in love with so he go along sigh with he arm hang down as we have say and he shoulder droop and in this melancholy guise reach the office of judge rushton he find mr roundjacket still drive away with he pen only stop at interval to flourish he ruler or to cast a affectionate glance upon the m of he great poem which gracefully tie with red tape arrange in a magnificent bow lay by he on the desk on verty 's entrance the poet raise he head and look at he curiously well my fine fellow he say what luck in you woo you look as wo-begone as the individual who draw priam 's curtain at the dead of night come my young savage why be you so sad verty sit down murmur something speak out say mr roundjacket wipe he pen i be not very sad verty reply look perfectly disconsolate -- what make you think so mr roundjacket you physiognomy my young friend be you happy with such a face as that ' such a face yes i tell you that you look as if you have just part with all you hope -- as if some

longear who have stretch himself at he master 's foot and now lay gaze at he verty open the record he have be copy and begin to write roundjacket look at he for a moment in silence and then with a expression of affection and pity which make he grotesque face absolutely handsome muttered something to himself and follow verty 's example when roundjacket commence write he do so with the regularity and accuracy of a machine which be set in motion by the turning of a crank and go on until it be stop this be the case on the present occasion and verty seem as earnestly engage in he own particular task but appearance be deceptive -- indian nature will not take the curb like anglo-saxon -- and a glance over verty 's shoulder will reveal the species of occupation which he become engage in after finish ten line of the law paper he be trace with melancholy interest a picture upon the sheet beneath he pen and this be a lovely little design of a young girl with smile lip kind tender eye and cheek which be round and beautiful with mirth with a stroke of the pen verty add the wave hair brush back _ a la pompadour _ the foam of lace around the neck and the golden drop in the little ear redbud look at you from the paper with she modest eye and smile -- and for a moment verty gaze at the creation of he pencil sigh mournfully then with a deeper sigh than before he draw beneath this another sketch -- the same head but very different the eye now be cold and half close -- the lip be close together and seem almost disdainful -- and as the gentle bend forward in the first design be full of pleasant _ abandon _ and graceful kindness so the head in the present sketch have that erect and frigid carriage which indicate displeasure verty cover he eye with he hand and lean down upon the desk be silent and motionless except that a stifled sigh would at time issue from he lip a sad heaving of he breast indicate the nature of he thought longear rise and come to he master wag he tail and ask with he mute but intelligent glance what have happen verty feel the dog lick he hand and rise from he recumbent posture yes yes longear he murmur i can not help show it -- even you know that i be not happy and with listless hand he take up the old violin which lay upon he desk and touch the string the sound die away in tremble wave -- roundjacket continue write verty without appear to be conscious of what he be do take the bow of the violin and place the instrument upon he shoulder lean he ear down to it and draw the hair over the string a long sad monotone float through the room roundjacket write on verty with he eye fix on vacancy he lip sorrowfully listless he frame droop more and more begin to play a low sad air which sound like a sigh roundjacket raise he head and look at the musician verty lean more and more upon he instrument listen to it as to some one speak to he he eye close he bosom heave he under lip compress sorrowfully as he dream roundjacket be just about to call upon verty to cease he savage and outrageous conduct or mr rushton who be in the other room would soon issue forth and revenge such a dreadful violation of law office propriety when the door of that gentleman 's sanctum open and he appear upon the threshold but far from bear any resemblance to the picture of the poet 's imagination -- instead of stand mute with rage and annihilate the musician with a horrible scowl from beneath he shaggy and frown brow mr rushton present a perfect picture of softness and emotion he head bend forward he eye half close and fill with a imperceptible mist he whole manner quiet and sad and subdue he seem to hang upon the long-drawn sighing of the violin and take a mournful pleasure in its utterance verty 's hand pass more and more slowly backward and forward -- the music become still more affect and pass from thoughtfulness to sadness and from sadness to passionate regret it die away in a wail he feel a hand upon he shoulder and turn round mr rushton with moist eye and tremble lip be gaze at he do not play that any more young man he say in a low tone it distress I distress you sir say verty yes what ` lullaby ' yes mutter the lawyer verty 's sad eye inquire the meaning of so singular a fact but mr rushton do not indulge this curiosity enough he say with more calmness as he turn away it be not proper for you to play the violin here in business hour but above all never again play that music -- i can not endure the memory it arouse -- enough and retire slowly mr rushton disappear close the door of he room behind he verty follow he with he eye until he be no longer visible then turn toward mr roundjacket for a explanation that gentleman seem to understand this mute interrogation but only shake he head therefore verty return to he work sadly lay aside the two sketch of redbud and select another sheet to copy the record upon by the time he have finish one page mr roundjacket rise from he desk stretch himself and announce that office hour be over and he would seek he surburban cottage where this gentleman live in bachelor misery verty say he be tire too and before long have tell mr roundjacket good-bye and mount cloud with longear at he side soberly walk in imitation of the horse verty go along toward he home in the hill gaze upon the golden west and think still of redbud chapter xxv a young gentleman just from william and mary college instead of follow verty who like most lover be very far from be a amusing personage let we go back and accompany mr ralph ashley on he way to the bower of nature where we young friend fanny await he and if these scene and character also fail to entertain we we may at least be sure that they be from the book of human nature -- a volume whose lightest chapter and most frivolous illustration be not beneath the attention of the wisest if this be not true the present chronicler would never be guilty of the folly of expend he time and ink upon such detail as go to make up this true history it would be lose labor be not the flower and the blade of grass the very thistle down upon the breeze each and all as wonderful as the grand forest of the splendid tropics what character or human deed be too small or trivial for study never do a great writer utter truer philosophy than when he say : say not ' a small event ' why ` small ' cost it more pain than this ye call a ` great event ' shall come to pass than that untwine I from the mass of deed which make up life one deed power shall fall short in or exceed and now after this philosophical dissertation upon human life and action we may proceed to narrate the visit of mr ralph ashley graduate of williamsburg and cousin of miss fanny to the bower of nature and its inmate fanny be at the door when he dismount and await the young gentleman with some blush and a large amount of laughter this laughter be probably direct toward the somewhat dandified costume of the young gentleman and he be not long leave in the dark upon this point how d'ye do my dearest fanny say mr ralph ashley hasten forward and hold out he arm let we embrace humph say fanny indeed you sha not sha not what -- kiss you yes sir : you shall do nothing of the sort wrong -- here go and before miss fanny could make she retreat ralph ashley esq catch that young lady in he arm and impress a salute upon she lip so remarkably enthusiastic that it resemble the discharge of a pistol perhaps we be wrong in say that it be imprint on he cousin 's lip inasmuch as miss fanny though incapacitate from release herself could still turn she head and she always maintain that nothing but she cheek suffer on this point we can not be sure and therefore leave the question undecided of one fact however there can be no doubt -- namely that mr ralph ashley receive almost immediately a vigorous salute of another description upon the cheek from miss fanny 's open hand -- a salute which cause he face to assume the most girlish bloom and he eye to suddenly fill with tear by jove you have get a arm say the cavalier admiringly come my charming child -- why do you treat I so cruelly why do you kiss I impudence that be just what young lady always say reply she cavalier philosophically whatever they like they be sure to call impudent like yes like do you pretend to say that you be not compliment by a salute from such a elegant gentleman as myself oh of course say miss fanny satirically then the element of natural affection -- of consanguinity -- have its due weight no doubt my dearest i be you cousin what of that man everything do not you know that in this reputable province call virginia blood go a great way cousin be invariably favorite you be very much mistaken sir say fanny there it be -- you girl always deny it and always believe it say mr ralph philosophically now you would die for I die indeed would ` nt you fiddlestick that be a impressive observation and there be no doubt about you meaning though the original signification the philological origin of the phrase be somewhat cloudy you will not expire for I then no then live for I delight of my existence say mr ralph ashley with a languish glance and clasp he hand romantically as he speak live for one whose heart be wrap in thee miss fanny 's sense of the ludicrous be strong and this pathetic appeal cause she to burst into laughter more ridiculous than ever as i live she cry though i think that be impossible do you yes mr ashley gently twine a lock around he finger and assume a foppish air reply : i do not know whether you think it impossible for I to become more ridiculous but you can not help confess my own fanny that you doubt whether i could grow more fascinating fanny 's lip curl oh yes she say come -- do not deny what be perfectly plain -- it will not do deny -- that you be desperately in love with I and that i be you sweetheart as the child say and mr ralph gently caress the downy covering of he chin and smile what a conceited thing you be say fanny laughing you be outrageous and have utter this opinion miss fanny 's eye suddenly fall and she merry cheek color the truth be simply that ralph have be a frank good-humored gallant boy and the neighbor _ have _ say that he be fanny 's sweetheart and the remembrance of this former imputation now embarrass the nearly-grown-up young lady no one could remain embarrassed in mr ralph 's society long however there be so much careless ease in he demeanor that it be contagious and so fanny in a moment have regain all she self-possession and return the languish glance of she admirer with she habitual expression of satirical humor yes perfectly outrageous she say and college have positively ruin you -- you can not deny it ruin I wholly on the contrary it have greatly improve I my dearest and ralph sit down on the trellised portico stretch out he elegant rosetted shoe and laugh i be not you dearest say fanny that be not my name you be mistaken but come sit by I : i be just in the mood to talk no i do not think i will pray do no say fanny shake she head coquettishly i 'll stand while you lordship discourse you positively sha not and with these word the young man grasp miss fanny 's long streaming hair-ribbon and gently draw it toward he laugh fanny cry out ralph laugh more than ever there be but one alternative leave for the young girl she must either see she elegantly bind up raven lock deprive of they confine ribbon and so fall in wild disorder or she must obey the command of the enemy and sit quietly beside he true there be the third course of become angry and raise she head with dignified hauteur but this course have its objection -- it would not do to quarrel with she cousin and former playmate immediately upon he return and again the movement of the head which we have indicate would have be attend by consequence exceedingly disastrous therefore as ralph continue to draw toward he gently the scarlet ribbon with many smile and admire glance miss fanny gradually approach the seat and finally sit down there sir she say pouting i hope you be satisfied perfectly the fact be my sweet fanny i never be anything else _ but _ satisfy with _ you _ i always be fascinate with you that be one of the thing which you be teach at college i suppose what make pretty speech no they do not teach that by jove nothing but wretched latin greek and mathematics -- thing evidently of far less importance than the art you mention oh of course and the reason be plain a gentleman never use the one after he leave college and lay they by with the crabbed book that teach they while the art of compliment be always useful and agreeable -- especially agreeable to young lady of you exceedingly juvenile age -- be ' t not very agreeable i know it be and when a woman descend to it and flatter a man -- ah my dear fanny there be no hope for he i be a melancholy instance you laugh fanny who have regain she good-humor yes you know williamsburg have many other thing to recommend it besides the college what thing pretty girl oh indeed yes and i assure you i do not neglect the opportunity of prosecute my favorite study -- the female character do not interrupt I -- you character be no longer a study to I i be very glad sir i make you out long ago -- like the rest of you sex you be of course very nearly angelic but still have you fault thank you sir all true -- but about williamsburg -- i be i say a melancholy sample of the effect produce by a kind and friendly speech from a lady observe that the say speech be perfectly commonplace and spring i be sure from the speaker 's general amiability and yet what must i do but go and fall in love with she oh from fanny yes -- true as truth itself and as a consequence my friend for the first and only time have a good joke against I they have a tale about my go to he excellency the governor 's palace to look at the great map there -- all for the purpose of find where the country be in which she live for observe she be only on a visit to williamsburg -- of study out this boundary and that -- this river to cross and that place to stop at -- the time it would take to carry my affection over they -- and all the thousand detail of course this be not true my darling fanny at least -- ralph you shall stop talk to I like a child exclaim fanny who have listen to the detail of mr ashley 's passion with more and more constraint please to remember that i be not a baby sir ralph look at the lovely face with its rosy-cheek and flash eye and burst out laugh there you be as angry as cleopatra when the slave bring she bad news -- and by jove fanny you be twice as lovely really you have improve wonderfully you eye at this moment be as brilliant as fire -- you lip like carnation -- and you face like sunlit gold recollect i be a poet i be positively rejoice at the good luck which make I bring such a lovely expression into you fair countenance fanny turn she head away come now fanny say ralph seriously i do believe you be go to find fault with my nonsense no reply mr ralph ashley heave a sigh and be silent you treat I like a child say fanny reproachfully i be not a child you certainly be not my dearest fanny -- you be a charming young lady -- the most delicious of you sex and mr ralph ashley accompany these word with a glance so ludicrously languish that fanny unable to command herself burst into laughter and the quarrel be all make up if quarrel it indeed have be you _ be _ a child in old time say mr ashley throw he foot elegantly over he knee and i recollect have a perfect genius for blindman 's - buff but of course at sixteen you have ` put away ' all those infantile or ` childish thing ' -- though i be sincerely rejoice to see that you have not ` become a man ' fanny laugh i wish i be she say what why a man oh you be very well as you be -- though if you be a ` youth ' i be sure fanny dear i should be desperately fond of you quite likely oh nothing truer and everybody would say ` see the handsome friend ' come now would ` nt we make a lovely couple lovely suppose we try it try what be a couple fanny suddenly catch from the laughing eye the young man 's meaning and begin to color i see you understand my own fanny observe mr ralph and i expect nothing less from a young lady of you quickness what say you it be not necessary for I to say that i be desperately in love with you oh not at all necessary reply fanny satirically but with a blush i see you doubt it oh not at all which mean as usual with young lady that you do not believe a word of it well only try I what proof will you have fanny laugh with the same expression of constraint which we have before observe and say : you have not look upon the map of virginium yet for my ` boundary ' ralph receive the hit full in the front by jove fanny he exclaim i ought not to have tell you that i be glad you do why because of course i shall not make any effort to please you -- you be already ` engage ' engage well you be wrong neither my heart nor my hand be engage ah dear fanny you do not know how we poor student carry away with we to college some consuming passion which we feed and nurture -- how we toast the dulcinea at oyster party and like corydon sigh over she miniature i have yours my -- miniature say the lively fanny with a roseate blush you have nothing of the sort you likeness then equally untrue -- where be it here say mr ralph ashley lay he hand upon he heart and ogle miss fanny with terrible expression ah fanny darling do not believe that story i relate about myself -- never have any one make any impression on I -- for my heart -- my love -- my thought -- have always -- suddenly the speaker become silent and rise to he foot make a courteous and graceful bow a young lady have just appear at the door chapter xxvi the necklace this be redbud the poor girl present a great contrast to the lively fanny who with sparkling eye and merry lip and rosy sunset cheek afford a excellent idea of the joyous maium as she trip on gather she lovely flower poor redbud she head be hang down she eye wander sadly and thoughtfully toward the distant autumn horizon and the tender lip wear that expression of soft languor which be so sad a spectacle in the young at mr ralph ashley 's bow she raise she head quickly and she startled look show plainly she have not be conscious of the presence of fanny or the young man on the portico redbud return the profound bow of fanny 's cavalier with a delightful little curtsey and would have retire into the house again but this miss fanny for reason best know to herself be determine to prevent -- reason which a close observer might have possibly guess after look at she blushing cheek and timid uneasy eye for everybody know that if there be anything more distasteful and embarrassing to very young lady than a failure on the part of gallant to recognize they claim to attention that other more embarrassing circumstance be a too large _ quantum _ of the please incense it be not the present writer however who will go so far as to say that they usual habit of run _ away _ from the admirer should be take as in other feminine maneuver by contrary so fanny duly introduce mr ralph ashley to miss redbud summer and then with a little masonic movement of the head add with perfect ease : suppose we all take a walk in the garden -- it be a very pretty evening this proposition be enthusiastically second by mr ralph ashley who have regain he laughing ease again -- and though redbud would fain have be excuse she be oblige to yield and so in ten minute they be promenade up and down the old garden engage in pleasant conversation -- which conversation have however nothing to do with this veracious history just as they arrive in one of they perambulatory excursion around the walk at a small gate which open on the hill-side they discover approach they a worthy of the pedlar description who carry on he broad german shoulder a large pack which as the pedlar jog along make pretence continually of a intention to dive forward over he head but always without carry this intention into execution the travel merchant seem to be at the moment a victim to that species of low spirit which attack all he class when trade be dull and no sooner have he descry the youthful group than he face light up with anticipated business he come to the gate at which they stand and duck he head unsling the pack and without further ceremony open it a tempting array of stuff and ribbon pencil pinchbeck jewel and thimble scissors and knife immediately become visible with many other thing which it be not necessary for we to specify the pedlar call attention to they by point admiringly at each and recommend they by mutter broken english over they with that propensity of young lady to handle and examine all article which concern themselves with personal adornment fanny and redbud though they really want nothing turn over everything in the pack but little result therefrom for the pedlar he do not succeed in persuade redbud to buy a beautiful dress pattern with dahlia and hollyhock in they natural size and color and be equally unsuccessful with fanny who obstinately decline to reduce into she possession a lovely lace cap such as we dear old grandmama ' portrait show we -- though this description may be incorrect as fanny always say that the article in question be a night-cap disappointed in this the pedlar bring out he minor article and here he be more successful mr ashley buy sufficiently for he young lady friend at the seminary he say and redbud and fanny both purchase little thing fanny buy the most splendid glass breastpin which she pretend with a merry laugh to admire to distraction redbud without know very well why buy a little red coral necklace which look bright and new and rattle merrily as she take it for some reason the pedlar part with it for a very small sum and then somewhat hastily pack up he goods and duck he head in thanks go on he way look what a very handsome breastpin i have say fanny as they return through the garden i be sure nobody would know that it be not a diamond you be right say mr ashley smile the world be give to judge almost wholly from outward appearance and what do you purchase miss summer -- or miss redbud if you will permit I -- oh yes sir say redbud look at he with she kind sad eye you need ` nt be ceremonious with _ I _ besides you be fanny 's cousin i buy this necklace -- i think it old-fashioned and pretty redbud be silent again she eye bent quietly upon the walk the long lash repose thus upon the tender little cheek old-fashioned and pretty say the young man with a smile do you not make a mistake there miss redbud no sir -- i mean it she say raise she eye simply to he own i think old-fashioned thing be very often prettier and more pleasant than new one do not you i do cried fanny i be sure my great grandmother 's diamond breastpin be much handsomer than this horrid thing and the young lady tear the pinchbeck jewel from she neck mr ashley laugh there be you consistency he say just now you think nothing could be finer miss fanny vehemently oppose this view of she character at great length and with extraordinary subtilty we regret that the exigency of we narrative render it impossible for we to follow she -- we can only state that the result as on all such occasion be the total defeat of the cavalier mr ralph ashley several time state he willingness to subscribe to any view opinion or conclusion which miss fanny desire he to and finally place he finger in he ear fanny greet this maneuver with a sudden blow in the laugher 's face from she bouquet and redbud forget she disquietude laugh gaily at the merry cousin so they enter and meet the bevy of young school girl on the portico with whom mr ralph ashley in some manner become instantaneously popular : perhaps partly on account of the grotesque present he scatter among they with he gay joyous laughter after thus make himself generally agreeable he look at the setting sun and say he must go he would however soon return he say to see he dearest fanny the delight of he existence and have make this pleasant speech he go away on he elegant horse laugh good-humored and altogether a very please graceful-looking cavalier as the red sunset shower upon he rich apparel and he slender charger all its wealth of ruddy golden light and as he go on thus so gallant in the bravery of youth and joy a young lady sit on the sun-lit portico follow he with she eye and lean she fine brow with its ebon curl upon she hand muse with a sigh and a smile and when the cavalier turn round as the tree swallow he and wave he hat with its fine feather in the golden light miss fanny murmur -- really i think -- ralph -- have very much -- improved which seem to be a very afflicting circumstance to miss fanny inasmuch as she utter a deep sigh meanwhile we little redbud gaze too from the brilliantly-illumined portico toward the golden ocean in the west the rich light linger lovingly upon she golden hair and tender lip and cheek and snowy neck on which the coral necklace rise and fall with the pulsation of she heart the kind mild eye be fix upon the sunset sadly and they blue depths seem to hold more than one dew-drop ready to pass the barrier of the long dusky lash which close gradually as the pure white forehead droop upon she hand for a long time the tender heart remain thus still and quiet then she lip move faintly and she murmur -- oh it be wrong -- i know it be -- i ought not to and two tear fall on the child 's hand and on the necklace which the finger hold chapter xxvii philosophical we leave we friend verty slowly go onward toward the western hill under the golden autumn sunset with drooping head and listless arm thinking of redbud and the event of the day which now be go to its death in royal purple over the far horizon one think one image only dwelt in the young man 's mind and what that think be he tell-tale lip clearly reveal : -- redbud redbud they murmur and the dreamer seem to be wholly dead to that splendid scene around he dream of he love there be those who speak slightingly of boyhood and its feeling scoff at the early yearning of the heart and find only food for jest in those innocent and childish rapture and regret we do not envy such that man 's heart must be make of doubtful stuff who jeer at the fresh dream of youth or rather he must have no heart at all -- above all no sweet and affect recollection there be something touch in the very idea of this pure and unselfish emotion which the hardened nature of the grown-up man can never feel again man often dream about they childhood and shed unavailing tear as they gaze in fancy on they own youthful face and with the pencil of imagination slowly trace the old form and image say a writer of we acquaintance no matter who since no one read or thought of he : -- the writer of these idle line find no difficulty in painting for himself a titian picture in which as in he life-picture he own figure lie on the canvas long ago -- a long long time ago -- in fact when he be a boy and love dearly a child like himself a child who be now a fair and beautiful-browed woman and who smile with a dreamy thoughtful expression when he face come to she -- long ago flower be very bright in the bright may day by a country brookside the butter-cup be over all the hill for child to put under they chin and pea-blossom very much like lady-slipper sway prettily in the wind beneath the foot of the boy and girl -- she be a merry bright-eyed child how i love she still -- break crocus and violet and a thousand wild flower fresh and full of fairy beauty the grass be green and soft and the bird rise through the air on flutter wing singing and rejoicing and the cloud float over they as only cloud in may can float quickly hopefully with a dash of changeful April in they -- not like those of August : for the may cloud be a maiden a child full of life and joy running and playing and look playfully back at the wind as they rustle on -- not august-like -- a thoughtful ripened beauty large lazy and contemplative whose spring of youth have pass whose summer have arrive in all its wealth and power and languid splendor well they wander -- the boy and girl -- on the

jinks bent he course toward bousch 's tavern where he propose to take up he temporary residence since this house have become historical let we say a word of it it be one of those old wooden ordinary of virginium which be now never see in town of any size crouch only on the road-side or in obscure nook where the past life still it be a building of large size though but two story in height and even then present a ancient appearance with its low eaves small-paned window and stone slab before the door behind it be a old garden and near at hand two ponderous valve open upon a large stable-yard full of bustling hostler the neighborhood in which this ancient dwelling stand be not without a certain picturesqueness thanks to the old low-eaved house date from the french-indian war and grassy knoll from which quarry of limestone stand out boldly above all because of the limpid stream which flow from the west just by the portico of the old tavern murmur gaily in the traveller 's ear and leap toward he as he cross it or allow he weary animal to bathe he nostril in the cool water two or three majestic weeping-willow plunge they broad trunk and vigorous root into the clear stream and sigh forever over it as pass onward it run away from the bousch hostelry toward its ocean the opequon this old tavern which exist still we believe a venerable relic of the border past be in the year 1777 the abode of a number of quaker together with one druggist and a dancing-master send to winchester under guard with a request from the executive of pennsylvanium direct to the county-lieutenant of frederick to secure they the reason for this arrest and exile may be find in a congressional report upon the subject -lrb- anno 1776 -rrb- which state that well-attested fact render it certain and notorious that those person be with much rancor and bitterness disaffected to the american cause -- for which reason they be request to go and remain in durance at winchester in virginium how they protest at philadelphium against be take into custody -- protest again at the pennsylvanium line against be carry out of that state -- protest again at the maryland line against be take into virginium -- and end by protest at winchester against everything in general -- it be all write in the book of the chronicle of the valley of virginium by mr samuel kercheval and also in a interesting philadelphium publication friend in exile to this day the old sun-dial in the garden of bousch 's tavern have upon it the inscription : _ exul patrium causâ libertate _ with the name of the unfortunate exile write under it -- always provide that the dial itself remain and the rain and snow and sun have not blot out the word that they be there the present chronicler know upon good authority how the exile pass they time at winchester and finally return will some day be embody in authentic history it be many year after the quaker inroad in fact the eighteenth century with all its philosophical political and scientific protest everywhere be nearly dead and go when another scene occur at bousch 's tavern which history know something of as that August muse however do not bury herself with personal detail we will briefly refer to this occurrence it be about mid-day then when a carriage with travel trunk behind it and a white foreign-looking driver and footman on the seat before draw rein in front of the old hostelry we have describe the footman descend from he perch and approach the door of the carriage open it and respectfully assist two gentleman to alight these gentleman be dress with elegant simplicity the first have a oval face which be full of good-humor and in which a imaginative eye might have discern a odd resemblance to a _ pear _ the second who seem to be he brother be more sedate and do not smile the gentleman enter the inn and ask if dinner could be furnish the landlord reply that nothing could be easier and call they attention to a noise which issue from the next room the elder gentleman whose accent have indicate he foreign origin approach the door which lead into the dining-room follow by he companion they look in a long table cover with a profusion of everything which the most robust appetite could desire be fill with ploughman rough farmer hunter from the neighbor hill and a nondescript class which be neither farmer ploughmen nor hunter but make they living by convey huge team from town to town they be travel merchant -- not wagoner simply as might have be suppose from they garment full of straw and the huge whip which lay beside they on the floor when they chew they food these worthy resemble horse masticate ear of corn when they laugh they make the window rattle the good-humored traveller shake he head over the face of he companion pass a disdainful smile which do not escape the landlord as the elder turn round he observe he servant inscribe they name in the tavern-book he would have stop he but he have already write the name he thereupon turn to the landlord could they not have a private room hum -- it be contrary to rule they want to dine could they not make up they mind to join the company the younger traveller could not and would not -- a room the landlord assume a dogged expression and reply that he make no distinction among he guest what be good enough for one be good enough for all then the young traveller say he would not stay in such a place the host reply that he might go and welcome -- the sooner the better -- he want no lofty foreign gentleman with they air etc the two gentleman bow with grave politeness and make a sign to they servant who come forward look with terrible frown at boniface prepare the carriage to set out again -- they would not dine there how monseigneur would go on in spite of -- enough -- monseigneur would consult they when it be necessary harness the horse again the result of which command be that in ten minute the two gentleman be again upon the road the

have just related occur little redbud be sit at she window reading by the red light of sunrise if anything be beautiful in this world assuredly it be the fresh innocent face of a child flood with the deep gold of sunrise and with cheek still bath in the delicate rose-bloom of slumber morning and childhood go together as all thing pure and fresh and tender do and in the face of the child sit there in the quiet morning a imaginative mind might have discern without difficulty more than one point of resemblance the dew sparkling like diamond on the emerald grass be not brighter or fresher than she eye -- the merry breeze might have be gayer but have not half as much thoughtful joy and tenderness as she gentle laugh -- the rosy flush of morning with all its golden splendor as of fair aurora rise to she throne be not more fair than the delicate cheek in a single word miss redbud -- about whom we always grow extravagant -- be a worthy portion of the bright fresh morning and the hardest-hearted individual who ever laugh at childhood and innocence and joy -lrb- and there be some god help they -rrb- would have think the place and time more cheerful and inspiring for she presence redbud have be read from a book which lay upon the window-sill the idle breeze turn over the leaf carelessly as though like a child it be look for picture and the word from dear mamma be see upon the fly-leaf -- in the rough uncouth character of childhood this be redbud 's bible -- and she have be read it and have raise she happy eye from the black heavy letter to the wave variegated tree and the bright sunrise overwhelming they with its flush of gold redbud be clothe as usual very simply -- she hair brush back and secure after the fashion of the time with a bow of ribbon -- she arm bare to the elbow with heavy fall sleeve -- she neck surround with a simple line of lace around she neck she wear the coral necklace we have see she purchase the girl gaze for some moment at the crimson and yellow tree on which a murmurous laughter of mock wind arise at time and rustle on and die away into the psithurisma of theocritus and the song of the oriole and mocking-bird fluttering among the ripe fruit or wave up into the sky bring a pleasant smile to she lip the lark too be pour from the cloud where he circle and flicker like a ball of light the glory of he song and from a old dead oak which raise its straight trunk just without the garden come the quick rattle of the woodpecker 's bill or the scream of that red-winged drummer as he dart off playing and scream with he fellow beyond the garden all the noble autumn forest wave away in magic splendor -- red and blue and golden the oak be beautiful with they wave leaf -- the little alder tree exquisite in its faint saffron -- the tall taper pine rise from the surround foliage like straight spear which have catch on they summit royal robe of emerald velvet green at first but when the red light fall upon they turn to imperial purple as of old emperor of rome all these sight and sound be pleasant thing to redbud and she gaze and listen to they with a species of tranquil pleasure which make she tender face very beautiful at last she eye return to she old bible and she begin to read again from the sacred book she turn the leaf and come to a passage around which faint line be trace in fade ink -- the word thus mark be those of st paul so sublime in they simplicity so grand in they quiet majesty : have a desire to depart and to be with christ these word have be mark by redbud 's mother and as the child gaze upon the fade ink and thought of the dear hand which have rest upon the page a tender regret betray itself in she veil eye and she lip murmur wistfully mamma she down-cast eye be veil by the long lash and the child 's thought go back to the old happy day when she mother have teach she to pray join she infant hand and tell she about god and all he goodness it be not grief which the child feel as she mental glance thus go backward to the time when she mother be alive -- rather a tender joy full of pure love and so far separate from the world or the thing of the world that she face grow holy as if a light from heaven stream upon it oh yes she need no one to tell she that she dear mother 's desire have be fulfil -- that she be with christ and she heart rise in prayer to the giver of all good to bless and purify she and give she power to conquer all she evil thought -- and pass through the toil and temptation of the world come finally to that happy land where she dear mother live and love -- from which she look upon she child she pray to be keep thus pure for strength to resist she sinful inclination ill-temper discontent and uncharitable thought for power to divorce she thought from the world spite of its sunshine and bright flower and attraction -- to feel that holy desire to be with the dear savior who have die for she the child rise with a countenance that be sacred for its purity and hopefulness and trust she gaze again upon the brilliant morning land and listen to the bird and smile -- for in the sunlight and the carol of the bright-winged oriole and every murmur of the merry wind she feel the presence of a loving and all-merciful creator who would bless she if she love and obey he and so the tender eye again beam with the unclouded light of childhood and the lip be again calm and happy the child have seek for peace and joy from the great central source and find it everything be now delightful -- all the cloud have pass -- and a bright smile illumine she fresh face and make the sunlight envious as it pour its fresh golden radiance upon she brow and cheek redbud have just close she bible and be about to put it away upon the shelf when a light step be hear in the room

thing to talk about and we may be sure that they do not neglect the opportunity what do _ not _ young lady at school discuss scarcely anything escape and these criticism be often very trenchant and

word and fanny immediately take the advice which have be proffer -- that be to say she turn she eye away from the banter lip of she companion and measure the stream which they be approach it be one of those little mountain-brook which roll they limpid water over silver sand hurl by through whisper ledge the resort of snipe and woodcock or vary this quiet and serene existence with occasional action dart between abrupt bank over mossy rock laugh as they fly onward to the open sunlight the spot which the party have reach unite these characteristic mention a path lead to a mossy log stretch from bank to bank some foot above the water -- a log which have answer the purpose of a bridge for a long time it seem for both end be bury in the sward and the flower which decorate it below this the limpid stream wound over bright sand and pebble which glitter in the ripple like diamond now cry ralph here be a pretty pass how be these delightful young lady to get over verty i do not know -- i suppose they will walk observe verty simply walk yes what when that very dog there have to balance himself in traverse the log who longear yes longear he be not use to log say verty smile and shake he

miss fanny up in he arm and rapidly pass across with he burden nothing easier by jove there go you slipper in fact just at the middle of the log the ribbon bind the slipper to miss fanny 's ankle have break -- probably on account of she struggle -- and the luckless slipper have fall into the stream it be now scud along like a lilliputian boat the huge rosette of crimson ribbon stand out like sail ralph burst into a roar of laughter from which he be instantly divert by a rousing slap upon the cheek administer by the hand of fanny who cry out at he audacity cousin you know -- we be cousin darling but what a tremendous strength of arm you have try it again sir say miss fanny pout and pull down she sleeve which have mount to she shoulder in the passage never cry ralph i be fully conscious of my improper conduct i blush to think of it -- that be to say my left cheek do serve you right say fanny uncharitable impudent unfortunate with which retort mr ralph ashley point to the slipper-less foot which be visible beneath miss fanny 's skirt and laugh ralph would then have make immediate pursuit of the slipper but verty detain he the young man call longear point out the roset boat to that intelligent serviteur and then turn to the company in two minute longear return pant with the slipper in he drip mouth from which it be transfer to the foot of its mistress with merry laughter for accompaniment this little incident be the subject of much amusing comment to the party -- in which miss fanny take she share she have soon recover she good-humor and now laugh as loudly as the loudest at one moment she certainly do blush however -- that be to say when in ascend the hill -- verty and redbud be before -- mr ralph refer to the delight he have experience when he salute

to discover the question be scarcely important chapter xxxix up the hill-side and under the chestnut thus leave the sedgy stream behind with all its brilliant ripple silver sand and sway waterflag which make they merry music for it as it go along toward the far potomac -- we joyful party ascend the fine hill which rise beyond mount with every step above the little town of winchester which before long look more like a lark 's nest hide in a field of wheat than what it be -- a honest border town with many memory verty and redbud as we have say go first we have few artist in virginium -- only one great humorist with the pencil this true history have not yet be submit to he yet we doubt whether ever the fine pencil of monsignor andante strozzus could transfer to canvas or the engraver 's block the figure of the maiden and the young man beauty grace and picturesqueness might be in the design but the indefinable and subtle poetry -- the atmosphere of youth and joy and innocence which seem to wrap they round and go with they wherever they move -- could not be reproduce yet in the mere material outline there be much to attract redbud with she simple little costume full of grace and elegance -- she slender figure golden hair and perfect grace of movement be a pure embodiment of beauty -- that all-powerful beauty which exist alone in woman when she pass from the fairy land of childhood or toward the real world pause with reluctant foot upon the line which separate they she golden hair be secure by a bow of scarlet ribbon she dress be azure the little chip hat with its float streamer just fall over she fine brow and give a shadowy softness to she tender smile : she look like some young shepherdness of arcady from out the old romance fresh and beautiful and happy poor cold word if even we friend the signor before mention could not do she justice how can we with nothing but we pen this little pastoral queen lean on the arm of the young leatherstocking whom we have describe so often verty 's costume by dint of these outline description must be familiar to the reader he have secure he rifle which he carry beneath he arm and he eye dwelt on the autumn forest with the old dreamy look which we have speak of as he thus go on clothe in he wild forest costume place he moccasined foot with caution upon the sod and bend he head forward as be the wont of hunter verty resemble nothing so much as some wild tenant of the american backwoods take back to arcady and in love with some fair daphne who have wile he from the deer all the old doubt and embarrassment have now disappear from redbud 's face and verty too be happy they go on talk very quietly and pleasantly -- the fresh little face of redbud light up by she tender smile what be you gaze at say the young girl smile as verty 's eye fix itself upon the blue sky intently i do not see anything -- do you yes say verty smile too what a pigeon where up yonder -- and i declare it be yours redbud mine

its wing and pet it and clap they hand at the sight of the olive branch the simple verty laugh as he think of the glee of the little ark-children -- if there be any there be no olive here he say when they have go a little further but just look at that hickory it be grow as yellow as a buttercup yes and see the maple poor fellow say verty why pity they i always do see how they be burn away and the chestnut -- oh i think we will get some chestnut : here be a tree -- and we be at the top of the hill verty thereupon let go redbud 's arm and busy himself in gather a pile of the chestnut which have fall this ceremony be attentively watch by longear who lie with he front paw stretch out straight he head bent knowingly on one side and a expression of thoughtful dignity upon he countenance seem to be revel in the calm delight of a good conscience and a mild digestion fanny and she cavalier come up just as verty have collect a pile of the chestnut and prepare some stone for the purpose of mash they out the party thereupon with much laughter betook themselves to the task talk gaily and admire the landscape as they munch -- for even young lady munch -- the chestnut one accident only happen and that be not of a important nature longear full of curiosity like most intellectual character have approach very near verty as he be mash the chestnut upon the stone select for the purpose and even in the excess of he interest have protrude he nose in the vicinity of the young man 's left hand which hold the nut while he prepare to strike it with the mass of limestone which he hold in he right it chance that verty be talk to fanny when longear make this demonstration of curiosity and do not observe he longear sniff verty raise he stone longear smell at the chestnut in he master 's grasp he cold muzzle nearly touch it the stone crash down longear make a terrific spring backwards and retire to some distance rub he nose vigorously with he paw look all the while with dignified reproach at

to walk on chapter xl under the greenwood tree how sir well madam keep you promise please to indicate it i refer sir to you college album oh certainly here it be my darling -- all ready and mr ralph ashley between whom and miss fanny this dialogue have take place seat himself beneath a magnificent tulip-tree and with a movement of the head suggest a similar proceeding to the rest all be seat the young man draw from he breast-pocket a small volume bind in leather and with a nod to fanny say : i have change my mind -- i can not read but two or three broken you promise you mean no my own -- oh no ralph you be really too impudent how pray and presumptuous why because sir -- i call you ` my own ' in advance eh yes sir fanny have utter the word without reflection -- intend they as a reply to mr ralph 's sentence the word in advance be omit therefrom everybody see she mistake at once and a shout of laughter greet the reply ralph assume a close and cautious expression and say : well -- i will be more careful in future the fact be that people who be _ to be _ marry should be as chary of they endearment in public as those who _ be _ married general laughter and assent -- except from fanny who be blush nothing be more disagreeable continued ralph philosophically than these public evidence of affection it be positively shocking to see and hear two married people exchange they ` dear ' and ` dearest ' ` love ' and ` darling ' -- especially to bachelor it be really insulting therefore it be equally in bad taste with those who _ be to be _ marry -- logically consequently and in the third place -- and lastly -- it be not proper between myself and you my fanny -- hum -- miss fanny this syllogistic discourse be receive by fanny with a mixture of blush and satirical curl of the lip hum more than once issue from she lip and this expression always signify with the young lady in question -- indeed -- really -- you think that be mighty fine -- or some other phrase indicative of scorn and defiance on the present occasion after utter a number of these hum fanny embody she feeling in word and reply : i think ralph you be the most impudent gentleman i have ever know and you wrong I i wonder how you get such bad manners at williamsburg i reckon hum if you wait until _ i _ marry you -- i shall never repent the delay ask ralph -- be that what you mean well i do not believe i shall but a truce to jest my charming cousin you speak of williamsburg and my deterioration of manners do you not yes i can prove that i have not deteriorated try then no i would have to read all this book which be full of compliment fanny that would take all day besides i be too modest oh laugh fanny who have recover she good humor let we hear mr ralph say redbud smile yes -- let we see how the odious college student write and talk add fanny laugh well i 'll select one from each branch say ralph : the friendly pathetic poetical and so forth lithe and listen lady all and while the company listen even down to longear who lay at some distance regard ralph with respectful and appreciative attention as of a critic to whom a m be read and who determine to be as favorable as he can consistent with he reputation -- while they listen ralph open he book and read some verse we regret that only a portion of the album of mr ralph ashley have come down to modern time -- the rat have devour a greater part of it no doubt attract by the flavor of the composition or possibly the paste make use of in the binding we can not therefore present the reader with many of the beautiful tribute to the character of ralph record in the album by he admiring friend one of these tribute especially be -- we be inform by vague tradition -- perfectly resplendent for its imagery and diction contest seriously we be assure the palm with homer virgil and we milton though unlike bright patroclus and the peerless lycida the subject of the eulogy have not suffer change when it be pen the eulogy in question compare ralph to demosthene and say that he must go on in he high course and gripe the palm from graecium 's greatest son and that from the obscure shades of private life he devoted tumle would watch the culmination of he genius and rejoice to reflect that they have formerly partaken of lambs-wool together in the classic shades of william and mary with much more to the same effect this be lose but a few of the tribute read aloud by mr ralph be here insert the first be poetic and pathetic : my dear ashley : recline in my apartment this evening and reflect upon the please scene through which we have pass together -- alas never to be renew since you be not go to return -- those beautiful word of the swan of avon occur to I : ` to be or not to be -- that be the question whether ` tis better in this world to bear the sling and arrow of -- ' i do not remember the rest but the whole of this handsome soliloquy express my sentiment and the sincerity with which my dear ashley i be yours -- no name cry ralph now for another : good old bantam oh mr bantam write this do he cry fanny yes miss for which reason i pass it -- no remonstrance -- i be inflexible here be another : dear ralph : i need not say how sorry i be to part with you we have see a great deal of each other and i trust that we friendship will continue through after life the next session will be dull without you -- i do not mean to flatter -- as you go away you carry with you the sincere friendship and kindest regard of dear ralph you attach friend -- -- i like that very much mr ralph say redbud smile you would like the writer much more miss redbud say the young man really one of the finest fellow that i ever know i want he to pay I a visit -- i have no other friend like alfred oh alfr 's he name be it cry fanny what be the rest i 'll set my cap at he alfr nothing be he name say ralph facetiously and i approve of you course you would be mrs nobody you know but listen -- here be the enthusiastic : my dear ashley : you be destine for great thing -- it be yours to scale the height of song and snatch the crown from os 's lofty brow fulfil you destiny and make you country happy -- -- oh yes say fanny why do not you i will very likely i be glad you agree with I but here be the _ considerate _ and turn the leaf he read -- i say old fellow : may you course in life be serene and happy and may you friend be as numerous and devoted as the fly and mosquito in the eastern range you friend till death -- -- the fact be say ralph in explanation that this be probably the finest wish in the book be there many fly say fanny myriad and mosquito like sand on the seashore and of a size which it be dreadful to reflect upon even now very large you may judge my dear fanny when i tell you that one of they fly against a scallop of oyster which the boot be bring to my apartment and with a single flap of he wing dash it from the hand of the boot -- it be dreadful but let we get on : this be the last i will read and check miss fanny 's intended outburst at the oyster story mr ralph read on -- you ask I my dear ashley to give you some advice and write down my good wish if i have any in you direction of course i have my dear fellow and here go my advice first then be never to drink more than three bottle of wine at one sit -- this be enough and six bottle be therefore accord to the most reliable rule of logic -- which i hate -- too much you might do it if you have my head but you hav not and there be a end of it next if you want to bet at race ascertain which horse be the general ` favorite ' and as we friend the ostler at the raleigh say -- go agin he human nature invariably go wrong and this a wise man will never forget next if you have the playing mania never play with anybody but gentleman you will thus have the consolation of reflect that you have be ruin in good company and in addition have you pleasure -- blackleg ruin a man with a vulgar rapidity which be positively shocking next my dear boy -- though this i need ` nt tell you -- never look at greek after leave college or moral philosophy or mathematics proper it interfere with a man 's education which commence when he have recover from the disadvantage of college lastly my dear fellow never fall in love with any woman -- if you do you will inevitably repent it this world would get on quietly without they -- as long as it last -- and i need ` nt tell you that the trojan war and other interesting event never would have happen but for bright eye and sigh and that sort of thing if you be oblige to marry because you have a establishment write the name of you lady acquaintance on scrap of paper put they in you hat and draw one forth at random this admirable plan save a great deal of trouble and you will inevitably get a wife who in all thing will make you miserable follow this advice my dear fellow and you will arrive at the summit of happiness i trust i shall see you at the oak at the occasion of my marriage -- you know to my lovely cousin she be a charming girl and we would be delighted to see you ever my dear boy you friend and pitcher -- -- -- do anybody -- ever ask ralph laugh such inconsistency say fanny not a bit of it not inconsistent why no explain why not if you please sir i wonder if -- that cloud do not threaten a storm and whether i be not hungry say ralph finish miss fanny 's sentence put the album in he pocket and attack the basket come my dear cousin let we after partaking of mental food assault the material by jove what a horn of plenty and ralph in the midst of cry exclamatory and no little laughter empty the contents of the basket on the velvet sward variegate by the sunlight through the bough and fit for king the lunch commence chapter xli use of coat in a storm it be a very picturesque group seat that day beneath the golden tree and the difference in the appearance of each member of the party make the effect more complete redbud with she mild tender eye and gentle smile and sylvan costume be the representative of the fine shepherdess of former time and want but a crook to worthily fill marlow 's ideal for she have not quite a belt of straw and ivy bud with coral clasp and amber stud -- she slender waist be encircle by a crimson ribbon quite as prettily embroider as the zone of the old poet 's fancy and against she snowy neck the coral necklace which she wear be clearly outline rise and fall tranquilly like may-bud weave by child-hand into a bright wreath and launch on the surface of some limpid stream and fanny -- gay mischievous fanny with she mad-cap countenance and midnight eye and ripple raven curl -- fanny look like a young duchess take she pleasure for the sake of contrast in the wood -- far from ancestral

piteously -- even longear seem to know the suffering of he master and be still and quiet chapter xliv in which the history return to apple orchard have devote much space in the foregoing page to those scene descriptive grotesque and sentimental which take place at the bower of nature and winchester it be proper that we should now go back to the domain of apple orchard and the inhabitant of that realm so long lose sight of in the contemplation of the grace and attraction of miss sallianna and the various planet which hover in the wake of that great feminine sun of love and beauty apple orchard so long lose sight of will not longer suffer itself to be neglect and fortunately the return of we heroine redbud afford a opportunity of pass away for the time from other scene and go thither in she company redbud 's sickness do not last long the girl have one of those constitution which though they seem frail and delicate yet like the reed be able to resist what break more robust frame the wetting she have get on the evening whose event we have chronicle have not seriously affect she -- a severe cold and with it some slight fever have be the result and this fever expend itself completely in a few day and leave the girl well again though quite weak and poorly as say the african redbud like most person be not fond of a sick-room and after send word day after day to we friend verty -- who never fail to call twice at least morning and evening -- that she be better and better the girl one morning declare to cousin lavinium that she be well enough to put on she dressing-wrapper and go down stair after some demur accompany by many grave and solemn shake of the head miss lavinium assent to this view of the case and accordingly set about arrange the girl 's hair which have become -- thanks to the fact that she could not bear it tie up -- one mass of curl of the color of gold and this task have be perform with solemn but affectionate care the squire make he appearance accord to appointment and take he baby as he call we heroine of sixteen and a half in he arm carry she down stair and deposit she on a sofa front the open window look on the fresh field and splendid autumn forest redbud lay here gaze with delight upon the landscape and smile pleasantly the autumn hour be go to the west -- the tree have grow more golden than on that fine evening when with sad mishap to fanny the gay party have wander over the hill though not very far away and see the thunder-storm suck in the dazzling glory of the bannered tree another year with all its light and joy and beauty slowly wane away and have itself decently entomb beneath the thick soft bed of yellow leaf with nothing to disturb it but the rabbit 's tread or forest cry or hoof-stroke of the deer that year have add life and beauty to the face and form of redbud make she a woman-child -- before she be but a child and the fine light now in she tender eye be a light of thought and mind the mature radiance of open intellect instead of the careless thoughtless life of childhood she have become suddenly much older the squire say since go to the bower of nature even and as she lay now on she couch front the die autumn the year which whisper faintly even now of its bright come in the spring promise to make she a young lady and as redbud lay thus smile and think who should run in with laugh eye and brilliant countenance and black curl ripple like a midnight stream but we young friend miss fanny fanny joyous as a lark -- and merrier still at see redbud down stair again -- overflow indeed with mirth and laughter like a morn of spring and make old caesar doze on the rug rise up and whine fanny kiss redbud enthusiastically which ceremony as everybody know be with young lady exactly equivalent to shake hand among the man and often indicate as little real good-feeling slanderous tongue have whisper no one however could have imagine that there be any affectation in fanny 's warm kiss the very ring of it be enough to prove that the young lady 's whole heart be in it and when she sit down by redbud and take she white hand and pat it against she own the very tenderest light shone in miss fanny 's dancing eye and it be plain that she have not exaggerate the truth in formerly declare that she be desperately in love with redbud ah that fond old school attachment -- whether of boy or girl -- for the close friend of sunny hour shall we laugh at it be the feeling of we after life so much more disinterested pure and elevated so miss fanny chat on with redbud tell she a thousand thing which fortunately have nothing to do with we present chronicle -- else would the unfortunate chronicler find he pen laugh at for its tardy movement fanny 's rapid flow of laughing and picturesque word could no more be keep up with by a sublunary instrument of record than the shadow of a dart bird can be catch by the eager hand of the child grasp at it as it flit by on the sward and in the middle of this flow of word and just when fanny make a veil allusion to a elderly thing and the propensity of the person in question to rob more juvenile young lady of they beau -- enter miss lavinium -- who ask what thing miss fanny speak of with a smile upon the austere countenance fanny decline explain but blush instead and ask miss lavinium where she get that darling shawl which be really a perfect love of a thing and so with smile from redbud the conversation continue until dinner-time when the squire make he appearance and after kiss miss redbud affect to take miss fanny by the elbow and bump she head against the ceiling baby-fashion in this attempt we need not say the worthy gentleman fail from the fact that young lady of seventeen be for some reason heavier than baby and be kiss with much more ease and far less trouble stand on they foot than chuck toward the ceiling for that purpose have dine and chat pleasantly and tell a number of amusing tale for miss redbud 's edification -- and against the silent protest and remonstrance of say miss lavinium -- the squire declare that he must go and see to he threshing and accordingly after swearing at caesar go away and be hear greet somebody as he depart this somebody turn out to be verty and the young man 's face blush with delight at sight of redbud whom he run to and devour with he glance redbud blush slightly but this pass soon and the kind eye beam on he softly -- no confusion in they now -- and the small hand be not draw away from he but remain in he own and fanny -- amiable fanny -- know all about it smile and miss lavinium staidest of she sex suspect something of it look grave and dignified but do not frown and verty with perfect forgetfulness of the presence of these person and much carelessness in regard to they opinion gaze upon redbud with he dreamy smile and talk to she so the day pass onward and the shades of evening take away the merry voice -- the bright sunset shine on they as they go they must come again without wait for she to return they visit -- say redbud smile -- and the happy laughter which reply to she make apple orchard chuckle through its farthest chamber and the portrait on the wall -- bright now in vagrant gleam of crimson sundown -- utter a low well-bred cachinnation such as be befitting in the solemn dignified old cavalier and lady look from they lace and hair-powder and stiff ruff upon they little grandchild so the merry voice become faint and the bright sunset slowly wane away a rosy flush upon the splendid sky drag another day of work or idleness despair or joy into oblivion redbud lie and gaze at the noble wood bath in that rosy flush and smile then she eye turn toward a portrait settle into shadow but light up with one bright beam -- and the dear mother 's eye shine on she with a tender light and bless she and she clasp she hand and she lip murmur something and she eye turn to the western sky again and evening slowly go away leave the beautiful pure face with evident regret but light up the kind blue eye and golden hair and delicate cheek with a last vagrant gleam so the dim cheerful night come down -- the day be dead chapter xlv hour in the October wood in a week redbud be go about again : slowly it be true and take care not to fatigue herself but still she be no longer confine to the house she rise one morning and come down with a face

numerous direction from we friend mr o'brallaghan verty resemble the young forest emperor which it be he wont to resemble at least in costume -- and fanny be clothe in the finest and most coquettish little dress conceivable after mature deliberation we be incline to believe that she conquest of ralph be on this day complete and perfect : -- the conduct of that gentleman for some day afterwards have be very suspicious we need only say that he sit at he window gaze moonward -- write sonnet in a very melancholy strain and lose much of he ardor and vivacity these symptom be sufficient for a diagnosis when one be familiar with the disease and they be exhibit by mr ralph on the occasion mention but we anticipate the gay party go out in the grove and wander about in the brilliant October sunlight gather primrose and other autumn flower which make into bunch they top with fine slender palm-like golden rod : -- and so pass on come to the old glen behind and just beneath the acclivity which make the western horizon of apple orchard look what a lovely tulip tree say fanny laughing and here be the old lime-kiln -- look ralph smile i be look -- he say you be not yes -- at you i ask

very much as she rise -- ralph be triumphant i have get they however sir she say hold the flower and i have a disagreeable accident say ralph laughing and pretend to rub he head disagreeable sir cry fanny without reflect yes say ralph -- why not fanny find herself involve again in a awkward explanation -- the fact be that ralph 's lip have by pure accident of course touch she brow it would therefore have only complicated matter for fanny to have explain why the accident ought not to be disagreeable as ralph declare it to be the general reply however which we have endeavor on various occasion to represent by the word humph issue from the young girl 's lip and busy herself with the wreath she pass on follow by the laugh company from the forest they go to the mossy glen as we may call it though that be not its name and verty enliven the company with a description of a flock of young partridge which have there start up once and run between he foot disappear before he very eye redbud too recollect the nice cherry they have eat from the tree -- as nice as the oxheart near the house -- in the spring and fanny do too and tell some very amusing story of beau be compel to climb and throw down bough laden with they red bunch in this pleasant way they stroll along the brook which steal by in sun and shadow over mossy rock and under bulrush where the minnow haunt -- which brook tradition -lrb- and the map -rrb- call to-day by the name of one member of that party and so pass over the slip of meadow where verty declare the hare be accustom to gambol by moonlight once more come again toward the locust-grove of dear old apple orchard -- -lrb- fanny 's phrase -rrb- -- and enter in again and throw down they treasure of bright flower and bird 's - nest -- for they have take some

the kite -- the post from which it sail forth on its aerial voyage the whole affair be a success and never do merrier heart watch a kite it be beautifully make -- of beautiful paper all red and blue and yellow -- and the young girl have completely surround it with figure of silver paper and decorate it from head to foot with flower thus when it ascend slowly into the cerulean heaven as say the poetical ralph its long flower-decorated streamer ripple in the wind it be greet with loud cry of joy and admiration -- thunder of applause and enthusiastic encouragement to go on from ralph who have grow very young again -- from fanny even more exaggerated cry that young lady seem to be on the point of fly after it -- the breeze seem about to bear she away and she clap she hand and follow the high sailing paper-bird with such delight that ralph suggest she should be send up as a messenger no say fanny grow a little calmer but laugh still i be afraid i should grow dizzy and look at the kite which soar far up and seem to be peep from side to side around the small white cloud fanny laugh more than ever but why should we waste we time in say that the gay party be please with everything and laugh out loudly for that reason perhaps a merrier company never make the golden day of autumn ring with laughter either at apple orchard where hill and meadow echo to the joyous carol or in any other place sit beneath the oak and look to the old house bury in its beautiful golden tree the girl sing with they pure melodious voice song which make the fresh yet dreamy autumn dearer still and wrap the heart of those who listen in a smile calm delight give youth only sky and pure fresh breeze and the ready laughter show how happy these thing simple as they be can make it it want no present beyond

laugh again and lean over the bark 's side play with the foam wave again as in the old day beautiful youth sailing for beulah the land of flower and landing there in dream -- how can we look upon you radiant brow and eye without such regret as nothing take root in this world can console we for completely ah after all there be no philosophy like ignorance -- there be no joy like youth and innocence

be however not more quarrelsome than usual : fanny be only struggle with ralph for the string of the kite the contention end in mutual laughter and as a horn at that moment sound for the servant to stop work for dinner the party determine to return to apple orchard the kite be tie to a root and they return homeward chapter xlvii day that be no more oh cry fanny as they be again walk upon the smooth meadow in the afternoon i think we ought to go and get some apple and so do i say ralph of course i expect you to agree with I sir naturally i always do this observation be remotely satirical and miss fanny resent it you be the most contentious person i ever know she say be i ask ralph yes sir that be fortunate why because difference of opinion be the soul of conversation and as you never disagree with anybody we could not converse observe how the syllogism come out fine logician lovely damsel mr college-graduate miss school-girl school-girl college-graduate and after this exchange of compliment the party walk on mutually please with each other redbud and verty follow they and they soon arrive at the old orchard behind the party follow longear whose presence throughout the day we have very improperly neglect to mention but as that inquisitive animal be during the whole morning roaming at he own wild will the neighbor field -- prying into the hole of various wild animal and exchange silent commentary with the apple orchard dog -- this omission will not appear very heinous longear have now regale himself with a comfortable dinner the last bone of which he have lick -- and have thus like a regular and respectable citizen take care of the material be busily engage again in the intellectual pursuit of he enemy the squirrel butterfly and bee at which he bark and dash at time with great vigor and enthusiasm look at he say redbud why do he dislike the butterfly only fun say verty he often do that here longears longear approach and verty point to the ground longear lay down stay there say verty and smile he walk on redbud laugh and turn round make sign to the dog to follow they longear however only move he head uneasily and wag he tail with eloquent remonstrance let he come verty say the girl verty smile and make a movement of the hand which from the distance of a hundred yard raise longear three foot into the air return from this elevation to the earth again he dart off over the field after the bee and swallow the young man and they companion smile and stroll on they reach the old orchard and run about among the tree pick up apple -- now the little soft yellow crab apple -- then the huge round ruddy pippin -- next the golden-coat bell apple oblong and mellow which have drop from pure ripeness from the autumn bough verty have often climb into the old tree and fill he cap with the speckled egg of black-bird or find upon the fence here embower in the foliage the slight nest of dove each with its two egg white and transparent almost and the recollection make he smile they gather a number of the apple and then stroll on and eat a moment with the pleasant overseer 's wife a number of little curly-headed boy have be roll like apple on the grass as they approach fat-armed and chubby-legged and make devoted advance to longear who descend from he dignity roll with they in the sunshine these now approach and the young girl pat they head and mr ralph give they some paternal advice and the good housewife spin in she cane-bottom chair with straight tall back smile pleasantly and curtsy the baby -lrb- there always be a baby at the overseer 's -rrb- soon make he appearance as baby will do everywhere and then the unfortunate young curly-head of riper age be force to return once more to the grass and play with longear -- they be forget to describe the going on of the two young lady with that baby be wholly out of the question they quarrel for it chuck it in they arm examine its toe with critical attention and converse with it in barbarous baby language which be enough ralph say to drive a man distract they ask it various question -- be delighted with its reply -- call its attention to the chicken -- and evidently labor under the impression that it understand they address the baby uniformly in the neuter gender and request to know whether it be not they darling to all which the baby reply with thoughtful stare only occasionally condescend to laugh the foot have be examine again -- there be much in baby ' foot -- the party smile and go away call after baby to the last now that be all affectation say ralph you young lady -- you be a barbarian sir reply fanny with great candor i know i be i be glad you do but continue ralph tell I now really do you young girl admire baby certainly _ i _ do -- and i say redbud they be the sweetest dearest thing in all the world continue fanny and the man who do not like baby -- be a monster eh far worse sir and fanny laugh that be pleasant to know say ralph then i be a monster have arrive at which highly encourage conclusion the young man whistle i say he say suddenly i want to ask -- well sir say fanny before we leave the subject -- what subject baby well ask on i wish to know whether baby talk certainly really now yes and you understand they _ i _ do say fanny what do ` um um ' mean i hear that baby say ` um um ' distinctly fanny burst out laugh oh i know she say when i give he a apple yes it mean ` that be a very nice apple and i would like to have some ' do it of course suppose then it have be a crab-apple and the baby have still say ` um um ' what would it then have mean plainly this : ` that be not a nice apple and i would not like to have any ' that be perfectly satisfactory say ralph ` um um ' express either the desire to possess a sweet apple or the objection to a sour one i have hear of delicate shades of language before but this be the sublimity thereof and ralph laugh i never see such a person say fanny pouting by the bye say ralph well sir what be there so interesting in the toe they be lovely anything else beautiful that all come now tell I the charm in those foot which you young lady designate i remember as ` teensy ' and express you desire to ` tiss ' shocking perversion of the king 's english -- and in honor of nothing but two dirty little foot say ralph the storm which be visit upon ralph 's unhappy head for this barbarous criticism be dreadful fanny declare in express term that he be a monster a ogre and with a stone in he breast instead of a heart to which mr ralph reply that the best writer of ancient and modern time have nowhere designate as a monster the man who be not in rapture at the sight of baby -- whereupon miss fanny declare she disregard of writer in general and she preference for baby -- at which stage of the discussion ralph begin to whistle why not catch the laughter of those youthful lip and tell how the young man and maiden amuse themselves that fine autumn day everything innocent and fresh be beautiful -- and there be eye which shine more brightly than the sun voice which make a softer music than the breeze of October in the laughing tree redbud 's face and voice have this innocence and joy in it -- there be pleasure in the very sound of it and such a delicate kind of light in the soft eye that as they go the young man feel more pure and bow to she as something better than themselves -- of higher nature the light of fanny 's eye be more brilliant but redbud 's be of such softness that you forget all else in gaze at they -- lose you heart look into they lucid depths of liquid light one heart be irremediably lose long since and go away into the possession of the young lady this be verty 's and as they go along he gaze so tenderly at the young girl that more than once she blush and suffer the long lash to fall down upon she rosy cheek fanny be talk with ralph -- for these young gentleman have make the simple and admirable arrangement without in the least consult the lady that verty should always entertain and be entertain by redbud ralph quarrel with and be quarrel with by fanny each on the present occasion be carry out he portion of the contract that be to say verty and redbud be quietly smile at each other ralph and fanny be exchange repartee they come thus to the knoll which they have stop upon in the forenoon the fine kite -- tie to a root as we have say -- be hover far up among the cloud sway and flutter its streamer in the wind : the various color of the paper and the flower almost wholly indiscernible so high have it ascend look say fanny there it be up among the swallow which be fly around it as if they never see a kite before female swallow doubtless observe ralph carelessly female pray why because they have so much curiosity see you have make I utter what be not common with I what sir a bad witticism fanny laugh and reply gaze at the kite : you witticism be of course always fine -- no doubt very classic now i will send up a messenger on the string redbud have you a piece of paper redbud draw the paper from she apron pocket and give it to fanny with a smile fanny tear the yellow scrap into a circle and in the center of this circle make a hole as large as she finger now mr ralph please untie the string from the root with pleasure say the young man for you my heart 's delight i would -- come come sir you make a oration upon every occasion with many remonstrance at be thus unceremoniously suppress mr ralph kneel down and untie the string do it pull strongly mr ralph say redbud smile oh yes you know it be nearly as tall as myself -- just try the messenger first cry fanny and she slip it over the string now miss redbud just try say ralph redbud wrap the string around she hand and ralph let it go how do you like it he say oh cry redbud it be so strong -- there must be a great wind in the cloud -- oh add the girl laugh it be cut my hand in two and she catch the string with she left hand to relieve the afflict member give it to I cry fanny yes give it to she she have the arm of a amazon say ralph enthusiastically humph and have enter this she standing protest fanny laugh and unwind the string from redbud 's hand on whose white surface two crimson circle be visible i can hold it cry the young girl easily and to display she indifference fanny knelt on one knee to pick up she glove the consequence of this movement be that the heavy kite strike doubtless at the moment by a gust of wind jerk the lady with the amazonian arm so violently that unable to retain she position she fall upon she left hand then upon she face and be drag a pace or two by the heavy weight by jove cry ralph run to she do anybody -- oh take care exclaim redbud hastening to she friend 's assistance it be nothing fanny say i can hold it and to prove this she let go the string which be cut she hand in two the poor kite loose from the sustain hand from the earth which so to speak hold it up -- it see its hope of elevation in the world all dash with disappointment and obscure it be doom but no a new friend come to its rescue -- desert by the lord and lady of creation the lesser creature take it under he protection longear be the rescuer longear have watch the messenger we have mention with deep interest as it lay upon the string and flutter longear imagine that it be a bee of the species call yellow-jacket challenge he to combat consequently longear no sooner see the string dart from fanny 's hand than believe the enemy about to escape he he spring toward it and catch it in he mouth longear catch a tartar but too brave to yield without a struggle roll upon the ground grind the yellow enemy and the string beneath he tooth he evolution on the grass wrap the string around he foot and neck longear be take prisoner and find himself drag violently over the ground brave and resolute before a common enemy longear fear this unknown adversary overcome with superstitious awe he howl endeavor to howl again he find he windpipe grasp by he enemy the howl turn into a wheeze he eye start from he head he jaw open he roll on the grass leap in the air put forth the strength of a giant but in vain it be at this juncture that verty run up and sever the string with he hunting-knive whereat longear find himself release rub he nose vigorously with he paw sneeze and lie down with a unconscious air as if nothing have happen he be save the kite however be sacrify justly punish for wound redbud 's hand throwing miss fanny on she face and perile the life of longear the unfortunate kite struggle a moment in the cloud stagger from side to side like a drunken man and then catch by a sudden gust sweep like a streaming comet down into the autumn forest and be go fanny be wipe she hand which be somewhat soil the rest of the company be laugh merrily at the disappearance of the kite longear be gravely and seriously contemplate the yellow enemy with whom he have struggle so violently and whose conqueror he believe himself to be this be the incident so frequently speak of by mr ralph ashley afterwards as the bucolic of the kite chapter xlviii the harvest moon the day be nearly go now die over fir-clad hill but yet before it go pour a last flood of rich red light such as only the mountain and the valley boast upon the beautiful sloping meadow stretch its green and dewy sea in front of apple orchard as the sun go away in royal splendor bound over the rim of evening like a red-striped tiger -- on the eastern horizon a light rise gradually as though a great conflagration rage there then the tree be kindle then the broad yellow moon -- call it the harvest moon -- soar slowly up drag its captive star and mix its fresh radiance with the wane glory of the crimson west and as the happy party -- group upon the grassy knoll like some party of shepherd and shepherdess in the old day of arcady -- gaze on the beautiful spectacle the voice of the negro come from they work be hear drive they slow team in and send on the air the clear melodious song which rude and ludicrous as they seem have yet so marvellous a effect bear on the air of night those evening song and sound not long ago one say i stand just at sunset on the summit of a pretty knoll and look eastward see the harvester cut into the tall brown-headed ripple wheat i hear the merry whistle of the whirling scythe i hear they song -- they be so sweet and why be these harvest melody so soft-sounding and so grateful to the ear simply because they discourse of the long bury past and like some magical spell arouse from its sleep all the beauteous and gay splendor of those hour as the clear measure sound float to my ear i hear also again the vanish music of happy childhood -- that elysian time which can not last for any of we i do not know what the song be -- whether some slow sad negro melody or loud-sounding hymn such as the forest ring with at camp-meeting but i know what the murmuring and die sound bring to I again live splendid instinct with a thoughtful but perfect joy fairyland never with its silver-twisted trumpet-flower-like bugle roll such a merry-mournful music to the friendly star i love to have the old day back again -- back with they very tint and atmosphere and sound and odor -- now no more the same thus i love to hear the young girl 's low merry song float from the window of a country-house half-broken by the cicalum the swallow 's twitter or the rustling leave -- i love to hear the joyous ripple of the harpsichord bring back with some old music time when that merry music stamp the hour and take possession of they -- in the heart -- forever more i love a ringing horn even the stage-horn -- now alas no more a sound of real life only memory -- the thousand murmur of a country evening the far clear cry of wild-geese from the cloud the tinkling bell of cattle every sound which bring again a glimpse of the far-glimmering plain of youth and that be why stand on this round knoll beneath the merrily-rustling cherry-tree and listen to the murmurous song i hear my boyhood speak to I and feel again the old breath on my brow the sun die away across the old sway wood the rattle hone upon the scythe the measure sweep the mellow music -- all be go away the day be do and the long twilight come -- twilight which mix the crimson of the darkling west the yellow moonlight in the azure east and the red glimmering starlight overhead into one magic light and so we go home merrily with pleasant thought and talk such pleasant thought i wish to all thus write one who ever delighted in the rural evening and they sound -- and thus listen the young person whose conversation light and trivial though it seem we have not think it a loss of time to chronicle from morn till eve they gaze with quiet pleasure upon the lovely landscape and listen to the negro as they sing they old rude touching madrigal shout at time to the horse of they team and not seldom send on the air the loud rejoiceful outburst of they laughter the moonlight sleep upon the wain pile up with yellow sheaf -- and plainly reveal the little monkey-like black seat on the summit of the foremost and this young gentleman have manage to procure a banjo and be play as he play he sing and as he sing keep time -- not with the head alone and foot but with he whole body arm and leg and shoulder -- all agitate with the ecstacy of mirth as -- singing coony up the holler and execute it with grand effect moreover -- the merry minstrel go upon he way various diminutive individual of a similar description be observe in the road behind execute a impromptu break down to the inspiring melody and so the great piled-up wagon come on in the moonlight creak in unison with the music and strew on the road its long trail of golden wheat the moon soar higher bidding defiance now to sunset which it drive completely from the field and in the window of apple orchard a light begin to twinkle and redbud rise she should not stay out she say as she have be sick and so they take they way as say we friend in pleasant talk across the emerald meadow to the cheerful home the low of cattle go with they and all the bird of night wake up and sing the beautiful moon -- the very moon of all the harvest-home since the earth be make -- shone on they as they go and by the time they have reach the portico of the old comfortable mansion evening have cast such shadow far and near that only the outline of the form be see as they pass in through the deep shadow they do not see that verty 's hand hold little redbud 's and that he look she with a tenderness which could not be mistaken but redbud see it and a flush pass over she delicate cheek on which the maiden moon look down and smile so the day end chapter xlix back to winchester where editorial iniquity be discourse of busy with the various fortune of we other personage we have not be able of late to give much attention to the noble poet roundjacket with whose ambition and great thought this history have heretofore somewhat concerned itself follow the old fine chivalric mansion _ place aux dames _ we have necessarily be compel to elbow the cavalier from the stage and pass by in silence without listen to they now however when we have write we pastoral canto and duly speak of the saying and doings of miss redbud and miss fanny -- use we best effort to place upon record what they amuse themselves with laugh at and take pleasure in under the golden tree of the beautiful wood and in the happy autumn field -- now we be at liberty to return to we good old border town and those other personage of the history whose merit have not be adequately recognize when verty enter winchester on the morning after the event or rather idle country scene which we have relate he be smile and joyous and the very clatter of cloud 's hoof make longear merry verty dismount and turn the knob of the office-door in open it strike against the back of mr roundjacket who pacing hastily up and down the apartment seem to be labor under much excitement in he left hand roundjacket carry a small brown newspaper with heavy straggling type and much dilapidated from its contact with the equestrian mail-bag which it have evidently issue from only a short time before in he right hand the poet hold a ruler which describe eccentric circle in the air and threaten imaginary foe with torture and extermination the poet 's hair stand up he breath come and go he coat-skirt move from side to side with indignation and he evidently regard something in the paper with a mixture of horror and despair verty pause for a moment on the threshold then take off he hat and go in round jacket turn round verty gaze at he for a moment in silence then smile : what be the matter sir he say matter sir cry roundjacket -- everything be the matter sir verty shake he head as much as to say that this be a dreadful state of thing and echo the word everything yes sir everything -- folly be the matter -- crime be the matter -- statutory misdemeanor be the matter and roundjacket overcome with indignation strike the newspaper a savage blow with he ruler i be the victim sir of editorial iniquity and typographical abomination anan say verty i be a victim sir yes you look angry i be verty shake he head that be not right he reply redbud say it be wrong to be angry -- redbud yes sir consign miss redbud -- oh no say verty do not do that i have a right to be angry continued roundjacket flourish he ruler it would be out of the question for I to be anything else how sir do you see that and roundjacket hold up the paper flourish he ruler at it in a threatening way the paper sir say verty yes what of it abomination oh sir yes utter abomination i do not understand sir mark I say roundjacket yes sir that be the ` virginia gazette ' be it sir publish at williamsburg i think i have hear of it sir williamsburg the center of civilization cultivation and the other ation cry roundjacket flourish he ruler savagely and smile with bitter scorn ah say verty finding that he be expect to say something yes the capital of virginium forsooth have williamsburg make you angry sir yes but the ` gazette ' -- be the immediate cause verty sit down i be sorry sir he say smile but i do not understand i never read the newspaper nothing but the bible -- because redbud want I to : i hope to like it after awhile though i trust you will never throw away you time on this thing cry roundjacket run the end of he ruler through the paper can you believe sir that the first canto of my great poem have be murder in its column -- yes murder kill do you mean sir i do -- i mean that the illiterate editor of this disgraceful sheet have assassinate the offspring of my imagination that be very wrong sir wrong it be infamous what should be do with such a man cry roundjacket arrest he suggest verty it be not a statutable offence what sir neglect to send sheet to correct anan say verty who do not understand i mean that i have not have a opportunity to correct the print verse sir and that i complain of verty nod mark I say roundjacket the publisher editor or reviewer who do not send sheet to the author for correction will inevitably perish in the end from the torture of remorse ah say verty yes sir the pang of a guilty conscience will not suffer he to sleep and death only will end he miserable existence which certainly have the air of a undoubted truth see say mr roundjacket relapsing into the pathetic -- see how my unfortunate offspring have be mangled -- maim -- a statutory offence -- mayhem -- see bacon 's abridgment page -- but i wander see continued roundjacket that be all that be leave of the original yes sir say verty the very first line be unrecognizable and roundjacket put he handkerchief to he eye and sniffle verty try not to smile it be very unfortunate sir he say but perhaps the paper -- i mean yours -- be not write plain write plain cry roundjacket suppress he feeling yes sir -- the manuscript i believe it be call well no -- it be not write plain -- of course not verty look surprised spite of he own suggestion i think you write as plain as print mr roundjacket i do why then -- not do so in the present instance do you mean yes sir young man say roundjacket solemnly it be easy to see that you be shockingly ignorant of the propriety of life -- or you never would have suggest such a thing what thing sir plain writing in a author oh say verty mark I continue roundjacket with affect gravity the unmistakable evidence of greatness be not the brilliant eye the fine forehead or the firm-set lip neither be the ` lion port ' or noble carriage -- it be far more simple sir it lie wholly in the hand-writing possible sir yes highly probable even no great man ever yet write legibly and i hold that such a thing be conclusive evidence of a narrowness of intellect great man uniformly use a species of scrawl which people have to study sir before they can understand like the oracle of delpho the manuscript be mysterious because it be profound my own belief sir be that homer 's manuscript -- if he have one which i doubt -- resemble a sheet of paper over which a fly with inked foot have crawl -- and you may imagine sir the respect and i may add the labor of the old greek type-setter in publish the first edition of the iliad this dissertation have the effect of divert mr roundjacket 's mind temporarily from he affliction but he grief soon return in full force again to think it he cry flourish he ruler and ready to weep -- to think that after take all the trouble to disguise my clear run hand and write as become a author of my standing -- in hieroglyphic -- to think that this should be the result of all my trouble roundjacket sniff do not be sorry say verty i can not refrain sir say roundjacket in a tone of acute agony it be more than i can bear see here sir again : ` high jove great father ' be change into ` by jove i would rather ' and so on sir it be more than humanity can bear i feel that i shall sink under it i shall be in bed to-morrow sir -- after all my trouble -- ` by jove ' with this despair exclamation roundjacket let he head fall overcome with grief upon he desk request not to be speak to after the wont of great unfortunate verty seem to feel great respect for this overwhelming grief at least he do not utter any commonplace consolation he also lean upon he desk and he idle hand trace idle line upon the paper before he he dreamy eye full of quiet pleasure fix themselves upon the far distance -- he be think of redbud he finally arouse himself however and begin to work half a hour a hour another hour pass -- verty be break himself into the trace he have finish he work he rise and go to mr rushton 's door knock and open it the lawyer be not there verty look round -- he companion be absorb in write verty sit down in the lawyer 's arm-chair chapter l how verty discover a portrait and what ensue for some time the young man remain motionless and silent thinking of redbud and smile with the old proverbial delight of lover as the memory of she bright sweet face and kind eye come to he thought there be now no longer any doubt assuredly that he be what be call in love with redbud verty say as much to himself and we need not add that when this circumstance occur the individual who come to such conclusion be no longer he own master or the master of he heart which be go from he for as it be observable that person often imagine themselves affect with material ailment when there be no good ground for such a supposition so on the other hand be it true that those who labor under the disease of love be the last to know they own condition as verty therefore come to the conclusion that he must be in love with redbud we may form a tolerably correct idea of the actual fact why should he not love she redbud be so kind so tender she large liquid eye be instinct with such deep truth and goodness in she fresh frank face there be such radiant joy and purity and love surely a mortal sin to do otherwise than love she and verty congratulate himself on exemption from this sad sin of omission he sit thus look with he dreamy smile through the window across which the shadow of the autumn tree flit and play listlessly he take up a pen nibb the feather with he old odd smile and begin to scrawl absently on the sheet of paper lie before he the word he write there thus unconsciously be some which he have hear redbud utter with she soft kind voice which dwell in he memory trust in god this verty write scarcely know he do so then he throw down the pen and recline in the old lawyer 's study chair fall into one of those indian reverie which the dreamy forest seem to have teach the red man as the young man thus recline in the old walnut chair clothe in he forest costume with he profuse tangled curl and smile lip and half-closed eye bath in the vagrant gleam of golden sunlight even monsignor might have think the picture not unworthy of he pencil but he could not have reproduce the wild fine picture for in verty 's face be that dim and dreamy smile which neither pencil nor word can describe on paper or canvas at last he rouse himself and wake to the real life around he -- though he thoughtful eye be still overshadow he look around he have never be alone in mr rushton 's sanctum before and naturally regard the object before he with curiosity there be a old press cover with dust and cobweb on the top of which huge volume of justinian 's institute frown at the ceiling a row of shelf which be cram with law book a old fade carpet cover with ink-splotch on he right hand splotch evidently produce by the lawyer 's habit of shake the superfluous ink from he pen before he place it upon the paper a dilapidated chair or two the rough walnut desk at which he sit cover with papers open law volume and red tape and finally a tall mantel-piece on which stand a half-emptied ink bottle -- which mantel-piece rise over a wide fire-place surround with a low iron fender on which a dislocated pair of tong be expose in grim resignation to the evil of old age there be little to interest verty in all this -- or in the old iron-bound trunk in the corner but he eye suddenly fall on a curtain in the recess farthest from the

pretend that he have not any portion of the passionate colloquy verty could do nothing all day for thinking of the astonishing scene he have pass through why should there be anything offensive in raise the curtain of a portrait why should so good a man as mr rushton address such insulting and harsh word to he for such a trifling thing how be it possible that the simple word ` trust in god ' have be the occasion of such anger nay almost fury the longer verty ponder the less he understand or at least he understand no better than before which amount precisely to no understanding at all he get through he day after a very poor fashion and go along under the evening sky cudgel he brain for the thousandth time for some explanation of this extraordinary circumstance in vain the explanation never come and find himself near apple orchard the young man determine to banish the subject and go in and see redbud the young girl have be imprudent in remain out so late on the precede evening and she cold have return with slight fever which however give she little inconvenience she lay upon the sofa near the open window with a shawl over she foot and when verty enter half-rose only give he she hand tenderly verty sit down and they begin to talk in the old friendly way and as the evening deepen to laugh and mention old thing which they both remember -- unite thus in the dim twilight all the golden thread which bind the present to the past -- gossamer which be not visible by the glaring daylight but be see when the soft twilight descend on the earth redbud even at verty 's request essay one of the old scottish song which he be fond of and the gentle carol fill the evening with its joy and musical delight this be rather dangerous in verty -- surely he be quite enough in love already why should he rivet the fetter insist upon a new set of shackle and a heavier chain verty tell redbud of the singular circumstance of the morning and demand a explanation she wonder be as great as he own however and she remain silently gaze at the sunset and ponder a shake of the head betray she want of success in this attempt to unravel the mystery especially the lawyer 's indignation at the word write by verty they pass from this to quite a grave discussion upon the truth of the maxim in question which redbud and she companion we may imagine do not differ upon the girl have just say -- for you know verty everything be for the best and we should not murmur -- when a gruff voice at the door reply : pardon I miss redbud -- that be a pretty maxim -- nothing more however and mr rushton cold and impassable come in with the jovial squire so busy talk young people that you could not even look out the window when i approach with visitor eh cry the squire chuckle miss redbud under the chin

suffer here in this world every affliction we know that there be a bless recompense in the other world humph -- how say the skeptic by faith what be faith he say look carelessly at the girl i do not know that i can define it better than belief and trust in god say redbud these be the word which verty have write on the paper the glance of the lawyer fall upon the young man 's face and from it pass to the innocent countenance of redbud she have evidently utter the word without the least thought of the similarity humph say the lawyer frowning that be very fine miss but suppose we can not see anything to give we a very lively -- faith as you call it oh but you may sir how everywhere there be evidence of god 's goodness and mercy you can not doubt that a shadow pass over the rough face i do

that strike -- which we can only think of as arm with a avenge sword or a all-consuming firebrand pray to one who stand before we as a nemesis of wrath and terror hating and ready to crush we -- humph and the lawyer wipe he brow can not we think of the creator differently say redbud earnestly how as the be who come down upon the earth and suffer and weep tear of blood be buffet and crown with thorn and crucify like a common degraded slave -- all because he love we and would not see we perish oh mr rushton if there be man who shrink from the terrible god -- who can not love _ that _ phase of the almighty why should they not turn to the savior who god as he be come down and suffer a ignominious death because he love they -- so dearly love they mr rushton be silent for a moment then he say coldly : i do not intend to talk upon these subject -- i only intend to say that trust in providence as the phrase be sound very grand and have only the disadvantage of not be very easy come miss redbud suppose we converse on the subject of flower or something that be more light and cheerful yes sir i will but i do not think anything be more cheerful than christianity and i love to talk about

when mr jink threaten to rid the earth of a scoundrel and a villain the execution of this scheme be prevent by the interposition of a third party so on the present occasion do the neighbor interfere and quiet the combatant ralph perfect the reconciliation by declare that fodder be the most vicious and dangerous of animal and that no one could rationally wonder at he conduct on this occasion o'brallaghan thereupon observe that he despise mr jinks too much to touch he and would forgive he and so he elbow he way through the crowd of gossip and re-enter he shop scowl at and be scowl at by the severe mr jinks ralph also embrace the opportunity to slip through the crowd and hasten round a corner have achieve which movement he lean against a pump and laugh until two baby play on the side-walk nearly choke themselves with marble as they gaze at he then chuckle to himself the young-worthy return toward the tavern leave mr jinks to he fate chapter lv woman trap lay by mr jink no sooner have o'brallaghan retreat into he store than mr jinks cast after he defiant word and gesture call on the crowd to take notice that o'brallaghan have ignominiously yield ground and decline he mr jinks ' proposition to have a combat if any wonder be feel at mr jinks ' bravery we may dispel it probably by explain that mr o'brallaghan have two or three month before be bind over in a large sum to keep the peace of the commonwealth against the inhabitant of the say commonwealth and especially that portion of they who dwell in the borough of winchester which fact mr jinks be well acquaint with and shape he conduct by if there be anything which o'brallaghan prefer to a personal encounter with fist or shillelah that object be money and mr jinks know that o'brallaghan would not touch he therefore mr jinks send word of defiance and menace after the retreat individual and say to the crowd with dignified calmness : my friend i call you to bear witness that i have offer to give this -- this -- person say mr jinks the amplest satisfaction in my power for the unfortunate conduct of my animal which i have just purchase at a large sum and have not exactly learn to manage yet we have not come to understand each other -- myself and fodder -- just yet and in pass with a young man whom i kindly permit to mount behind I the animal run into the shop of this -- individual if he want satisfaction continue mr jinks frown and lay he hand upon he sword he can have it sir yes sir i be ready sir -- now and always sir these word be ostensibly address to mr o'brallaghan who be in contempt of mr jinks busily engage at he work again but in reality the whole harangue of mr jinks be intend for the ear of a person in the crowd who hold a hot iron in she hand have run up like the rest when the occurrence first take place this person who be of the opposite sex and upon whom mr jink evidently desire to produce a impression gaze at the cavalier with tender melancholy in she ruddy face and especially regard the leg of mr jinks with unconcealed admiration it be mistress o'calligan the handsome ruddy lady whom we have meet with once before on that day when mr jinks remember o'brallaghan 's incapacity to fight challenge that gentleman to mortal combat between this lady and mr jinks on the present occasion glance pass more than once and when -- o'brallaghan not appear -- mr jinks ride away from the shop of the dastard in dignified disgust he direct the step of fodder cautiously and gently around the corner and stop before the door of mistress o'calligan 's lodge the lament o'calligan be go to that bourne which we all know of and he widow now support herself and the two round dirty-faced young gentleman who have choke themselves in they astonishment at ralph by take in wash and iron to which she add occasionally the occupation and mystery of undergarment construction thanks to these toil mistress o'calligan who be yet young and handsome and strong and healthy have amass a very snug little sum of money which she have invest in a garden numerous pig chicken and other thing and in the neighborhood this lady be regard as one destine to thrive in the world and eventually bring to the successor of the lament o'calligan not only she fair self and good-humored smile include but also no contemptible portion of this world 's goods o'brallaghan 's ambition be to succeed the lament he have long make unsuccessful court to the lady -- in vain he suspect not without justice that the graceful and military mr jinks have make a impression on the lady 's heart and hate mr jinks accordingly it be before the low comfortable cottage of mistress o'calligan therefore that mr jinks stop and tie fodder to the pump he push aside the under-tunic which depend from line and be flutter in the wind and so make he entrance into the dwelling mistress o'calligan pretend to be greatly surprised and flutter on mr jinks ' entrance and lay down the iron she be try by put she finger in she mouth and then apply it to the under surface she then smile and declare she never be in such a take and to prove this sit down and pant and scream good-humoredly to the youthful o'calligan not to go near that pretty horse and then ask mr jinks if he would ` nt take something mr jinks say with great dignity that he think he would thereupon mistress o'calligan produce a flat bottle of poteen and pour a portion for she own fair self into a cup say that this be a wicked world and hand the flask to mr jinks that gentleman take a tolerably large draught and then set down the bottle scowl this terrify mistress o'calligan and she say so mr jinks explain that he be angry -- in a towering rage and add that nothing but the presence of mistress o'calligan have prevent he from exterminate o'brallaghan who be a wretched creature beneath the contempt etc whereto the lady reply really to think it but that these feeling be wrong and she be only too happy if she presence have prevent bloodsh she think that mr jinks be flattering she -- with more of the same description thus commence this interview which the loving and flattered mistress o'calligan wrongly suppose to be intend as one of courtship on the part of mr jinks she be greatly mistake if ever proceed be calm deliberate and prompt by revengeful and diabolical intention the proceeding of mr jinks on the present occasion be of that description but none of this appear upon the countenance of we friend mr jinks be himself -- he be gallant impressive and warm with the rum enter into detail of he private feeling he have ever admire and venerate -- he say -- the character of the beautiful and fascinating judith o'calligan who have alone and by she unassisted merit remove from he character that tendency toward contempt and undervaluation of woman which he be mortify to say he have be induce to feel from a early disappointment in love mistress o'calligan here look very much flurry and ejaculate lor mr jinks proceed to say that the lady need not feel any concern for he now that the early disappointment speak of have it be true cast a shadow on he life which he imagine nothing but the gory blood of he successful rival could remove that still he mr jinks have have the rare good fortune of meeting with a divine charmer who cause he to forget he past sorrow and again indulge in hope of domestic felicity and paternal happiness by the larean altar of a happy home that the vision of romance have never picture such a person that the lady whom he speak of be well know to the lady whom he address and indeed to be more explicit be not ten thousand mile from they at the moment in question this be so very broad that the lady in question blush the color of the red brick in she fire-place and declare that mr jinks be the dreadfulest creature and he need ` nt expect to persuade she that he like she -- no he need ` nt mr jinks repel the accusation of be a dreadful creature and say that however terrifying he name might be to he enemy among the man that no woman have ever yet have cause to be afraid of he or to complain of he after which mr jink frowned and take a gulp of the poteen mistress o'calligan think that mr jinks be very wrong to be talk in such a meaning way to she -- and the lament o'calligan not dead two year that she know what it be to bestow she affection on a object which object do not return they -- and never never could be bring to trust the future of those bless dear a-play on the side-walk to a gay deceiver after which observation mistress o'calligan take up a corner of she apron and make a feint to cry but not be encourage by any consternation agitation or objection of any description on the part of she companion change she mind and smile mr jinks say that if the paragon of she sex the lovely judith mean to say that he be a gay deceiver the assertion in question involve a mistake of a cruel and opprobrious character so far from be a deceiver he have himself be uniformly deceive and that in the present instance it be much more probable that he would suffer because the lovely charmer before he care nothing for he which accusation throw the lovely charmer into a flutter and cause she to deny the truth of mr jinks ' charge and in addition to assert that there exist no proof of the fact that she do ` nt care much more for mr jinks than he do for she -- and whether he say she do ` nt or do ` nt say she do ` nt still that this do ` nt change the fact : and so he be mistaken whereupon mr jinks imbibe more poteen reply that assertion though in themselves worthy of high respect when they issue from so lovely and fascinating a source could still not stand in opposition to fact mistress o'calligan ask what fact which cause mr jinks to explain he mean that the test of affection be do one a service that the loving individual would perform what the beloved wish and that here the beautiful judith be deficient to which the beautiful judith with a preparatory caution to the young o'calligan reply by say that she have never be try and if that be all the foundation for such a charge the best way to prove its falseness be to immediately test she friendship at this mr jink brighten up and lean over toward the ruddy-faced judith whisper for some minute the whisper bring to the lady 's face a variety of expression : consternation alarm doubt objection refusal refusal remain paramount mr jinks imbibe more poteen and observe with dignity that he have be perfectly well aware before make he communication that the protestation of the lady opposite to whom he sit be like those of lady in general calculate to mislead and deceive he would therefore not annoy she further but seek some other -- incipient tear from the lady who think mr jinks cruel unreasonable and too bad mr jinks be rational and have ask a very inconsiderable favor he beautiful acquaintance miss sallianna would not hesitate a moment to oblige he and he would therefore respectfully take he departure -- for some time he be afraid if not forever mr jinks have play he game with much skill and great knowledge of the lady whom he address he bring out he trump so to speak when he mention miss sallianna and allude to he intention never to return perhaps the lady could not resist the moment have arrive when she be to decide whether she should supply the youthful o'calligan with a noble father and protector or suffer they still to inhabit the dangerous side-walk in infant helplessness and expose to every enemy therefore the fair mistress o'calligan find she resolution evaporate -- she objection remove -- she consent to comply with mr jinks ' request because the object of she affection make it -- yes the object of she affection for many a long day through every accusation of cabbaged cloth and other thing bring by he enemy -- the object of she ambition the destine recipient of the garden and the chicken and the pig when fate remove she and have utter this speech with great agitation and numerous gasp mistress o'calligan yield to she nerve and repose upon mr jinks ' breast fifteen minute afterwards mr jinks be go back to bousch 's tavern mount on fodder and grimace she 'll do it sir she 'll do it say mr jinks we 'll see look out for gory blood sir and that be all chapter lvi take verty to mr roundjacket as mr

down he violin look at the old indian woman with affectionate smile and murmur : we be happy still _ ma mere _ chapter lxi mistress o'calligan 's wooer it will be remember that mr jinks have sum up the probable result of he deep lay scheme that morning when he return from mistress o'calligan 's in the strong and emphatic word-picture there will be gory blood sir now while these word strictly construe be perhaps ambiguous from a certain redundancy in the arrangement still there be little difficulty in determine what mr jinks mean death and destruction dwelt in he imagination and hold there a riotous carnival and to such a pitch of delight be we friend elevated by the triumphant anticipation of revenge upon o'brallaghan that he stalk about during the remain portion of the day talk to himself in the heroic vein and present the appearance of a imperial grasshopper arrive at the summit of felicity but mr jinks be not idle no one know better than himself that vigilance be the price pay for success and to vigilance we conspirator add cunning -- in which noble trait he be by no means deficient we have see how on return from the heroic attack upon the peace-bound o'brallaghan mr jinks throw out a series of observation which attract the attention of the landlord at the tavern and we have further see these two gentleman retire together into the hostelry with significant look and muttering of the exact nature of that interview we can not speak have nowhere discover any memorandum to guide we in the authentic document from which this history be compile but result define cause and from after event it be not improbable that mr jinks make a eloquent and stir oration address after the manner of all great orator to the prejudice of the auditor and indicative of mr jinks ' intention to overwhelm with defeat and destruction the anti-germanic league and pageant on st michael 's day that day be very near as we have see but twenty-four hour remain for the conspirator to act in and mr jinks determine not to lose the opportunity to perfect and render satisfactory he bloody revenge many thing conspire to put he in high spirit and arouse that heroic confidence feel by all great man in undertake arduous affair the landlord have be so much pleased with mr jinks ' patriotic ardor in the german cause that he generously hint at a entire obliteration of any little score chalk up against the name of jinks for board and lodging at the hostelry this be one of the circumstance which inspirit mr jinks another be the possession of a steed -- a donkey it be true but a donkey out of a thousand _ nee pluribus impar _ and not unworthy of a knight in a great and exciting contest thus it happen that when upon the follow morning mr jinks arise assume he garment and descend he face be radiant with anticipated triumph he sword clatter against he slender leg with martial significance and he brow be corrugated into a frown which indicate ruin to all those oppose to he mount upon fodder who be sleek and in high spirit owe to a good night 's rest and a plentiful supply of he favorite provender mr jinks remain for a moment irresolute before the door of the hostelry revolve in he mind various and conflicting thought of love and war should he go on he handsome animal and enact the little drama which he have arrange in he mind with miss sallianna at the bower of nature should he on this morning advance to victory and revenge in that direction or should he go and challenge he enemy verty and make he name glorious forever these conflict idea chase themselves through mr jinks ' mind and render he irresolute he be interrupt in the midst of they by a voice laughing and sonorous which cry from the direction of the gateway : hey there what now jink ' what thought occupy you mind my dear fellow and ralph come out from the yard of the tavern mount upon he handsome animal as fresh and bright-looking as himself i be reflect sir say mr jinks i have much to occupy I to-day ah well set about it -- set about it do not you know that the great element of success in life from kill a mosquito to win a empress be to strike at once and at the right moment go on jinks my boy and luck to you thanks sir reply mr jinks -- i hope i shall have luck of course because you have genius what be luck cry ralph bend down to smooth the glossy neck of he animal and laugh gaily -- why nothing but a word luck sir be nothing -- genius everything luck throw she old shoe after as say the proverb but genius catch it and conquer come you be good at everything let we have a race no i thank you say mr jinks draw back i have business sir -- important business sir have you say ralph restrain he desire to lay the lash of he whip over fodder 's back and so inaugurate a new iliad of woe for mr jinks then go on in you course my dear fellow i be go to see a young lady who really be begin to annoy I and the mercurial young fellow pass from laughter to smile and even to something suspiciously resemble a sigh farewell my dear jink he add become gay again fortune favor the brave recollect i wish i could believe it he add laugh and touch he horse ralph set forward toward the bower of nature and consequently toward miss fanny there go a young man who be in love say mr jinks with philosophic dignity regularly catch by a pair of black eye boy add mr jinks after the manner of coriolanus he do not know 'em as i do he be look out for happiness -- i for revenge and mr jinks scowl at a stable-boy until the terrify urchin hang he head in awe respect and admiration the great militaire be not superior to humanity and even this triumph elate he he set forth therefore on fodder feeling like a conqueror if this veracious history be a narrative of the life and adventure of mr jinks alone we might follow the great conspirator in he various movement on this eventful day we might show how he perambulate the town of winchester on he noble steed like a second don quixote mount for the nonce upon the courser of sancho panza while rosinante recover from he bruise though the illustration might fail if carry further inasmuch as mr jinks encounter no windmill and indeed meet with no adventure worth relate still we might speak of he prying inquisition into every movement of the hostile irish -- detail he smile visit in the character of spy to numerous domicil and relate at length the manner in which he procure the information which the noble knight desire all this we might do but be it necessary not always do the great historic muse fill up the flaw of story leave rather much to the imagination and in the present instance we might justly be accuse of undue partiality we be not sure that some of we kind reader might not go further still and declare in general term that none of mr jinks ' adventure be worth tell -- mr jinks himself be a personage wholly unworthy of attention to critic of this last description we would say in deprecation of they stricture -- friend the world be make up of a number of odd personage as the animal kingdom be of singular and not wholly pleasant creature just as the scarabaeus and the ugly insect be as much a part of animated nature as the golden-winged butterfly and humming-bird and noble eagle so be the class represent partly by we friend as human as the greatest and the best as the naturalist with laborious care define the characteristic of the ugly insect buzz and sting and prey on the weaker so must the writer give a portion of he attention to the microscopic bully braggart and boast coward of the human species in the one case it be _ science _ -- in the other _ art _ but still we shall not give too much space to mr jinks and shall proceed to detail very briefly the result of he exploration the great conspirator have by the hour of eventide procure all the information he wish that information lead mr jinks to believe that on the follow day the oppose race would turn out in number far exceed those on any previous occasion they would have a grand pageant : -- st patrick would meet st michael in deadly conflict and the result would undoubtedly overwhelm one of the combatant with defeat elevate the other to the summit of joy and victory it be mr jinks ' object to ensure the success of the worthy st michael and prostrate the great st patrick in the dust but this be not all mr jink further desire to procure a adequate revenge upon he friend o'brallaghan to overwhelm with defeat and dismay the party to which he enemy belong be not enough -- any common man could invent so plain a course as that it be mr jinks ' boast privately and to himself be it understand that he would arrange the detail of a original and refined revenge -- a revenge which should in equal degree break down the strength and spirit of he enemy and elevate the inventor to the niche of a great creative genius by the hour of nine that night all be arrange and after labor for a hour or more at some mysterious employment in the secresy of he apartment mr jinks descend and order fodder to be saddle under he arm he carry a bundle of some size and this bundle be place carefully before he on the animal this do mr jinks go forth cautiously into the night let we follow he he proceed carefully toward the western portion of the town then suddenly turn a corner and go northward then change he course and take he way eastward this be to throw enemy off the track half a hour 's ride bring he in the neighborhood of mistress o'calligan 's what do he hear a voice singing -- the voice of no less a personage than mr o'brallaghan the conspirator retrace he step for some distance -- dismount -- tie fodder to a tree-trunk and then with he bundle under he arm creep along in the shadow toward the cabin at mr o'calligan 's door sit upon the railing he perceive the portly figure of mr o'brallaghan who be sing a song of he own composition not the ditty which have come down to modern time connect with this gentleman 's name -- but another and more original madrigal the popular ditty we have every reason to believe be afterwards write by mr jinks in derision and contempt of mr o'brallaghan mr jinks creep up diabolical and gloomy thought agitate he soul and when a night-cap appear at a opening in the shutter and a flutter voice exclaim oh now -- really mr o'brallaghan the hidden spectator tremble with jealousy and rage a colloquy then ensue between the manly singer and the maiden which we need not repeat it be enough to say that mr o'brallaghan express disapprobation at the coldness of the lady the lady reply that she respect and esteem mr o'brallaghan but never never can be he owe to the fact that she be another 's mr jinks start with joy and shake he fist -- from the protect shadow -- triumphantly at the poor defeat wooer the wooer in turn grow cold and defiant he upbraid the lady he charge she with entertain a passion for the rascal and coward jinks this cause the lady to repel the insulting accusation with hauteur mr o'brallaghan think and say thereupon that she be a cruel and unnatural woman and unworthy of affection or respect mistress o'calligan wish in reply to know if mr o'brallaghan mean to call she a woman mr o'brallaghan reply that he do and that if mr jinks be present he would exterminate that gentleman as some small exhibition of the state of he feeling at be thus insult by the worst and most hard-hearted of she sex after which mr o'brallaghan clench he hand with threatening vehemence and brushing by the conceal jinks who make himself as small as possible disappear mutter vengeance mr jinks be happy radiant triumphant and as he watch the retreat wooer he frame shake with sombre merriment then he turn toward the window and laugh with cautious dignity the lady who be just close the window start and utter a exclamation of affright this however be disregard by mr jinks who draw near and stand beneath the window mistress o'calligan consider it necessary to state that she be in such a take and to ask who could have think it mr jinks do not directly reply to this question but reach up hand in the bundle and commence a whisper conversation the lady be doubtful fearful -- mr jinks grow more eloquent finally the lady melt and when mr jink clasp rapturously the red hand hang out he have triumph in fifteen minute he be on he way back to the tavern chuckle shake and triumphant all be prepared chapter lxii verty muse let we now leave the good old town of winchester and go into the hill where the brilliant autumn morning reign splendid and vigorous in the hill happy be the man who know what those word mean for only the mountain-born can understand they happy then let we say be the mountain-born we will not underrate the glory of the lowland and the atlantic shore or close we eye to the wealth of the sea the man be blind who do not catch the subtle charm of the wild wave glitter in the sun or brood over by the sullen storm but nigh gravel blind be that other whose eye be not open to the grand beauty of the mountain let we not rhapsodize or with this little bit of yellow ore venture to speak of the great pile of grandeur from whose heart it be dig up there be that about the mountain with they roar diapason of the noble pine they rugged summit and far die tint purple and gold and azure which no painter could express have the genius of titian and watteau and the atmosphere of poussin to speak over its creation no let they speak for themselves as all great thing must -- happy be he who by right of birth can understand they noble voice but there be the other and lesser mountain life -- the life of the hill autumn love these especially and happy too be they who know the charm of the breezy hill the hill where autumn pour she ruddy sunshine upon lordly pine -- rather call they palm -- shoot they slender sway trunk into the golden sea of morning and far up above wave they emerald plume in the laughing wind -- where the sward be fresh and dewy in the shiver delicious hunter 's morning -- where the arrow-wood and dogwood cluster crimson berry and the maple alder tree and tulip burn away -- set the dewy copse on fire with splendor yes autumn love the hill and pour she brawling brook swarm with leaf through thousand of hollow any one of which might make a master-piece on canvas some day we shall have they -- who know -- and even the great mountain-ranges shall be master by the come man we do not know the name of the hollow through which verty come on the bright morning of the day follow the event we have just related but autumn have never dower any spot more grandly all the tree be bright and dewy in the sunrise -- bird be singing -- and the thousand variegated color of the fall sweep on from end to end of it swallow the little stream and break against the sky like a gay fringe verty know all this and though he do not look at it he see it and he lip move cloud prick up he ear and the hound gaze at he master inquiringly but verty be muse he large dreamy eye be fix with unalterable attention upon vacancy and he drooping shoulder whereon lay the tangled mass of he chestnut hair sway regularly as he move it only mingle with he musing -- the bright scene -- and grow a part of they he scarcely see it yes he murmur yes i think i be a delaware -- a white to dream it be i mad the wild night-wind must have whisper to I while i sleep and go away laugh at I i the savage the simple savage to think this be so and yet -- yes yes -- i do think so redbud say it be thus -- redbud and the young man for a time be silent i wonder what redbud think of I he murmur again with he old dreamy smile can she find anything to like in I what be i poor poor verty -- you be very weak

cry of game -- of deer and turkey pheasant and the rest he hear with he quick ear many of these sound : the still croak of the turkey the drum of the pheasant more than once see disappear on a distant hill like a fly shadow the fallow deer which he have so often chase and shoot but on that morning he could not leave he path to follow the wild deer or slay the lesser game of which the copse be full master by a greater passion even than hunting verty draw near apple orchard -- make sign with he head to the deer to go on they way and wholly oblivious of pheasant he reach apple orchard just as the sun soar redly up above the distant forest and the old homestead wake up with it morning always smile on apple orchard and the brilliant flush seem there more brilliant still while all the happy

up all other thought -- around which the muse heart cluster all its joy and hope -- which be look forward to and dream over with longing dreamy yet excited happiness and this be the reason why the most fatal blow which the young heart can suffer be a sudden warning that there must be no more meeting no more when it dream of and cling to that thought of meeting as the life and vital blood of to-morrow -- when the heart be liquid -- the eye moist with tenderness -- the warp of think weave of golden thread -- at such a moment for the blow of the wave to fall and drown the precious argosy

dwelt fondly on every object so old and familiar and dear be it wonderful that not seldom she glance encounter verty 's and they exchange smile he face be the face of she boy playmate -- it be very old and familiar who can say that it be not more -- that it be not dear and so they pass the old gate with all its apple tree and the spot where the great tree stand through whose heart be bore the aperture for the cider press beam -- and through the slope beyond leave the overseer 's house baby and all behind and issue forth into the highway lead to the ancient borough of winchester and gaze on the happy autumn field we little heroine smile brightly and feel very thankful in she heart to he who dower she life with all that beauty and joy and happiness and ever and anon she hand would be raise absently toward she neck where it play with the old coral necklace take from the drawer in which it have be lay -- by accident we should say if there be any accident and so they approach the town chapter lxvi the hour and the necklace as they enter the town something strange seem to be go on the place be evidently in commotion a great thrill seem to run through the population who be gather at the door and window -- such of they as do not throng the street and as the hoof of the horse strike upon the beaten way a drum suddenly be hear thunder indignantly through the narrow street the crowd rush toward it -- hurry mutter arm with nondescript weapon as though the indian be come down from the mountain fastness once more and then as the cortege from apple orchard pass beyond the old fort the meaning of all the commotion be visible march slowly along in confused mass a large portion of the irish population come toward the fort and from they appearance these man seem ripe for commotion they be arm with club heavy cane bludgeon and old rusty sword and these weapon be flourish in the air in a way which seem to indicate the desire to inflict death and destruction on some hostile party which do not appear but the most singular portion of the pageant be undoubtedly the personage bear aloft by the shout crowd this be the dutch st michael himself -- portly redfaced with a necklace of sour krout clothe as have be say by mr jinks in six pair of pantaloons and resemble a hogshead st michael be bear aloft on a species of platform support on the shoulder of a dozen man and when the saint raise the huge beer glass from he knee and bury he white beard in it the sway crowd set up a shout which shake the house this be the irish defiance of the dutch : the emerald isle against the low country -- st patrick against st michael the figure of st michael be parade in defiance of the dutch -- the thunder drum and echo shout be all so many ironical and triumphant defiance the shout crowd come on tramp heavily brandish they club and eager for the fray miss lavinium become terrify the lady of the party by a unanimous vote decide that they will draw up to one side by mr rushton 's office and permit the crowd to pass mr rushton desire to advance upon the peacebreaker and engage in single combat with st michael and all he supporter the squire dissuade he -- and growl contemptuously the lawyer do not further oppose the desire of the lady then from mr rushton 's office come hastily we friend mr roundjacket -- smile flourish he ruler and point with well-bred amusement to the crowd the crowd look sidewise at mr roundjacket who return they amiable smile and brandish he ruler in pleasant recognition of hibernian friend and client in the assemblage roundjacket think the lady need not be alarm still as there will probably be a fight soon they have better get out and come in roundjacket be the public character when he speak thus -- he be flourish he ruler it be only when miss lavinium have descend that he ogle that lady suddenly however he resume he noble and lofty carriage and wave the ruler at he friend st michael -- tailor and client -- by name o'brallaghan the crowd pass on with thunder drum and defiant shout and we party from apple orchard have affix they horse to the wall near at hand gaze on the masquerade from mr rushton 's office we have give but a few word to the strange pageant which sweep on through the main street of the old border town and this because any accurate description be almost wholly impossible let the reader endeavor to imagine pandemonium break loose with all its burly inmate and thunder voice and _ outré _ form and perhaps the general idea in he mind may convey to he some impression of the rout which sweep by with its shout and mad defiance some be clothe in coat and pantaloons only other have forget the coat and expose brawny and hirsute torso to the October sun and swell muscle worthy of athlete other again be almost _ sans-culotte _ only a remnant be leave which make the deficiency more tantalizingly painful to the eye let the reader then imagine this spectacle of tear garment tattered hat and brandish club -- not forget the tatterdemalion negro child who run after the crowd in the last state of dilapidation and he will have some slight idea of the masquerade over which ride in supreme majesty the trunk-nosed mr o'brallaghan we need not repeat the observation of the lady or detail they exclamation fear and general behavior like all member of the fair sex they make a virtue of necessity and assume the most winning expression of timidity and reliance on they cavalier and even miss lavinium repose upon a settee and exclaim that it be dreadful -- very dreadful and terrifying thereat mr roundjacket rise into the hero and allude to the crowd with dignified amusement and when miss lavinium say in a low voice that other life be precious to she besides she own -- evidently refer to mr roundjacket -- that gentleman brandish he ruler and declare that life be far less valuable than she smile in another part of the room ralph and fanny laugh and jest -- opposite they mr rushton indignantly shake he fist in the direction of the crowd and vituperate the hibernian nation in a manner shocking to hear verty be lean on the mantel-piece as quietly as if there be nothing to attract he attention he have push cloud through the mass with the unimpressed carriage of the indian hunter and he dreamy eye be far away -- he listen to other sound than shout perhaps to a maiden singing the little singer -- we refer to miss redbud -- have be much terrify by the crowd and feel weak owe to the recent sickness she look round for a seat and see none the door lead into the inner sanctum of mr rushton then attract she attention and see a comfortable chair within she enter and sit down redbud utter a sigh of weariness and relief and then gaze around she the curtain be draw back

he voice charge with tear and with a slow movement of he head up and down he again desire redbud to leave he she go out : -- the last she see be mr rushton clasp the necklace to he lip and sob bitterly in the outer room they laugh and jest gaily chapter lxvii how st patrick encounter st michael and what ensue as redbud enter the outer room the talker suddenly become silent and run to the window the procession have return : -- the pageant have retrace its step : -- the sway shout battle-breathing rout have make the northern end of the town hideous and come back to make the portion already pass over still more hideous hitherto the reveller have have a clear sweep -- a unobstructed highway they have go on in power and glory conquer where there be no enemy defy where there be no adversary but this all change suddenly and a great shout roar up from a hundred mouth another drum be hear muttering from the southern end of the town respond the follower of the malign and desecrate michael be in battle array -- the dutch be out to protect they saint and meet the irish world in arm they come on in a tumultuous mass : they sway they bend they leap they shout the other half of pandemonium have turn out and surround ear be deafen by the demoniac chorus in costume they be not dissimilar to they enemy -- in rotundity they be superior however if not in brawn every other warrior hold he pipe between he tooth and all brandish nondescript weapon like they enemy the irish and as the great crowd draw near the crowning peculiarity of the pageant be reveal to wonder eye the dutch will have they defiant masquerade no less than they enemy : the irish parade st michael in derision : they 's be it to show the world a effigy of st patrick bear like st michael on a platform raise above the universal head in proud pre-eminence behold the great st patrick and he wife sheeley st patrick be tall and gaunt from he contest with the serpent of the emerald isle he wear a flow robe which nevertheless permit he slender manly leg to come out and be visible he boast a shovel hat adorn with a gigantic sprig of shamrock : he sit upon the chest in which if historical tradition truly speak the great boa constrictor of killarney be shut up and sink into the water of the lake around he neck be a string of irish potato -- in he hand a shillelah beside he sit he wife sheeley rotund and ruddy with a coronet of potato a necklace of potato a breastpin of potato -- and lastly a apron full of potato she herself resemble indeed a gigantic potatoe and philologian might have conjecture that she very name be no more than a corruption of the adjective mealy the noble saint and he wife come on thus far above the roar crowd and as they draw nearer lo the saint and sheeley be reveal the saint be personate by the heroic mr jinks -- he wife be represent by mistress o'calligan this be the grand revenge of mr jinks -- this be the sweet morsel which he have roll beneath he tongue for day -- this be the refinement of torture he have mix for the love-sick o'brallaghan who personate the oppose michael as the adversary see they opponent they roar -- as they catch sight of they patron saint thus raise aloft derisively they thunder the glove be throw the die be cast -- in a instant they be meet in deadly battle would that we acquaintance with the historic muse be sufficiently intimate to enable we to invoke she aid on this occasion but she be far away think of treaty and protocol and eventuality far in the orient brooding o'er lose sebastopol the reader therefore must be content with hasty word the first item of the battle worthy to be describe be the downward movement of the noble saint from they high position once in the melee clutch at they enemy the combatant become oblivious of saintly affair the shoulder of the platform bearer bend -- the platform tumble -- st patrick grapple with st michael who smash he pewter beer-pot down upon the shamrock the shamrock rise -- wild and overwhelmed with terror recreant to ireland and quail before michael who have stumble over sheeley mr jinks retreat through the press before o'brallaghan who pursue he with horrible ferocity breathing vengeance and on fire with rage o'brallaghan grasp jinks ' robe -- the robe be tear from he back and o'brallaghan fall backwards : then rise still overwhelm with rage jinks suddenly see a chance of escape -- he have intrust fodder to a boy who ride now in the middle of the press he tear the urchin from the saddle seize a club and leap upon fodder 's back brandish he weapon and cheer on he man to victory but accident will happen even to hero mr jinks be not a great rider -- it be he sole weak point fodder receive a blow behind start forward -- then stop kick up violently the forward movement cause the shoulder of mr jinks to fly down on the animal 's back the leg of mr jinks to rise into the air the backward movement of the donkey 's heel interpose at this moment to knock mr jinks back to he former position but he foot be out of the stirrup he can not keep he seat and suddenly he feel a hand upon he leg -- he enemy glare on he he be whirl down to the earth and o'brallaghan have catch he prey the stormy combat with its cry and shout and blow and imprecation close over they and all seem lose for jinks not so when fate seem to lower darkest sunlight come o'brallaghan have bring he stalwart fist down on mr jinks ' nose but once have scarcely cause the gory blood of that gentleman to spout forth from the natural orifice when a vigorous female hand be lay upon he collar and he turn it be mistress o'calligan sheeley come to the rescue of she husband o'brallaghan be pull from jinks -- that hero rise and attempt to flee he rush into the arm of another lady who in pass near the crowd have be catch up like a leaf and bury in the combat -- miss sallianna but fate be again adverse though impartial mr jinks and o'brallaghan be fell simultaneously by mighty blow and the rout close over they as they fall a sway motion in the crowd be feel -- the authority have arrive -- the worn-out combatant draw off sullenly and the dead and wound only be leave upon the field the crowd retire -- they have have they fight and broken numerous head they have vindicate the honor of they saint -- to-morrow they be friend and neighbor again one beautiful and touching scene be leave for aftertime -- one picture which even the historic muse might have pause near and admire two lovely dame contend for the privilege of hold a bloody warrior 's head whose nose be injure it be mr jinks miss judith and miss sallianna chapter lxviii the end of the chain we be conscious that the description of the great battle just give be but a poor and lame delineation and we can only plead defective power in that department of art -- the treatment of battle-piece we can not describe the appearance of the battle-field after the combat any more than the contest wound and crack-crowned groaning and mutter hero drag themselves away -- this be the resumé which we find it in we power alone to give one hero only seem to be seriously injured he be a man of forty-five or fifty with a heavy black beard thick sensual lip and dog-like face he be clad roughly and the few word which he utter prove that he be a german the fight have take place opposite mr rushton 's office and thither this man be bear mr rushton growl and demand how he have the audacity to break the peace the man mutter mr rushton observe that he will have he place in the stock and then send to jail the german groan suddenly mr rushton feel a hand upon he arm he turn round : it be redbud that be the man who sell I the necklace sir she say in a hesitating voice i recognize he -- it be the pedlar mr rushton start and catch the pedlar by the arm come he commence the pedlar rise without assistance sullenly prepare for the stock where do you get this necklace speak the lawyer 's eye awe the man and he stammer mr rushton grasp he by the collar and glare at he ferociously where in five minute he have make the pedlar speak -- he buy the necklace from the mother of the young man standing at the door from the indian woman yes from she mr rushton turn pale and fall into a chair verty hasten to he the lawyer rise and gaze at he with pale lip pass he hand over he brow with nervous tremble haste he hold the necklace up before verty there and say in a husky voice -- where do you mother get this verty gaze at the necklace and shake he head i do not know sir -- i do not know that it be she 's -- i think i have see it though -- yes yes long long ago -- somewhere and the young hunter 's head droop thoughtfully -- he dreamy eye seem to wander over other year then he raise he head and say abruptly : i have a strange thought sir i think i see myself -- only i be a little child -- play with that necklace somewhere in a garden -- oh how strange there be walk with box and tulip bed and in the middle a fountain -- strange i think i see indian too -- and hear a noise -- why i be dream the lawyer look at verty with wild eye which slowly very slowly fill with a strange light which make the surround personage keep silent -- so singular be this rapt expression a thought be rise on the troubled and agitate mind of the lawyer like a moon soar above the horizon he tremble and do not take he eye for a moment from the young man 's face a fountain -- indian he mutter almost inarticulately yes yes say verty with dreamy eye and crouch so to speak indian fashion until he tangled chestnut curl half cover he cheek -- yes yes -- there again -- why it be magic -- there i see it all -- i remember it i must have see it redbud he say turn to the young girl with a frightened air be i dream redbud would have speak mr rushton with a sign bid she be silent he look at the young man with the same strange look and say in a low tone : must have see what why this say verty half extend he arm and point toward a far imaginary horizon on which he dreamy eye be fix -- this do not you see it my tribe my delaware -- there in the wood they attack the house and carry off the child in the garden playing with the necklace he nurse be kill -- poor thing she blood be on the fountain now they go into the great wood with the child and a indian woman take he and will not let they kill he -- he be so pretty with he long curl like the sunshine : you might take he for a girl the indian woman hold before he a bit of looking-glass steal from the house look they will have he life -- oh and crouch with a exclamation of terror verty shudder give I my rifle he cry they be come there back and the young man rise erect with flash eye the woman fly in the night he continue become calm again they pursue she -- she escape with the boy -- they come to a desert lodge -- a lodge a lodge why it be we lodge in the hill it be _ ma mere _ and i be that child be i mad and verty raise he head and look round he with terror he eye fall upon mr rushton who breathe heavily he look rivet to he face he lip tremble seem to control some overwhelming emotion by a powerful effort the lawyer rise and lay he hand upon verty 's shoulder -- it tremble you be -- dream -- he gasp suddenly a brilliant flash dart from he eye with a movement as rapid as think he tear the clothes from the young man 's left shoulder so as to leave it bare to the armpit exactly on the rounding of the shoulder which be white and wholly free from the copper-tinge of the indian blood the company descry a burn apparently inflict in infancy the dazzled eye of the lawyer almost close -- he fall into the old leather chair and sob my son my son arthur would have faint he be revive promptly and the wonder auditor gather around he listen while he speak -- the shaggy head lean on the shoulder of verty who kneel at he foot and look up in he eye with joy and wonder yes there could be no earthly doubt that the strange word utter by the boy be so many broken and yet brilliant memory shine from the dim past : that this be he son -- the original of the portrait the now harsh and sombre lawyer when a young and happy man have marry a french lady and live on the border and he little son have after the french fashion receive for middle name he mother 's name anne -- and this have become he pet designation he likeness have be paint by a wander artist and soon after a band of delaware have attack the homestead and carry he away to the wilderness and there have remain little doubt in he father 's mind that the child have be treat as the indian be accustom to treat such captive -- mercilessly slay the picture of he be the only treasure leave to the poor broken heart when heaven have take he wife from he soon afterwards -- and in the gloom and misanthropy these torture inflict upon he this alone have be he light and solace retain for the boy he old pet name of anne he have cry in presence of the picture and be harden in spite of all against providence in the blind convulsion of he passionate regret he have even utter blasphemy and scout anything like trust in god and here now be that merciful god lead he child back to he and pardon all he sin of unbelief and enmity and hatred and say to he in word of marvellous sweetness and goodness poor soured spirit henceforth worship and trust in I yes he son arthur so long weep and mourn have come to he again -- be there before he kneel at he foot and with he arm around the boy the rugged man bent down and weep and utter in he heart a prayer for pardon and we may be sure that the man 's joy be not unshared by those around -- those kind friendly eye which look upon the father and son and rejoice in they happiness the very sunshine grow more bright it seem and when the picture be bring forth and set in he light he shine full on it and seem to laugh and bless the group with he kind light -- even the little laughing child chapter lxix conclusion we chronicle be end and we can not detain the reader longer listen to those honest kindly voice which have perhaps speak quite as much as he be willing to give ear to let we hope that in consideration of they kindness and simplicity he may pardon what appear frivolous -- see that humanity beat under all and kindness -- like the gentle word of the poet -- be always gain the history be therefore do and all end here upon the bourne of comedy redbud with all she purity and tenderness -- verty with he forest instinct and simplicity -- the lawyer and poet and the rest must go again into silence from which they come they be go away now and they voice sound no more they eye beam no longer all they merry quip and sigh they grief and laughter die away -- the comedy be end do not think harshly of the poor writer who regret to part with they -- who feel that he must miss they silent company in the long hour of the come autumn night poor puppet of the imagination some may say what be all this mock regret no no not only of the imagination : of the heart as well this say all be say but perhaps a few word of the after fate of verty and the rest may not be inappropriate the two kind heart which love each other so -- verty and redbud -- be marry in due course of time : and ralph and fanny too miss lavinium and the poet of chancery -- mistress o'calligan and the knight of the shears -- miss sallianna and the unfortunate jinks -- all these pair ere long be unite mr jinks perfect he revenge upon miss sallianna as he think by marry she -- but we believe the result of he revenge be misery mistress o'calligan accept the hand of mr o'brallaghan upon hearing of this base desertion and so the desire of all be accomplish -- for weal or woe be sure _ ma mere _ live with verty and redbud all she day thereafter and we honest verty often mount cloud and go away on bright October morning to the hill and visit the old hunting lodge : and smooth thoughtfully the ancient head of longear ponder on that strange wild dream of the far past which slowly develop itself under the hand of he the author and life indeed who bring the light and one day standing there beside the old hunting lodge with redbud verty as we still would call he point to the sky and press with he encircle arm the young form say simply : how good and merciful he be -- to give I all this happiness --
