produce by thaadd and the pg distribute proofread team _ be mar habitable _ a critical examination of professor percival lowell 's book mar and its canal with a alternative explanation by alfred russel wallace fr etc preface this small volume be commence as a review article on professor percival lowell 's book _ mar and its canal _ with the object of show that the large amount of new and interesting fact contain in this work do not invalidate the conclusion i have reach in 1902 and state in my book on _ man 's place in the universe _ that mar be not habitable but the more complete presentation of the opposite view in the volume now under discussion require a more detailed examination of the various physical problem involve and as the subject be one of great popular as well as scientific interest i determine to undertake the task this be render the more necessary by the fact that in July last professor lowell publish in the _ philosophical magazine _ a elaborate mathematical article claim to demonstrate that notwithstanding its much greater distance from the sun and its excessively thin atmosphere mar possess a climate on the average equal to that of the south of england and in its polar and sub-polar region even less severe than that of the earth such a contention of course require to be deal with and lead I to collect information bearing upon temperature in all its aspect and so enlarge my criticism that i see it would be necessary to issue it in book form two of my mathematical friend have point out the chief omission which vitiate professor lowell 's mathematical conclusion -- that of a failure to recognize the very large conservative and _ cumulative _ effect of a dense atmosphere this very point however i have already myself discuss in chapter vi and by means of some remarkable research on the heat of the moon and a investigation of the cause of its very low temperature i have i think demonstrate the incorrectness of mr lowell 's result in my last chapter in which i briefly summarise the whole argument i have further strengthen the case for very severe cold in mar by adduce the rapid lowering of temperature universally cause by diminution of atmospheric pressure as manifest in the well-known phenomenon of temperate climate at moderate height even close to the equator cold climate at greater height even on extensive plateau culminate in arctic climate and perpetual snow at height where the air be still far denser than it be on the surface of mar this argument itself be in my opinion conclusive but it be enforce by two other equally complete neither of which be adequately meet by mr lowell the careful examination which i have be lead to give to the whole of the phenomenon which mar present and especially to the discovery of mr lowell have lead I to what i hope will be consider a satisfactory physical explanation of they this explanation which occupy the whole of my seventh chapter be found upon a special mode of origin for mar derive from the meteoritic hypothesis now very widely adopt by astronomer and physicist then by a comparison with certain well-known and widely spread geological phenomenon i show how the great feature of mar -- the ` canal ' and ` oasis ' -- may have be cause this chapter will perhaps be the most interesting to the general reader as furnish a quite natural explanation of feature of the planet which have be term ` non-natural ' by mr lowell incidentally also i have be lead to a explanation of the highly volcanic nature of the moon 's surface this seem to I absolutely to require some such origin as sir george darwin have give it and thus furnish corroborative proof of the accuracy of the hypothesis that we moon have have a unique origin among the known satellite in have be throw off from the earth itself i be indebted to professor j h poynting of the university of birmingham for valuable suggestion on some of the more difficult point of mathematical physics here discuss and also for the critical note -lrb- at the end of chapter v -rrb- on professor lowell 's estimate of the temperature of mar broadstone dorset _ October _ 1907 table of contents

early observer of mar few person except astronomer fully realize that of all the planet of the solar system the only one whose solid surface have be see with certainty be mar and very fortunately that be also the only one which be sufficiently near to we for the physical feature of the surface to be determine with any accuracy even if we could see it in the other planet of venus we probably see only the upper surface of its cloudy atmosphere -lrb- 1 -rrb- as regard jupiter and saturn this be still more certain since they low density will only permit of a comparatively small proportion of they huge bulk be solid they belt be but the cloud-stratum of they upper atmosphere perhaps thousand of mile above they solid surface and a somewhat similar condition seem to prevail in the far more remote planet uranus and neptune it have thus happen that although as telescopic object of interest and beauty the marvellous ring of saturn the belt and ever-changing aspect of the satellite of jupiter and the moon-like phase of venus together with its extreme brilliancy still remain unsurpassed yet the greater amount of detail of these feature when examine with the powerful instrument of the nineteenth century have neither add much to we knowledge of the planet themselves or lead to any sensational theory calculate to attract the popular imagination -lrb- footnote 1 : mercury also seem to have a scanty atmosphere but as its mass be only one-thirtieth that of the earth it can retain only the heavier gas and its atmosphere may be dust-laden as be that of mar accord to mr lowell its dusky marking as see by schiaparellus seem to be permanent and they be also for considerable period unchangeable in position indicate that the planet keep the same face towards the sun as do venus this be confirm by mr lowell in 1896 its distance from we and unfavourable position for observation must prevent we from obtain any detailed knowledge of its actual surface though its low reflective power indicate that the surface may be really visible -rrb- but in the case of mar the progress of discovery have have a very different result the most obvious peculiarity of this planet -- its polar snow-cap -- be see about 250 year ago but they be first prove to increase and decrease alternately in the summer and winter of each hemisphere by sir william herschell in the latter part of the eighteenth century this fact give the impulse to that idea of similarity in the condition of mar and the earth which the recognition of many large dusky patch and streak as water and the more ruddy and brighter portion as land further increase add to this a day only about half a hour longer than we own and a succession of season of the same character as ours but of nearly double the length owe to its much longer year seem to leave little want to render this planet a true earth on a smaller scale it be therefore very natural to suppose that it must be inhabit and that we should some day obtain evidence of the fact _ the canal discover by schiaparellus _ hence the great interest excite when schiaparellus at the milan observatory during the very favourable opposition of 1877 and 1879 observe that the whole of the tropical and temperate region from 60 ° n to 60 ° s lat be cover with a remarkable network of broader curved and narrower straight line of a dark color at each successive favourable opposition these strange object call _ canali _ -lrb- channel -rrb- by they discoverer but rather misleadingly ` canal ' in england and america be observe by means of all the great telescope in the world and they reality and general feature become well establish in schiaparellus 's first map they be represent as be much broader and less sharply define than he himself and other observer find by later and equally favourable observation that they really be _ discovery of the double canal _ in 1881 another strange feature be discover by schiaparellus who find that about twenty canal which have previously be see single be now distinctly double that be that they consist of two parallel line equally distinct and either very close together or a considerable distance apart this curious appearance be at first think to be due to some instrumental defect or optical illusion but as it be soon confirm by other observer with the best instrument and in widely different locality it become in time accept as a real phenomenon of the planet 's surface _ round spot discover in _ 1892 at the favourable opposition of 1892 mr w h pickering notice that besides the ` sea ' of various size there be numerous very small black spot apparently quite circular and occur at every intersection or starting-point of the ` canal ' many of these have be see by schiaparellus as larger and ill-defined dark patch and be term sea or lake but mr pickering 's observatory be at arequipa in peru about 8000 foot above the sea and with such perfect atmospheric condition as be in he opinion equal to a doubling of telescopic aperture they be soon detect by other observer especially by mr lowell in 1894 who thus write of they : scatter over the orange-ochre groundwork of the continental region of the planet be any number of dark round spot how many there may be it be not possible to state as the better the see the more of they there seem to be in spite however of they great number there be no instance of one unconnected with a canal what be more there be apparently none that do not lie at the junction of several canal reversely all the junction appear to be provide with spot plot upon a globe they and they connect canal make a most curious network over all the orange-ochre equatorial part of the planet a mass of line and knot the one mark be as omnipresent as the other _ change of color recognize _ during the opposition of 1892 and 1894 it be fully recognize that a regular course of change occur dependent upon the succession of the season as have be first suggest by schiaparellus as the polar snow melt the adjacent sea appear to overflow and spread out as far as the tropics and be often see to assume a distinctly green color these remarkable change and the extraordinary phenomenon of perfect straight line cross each other over a large portion of the planet 's surface with the circular spot at they intersection have such a appearance of artificiality that the idea that they be really ` canal ' make by intelligent being for purpose of irrigation be first hint at and then adopt as the only intelligible explanation by mr lowell and a few other person this at once seize upon the public imagination and be spread by the newspaper and magazine over the whole civilised world _ existence of sea doubt _ at this time -lrb- 1894 -rrb- it begin to be doubt whether there be any sea at all on mar professor pickering think they be far more limited in size than have be suppose and even might not exist as true sea professor barnard with the lick thirty-six inch telescope discern a astonishing wealth of detail on the surface of mar so intricate minute and abundant that it baffle all attempt to delineate it and these peculiarity be see upon the suppose sea as well as on the land-surface in fact under the best condition these ` sea ' lose all trace of uniformity they appearance be that of a mountainous country break by ridge rift and canyon see from a great elevation as we shall see later on these doubt soon become certainty and it be now almost universally admit that mar possess no permanent body of water chapter ii mr percival lowell 's discovery and theory _ the observatory in arizona _ in 1894 after a careful search for the best atmospheric condition mr lowell establish he observatory near the town of flagstaff in arizona in a very dry and uniform climate and at a elevation of 7300 foot above the sea he then possess a fine equatorial telescope of 18 inch aperture and 26 foot focal length besides two smaller one all of the best quality to these he add in 1896 a telescope with 24 inch object glass the last work of the celebrated firm of alvan clark & son with which he have make he later discovery he thus become perhaps more favourably situate than any astronomer in the northern hemisphere and during the last twelve year have make a specialty of the study of mar besides do much valuable astronomical work on other planet _ mr lowell 's recent book upon mar _ in 1905 mr lowell publish a illustrated volume give a full account of he observation of mar from 1894 to 1903 chiefly for the use of astronomer and he have now give we a popular volume summarise the whole of he work on the planet and publish both in america and england by the macmillan company this very interesting volume be fully illustrate with twenty plate four of they color and more than forty figure in the text show the great variety of detail from which the larger general map have be construct _ non-natural feature of mar _ but what render this work especially interesting to all intelligent reader be that the author have here for the first time fully set forth he view both as to the habitability of mar and as to its be actually inhabit by being comparable with ourselves in intellect the larger part of the work be in fact devote to a detailed description of what he term the ` non-natural feature ' of the planet 's surface include especially a full account of the ` canal ' single and double the ` oasis ' as he term the dark spot at they intersection and the vary visibility of both depend partly on the martian season while the five conclude chapter deal with the possibility of animal life and the evidence in favor of it he also uphold the theory of the canal have be construct for the purpose of ` husband ' the scanty water-supply that exist and throughout the whole of this argument he clearly show that he consider the evidence to be satisfactory and that the only intelligible explanation of the whole of the phenomenon he so clearly set forth be that the inhabitant of mar have carry out on they small and naturally inhospitable planet a vast system of irrigation-works far greater both in its extent in its utility and its effect upon they world as a habitation for civilised being than anything we have yet do upon we earth where we destructive agency be perhaps more prominent than those of a improving and recuperative character _ a challenge to the thinking world _ this volume be therefore in the nature of a challenge not so much to astronomer as to the educate world at large to investigate the evidence for so portentous a conclusion to do this require only a general acquaintance with modern science more especially with mechanic and physics while the main contention -lrb- with which i shall chiefly deal -rrb- that the feature term ` canal ' be really work of art and necessitate the presence of intelligent organic being require only care and judgment in draw conclusion from admit fact as i have already pay some attention to this problem and have express the opinion that mar be not habitable -lrb- 2 -rrb- judge from the evidence then available and as few man of science have the leisure require for a careful examination of so speculative a subject i propose here to point out what the fact as state by mr lowell himself do _ not _ render even probable much less prove incidentally i may be able to adduce evidence of a more or less weighty character which seem to negative the possibility of any high form of animal life on mar and _ a fortiorus _ the development of such life as might culminate in a be equal or superior to ourselves as most popular work on astronomy for the last ten year at least as well as many scientific periodical and popular magazine have reproduce some of the map of mar by schiaparellus lowell and other the general appearance of its surface will be familiar to most reader who will thus be fully able to appreciate mr lowell 's account of he own further discovery which i may have to quote one of the _ best _ of these map i be able to give as a frontispiece to this volume and to this i shall mainly refer -lrb- footnote 2 : _ man 's place in the universe _ p 267 -lrb- 1903 -rrb- -rrb- _ the canal as describe by mr lowell _ in the clear atmosphere of arizona mr lowell have be able on various favourable occasion to detect a network of straight line meet or cross each other at various angle and often extend to a thousand or even over two thousand mile in length they be see to cross both the light and the dark region of the planet 's surface often extend up to or start from the polar snow-cap most of these line be so fine as only to be visible on special occasion of atmospheric clearness and steadiness which hardly ever occur at lowland station even with the best instrument and almost all be see to be as perfectly straight as if draw with a ruler _ the double canal _ under exceptionally favourable condition many of the line that have be already see single appear double -- a pair of equally fine line exactly parallel throughout they whole length and appear as mr lowell say clear cut upon the disc its twin line like the rail of a railway track both schiaparellus and lowell be at first so surprised at this phenomenon that they think it must be a optical illusion and it be only after many observation in different year and by the application of every conceivable test that they both become convinced that they witness a real feature of the planet 's surface mr lowell say he have now see they hundred of time and that he first view of one be ` the most startlingly impressive ' sight he have ever witness _ dimension of the canal _ a few dimension of these strange object must be give in order that reader may appreciate they full strangeness and inexplicability out of more than four hundred canal see and record by mr lowell fifty-one or about one eighth be either constantly or occasionally see to be double the appearance of duplicity be more or less periodical of ` canal ' generally mr lowell state that they vary in length from a few hundred to a few thousand mile long one of the largest be the phison which he term ' a typical double canal ' and which be say to be 2250 mile long while the distance between its two constituent be about 130 mile -lrb- 3 -rrb- the actual width of each canal be from a minimum of about a mile up to several mile in one case over twenty a great feature of the double be that they be strictly parallel throughout they whole course and that in almost all case they be so truly straight as to form part of a great circle of the planet 's sphere a few however follow a gradual but very distinct curve and such of these as be double present the same strict parallelism as those which be straight -lrb- footnote 3 : this be on the opposite side of mar from that show in the frontispiece -rrb- _ canal extend across the sea _ it be only after seventeen year of observation of the canal that it be find that they extend also into and across the dark spot and surface which by the earlier observer be term sea and which then form the only clearly distinguishable and permanent mark on the planet 's surface at the present time professor lowell state that this curious triangulation have be trace over almost every portion of the planet 's surface whether dark or light whether greenish ochre or brown in color in some part they be much closer together than in other form a perfect network of line and spot so that to identify they all be a matter of extreme difficulty two such portion be figure at page 247 and 256 of mr lowell 's volume _ the oasis _ the curious circular black spot which be see at the intersection of many of the canal and which in some part of the surface be very numerous be say to be more difficult of detection than even the line be often blur or render completely invisible by slight irregularity in we own atmosphere while the canal themselves continue visible about 180 of these have now be find and the more prominent of they be estimate to vary from 75 to 100 mile in diameter there be however many much smaller down to minute and barely visible black point yet they all seem a little larger than the canal which enter they where the canal be double the spot -lrb- or ` oasis ' as mr lowell term they -rrb- lie between the two parallel canal no one can read this book without admiration for the extreme perseverance in long continued and successful observation the result of which be here record and i myself accept unreservedly the substantial accuracy of the whole series it must however always be remember that the growth of knowledge of the detailed marking have be very gradual and that much of it have only be see under very rare and exceptional condition it be therefore quite possible that if at some future time a further considerable advance in instrumental power should be make or a still more favourable locality be find the new discovery might so modify present appearance as to render a satisfactory explanation of they more easy than it be at present but though i wish to do the fullest justice to mr lowell 's technical skill and long year of persevere work which have bring to light the most complex and remarkable appearance that any of the heavenly body present to we i be oblige absolutely to part company with he as regard the startling theory of artificial production which he think alone adequate to explain they so much be this the case that the very phenomenon which to he seem to demonstrate the intervention of intelligent being work for the improvement of they own environment be those which seem to I to bear the unmistakable impress of be due to natural force while they be wholly unintelligible as be useful work of art i refer of course to the great system of what be term ` canal ' whether single or double of these i shall give my own interpretation later on chapter iii the climate and physiography of mar mr lowell admit and indeed urge strongly that there be no permanent body of water on mar that the dark space and spot think by the early observer to be sea be certainly not so now though they may have be at a earlier period that true cloud be rare even if they exist the appearance that have be take for they be either dust-storm or a surface haze that there be consequently no rain and that large portion -lrb- about two-third -rrb- of the planet 's surface have all the characteristic of desert region _ snow-cap the only source of water _ this state of thing be suppose to be ameliorate by the fact of the polar snow which in the winter cover the arctic and about half the temperate region of each hemisphere alternately the maximum of the northern snow-cap be reach at a period of the martian winter correspond to the end of February with we about the end of march the cap begin to shrink in size -lrb- in the northern hemisphere -rrb- and this go on so rapidly that early in the June of mar it be reduce to its minimum about the same time change of color take place in the adjacent darker portion of the surface which become at first bluish and later a decide blue-green but by far the larger portion include almost all the equatorial region of the planet remain always of a reddish-ochre tint -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : in 1890 at mount wilson californium mr wh pickering 's photograph of mar on April 9th show the southern polar cap of moderate dimension but with a large dim adjacent area twenty-four hour later a corresponding plate show this same area brilliantly white the result apparently of a great martian snowfall in 1882 the same observer witness the steady disappearance of 1600000 square mile of the southern snow-cap a area nearly one-third of that hemisphere of the planet -rrb- the rapid and comparatively early disappearance of the white covering be very reasonably suppose to prove that it be of small thickness corresponding perhaps to about a foot or two of snow in north-temperate america and europe and that by the increase amount of sun-heat it be convert partly into liquid and partly into vapor coincident with this disappearance and as a presumed result of the water -lrb- or other liquid -rrb- produce inundation the bluish-green tinge which appear on the previously dark portion of the surface be suppose to be due to a rapid growth of vegetation but the evidence on this point do not seem to be clear or harmonious for in the four color plate show the planet 's surface at successive martian date from December 30th to February 21st not only be a considerable extent of the south temperate zone show to change rapidly from bluish-green to chocolate-brown and then again to bluish-green but the portion furthest from the suppose fertilise overflow be permanently green as be also considerable portion in the opposite or northern hemisphere which one would think would then be completely dry up _ no hill upon mar _ the special point to which i here wish to call attention be this mr lowell 's main contention be that the surface of mar be wonderfully smooth and level not only be there no mountain but there be no hill or valley or plateau this assumption be absolutely essential to support the other great assumption that the wonderful network of perfectly straight line over nearly the whole surface of the planet be irrigation canal it be not allege that irregularity or undulation of a few hundred or even one or two thousand of foot could possibly be detect while certainly all we know of planetary formation or structure point strongly towards _ some _ inequality of surface mr lowell admit that the dark portion of the surface when examine on the terminator -lrb- the margin of the illuminate portion -rrb- do _ look _ like hollow and _ may be _ the bed of dried-up sea yet the suppose canal run across these old sea-bed in perfect straight line just as they do across the many thousand mile of what be admit to be desert -- which he describe in these forcible term : pitiless as we desert be they be but faint forecast of the state of thing existent on mar at the present time it appear then that mr lowell have to face this dilemma -- _ only if the whole surface of mar be a almost perfect level could the enormous network of straight canal each from hundred to thousand of mile long have be possibly construct by intelligent being for purpose of irrigation but if a complete and universal level surface exist no such system would be necessary _ for on a level surface -- or on a surface slightly incline from the pole towards the equator which would be advantageous in either case -- the melting water would of itself spread over the ground and naturally irrigate as much of the surface as it be possible for it to reach if the surface be not level but consist of slight elevation and expression to the extent of a few score or a few hundred of foot then there would be no possible advantage in cut straight trough through these elevation in various direction with water flow at the bottom of they in neither case and in hardly any conceivable case could these perfectly straight canal cut across each other in every direction and at very vary angle be of any use or be the work of a intelligent race if any such race could possibly have be develop under the adverse condition which exist in mar _ the scanty water-supply _ but further if there be any superfluity of water derive from the melting snow beyond what be sufficient to moisten the hollow indicate by the darker portion of the surface which at the time the water reach they acquire a green tint -lrb- a superfluity under the circumstance highly improbable -rrb- that superfluity could be best utilise by widen however little the border to which natural overflow have carry it any attempt to make that scanty surplus by means of overflow canal travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere through such a terrible desert region and expose to such a cloudless sky as mr lowell describe would be the work of a body of madman rather than of intelligent being it may be safely assert that not one drop of water would escape evaporation or insoak at even a hundred mile from its source -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : what the evaporation be likely to be in mar may be estimate by the fact state by professor jw gregory in he recent volume on ` australium ' in _ stanford 's compendium _ that in north-west victorium evaporation be at the rate of ten foot per annum while in central australium it be very much more the greatly diminish atmospheric pressure in mar will probably more than balance the loss of sun-heat in produce rapid evaporation -rrb- _ miss clerke on the scanty water-supply _ on this point i be support by no less a authority than the historian of modern astronomy the late miss agne clerke in the _ edinburgh review _ -lrb- of October 1896 -rrb- there be a article entitle ` new view about mar ' exhibit the writer 's characteristic fulness of knowledge and charm of style speaking of mr lowell 's idea of the ` canal ' carry the surplus water across the equator far into the opposite hemisphere for purpose of irrigation there -lrb- which we see he again state in the present volume -rrb- miss clerke write : we can hardly imagine so shrewd a people as the irrigator of thule and hella -lrb- 6 -rrb- waste labor and the life-giving fluid after so unprofitable a fashion there be every reason to believe that the martian snow-cap be quite flimsy structure they material might be call snow _ soufflé _ since owe to the small power of gravity on mar snow be almost three time lighter there than here consequently its own weight can have very little effect in render it compact nor indeed be there time for much settle down the calotte do not form until several month after the winter solstice and it begin to melt as a rule shortly after the vernal equinox -lrb- the interval between these two epoch in the southern hemisphere of mar be 176 day -rrb- the snow lie on the ground at the outside a couple of month at time it melt while it be still fresh fall thus at the opposition of 1881-82 the spreading of the northern snow be delay until seven week after the equinox : and they have accordingly no sooner reach they maximum than they begin to decline and professor pickering 's photograph of April 9th and 10th 1890 prove that the southern calotte may assume its definitive proportion in a single night -lrb- footnote 6 : area on mar so name -rrb- no attempt have yet be make to estimate the quantity of water derivable from the melting of one of these formation yet the experiment be worth try as a help towards define idea let we grant that the average depth of snow in they of the delicate martian kind be twenty foot equivalent at the most to one foot of water the maximum area cover of 2400000 square mile be nearly equal to that of the united state while the whole globe of mar measure 55500000 square mile of which one-third on the present hypothesis be under cultivation and in need of water nearly the whole of the dark area as we know be situate in the southern hemisphere of which they extend over at the very least 17000000 square mile that be to say they cover a area in round number seven time that of the snow-cap only one-seventh of a foot of water accordingly could possibly be make available for they fertilisation suppose they to get the entire advantage of the spring freshet upon a stint of less than two inch of water these fertile land be expect to flourish and bear abundant crop and since they completely enclose the polar area they be necessarily serve first the great emissary for carry off the surplus of they aqueous riches would then appear to be superfluous construction nor be it likely that the share in those riches due to the canal and oasis intricately divide up the wide dry continental plain can ever be realize we have assume in we little calculation that the entire contents of a polar hood turn to water but in actual fact a considerable proportion of they must pass directly into vapor omit the intermediate stage even with we a large quantity of snow be remove aerially and in the rare atmosphere of mar this cause of waste must be especially effective thus the polar reservoir be despoil in the act of be open further objection might be take to mr lowell 's irrigation scheme but enough have be say to show that it be hopelessly unworkable it will be see that the writer of this article accept the existence of water on mar on the testimony of sir w huggin which in view of later observation he have himself acknowledge to be valueless dr johnstone stoney 's proof of its absence derive from the molecular theory of gas have not then be make public _ description of some of the canal _ at the end of he volume mr lowell give a large chart of mar on mercator 's projection show the canal and other feature see during the opposition of 1905 this contain many canal not show on the map here reproduce -lrb- see frontispiece -rrb- and some of the difference between the two be very puzzling look at we map which show the north-polar snow below so that the south pole be out of the view at the top of the map the central feature be the large spot ascraeeus lucus from which ten canal diverge centrally and four from the side form wide double canal fourteen in all there be also a canal name ulyss which here pass far to the right of the spot but in the large chart enter it centrally look at we map we see go downward a little to the leave the canal udon which run through a dark area quite to the outer margin in the dark area however there be show on the chart a spot aspledon lucus where five canal meet and if this be take as a terminus the udon canal be almost exactly 2000 mile long and another on its right lapadon be the same length while ich run in a slightly curved line to a large spot -lrb- lucus castorius on the chart -rrb- be still longer the ulyss canal which -lrb- on the chart -rrb- run straight from the point of the mare sirenum to the astraeeus lucus be about 2200 mile long other however be even longer and mr lowell say : with they 2000 mile be common while many exceed 2500 and the eumenides-orcus be 3540 mile from the point where it leave lucus phoeniceus to where it enter the trivium charonti this last canal be barely visible on we map its commencement be indicate by the word eumenide the trivium charonti be situate just beyond the right-hand margin of we map it be a triangular dark area the side about 200 mile long and it be show on the chart as be the center from which radiate thirteen canal another center be aquae calida situate at the point of a dark area run obliquely from 55 ° to 35 ° n latitude and as show on a map of the opposite hemisphere to we map have nearly twenty canal radiate from it in almost every direction here at all event there seem to be no special connection with the polar snow-cap and the radiate line seem to have no intelligent purpose whatever but be such as might result from fracture in a glass globe produce by firing at it with very small shot one at a time take the whole series of they mr lowell very justly compare they to a network which triangulate the surface of the planet like a geodetic survey into polygon of all shape and size at the very lowest estimate the total length of the canal observe and map by mr lowell must be over a hundred thousand mile while he assure we that number of other have be see over the whole surface but so faintly or on such rare occasion as to elude all attempt to fix they position with certainty but these be of the same character and evidently form part of the same system must also be artificial and thus we be lead to a system of irrigation of almost unimaginable magnitude on a planet which have no mountain no river and no rain to support it whose whole water-supply be derive from polar snow the amount of which be ludicrously inadequate to need any such world-wide system while the low atmospheric pressure would lead to rapid evaporation thus greatly diminish the small amount of moisture that be available everyone must i think agree with miss clerke that even admit the assumption that the polar snow consist of frozen water the excessively scanty amount of water thus obtain would render any scheme of world-wide distribution of it hopelessly unworkable the very remarkable phenomenon of the duplication of many of the line together with the darkspot -- the so-called oasis -- at they intersection be doubtless all connect in some unknown way with the constitution and past history of the planet but on the theory of the whole be work of art they certainly do _ not _ help to remove any of the difficulty which have be show to attend the theory that the single line represent artificial canal of irrigation with a strip of verdure on each side of they produce by they overflow _ lowell on the purpose of the canal _ before leave this subject it will be well to quote mr lowell 's own word as to the suppose perfectly level surface of mar and he interpretation of the origin and purpose of the ` canal ' : a body of planetary size if unrotating become a sphere except for solar tidal deformation if rotate it take on a spheroidal form exactly expressive so far as observation go of the so-called centrifugal force at work mar present such a figure be flatten out to correspond to its axial rotation its surface therefore be in fluid equilibrium or in other word a particle of liquid at any point of its surface at the present time would stay where it be devoid of inclination to move elsewhere now the water which quicken the verdure of the canal move from the pole down to the equator as the season advance this it do then irrespective of gravity no natural force propel it and the inference be forthright and inevitable that it be artificially help to its end there seem to be no escape from this deduction water only flow downhill and there be no such thing as downhill on a surface already in fluid equilibrium a few canal might presumably be so situate that they flow could by inequality of terrane lie equatorward but not allnow it be not in particular but by general consent that the canal-system of mar develop from pole to equator from the respective time at which the minimum take place it appear that the canal quicken occupy fifty-two day as evidence by the successive vegetal darkening to descend from latitude 72 ° north to latitude 0 ° a journey of 2650 mile this give for the water a speed of fifty-one mile a day or 21 mile a hour the rate of progression be remarkably uniform and this abet the deduction as to assisted transference but the fact be more unnatural yet the growth pay no regard to the equator but proceed across it as if it do not exist into the planet 's other hemisphere here be something still more telling than travel to this point for even if we suppose for the sake of argument that natural force take the water down to the equator they action must there be certainly reverse and the equator prove a dead-line to pass which be impossible -lrb- pp 374-5 -rrb- i think my reader will agree with I that this whole argument be one of the most curious ever put forth seriously by a eminent man of science because the polar compression of mar be about what calculation show it ought to be in accordance with its rate of rotation its surface be in a state of ` fluid equilibrium ' and must therefore be absolutely level throughout but the polar compression of the earth equally agree with calculation therefore its surface be also in ` fluid equilibrium ' therefore it also ought to be as perfectly level on land as it be on the ocean surface but as we know this be very far from be the case why must it be so in mar be we to suppose mar to have be form in some totally different way from other planet and that there neither be nor ever have be any reaction between its interior and exterior force again the assumption of perfect flatness be directly oppose to all observation and all analogy with what we see on the earth and moon it give no account whatever of the numerous and large dark patch once term sea but now find to be not so and to be full of detailed marking and vary depths of shadow to suppose that these be all the same dead-level as the light-coloured portion be assume to be imply that the darkness be one of material and color only not of diversified contour which again be contrary to experience since difference of material with we always lead to difference in rate of degradation and hence of diversified contour as these dark space actually show themselves under favourable condition to independent observer _ lowell on the system of canal as a whole _ we will now see what mr lowell claim to be the plain teaching of the ` canal ' as a whole : but last and all-embracing in its import be the system which the canal form instead of run at hap-hazard the canal be interconnect in a most remarkable manner they seek centre instead of avoid they the centre be link thus perfectly one with another a arrangement which could not result from centre whether of explosion or otherwise which be themselves discrete furthermore the system cover the whole surface of the planet dark area and light one alike a world-wide distribution which exceed the bound of natural possibility any force which could act longitudinally on such a scale must be limit latitudinally in its action as witness the belt of jupiter and the spot upon the sun rotational climatic or other physical cause could not fail of zonal expression yet these line be grandly indifferent to such compete influence finally the system after mesh the surface in its entirety run straight into the polar cap it be then a system whose end and aim be the tap of the snow-cap for the water there semi-annually let loose then to distribute it over the planet 's face -lrb- p 373 -rrb- here again we have curiously weak argument adduce to support the view that these numerous straight line imply work of art rather than of nature especially in the comparison make with the belt of jupiter and the spot on the sun both purely atmospheric phenomenon whereas the line on mar be on the solid surface of the planet why should there be any resemblance between they every fact state in the above quotation always keep in mind the physical condition of the planet -- its very tenuous atmosphere and rainless desert-surface -- seem wholly in favor of a purely natural as oppose to a artificial origin and at the close of this discussion i shall suggest one which seem to I to be at least possible and to explain the whole series of the phenomenon set forth and largely discover by mr lowell in a simpler and more probable manner than do he tremendous assumption of they be work of art reader who may not possess mr lowell 's volume will find three of he most recent map of the ` canal ' reproduce in _ nature _ of October 11th 1906 chapter iv be animal life possible on mar have now show that even admit the accuracy of all mr lowell 's observation and provisionally accept all he chief conclusion as to the climate the nature of the snow-cap the vegetation and the animal life of mar yet he interpretation of the line on its surface as be veritably ` canal ' construct by intelligent being for the special purpose of carry water to the more arid region be wholly erroneous and rationally inconceivable i now proceed to discuss he more fundamental position as to the actual habitability of mar by a highly organised and intellectual race of material organic being _ water and air essential to life _ here fortunately the issue be render very simple because mr lowell fully recognize the identity of the constitution of matter and of physical law throughout the solar-system and that for any high form of organic life certain condition which be absolutely essential on we earth must also exist in mar he admit for example that water be essential that a atmosphere contain oxygen nitrogen aqueous vapor and carbonic acid gas be essential and that a abundant vegetation be essential and these of course involve a surface-temperature through a considerable portion of the year that render the existence of these -- especially of water -- possible and available for the purpose of a high and abundant animal life _ blue color the only evidence of water _ in attempt to show that these essential actually exist on mar he be not very successful he adduce evidence of a atmosphere but of a exceedingly scanty one since the greatest amount he can give to it be -- not more than about four inch of barometric pressure as we reckon it -lrb- 7 -rrb- and he assume as he have a fair right to do till disprove that it consist of oxygen and nitrogen with carbon-dioxide and water-vapour in approximately the same proportion as with we with regard to the last item -- the water-vapour -- there be however many serious difficulty the water-vapour of we atmosphere be derive from the enormous area of we sea ocean lake and river as well as from the evaporation from heated land and tropical forest of much of the moisture produce by frequent and abundant rain all these source of supply be admittedly absent from mar which have no permanent body of water no rain and tropical region which be almost entirely desert many writer have therefore doubt the existence of water in any form upon this planet suppose that the snow-cap be not form of frozen water but of carbon-dioxide or some other heavy gas in a frozen state and mr lowell evidently feel this to be a difficulty since the only fact he be able to adduce in favor of the melting snow of the polar cap produce water be that at the time they be melt a marginal blue band appear which accompany they in they retreat and this blue color be say to prove conclusively that the liquid be not carbonic acid but water this point he dwell upon repeatedly state of these blue border : this exclude the possibility of they be form by carbon-dioxide and show that of all the substance we know the material compose they must be water -lrb- footnote 7 : in a paper write since the book appear the density of air at the surface of mar be say to be 1\/12 of the earth 's -rrb- this be the only proof of the existence of _ water _ he adduce and it be certainly a most extraordinary and futile one for it be perfectly well know that although water in large mass and by transmitted light be of a blue color yet shallow water by reflect light be not so and in the case of the liquid produce by the snow-cap of mar which the whole condition of the planet show must be shallow and also be more or less turbid it can not possibly be the cause of the ` deep blue ' tint say to result from the melting of the snow but there be a very weighty argument depend on the molecular theory of gas against the polar cap of mar be compose of frozen water at all the mass and elastic force of the several gas be due to the greater or less rapidity of the vibratory motion of they molecule under identical condition the speed of these molecular motion have be ascertain for all the chief gas and it be find to be so great as in certain case to enable they to overcome the force of gravity and escape from a planet 's surface into space dr g johnstone stoney have specially investigate this subject and he find that the force of gravity on the earth be sufficient to retain all the gas compose its atmosphere but not sufficient to retain hydrogen and as a consequence although this gas be produce in small quantity by volcano and by decompose vegetation yet no trace of it be find in we atmosphere the moon however have only one-eightieth the mass of the earth can not retain any gas hence its airless and waterless condition _ water vapor can not exist on mar _ now dr stoney find that in order to retain water vapor permanently a planet must have a mass at least a quarter that of the earth but the mass of mar be only one-ninth that of the earth therefore unless there be some special condition that prevent its loss this gas can not be present in the atmosphere mr lowell do not refer to this argument against he view neither do he claim the evidence of spectroscopy in he favor this be allege more than thirty year ago to show the existence of water-vapour in the atmosphere of mar but of late year it have be doubt and mr lowell 's complete silence on the subject while lay stress on such a very weak and inconclusive argument as that from the tinge of color that be observe a little distance from the edge of the diminish snow-cap show that he himself do not think the fact to be thus prove if he do he would hardly adduce such a argument for its presence as the following : the melting of the cap on the one hand and they re-forming on the other affirm the presence of water-vapour in the martian atmosphere of whatever else that air consist -lrb- p 162 -rrb- yet absolutely the only proof he give that the cap be frozen water be the almost frivolous colour-argument above refer to _ no spectroscopic evidence of water vapor _ as sir william huggin be the chief authority quote for this fact and be refer to as be almost conclusive in the third edition of miss clerke 's _ history of astronomy _ in 1893 i have ascertain that he opinion at the present time be that there be no conclusive proof of the presence of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere of mar and that observation at the lick observatory -lrb- in 1895 -rrb- where the condition and instrument be of the highest order be negative he also inform I that marchand at the pic du midi observatory be unable to obtain line of aqueous vapor in the spectrum of mar and that in 1905 slipher at mr lowell 's observatory be unable to detect any indication of aqueous vapor in the spectrum of mar it thus appear that spectroscopic observation be quite accordant with the calculation found on the molecular theory of gas as to the absence of aqueous vapor and therefore presumably of liquid water from mar it be true that the spectroscopic argument be purely negative and this may be due to the extreme delicacy of the observation require but that dependent on the inability of the force of gravity to retain it be positive scientific evidence against its presence and till show to be erroneous must be hold to be conclusive this absence of water be of itself conclusive against the existence of animal life unless we enter the region of pure conjecture as to the possibility of some other liquid be able to take its place and that liquid be as omnipresent there as water be here mr lowell however never take this ground but basis he whole theory on the fundamental identity of the substance of the body of live organism wherever they may exist in the solar system in the next two chapter i shall discuss a equally essential condition that of temperature which afford a still more conclusive and even crush argument against the suitability of mar for the existence of organic life chapter v the temperature of mar -- mr lowell 's estimate we have now to consider a still more important and fundamental question and one which mr lowell do not grapple with in this volume the actual temperature on mar due to its distance from the sun and the atmospheric condition on which he himself lay so much stress if i be not greatly mistake we shall arrive at conclusion on this subject which be absolutely fatal to the conception of any high form of organic life be possible on this planet _ the problem of terrestrial temperature _ in order that the problem may be understand and its importance appreciate it be necessary to explain the now generally accept principle as to the cause which determine the temperature on we earth and presumably on all other planet whose condition be not wholly unlike ours the fact of the internal heat of the earth which become very perceptible even at the moderate depths reach in mine and deep boring and in the deepest mine become a positive inconvenience lead many people to suppose that the surface - temperature of the earth be partly due to this cause but it be now generally admit that this be not the case the reason be that all rock and soil in they natural compacted state be exceedingly bad conductor of heat a striking illustration of this be the fact that a stream of lava often continue to be red hot at a few foot depth for year after the surface be consolidated and be hardly any warmer than that of the surrounding land a still more remarkable case be that of a glacier on the south-east side of the highest cone of etna underneath a lava stream with a intervene bed of volcanic sand only ten foot thick this be visit by sir charle lyell in 1828 and a second time thirty year later when he make a very careful examination of the stratum and be quite satisfied that the sand and the lava stream together have actually preserve this mass of ice which neither the heat of the lava above it at its first outflow nor the continued heat rise from the great volcano below it have be able to melt or perceptibly to diminish in thirty year another fact that point in the same direction be the existence over the whole floor of the deepest ocean of ice-cold water which originate in the polar sea owe to its greater density sink and creep slowly along the ocean bottom to the depths of the atlantic and pacific and be not perceptibly warm by the internal heat of the earth now the solid crust of the earth be estimate as at least about twenty mile in average thickness and keep in mind the other fact just refer to we can understand that the heat from the interior pass through it with such extreme slowness as not to be detect at the surface the vary temperature of which be due entirely to solar heat a large portion of this heat be store up in the surface soil and especially in the surface layer of the ocean and sea thus partly equalise the temperature of day and night of winter and summer so as greatly to ameliorate the rapid change of temperature that would otherwise occur we dense atmosphere be also of immense advantage to we as a equaliser of temperature charge as it almost always be with a large quantity of water-vapour this latter gas when not condensed into cloud allow the solar heat to pass freely to the earth but it have the singular and highly beneficial property of absorb and retain the dark or lower-grade heat give off by the earth which would otherwise radiate into space much more rapidly we must therefore always remember that very nearly if not quite the _ whole _ of _ the warmth we experience on the earth be derive from the sun _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : professor jh poynting in he lecture to the british association at cambridge in 1904 say : the surface of the earth receive we know a amount of heat from the inside almost infinitesimal compare with that which it receive from the sun and on the sun therefore we depend for we temperature -rrb- in order to understand the immense significance of this conclusion we must know what be mean by the _ whole _ heat or warmth as unless we know this we can not define what half or any other proportion of sun-heat really mean now i feel pretty sure that nine out of ten of the average educate public would answer the follow question incorrectly : the mean temperature of the southern half of england be about 48 ° f suppose the earth receive only half the sun-heat it now receive what would then be the probable mean temperature of the south of england the majority would i think answer at once -- about 24 ° f nearly as many would perhaps say -- 48 ° f be 16 ° above the freezing point therefore half the heat receive would bring we down to 8 ° above the freezing point or 40 ° f very few i think would realize that we share of half the amount of sun-heat receive by the earth would probably result in reduce we mean temperature to about 100 ° f below the freezing point and perhaps even lower this be about the very lowest temperature yet experience on the earth 's surface to understand how such result be obtain a few word must be say about the absolute zero of temperature _ the zero of temperature _ heat be now believe to be entirely due to ether-vibration which produce a correspondingly rapid vibration of the molecule of matter cause it to expand and produce all the phenomenon we term ` heat ' we can conceive this vibration to increase indefinitely and thus there would appear to be no necessary limit to the amount of heat possible but we can not conceive it to decrease indefinitely at the same uniform rate as it must soon inevitably come to nothing now it have be find by experiment that gas under uniform pressure expand 1\/273 of they volume for each degree centigrade of increase temperature so that in pass from 0 ° c to 273 ° c they be double in volume they also decrease in volume at the same rate for each degree below 0 ° c -lrb- the freezing point of water -rrb- hence if this go on to-273 ° c a gas will have no volume or it will undergo some change of nature hence this be call the zero of temperature or the temperature to which any matter fall which receive no heat from any other matter it be also sometimes call the temperature of space or of the ether in a state of rest if that be possible all the gas have now be prove to become first liquid and then -lrb- most of they -rrb- solid at temperature considerably above this zero the only way to compare the proportional temperature of body whether on the earth or in space be therefore by means of a scale beginning at this natural zero instead of those scale found on the artificial zero of the freezing point of water or as in fahrenheit 's 32 ° below it only by use the natural zero and measure continuously from it can we estimate temperature in relative proportion to the amount of heat receive this be term the absolute zero and so that we start reckon from that point it do not matter whether the scale adopt be the centigrade or that of fahrenheit _ the complex problem of planetary temperature _ now if as be the case with mar a planet receive only half the amount of solar heat that we receive owe to its greater distance from the sun and if the mean temperature of we earth be 60 ° f this be equal to 551 ° f on the absolute scale it would therefore appear very simple to halve this amount and obtain 2755 ° f as the mean temperature of that planet but this result be erroneous because the actual amount of sun heat intercept by a planet be only one condition out of many that determine its result temperature radiation that be loss of heat be go on concurrently with gain and the rate of loss vary with the temperature accord to a law recently discover the loss be much greater at high temperature in proportion to the 4th power of the absolute temperature then again the whole heat intercept by a planet do not reach its surface unless it have no atmosphere when it have one much be reflect or absorb accord to complex law dependent on the density and composition of the atmosphere then again the heat that reach the actual surface be partly reflect and partly absorb accord to the nature of that surface -- land or water desert or forest or snow-clad -- that part which be absorb be the chief agent in raise the temperature of the surface and of the air in contact with it very important too be the loss of heat by radiation from these various heated surface at different rate while the atmosphere itself send back to the surface a ever vary portion of both this radiant and reflect heat accord to distinct law further difficulty arise from the fact that much of the sun 's heat consist of dark or invisible ray and it can not therefore be measure by the quantity of light only from this rough statement it will be see that the problem be a exceedingly complex one not to be decide off-hand or by any simple method it have in fact be usually consider as -lrb- strictly speak -rrb- insoluble and only to be estimate by a more or less rough approximation or by the method of general analogy from certain known fact it will be see from what have be say in previous chapter that mr lowell in he book have use the latter method and by take the presence of water and water-vapour in mar as prove by the behavior of the snow-cap and the bluish color that result from they melting have deduce a temperature above the freezing point of water as prevalent in the equatorial region permanently and in the temperate and arctic zone during a portion of each year _ mr lowell 's mathematical investigation of the problem _ but as this result have be hold to be both improbable in itself and found on no valid evidence he have now in the _ london edinburgh and dublin philosophical magazine _ of July 1907 publish a elaborate paper of 15 page entitle _ a general method for evaluate the surface-temperature of the planet with special reference to the temperature of mar _ by professor percival lowell and in this paper by what purport to be strict mathematical reasoning base on the most recent discovery as to the law of heat as well as on measurement or estimate of the various element and constant use in the calculation he arrive at a conclusion strikingly accordant with that put forward in the recently publish volume have myself neither mathematical nor physical knowledge sufficient to enable I to criticise this elaborate paper except on a few point i will here limit myself to give a short account of it so as to explain its method of procedure after which i may add a few note on what seem to I doubtful point while i also hope to be able to give the opinion of some more competent critic than myself _ mr lowell 's mode of estimate the surface-temperature of mar _ the author first state that professor young in he _ general astronomy _ -lrb- 1898 -rrb- make the mean temperature of mar 2236 ° absolute by use newton 's law of heat be radiate in proportion to temperature and 363 ° ab -lrb- = -96 ° f -rrb- by dulong and petit 's law but add that a closer determination have be make by professor moulton use stefan 's law that radiation be as the _ \/ 4th _ power of the temperature whence result a mean temperature of-31 ° f these estimate assume identity of atmospheric condition of mar and the earth but as none of these estimate take account of the many complex factor which interfere with such direct and simple calculation mr lowell then proceed to enunciate they and work out mathematically the effect they produce : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the whole radiant energy of the sun on strike a planet become divide as follow : part be reflect back into space part absorb by the atmosphere part transmit to the surface of the planet this surface again reflect a portion and only the balance leave go to warm the planet -lrb- 2 -rrb- to solve this complex problem we be help by the _ albedo _ or intrinsic brilliancy of the planet which depend on the proportion of the visible ray which be reflect and which determine the comparative brightness of they respective surface we also have to find the ratio of the invisible to the visible ray and the heating power of each -lrb- 3 -rrb- he then refer to the actinometer and pyroheliometer instrument for measure the actual heat derive from the sun and also to the bolometer a instrument invent by professor langley for measure the invisible heat ray which he have prove to extend to more than three time the length of the whole heat-spectrum as previously know and have also show that the invisible ray contribute 68 per cent of the sun 's total energy -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : for a short account of this remarkable instrument see my _ wonderful century _ new ed pp 143-145 -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- then follow a elaborate estimate of the loss of heat during the passage of the sun 's ray through we atmosphere from experiment make at different altitude and from the estimate reflective power of the various part of the earth 's surface -- rock and soil ocean forest and snow -- the final result be that three-fourth of the whole sun-heat be reflect back into space form we _ albedo _ while only one-fourth be absorb by the soil and go to warm the air and determine we mean temperature -lrb- 5 -rrb- we now have another elaborate estimate of the comparative amount of heat actually receive by mar and the earth dependent on they very different amount of atmosphere and this estimate depend almost wholly on the comparative _ albedo _ that of mar as observe by astronomer be 027 while ours have be estimate in a totally different way as be 075 whence he conclude that nearly three-fourths of the sun-heat that mar receive reach the surface and determine its temperature while we get only one-fourth of we total amount then by apply stefan 's law that the radiation be as the 4th power of the surface temperature he reach the final result that the actual heating power at the surface of mar be considerably _ more _ than on the earth and would produce a mean temperature of 72 ° f if it be not for the greater conservative or blanket power of we denser and more water-laden atmosphere the difference produce by this latter fact he minimise by dwelling on the probability of a greater proportion of carbonic-acid gas and water-vapour in the martian atmosphere and thus bring down the mean temperature of mar to 48 ° f which be almost exactly the same as that of the southern half of england he have also as the result of observation reduce the probable density of the atmosphere of mar to 2-1\/2 inch of mercury or only one-twelfth of that of the earth _ critical remark on mr lowell 's paper _ the last part of this paper indicate under par 4 and 5 be the most elaborate occupy eight page and it contain much that seem uncertain if not erroneous in particular it seem very unlikely that under a clear sky over the whole earth we should only receive at the sea-level 023 of the solar ray which the earth intercept -lrb- p 167 -rrb- these datum largely depend on observation make in californium and other part of the southern united state where the lower atmosphere be exceptionally dust-laden till we have similar observation make in the tropical forest-region which cover so large a area and where the atmosphere be purify by frequent rain and also on the prairie and the great ocean we can not trust these very local observation for general conclusion affect the whole earth later in the same article -lrb- p 170 -rrb- mr lowell say : cloud transmit approximately 20 per cent of the heat reach they : a clear sky at sea-level 60 per cent as the sky be half the time cloudy the mean transmission be 35 per cent these statement seem incompatible with that quote above the figure he use in he calculation for the actual albedo of the earth 075 be also not only improbable but almost self-contradictory because the albedo of cloud be 072 and that of the great cloud-covered planet jupiter be give by lowell as 075 while zollner make it only 062 again lowell give venus a albedo of 092 while zollner make it only 050 and mr gore 065 this show the extreme uncertainty of these estimate while the fact that both venus and jupiter be wholly cloud-covered while we be only half-covered render it almost certain that we albedo be far less than mr lowell make it it be evident that mathematical calculation found upon such uncertain datum can not yield trustworthy result but this be by no mean the only case in which the datum employ in this paper be of uncertain value everywhere we meet with figure of somewhat doubtful accuracy here we have somebody 's ` estimate ' quote there another person 's ` observation ' and these be adopt without further remark and use in the various calculation lead to the result above quote it require a practiced mathematician and one fully acquaint with the extensive literature of this subject to examine these various datum and track they through the maze of formula and figure so as to determine to what extent they affect the final result there be however one curious oversight which i must refer to as it be a point to which i have give much attention not only do mr lowell assume as in he book that the ` snow ' of mar consist of frozen water and that therefore there _ be _ water on its surface and water-vapour in its atmosphere not only do he ignore altogether dr johnstone stoney 's calculation with regard to it which i have already refer to but he use term that imply that water-vapour be one of the heavier component of we atmosphere the passage be at p 168 of the _ philosophical magazine _ after state that owe to the very small barometric pressure in mar water would boil at 110 ° f he add : the sublimation at lower temperature would be correspondingly increase consequently the amount of water-vapour in the martian air must on that score be relatively greater than we own then follow this remarkable passage : carbon-dioxide because of its greater specific gravity would also be in relatively greater amount so far as this cause be consider for the planet would part _ caeteris paribus _ with its lighter gas the quickest whence as regard both water-vapour and carbon-dioxide we have reason to think they in relatively greater quantity than in we own air at corresponding barometric pressure i can not understand this passage except as imply that ` water-vapour and carbon-dioxide ' be among the heavier and not among the lighter gas of the atmosphere -- those which the planet ` part with quickest ' but this be just what water-vapour _ be _ be a little less than two-third the weight of air -lrb- 06225 -rrb- and one of those which the planet _ would _ part with the quickest and which accord to dr johnstone stoney it lose altogether \* \* \* \* \* note on professor lowell 's article in the _ philosophical magazine _ by jh poynting fr professor of physics in the university of birmingham i think professor lowell 's result be erroneous through he neglect of the heat store in the air by its absorption of radiation both from the sun and from the surface the air thus heated radiate to the surface and keep up the temperature i have send to the _ philosophical magazine _ a paper in which i think it be show that when the radiation by the atmosphere be take into account the result be entirely change the temperature of mar with professor lowell 's datum still come out far below the freezing-point -- still further below than the increase distance alone would make it indeed the lower temperature on elevated region of the earth 's surface would lead we to expect this i think it be impossible to raise the temperature of mar to anything like the value obtain by professor lowell unless we assume some quality in he atmosphere entirely different from any find in we own atmosphere jh poynt October 19 1907 chapter vi a new estimate of the temperature of mar when we be present with a complex problem depend on a great number of imperfectly ascertain datum we may often check the result thus obtain by the comparison of case in which some of the more important of these datum be identical while other be at a maximum or a minimum in the present case we can do this by a consideration of the moon as compare with the earth and with mar _ langley 's determination of the moon 's temperature _ in the moon we see the condition that prevail in mar both exaggerated and simplify mar have a very scanty atmosphere the moon none at all or if there be one it be so excessively scanty that the most refined observation have not detect it all the complication arise from the possible nature of the atmosphere and its complex effect upon reflection absorption and radiation be thus eliminate the mean distance of the moon from the sun be identical with that of the earth the total amount of heat intercept must also be identical only in this case the whole of it reach the surface instead of one-fourth only accord to mr lowell 's estimate for the earth now by the most refined observation with he bolometer mr langley be able to determine the temperature of the moon 's surface expose to undimmed sunshine for fourteen day together and he find that even in that portion of it on which the sun be shine almost vertically the temperature rarely rise above the freezing point of water however extraordinary this result may seem it be really a striking confirmation of the accuracy of the general law determine temperature which i have endeavor to explain in the precede chapter for the same surface which have have fourteen day of sunshine have also have a precede fourteen day of darkness during which the heat which it have accumulate in its surface layer would have be lose by free radiation into stellar space it thus acquire during its day a maximum temperature of only 491 ° f absolute while its minimum after 14 day ' continuous radiation must be very low and be with much reason suppose to approach the absolute zero _ rapid loss of heat by radiation on the earth _ in order better to comprehend what this minimum may be under extreme condition it will be useful to take note of the effect it actually produce on the earth in place where the condition be nearest to those exist on the moon or on mar though never quite equalling or even approach very near they it be in we great desert region and especially on high plateau that extreme aridity prevail and it be in such district that the difference between day and night temperature reach they maximum it be state by geographer that in part of the great sahara the surface temperature be sometimes 150 ° f while during the night it fall nearly or quite to the freezing point -- a difference of 118 degree in little more than 12 hour -lrb- 10 -rrb- in the high desert plain of central asia the extreme be say to be even greater -lrb- 11 -rrb- again in he _ universal geography _ reclus state that in the armenian highland the thermometer oscillate between 13 ° f and 112 ° f we may therefore without any fear of exaggeration take it as prove that a fall of 100 ° f in twelve or fifteen hour not infrequently occur where there be a very dry and clear atmosphere permit continuous insolation by day and rapid radiation by night -lrb- footnote 10 : keith johnston 's ` africa ' in _ stanford 's compendium _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : _ chamber 's encyclopedia _ art ` desert ' -rrb- now as it be admit that we dense atmosphere however dry and clear absorb and reflect some considerable portion of the solar heat we shall certainly underestimate the radiation from the moon 's surface during its long night if we take as the basis of we calculation a lowering of temperature amounting to 100 ° f during twelve hour as not unfrequently occur with we use these datum -- with stefan 's law of decrease of radiation as the 4th power of the temperature -- a mathematical friend find that the temperature of the moon 's surface would be reduce during the lunar night to nearly 200 ° f absolute -lrb- equal to-258 ° f -rrb- _ more rapid loss of heat by the moon _ although such a calculation as the above may afford we a good approximation to the rate of loss of heat by mar with its very scanty atmosphere we have now good evidence that in the case of the moon the loss be much more rapid two independent worker have investigate this subject with very accordant result -- dr boeddicker with lord rosse 's 3-foot reflector and a thermopile to measure the heat and mr frank very with a glass reflector of 12 inch diameter and the bolometer invent by mr langley the very striking and unexpected fact in which these observer agree be the sudden disappearance of much of the stored-up heat during the comparatively short duration of a total eclipse of the moon -- less than two hour of complete darkness and about twice that period of partial obscuration dr boeddicker be unable to detect any appreciable heat at the period of greatest obscuration but owe to the extreme sensitiveness of the bolometer mr very ascertain that those part of the surface which have be longest in the shadow still emit heat to the amount of one per cent of the heat to be expect from the full moon this however be the amount of radiation measure by the bolometer and to get the temperature of the radiate surface we must apply stefan 's law of the 4th power hence the temperature of the moon 's dark surface will be the -lrb- fourth root of -lrb- 1 over 100 -rrb- -rrb- = 1 over 32 -lrb- a -rrb- of the highest temperature -lrb- which we may take at the freezing-point 491 ° f abs -rrb- or 154 ° f abs just below the liquefaction point of air this be about 50 ° lower than the amount find by calculation from we most rapid radiation and as this amount be produce in a few hour it be not too much to expect that when continue for more than two week -lrb- the lunar night -rrb- it might reach a temperature sufficient to liquefy hydrogen -lrb- 60 ° f abs -rrb- or perhaps even below it -lrb-

improbable as to be almost incredible may perhaps be to some extent explain by the physical constitution of the moon 's surface which from a theoretical point of view do not appear to have receive the attention it deserve it be clear that we satellite have be long subject to volcanic eruption over its whole visible face and these have evidently be of a explosive nature so as to build up the very lofty cone and crater as well as thousand of smaller one which owe to the absence of any degrading or denuding agency have remain pile up as they be first form this highly volcanic structure can i think be well explain by a origin such as that attribute to it by sir george darwin and which have be so well describe by sir robert ball in he small volume _ time and tide _ these astronomer adduce strong evidence that the earth once rotate so rapidly that the equatorial protuberance be almost at the point of separation from the planet as a ring before this occur however the tension be so great that one large portion of the protuberance where it be weakest break away and begin to move around the earth at some considerable distance from it as about 1\/50 of the bulk of the earth thus escape it must have consist of a considerable portion of the solid crust and a much larger quantity of the liquid or semi-liquid interior together with a proportionate amount of the gas which we know form and still form a important part of the earth 's substance as the surface layer of the earth must have be the lightest they would necessarily when break up by this gigantic convulsion have come together to form the exterior of the new satellite and be soon adjust by the force of gravity and tidal disturbance into a more or less irregular spheroidal form all whose interstice and cavity would be fill up and connect together by the liquid or semi-liquid mass force up between they thence-forward as the moon increase its distance and reduce its time of rotation in the way explain by sir robert ball there would necessarily commence a process of escape of the imprison gas at every fissure and at all point and line of weakness give rise to numerous volcanic outlet which be subject only to the small force of lunar gravity -lrb- only one-sixth that of the earth -rrb- would in the course of age pile up those gigantic cone and ridge which form its great characteristic but this small gravitative power of the moon would prevent its retain on its surface any of the gas form we atmosphere which would all escape from it and probably be recapture by the earth by no process of external aggregation of solid matter to such a relatively small amount as that form the moon even if the aggregation be so violent as to produce heat enough to cause liquefaction could any such long-continued volcanic action arise by gradual cooling in the absence of internal gas there might be fissure and even some outflow of molten rock but without imprison gas and especially without water and water-vapour produce explosive outburst could any such amount of scoria and ash be produce as be necessary for the building up of the vast volcanic cone crater and craterlet we see upon the moon 's surface i be not aware that either sir robert ball or sir george darwin have adduce this highly volcanic condition of the moon 's surface as a phenomenon which can _ only _ be explain by we satellite have be throw off a very much larger body whose gravitative force be sufficient to acquire and retain the enormous quantity of gas and of water which we possess and which be _ absolutely essential _ for that _ special form of cone-building volcanic action _ which the moon exhibit in so pre-eminent a degree yet it seem to I clear that some such hypothetical origin for we satellite would have have to be assume if sir george darwin have not deduce it by means of purely mathematical argument base upon astronomical fact return now to the problem of the moon 's temperature i think the phenomenon this present may be in part due to the mode of formation here describe for its entire surface be the result of long-continued gaseous explosion all the volcanic product -- scoriae pumice and ash -- would necessarily be highly porous throughout and never have be compacted by water-action as on the earth and there have be no wind to carry the finer dust so as to fill up they pore and fissure the whole of the surface material to a very considerable depth must be loose and porous to a high degree this condition have be further increase owe to the small power of gravity and the extreme irregularity of the surface consist very largely of lofty cone and ridge very loosely pile up to enormous height now this condition of the substance of the moon 's surface be such as would produce a high specific heat so that it would absorb a large amount of heat in proportion to the rise of temperature produce the heat be conduct downward to a considerable depth owe however to the total absence of atmosphere radiation would very rapidly cool the surface but afterwards more slowly both on account of the action of stefan 's law and because the heat store up in the deeper portion could be carry to the surface by conduction only and with extreme slowness _ very 's research on the moon 's heat _ the result of the eclipse observation be support by the detailed examination of the surface-temperature of the moon by mr very in he _ prize essay on the distribution of the moon 's heat _ -lrb- publish by the utrecht society of art and science in 1891 -rrb- he show by a diagram of the ` phase-curve ' that at the commencement of the lunar day the surface just within the illuminate limb have acquire about 1\/7 of its maximum temperature or about 70 ° f abs as the surface expose to the bolometer at each observation be about 1\/30 of the moon 's surface and in order to ensure accuracy the instrument have to be direct to a spot lie wholly within the edge of the moon it be evident that the surface measure have already be for several hour expose to oblique sunshine the curve of temperature then rise gradually and afterwards more rapidly till it attain its maximum -lrb- of about +30 to 40 ° f -rrb- a few hour _ before _ noon this mr very think be due to the fact that the half of the moon 's face first illuminate for we have on the average a darker surface than that of the afternoon or second quarter during which the curve descend not quite so rapidly the temperature near sunset be only a little higher than that near sunrise this rapid fall while expose to oblique sunshine be quite in harmony with the rapid loss of heat during the few hour of darkness during a eclipse both show the prepotency of radiation over insolation on the moon two other diagram show the distribution of heat at the time of full-moon one half of the curve show the temperature along the equator from the edge of the disc to the center the other along a meridian from this center to the pole this diagram -lrb- here reproduce -rrb- exhibit the quick rise of temperature of the oblique rim of the moon and the nearly uniform heat of the central half of its surface the diminution of heat towards the pole however be slower for the first half and more rapid for the latter portion it be a interesting fact that the temperature near the margin of the full-moon increase towards the center more rapidly than it do when the same part be observe during the early phase of the first quarter mr very explain this difference as be due to the fact that the full-moon to its very edge be fully illuminate all the shadow of the ridge and mountain be throw vertically or obliquely _ behind they _ we thus measure the heat reflect from the _ whole _ visible surface but at new moon and somewhat beyond the first quarter the deep shadow throw by the smallest cone and ridge as well as by the loftiest mountain cover a considerable portion of the visible surface thus largely reduce the quantity of light and heat reflect or radiate in we direction it be only at the full therefore that the maximum temperature of the whole lunar surface can be measure it must be consider a proof of the delicacy of the heat-measuring instrument that this difference in the curve of temperature of the different part of the moon 's surface and under different condition be so clearly show _ the application of the precede result to the case of mar _ this somewhat lengthy account of the actual state of the moon 's surface and temperature be of very great importance in we present enquiry because it show we the extraordinary difference in mean and extreme temperature of two body situate at the same distance from the sun and therefore receive exactly the same amount of solar heat per unit of surface we have learn also what be the main cause of this almost incredible difference namely : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a remarkably rugged surface with porous and probably cavernous rock-texture lead to extremely rapid radiation of heat in the one as compare with a comparatively even and well-compacted surface largely clad with vegetation lead to comparatively slow and gradual loss by radiation in the other : and -lrb- 2 -rrb- these result be greatly intensify by the total absence of a protect atmosphere in the former while a dense and cloudy atmosphere with a ever-present supply of water-vapour accumulate and equalise the heat receive by the latter the only other essential difference in the two body which may possibly aid in the production of this marvellous result be the fact of we day and night have a mean length of 12 hour while those of the moon be about 14-1\/2 of we day but the altogether unexpected fact in which two independent enquirer agree that during the few hour ' duration of a total eclipse of the moon so large a proportion of the heat be lose by radiation render it almost certain that the result low temperature would be not very much less if the moon have a day and night the same length as we own the great lesson we learn by this extreme contrast of condition supply to we by nature as if to enable we to solve some of she problem be the overwhelming importance first of a dense and well-compacted surface due to water-action and strong gravitative force secondly of a more or less general coat of vegetation and thirdly of a dense vapour-laden atmosphere these three favourable condition result in a mean temperature of about +60 ° f with a range seldom exceed 40 ° above or below it while over more than half the land-surface of the earth the temperature rarely fall below the freezing point on the other hand we have a globe of the same material and at the same distance from the sun with a maximum temperature of freezing water and a minimum not very far from the absolute zero the monthly mean be probably much below the freezing point of carbonic-acid gas -- a difference entirely due to the absence of these three favourable condition _ the special feature of mar as influence temperature _ come now to the special feature of mar and its probable temperature we find that most writer have arrive at a very different conclusion from that of mr lowell who himself quote mr moulton as a authority who ` recently by the application of stefan 's law ' have find the mean temperature of this planet to be-35 ° f again professor jh poynting in he lecture on ` radiation in the solar system ' deliver before the british association at cambridge in 1904 give a estimate of the mean temperature of the planet arrive at from measurement of the sun 's emissive power and the application of stefan 's law to the distance of the several planet and he thus find the earth to have a mean temperature of 17 ° c -lrb- = 62-1\/2 ° f -rrb- and mar one of-38 ° c -lrb- = -36 -1 \/ 2 ° f -rrb- a wonderfully close approximation to the mean temperature of the earth as determine by direct measurement and therefore presumably a equally near approximation to that of mar as dependent on distance from the sun and ' _ on the supposition that it be earth-like in all its condition _ ' but we know that it be far from be earth-like in the very condition which we have find to be those which determine the extremely different temperature of the earth and moon and as regard each of these we shall find that so far as it differ from the earth it approximate to the less favourable condition that prevail in the moon the first of these condition which we have find to be essential in regulate the absorption and radiation of heat and thus raise the mean temperature of a planet be a compact surface well cover with vegetation two condition arise from and absolutely dependent on a ample amount of water but mr lowell himself assure we as a fact of which he have no doubt that there be no permanent body of water great or small upon mar that rain and consequently river be totally want that its sky be almost constantly clear and that what appear to be cloud be not form of water-vapour but of dust he dwell emphatically on the terrible desert condition of the greater part of the surface of the planet that be the case now we have no right to assume that it have ever be otherwise and take full account of the fact neither deny nor dispute by mr lowell that the force of gravity on mar be not sufficient to retain water-vapour in its atmosphere we must conclude that the surface of that planet like that of the moon have be mould by some form of volcanic action modify probably by wind but not by water add to this that the force of gravity on mar be nearer that of the moon than to that of the earth and we may r reasonably conclude that its surface be form of volcanic matter in a light and porous condition and therefore highly favourable for the rapid loss of surface heat by radiation the surface-condition of mar be therefore presumably much more like those of the moon than like those of the earth the next condition favourable to the store up of heat -- a covering of vegetation -- be almost certainly absent from mar except possibly over limited area and for short period in this feature also the surface of mar approximate much nearer to lunar than to earth-condition the third condition -- a dense vapour-laden atmosphere -- be also want in mar for although it possess a atmosphere it be estimate by mr lowell -lrb- in he latest article -rrb- to have a pressure equivalent to only 2-1\/2 inch of mercury with we give it a density of only one-twelfth part that of ours while aqueous vapor the chief accumulator of heat can not permanently exist in it and notwithstanding repeat spectroscopic observation for the purpose of detect it have never be prove to exist i submit that i have now show from the statement -- and largely as the result of the long-continued observation -- of mr lowell himself that so far as the physical condition of mar be know to differ from those of the earth the difference be all _ unfavourable _ to the conservation and _ favourable _ to the dissipation of the scanty heat it receive from the sun -- that they point unmistakeably towards the temperature condition of the moon rather than to those of the earth and that the cumulative effect of these adverse condition act upon a heat-supply reduce by solar distance to less than one-half of ours _ must _ result in a mean temperature -lrb- as well as in the extreme -rrb- nearer to that of we satellite than to that of we own earth _ further criticism of mr lowell 's article _ we be now in a position to test some further conclusion of mr lowell 's _ phil mag _ article by comparison with actual phenomenon we have see in the outline i have give of this article that he endeavor to show how the small amount of solar heat receive by mar be counterbalance largely by the greater transparency to light and heat of its thin and cloudless atmosphere and partially also by a greater conservative or ` blanket ' power of its atmosphere due to the presence in it of a large proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueous vapor the first of these statement may be admit as a fact which he be entitle to dwell upon but the second -- the presence of large quantity of carbon-dioxide and aqueous vapor be a pure hypothesis unsupported by any item of scientific evidence while in the case of aqueous vapor it be directly oppose to admit result found upon the molecular theory of gaseous elasticity but although mr lowell refer to the conservative or ` blanket ' effect of the earth 's atmosphere he do not consider or allow for its very great cumulative effect as be strikingly show by the comparison with the actual temperature condition of the moon this cumulative effect be due to the _ continuous _ reflection and radiation of heat from the cloud as well as from the vapour-laden stratum of air in we lower atmosphere which latter though very transparent to the luminous and accompany heat ray of the sun be opaque to the dark heat-ray whether radiate or reflect from the earth 's surface we be therefore in a position strictly comparable with that of the interior of some huge glass house which not only become intensely heat by the direct ray of the sun but also to a less degree by reflect ray from the sky and those radiate from the cloud so that even on a cloudy or misty day its temperature rise many degree above that of the outer air such a building if of large size of suitable form and well protect at night by blind or other cover might be so arrange as to accumulate heat in its soil and wall so as to maintain a tolerably uniform temperature though expose to a considerable range of external heat and cold it be to such a power of accumulation of heat in we soil and lower atmosphere that we must impute the overwhelming contrast between we climate and that of the moon with we the solar heat that penetrate we vapour-laden and cloudy atmosphere be shut in by that same atmosphere accumulate there for week and month together and can only slowly escape it be this great cumulative power which mr lowell have not take account of while he certainly have not estimate the enormous loss of heat by free radiation which entirely neutralise the effect of increase of sun-heat however great when these cumulative agency be not present -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : the effect of this ` cumulative ' power of a dense atmosphere be further discuss and illustrate in the last chapter of this book where i show that the universal fact of steadily diminish temperature at high altitude be due solely to the diminution of this cumulative power of we atmosphere and that from this cause alone the temperature of mar must be that which would be find on a lofty plateau about 18000 foot higher than the average of the peak of the ande -rrb- _ temperature on polar region of mar _ there be also a further consideration which i think mr lowell have altogether omit to discuss whatever may be the _ mean _ temperature of mar we must take account of the long night in its polar and high-temperate latitudes last nearly twice as long as ours with the result lowering of temperature by radiation into a constantly clear sky even in siberium in lat 67-1\/2 ° n a cold of-88 ° f have be attain while over a large portion of n asia and america above 60 ° lat the _ mean _ January temperature be from-30 ° f to-60 ° f and the whole subsoil be permanently freeze from a depth of 6 or 7 foot to several hundred but the winter temperature _ over the same latitudes _ in mar must be very much lower and it must require a proportionally larger amount of its feeble sun-heat to raise the surface even to the freezing-point and a additional very large amount to melt any considerable depth of snow but this identical area from a little below 60 ° to the pole be that occupy by the snow-cap of mar and over the whole of it the winter temperature must be far lower than the earth-minimum of-88 ° f then as the martian summer come on there be less than half the sun-heat available to raise this low temperature after a winter nearly double the length of ours and when the summer do come with its scanty sun-heat that heat be not accumulate as it be by we dense and moisture-laden atmosphere the marvellous effect of which we have already show yet with all these adverse condition each assist the other to produce a climate approximate to that which the earth would have if it have no atmosphere -lrb- but retain we superiority over mar in receive double the amount of sun-heat -rrb- we be ask to accept a mean temperature for the more distant planet almost exactly the same as that of mild and equable southern england and a disappearance of the vast snowfield of its polar region as rapid and complete as what occur with we if the moon even at its equator have not its temperature raise above the freezing-point of water how can the more _ distant _ mar with its _ oblique _ noon-day sun fall upon the snow-cap receive heat enough first to raise they temperature to 32 ° f and then to melt with marked rapidity the vast frozen plain of its polar region mr lowell be however so regardless of the ordinary teaching of meteorological science that he actually account for the suppose mild climate of the polar region of mar by the absence of water on its surface and in its atmosphere he conclude he fifth chapter with the follow word : could we earth but get rid of its ocean we too might have temperate region stretch to the pole here he run counter to two of the best-established law of terrestrial climatology -- the wonderful equalising effect of warm ocean-current which be the chief agent in diminish polar cold the equally striking effect of warm moist wind derive from these ocean and the great storehouse of heat we possess in we vapour-laden atmosphere its vapor be primarily derive from these same ocean but in mr lowell 's opinion all we meteorologist be quite mistaken we ocean be we great drawback only get rid of they and we should enjoy the exquisite climate of mar -- with its absence of cloud and fog of rain or river and its delightful expanse of perennial desert vary towards the pole by a scanty snow-fall in winter the melting of which might with great care supply we with the necessary moisture to grow wheat and cabbage for about one-tenth or more likely one-hundredth of we present population i hope i may be excuse for not treat such a argument seriously the various consideration now advance especially those which show the enormous cumulative and conservative effect of we dense and water-laden atmosphere and the disastrous effect -- judge by the actual condition of the moon -- which the loss of it would have upon we temperature seem to I quite sufficient to demonstrate important error in the datum or fallacy in the complex mathematical argument by which mr lowell have attempt to uphold he view as to the temperature and consequent climatic condition of mar in conclude this portion of my discussion of the problem of mar i wish to call attention to the fact that my argument found upon a comparison of the physical condition of the earth and moon with those of mar be dependent upon a small number of generally admit scientific fact while the conclusion draw from those fact be simple and direct require no mathematical knowledge to follow they or to appreciate they weight and cogency i claim for they therefore that they be in no degree speculative but in they datum and method exclusively scientific in the next chapter i will put forward a suggestion as to how the very curious marking upon the surface of mar may possibly be interpret so as to be in harmony with the planet 's actual physical condition and its not improbable origin and past history chapter vii a suggestion as to the ` canal ' of mar the special characteristic of the numerous line which intersect the whole of the equatorial and temperate region of mar be they straightness combine with they enormous length it be this which have lead mr lowell to term they ` non-natural feature ' schiaparellus in he earlier drawing show they curved and of comparatively great width later he find they to be straight fine line when see under the best condition just as mr lowell have always see they in the pure atmosphere of he observatory both of these observer be at first doubtful of they reality but persistent observation continue at many successive opposition compel acceptance of they as actual feature of the planet 's disc so many other observer have now see they that the objection of unreality seem no longer valid mr lowell urge however that they perfect straightness they extreme tenuity they uniformity throughout they whole length the dual character of many of they they relation to the ` oasis ' and the form and position of these round black spot be all proof of artificiality and be suggestive of design and consider that some of they be actually as long as from boston to san francisco and relatively to they globe as long as from london to bombay he objection that no natural phenomenon within we knowledge show such regularity on such a scale seem at first a mighty one it be certainly true that we can point to nothing exactly like they either on the earth or on the moon and these be the only two planetary body we be in a position to compare with mar yet even these do i think afford we some hint towards a interpretation of the mysterious line but as we knowledge of the internal structure and past history even of we earth be still imperfect that of the moon only conjectural and that of mar a perfect blank it be not perhaps surprising that the surface-feature of the latter do not correspond with those of either of the other _ mr pickering 's suggestion _ the best clue to a natural interpretation of the strange feature of the surface of mar be that suggest by the american astronomer mr wh pickering in _ popular astronomy _ -lrb- 1904 -rrb- briefly it be that both the ` canal ' of mar and the rift as well as the luminous streak on the moon be crack in the volcanic crust cause by internal stress due to the action of the heated interior these crack he consider to be symmetrically arrange with regard to small ` craterlet ' -lrb- mr lowell 's ` oasis ' -rrb- because they have originate from they just as the white streak on the moon radiate from the larger crater as centre he further suppose that water and carbon-dioxide issue from the interior into these fissure and in conjunction with sunlight promote the growth of vegetation owe to the very rare atmosphere the vapor he think would not ascend but would roll down the outside of the craterlet and along the border of the canal thus irrigate the immediate vicinity and serve to promote the growth of some form of vegetation which render the canal and oasis visible -lrb- 13 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 13 : _ nature _ vol 70 p 536 -rrb- this opinion be especially important because next to mr lowell mr pickering be perhaps the astronomer who have give most attention to mar during the last fifteen year he be for some time at flagstaff with mr lowell and it be he who discover the oasis or craterlet and who originate the idea that we do not see the ` canal ' themselves but only the vegetable growth on they border he also observe mar in the southern hemisphere at arequipa and he have since make a elaborate study of the moon by means of a specially construct telescope of 135 foot focal length which produce a direct image on photographic plate nearly 16 inch in diameter -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 14 : _ nature _ vol 70 may 5 pxus supplement -rrb- it be clear therefore that mr lowell 's view as to the artificial nature of the ` canal ' of mar be not accept by a astronomer of equal knowledge and still wider experience yet professor pickering 's alternative view be more a suggestion than a explanation because there be no attempt to account for the enormous length and perfect straightness of the line on mar so different from anything that be find either on we earth or on the moon there must evidently be some great peculiarity of structure or of condition on mar to account for these feature and i shall now attempt to point out what this peculiarity be and how it may have arise _ the meteoritic hypothesis _ during the last quarter of a century a considerable change have come over the opinion of astronomer as regard the probable origin of the solar system the large amount of knowledge of the stellar universe and especially of nebula of comet and of meteor-stream which we now possess together with many other phenomenon such as the constitution of saturn 's ring the great number and extent of the minor planet and generally of the vast amount of matter in the form of meteor-ring and meteoric dust in and around we system have all point to a different origin for the planet and they satellite than that formulate by laplace as the nebular hypothesis it be now see more clearly than at any earlier period that most of the planet possess special characteristic which distinguish they from one another and that such a origin as laplace suggest -- the slow cooling and contraction of one vast sun-mist or nebula besides present inherent difficulty -- many think they impossibility -- in itself do not afford a adequate explanation of these peculiarity hence have arise what be term the meteoritic theory which have be ably advocate for many year by sir norman lockyer and with some unimportant modification be now become widely accept briefly this theory be that the planet have be form by the slow aggregation of solid particle around centre of greatest condensation but as many of my reader may be altogether unacquainted with it i will here give a very clear statement of what it be from professor jw gregory 's presidential address to the geological section of the british association of the present year he begin by say that these modern view be of far more practical use to man of science than that of laplace and that they give we a history of the world consistent with the actual record of geology he then continue : accord to sir norman lockyer 's meteoritic hypothesis nebula comet and many so-called star consist of swarm of meteorite which though normally cold and dark be heat by repeat collision and so become luminous they may even be volatilise into glowing meteoric vapor but in time this heat be dissipate and the force of gravity condense a meteoritic swarm into a single globe ` some of the swarm be ' say lockyer ` truly member of the solar system ' and some of these travel round the sun in nearly circular orbit like planet they may be regard as infinitesimal planet and so chamberlain call they ` planetismal ' the planetismal theory be a development of the meteoritic theory and present it in a especially attractive guise it regard meteorite as very sparsely distribute through space and gravity as powerless to collect they into dense group so it assign the parentage of the solar system to a spiral nebula compose of planetismal and the planet as form from knot in the nebula where many planetismal have be concentrate near the intersection of they orbit these group of meteorite already as dense as a swarm of bee be then packed closer by the influence of gravity and the contracting mass be heat by the pressure even above the normal melting-point of the material which be keep rigid by the weight of the overlying layer now adopt this theory as the last word of science upon the subject of the origin of planet we see that it afford immense scope for diversity in result depend on the total _ amount _ of matter available within the range of attraction of a incipient planetary mass and the _ rate _ at which this matter become available by a special combination of these two quantity -lrb- which have almost certainly be different for each planet -rrb- i think we may be able to throw some light upon the structure and physical feature of mar _ the probable mode of origin of mar _ this planet lie between two of much greater mass have evidently have less material from which to be form by aggregation and if we assume -- as in the absence of evidence to the contrary we have a right to do -- that its beginning be not much later -lrb- or earlier -rrb- than those of the earth then its smaller size show that it have in all probability aggregated very much more slowly but the internal heat acquire by a planet while form in this manner will depend upon the rate at which it aggregate and the velocity with which the planetismal ' fall into it and this velocity will increase with its mass and consequent force of gravity in the early stage of a planet 's growth it will probably remain cold the small amount of heat produce by each impact be lose by radiation before the next one occur and with a small and slowly aggregate planet this condition will prevail till it approach its full size then only will its gravitative force be sufficient to cause incoming matter to fall upon it with so powerful a impact as to produce intense heat further the compressive force of a small planet will be a less effective heat-producing agency than in the case of a larger one the earth we know have acquire a large amount of internal heat probably sufficient to liquefy its whole interior but mar have only one-ninth part the mass of the earth and it be quite possible and even probable that its comparatively small attractive force would never have liquefy or even permanently heat the more central portion of its mass this be admit i suggest the follow course of event as quite possible and not even improbable in the case of this planet during the whole of its early growth and till it acquire nearly its present diameter its rate of aggregation be so slow that the planetismal fall upon it though they might have be heat and even partially liquefy by the impact be never in such quantity as to produce any considerable heating effect on the whole mass and each local rise of temperature be soon lose by radiation the planet thus grow as a solid and cold mass compacted together by the impact of the incoming matter as well as by its slowly increase gravitative force but when it have attain to within perhaps 100 perhaps 50 mile or less of its present diameter a great change occur in the opportunity for further growth some large and dense swarm of meteorite perhaps contain a number of body of the size of the asteroid come within the range of the sun 's attraction and be draw by it into a orbit which cross that of mar at such a small angle that the planet be able at each revolution to capture a considerable number of they the result might then be that as in the case of the earth the continuous inpour of the fresh matter first heated and later on liquefy the greater part of it as well perhaps as a thin layer of the planet 's original surface so that when in due course the whole of the meteor-swarm have be capture mar have acquire its present mass but would consist of a intensely heated and either liquid or plastic thin outer shell rest upon a cold and solid interior the size and position of the two recently discover satellite of mar which be believe to be not more than ten mile in diameter the more remote revolve around its primary very little slower than the planet rotate while the nearer one which be considerably less distant from the planet 's surface than its own antipode and revolve around it more than three time during the martian day may perhaps be look upon as the remnant of the great meteor-swarm which complete the martian development and which be perhaps themselves destine at some distant period to fall into the planet should future astronomer witness the phenomenon the effect produce upon its surface would be full of instruction as the result of such a origin as that suggest mar would possess a structure which in the essential feature of heat-distribution would be the very opposite of that which be believe to characterise the earth yet it might have be produce by a very slight modification of the same process this peculiar heat-distribution together with a much smaller mass and gravitative force would lead to a very different development of the surface and a altogether diverse geological history from ours which have throughout be profoundly influence by its heated interior its vast supply of water and the continuous physical and chemical reaction between the interior and the crust these reaction have in we case be of substantially the same nature and very nearly of the same degree of intensity throughout the whole vast eon of geological time and they have result in a wonderfully complex succession of rock-formation -- volcanic plutonic and sedimentary -- more or less intermingle throughout the whole series here remain horizontal as when first deposit there upheaved or depressed fractured or crushed inclined or contorted denude by rain and river with the assistance of heat and cold of frost and ice in a unceasing series of change so that however vary the surface may be with hill and dale plain and upland mountain range and deep intervene valley these be as nothing to the diversity of interior structure as exhibit in the side of every alpine valley or precipitous escarpment and make know to we by the work of the miner and the well-borer in every part of the world _ structural straight line on the earth _ the great characteristic of the earth both on its surface and in its interior be thus see to be extreme diversity both of form and structure and this be further intensify by the varied texture constitution hardness and density of the various rock and debris of which it be compose it be therefore not surprising that with such a complex outer crust we should nowhere find example of those geometrical form and almost world-wide straight line that give such a remarkable and as mr lowell maintain ` non-natural ' character to the surface of mar but which as it seem to I of themselves afford _ prima facie _ evidence of a corresponding simplicity and uniformity in its internal structure yet we be not ourselves by any means devoid of ` straight line ' structurally produce in spite of every obstacle of diversity of form and texture of softness and hardness of lamination or crystallisation which be adverse to such development example of these be the numerous ` fault ' which occur in the harder rock and which often extend for great distance in almost perfect straight line in we own country we have the tyneside and craven fault in the north of england which be 30 mile long and often 20 yard wide but even more striking be the great cleveland dyke -- a wall of volcanic rock dip slightly towards the south but sometimes be almost vertical and stretch across the country over hill and dale in a almost perfect straight line from a point on the coast ten mile north of scarborough in a west-by-north direction pass about two mile south of stockton and terminate about six mile north-by-east of barnard castle a distance of very nearly 60 mile the great fault between the highland and lowland of scotland extend across the country from stonehaven to near helensburgh a distance of 120 mile and there be very many more of less importance much more extensive be some of the great continental dislocation often form valley of considerable width and length the upper rhine flow in one of these great valley of subsidence for about 180 mile from mulhausen to frankfort in a generally straight line though modify by denudation vaster still be the valley of the jordan through the sea of galilee to the dead sea continue by the wady arabah to the gulf of akaba believe to form one vast geological depression or fracture extend in a straight line for 400 mile thousand of such fault dyke or depression exist in every part of the world all believe to be due to the gradual shrinking of the heated interior to which the solid crust have to accommodate itself and they be especially interesting and instructive for we present purpose as show the tendency of such fracture of solid rock-material to extend to great length in straight line notwithstanding the extreme irregularity both in the surface contour as well as in the internal structure of the varied deposit and formation through which they pass _ probable origin of the surface-feature of mar _ return now to mar let we consider the probable course of event from the point at which we leave it the heat produce by impact and condensation would be likely to release gas which have be in combination with some of the solid matter or perhaps be itself in a solid state due to intense cold and these escape outwards to the surface would produce on a small scale a certain amount of upheaval and volcanic disturbance and as a outer crust rapidly form a number of vent might remain as crater or craterlet in a moderate state of activity owe to the comparatively small force of gravity the outer crust would become scoriaceous and more or less permeate by the gas which would continue to escape through it and this would facilitate the cooling of the whole of the heated outer crust and allow it to become rather densely compacted when the greater portion of the gas have thus escape to the outer surface and assist to form a scanty atmosphere such as now exist there would be no more internal disturbance and the cooling of the heated outer coating would steadily progress result at last in a slightly heated and later in a cold layer of moderate thickness and great general uniformity owe to the absence of rain and river denudation such as we experience would be unknown though the superficial scoriaceous crust might be partially break up by expansion and contraction and suffer a certain amount of atmospheric erosion the final result of this mode of aggregation would be that the planet would consist of a outer layer of moderate thickness as compare with the central mass which outer layer would have cool from a highly heated state to a temperature considerably below the freezing-point and this would have be all the time _ contracting upon a previously cold and therefore non-contracting nucleus _ the result would be that very early in the process great superficial tension would be produce which could only be relieve by crack or fissure which would initiate at point of weakness -- probably at the craterlet already refer to -- from which they would radiate in several direction each crack thus form near the surface would as cool progress develop in length and depth and owe to the general uniformity of the material and possibly some amount of crystalline structure due to slow and continuous cool down to a very low temperature the crack would tend to run on in straight line and to extend vertically downward which two circumstance would necessarily result in they form portion of ` great circle ' on the planet 's surface -- the two great fact which mr lowell appeal to as be especially ` non-natural ' _ symmetry of basaltic column _ we have however one quite natural fact on we earth which serve to illustrate one of these two feature the direction of the downward fissure this be the comparatively common phenomenon of basaltic column and ` giant 's causeway ' the wonderful regularity of these and especially the not unfrequent upright pillar in serried rank as in the palisade of the hudson river must have always impressed observer with they appearance of artificiality yet they be undoubtedly the result of the very slow cooling and contraction of melted rock under compression by stratum _ below and above they _ so that when once solidify the mass be hold in position and the tension produce by contraction could only be relieve by numerous very small crack at short distance from each other in every direction result in five six or seven-sided polygon with side only a few inch long this contraction begin of course at the coolest surface generally the upper one and observation of these column in various position have establish the rule that they direction lengthway _ be always at right angle to the cooling surface _ and thus whenever this surface be horizontal the column become almost exactly vertical _ how this apply to mar _ one of the feature of the surface of mar that mr lowell describe with much confidence be that it be wonderfully uniform and level which of course it would be if it have once be in a liquid or plastic state and not much disturbed since by volcanic or other internal movement the result would be that crack form by contraction of the harden outer crust would be vertical and in a generally uniform material at a very uniform temperature these crack would continue almost indefinitely in straight line the hardened and contracting surface be free to move laterally on account of there be a more heated and plastic layer below it the crack once initiate above would continually widen at the surface as they penetrate deeper and deeper into the slightly heated substratum now as basalt begin to soften at about 1400 ° f and the surface of mar have cool to at least the freezing-point -- perhaps very much below it -- the contraction would be so great that if the fissure produce be 500 mile apart they might be three mile wide at the surface and if only 100 mile apart then about two-third of a mile wide -lrb- 15 -rrb- but as the production of the fissure might have occupy perhaps million of year a considerable amount of atmospheric denudation would result however slowly it act expansion and contraction would wear away the edge and side of the fissure fill up many of they with the debris and widen they at the surface to perhaps double they original size -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : the coefficient of contraction of basalt be 0000006 for 1 ° f which would lead to the result give here -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : mr wh pickering observe cloud on mar 15 mile high these be the ` projection ' see on the terminator when the planet be partially illuminate they be at first think to be mountain but during the opposition of 1894 more than 400 of they be see at flagstaff during nine month ' observation usually they be of rare occurrence they be see to change in form and position from day to day and mr lowell be strongly of opinion that they be dust-storm not what we term cloud they be mostly about 13 mile high indicate considerable aerial disturbance on the planet and therefore capable of produce proportional surface denudation -rrb- _ suggest explanation of the ` oasis ' _ the numerous round dot see upon the ` canal ' and especially at point from which several canal radiate and where they intersect -- term ` oasis ' by mr lowell and ` craterlet ' by mr pickering may be explain in two way those from which several canal radiate may be true crater from which the gas imprison in the heated surface layer have gradually escape they would be situate at point of weakness in the crust and become centre from which crack would start during contraction those dot which occur at the cross of two straight canal or crack may have originate from the fact that at such intersection there would be four sharply-projecting angle which be expose to the influence of alternate heat and cold -lrb- during day and night -rrb- on the two opposite surface would inevitably in time become fractured and crumble away result in the formation of a roughly circular chasm which would become partly fill up by the debris those form by crack radiate from craterlet would also be subject to the same process of round off to a even greater extent and thus would be produce the ` oasis ' of various size up to 50 mile or more in diameter record by mr lowell and other observer _ probable function of the great fissure _ mr pickering as we have see suppose that these fissure give out the gas which overflow on each side favor the growth of the suppose vegetation which render the course of the canal visible and this no doubt may have be the case during the remote period when these crack give access to the heated portion of the surface layer but it seem more probable that mar have now cool down to the almost uniform mean temperature it derive from solar heat and that the fissure -- now for the most part broad shallow valley -- serve merely as channel along which the liquid and heavy gas derive from the melting of the polar snow naturally flow and owe to they nearly level surface overflow to a certain distance on each side of they _ suggest origin of the blue patch _ these heavy gas mainly perhaps as have be often suggest carbon-dioxide would when in large quantity and of considerable depth reflect a good deal of light and be almost inevitably dust-laden might produce that blue tinge adjacent to the melting snow-cap which mr lowell have erroneously assume to be itself a proof of the presence of liquid water just as the blue of we sky be undoubtedly due to reflection from the ultra-minute dust particle in we higher atmosphere similar particle bring down by the ` snow ' from the higher martian atmosphere might produce the blue tinge in the great volume of heavy gas produce by its evaporation or liquefaction it may be note that mr lowell object to the carbon-dioxide theory of the formation of the snow-cap that this gas at low pressure do not liquefy but pass at once from the solid to the gaseous state and that only water remain liquid sufficiently long to produce the blue color ' which play so large a part in he argument for the mild climate essential for a inhabit planet but this argument as i have already show be valueless for only very deep water can possibly show a blue color by reflect light while a dust-laden atmosphere -- especially with a layer of very dense gas at the bottom of it as would be the case with the newly evaporate carbon-dioxide from the diminish snow-cap -- would provide the very condition likely to produce this blue tinge of color it may be consider a support to this view that carbonic-acid gas become liquid at -- 140 ° f and solid at -- 162 ° f temperature far higher than we should expect to prevail in the polar and north temperate region of mar during a considerable part of the year but such as might be reach there during the summer solstice when the ` snow ' so rapidly disappear to be re-form a few month later _ the double canal _ the curious phenomenon of the ` double canal ' be undoubtedly the most difficult to explain satisfactorily on any theory that have yet be suggest they vary in distance apart from about 100 to 400 mile in many case they appear perfectly parallel and mr lowell give we the impression that they be almost always so but he map show in some case decide difference of width at the two extremity indicate considerable want of parallelism a few of the curved canal be also double there be one drawing in mr lowell 's book -lrb- p 219 -rrb- of the mouth or start point of the euphrate and phison two widely separated double canal diverge at a angle of about 40 ° from the same two oasis so that the two inner canal cross each other now this suggest two wide band of weakness in the planet 's crust radiate probably from within the dark tract call the ` mare icarium ' and that some widespread volcanic outburst initiate diverge crack on either side of these band something of this kind may have be the cause of most of the double canal or they may have be start from two or more craterlet not far apart the direction be at first decide by some local peculiarity of structure and where begin continue in straight line owe to homogeneity or uniform density of material this be very vague but the phenomenon be so remarkable and so very imperfectly know at present that nothing but suggestion can be attempt _ conclude remark on the ` canal ' _ in this somewhat detailed exposition of a possible and i hope a probable explanation of the surface-feature of mar i have endeavor to be guide by known fact or accept theory both astronomical and geological i think i may claim to have show that there be some analogous feature of terrestrial rock-structure to serve as guide towards a natural and intelligible explanation of the strange geometric marking discover during the last thirty year and which have raise this planet from comparative obscurity into a position of the very first rank both in astronomical and popular interest this wide-spread interest be very largely due to mr lowell 's devotion to its study both in seek out so admirable a position as regard altitude and climate and in establish there a first-class observatory and also in bring he discovery before the public in connection with a theory so startling as to compel attention i venture to think that he merit as one of we first astronomical observer will in no way be diminish by the rejection of he theory and the substitution of one more in accordance with the actually observe fact appendix _ a suggest experiment to illustrate the ` canal ' of mar _ if my explanation of the ` canal ' should be substantially correct -- that be if they be produce by the contraction of a heated outward crust upon a cold and therefore non-contracting interior the result of such a condition might be show experimentally several baked clay ball might be form to serve as core say of 8 to 10 inch in diameter these be fix within mould of say half a inch to a inch greater diameter the outer layer would be form by pour in some suitable heated liquid material and release it from the mould as soon as consolidation occur so that it may cool rapidly from the _ outside _ some kind of impure glass or the brittle metal bismuth or antimony or alloy of these might be use in order to see what form the result fracture would take it would be well to have several duplicate of each ball and as soon as tension through contraction manifest itself to try the effect of firing very small charge of small shot to ascertain whether such impact would start radiate fracture when take from the mould the ball should be suspend in a slight current of air and keep rotate to reproduce the planetary condition as nearly as possible the exact size and material of the core the thickness of the heated outer crust the material best suit to show fracture by contraction and the detail of they treatment might be modify in various way as suggest by the result first obtain such a series of experiment would probably throw further light on the physical condition which have produce the gigantic system of fissure or channel we see upon the surface of mar though it would not of course prove that such condition actually exist there in such a speculative matter we can only be guide by probability base upon whatever evidence be available chapter viii summary and conclusion this little volume have necessarily touch upon a great variety of subject in order to deal in a tolerably complete manner with the very extraordinary theory by which mr lowell attempt to explain the unique feature of the surface of the planet which by long-continued study he have almost make he own it may therefore be well to sum up the main point of the argument against he view introduce a few other fact and consideration which greatly strengthen my argument the one great feature of mar which lead mr lowell to adopt the view of its be inhabit by a race of highly intelligent being and with ever-increasing discovery to uphold this theory to the present time be undoubtedly that of the so-called ` canal ' -- they straightness they enormous length they great abundance and they extension over the planet 's whole surface from one polar snow-cap to the other the very immensity of this system and its constant growth and extension during fifteen year of persistent observation have so completely take possession of he mind that after a very hasty glance at analogous fact and possibility he have declare they to be ` non-natural ' -- therefore to be work of art -- therefore to necessitate the presence of highly intelligent being who have design and construct they this idea have color or govern all he writings on the subject the innumerable difficulty which it raise have be either ignore or brush aside on the flimsiest evidence as example he never even discuss the totally inadequate water-supply for such worldwide irrigation or the extreme irrationality of construct so vast a canal-system the waste from which by evaporation when expose to such desert condition as he himself describe would use up ten time the probable supply again he urge the ` purpose ' display in these ` canal ' they be _ all _ so straight _ all _ describe great circle of the ` sphere ' all be so evidently arrange -lrb- as he think -rrb- either to carry water to some ` oasis ' 2000 mile away or to reach some arid region far over the equator in the opposite hemisphere but he never consider the difficulty this imply everywhere these canal run for thousand of mile across waterless desert form a system and indicate a purpose the wonderful perfection of which he be never tire of dwelling upon -lrb- but which i myself can nowhere perceive -rrb- yet he never even attempt to explain how the martian could have live _ before _ this great system be plan and execute or why they do not _ first _ utilise and render fertile the belt of land adjacent to the limit of the polar snow -- why the method of irrigation do not as with all human art begin gradually at home with terrace and channel to irrigate the land close to the source of the water how with such a desert as he describe three-fourth of mar to be do the inhabitant ever get to _ know _ anything of the equatorial region and its need so as to start right away to supply those need all this to my mind be quite oppose to the idea of they be work of art and altogether in favor of they be natural feature of a globe as peculiar in origin and internal structure as it be in its surface-feature the explanation i have give though of course hypothetical be found on known cosmical and terrestrial fact and be i suggest far more scientific as well as more satisfactory than mr lowell 's wholly unsupported speculation this view i have explain in some detail in the precede chapter mr lowell never even refer to the important question of loss by evaporation in these enormous open canal or consider the undoubted fact that the only intelligent and practical way to convey a limited quantity of water such great distance would be by a system of water-tight and air-tight tube lay _ under the ground _ the mere attempt to use open canal for such a purpose show complete ignorance and stupidity in these allege very superior being while it be certain that long before half of they be complete they failure to be of any use would have lead any rational being to cease construct they he also fail to consider the difficulty that if these canal be necessary for existence in mar how do the inhabitant ever reach a sufficiently large population with surplus food and leisure enable they to rise from the low condition of savage to one of civilisation and ultimately to scientific knowledge here again be a dilemma which be hard to overcome only a _ dense _ population with _ ample _ means of subsistence could possibly have construct such gigantic work but give these two condition no adequate motive exist for the conception and execution of they -- even if they be likely to be of any use which i have show they could not be _ further consideration on the climate of mar _ recur now to the question of climate which be all-important mr lowell never even discuss the essential point -- the temperature that must _ necessarily _ result from a atmospheric envelope one-twelfth -lrb- or at most one-seventh -rrb- the density of we own in either case correspond to a altitude far greater than that of we highest mountain -lrb- 17 -rrb- surely this phenomenon everywhere manifest on the earth even under the equator of a regular decrease of temperature with altitude the only cause of which be a less dense atmosphere should have be fairly grapple with and some attempt make to show why it should not apply to mar except the weak remark that on a level surface it will not have the same effect as on expose mountain height but it _ do _ have the same effect or very nearly so on we lofty plateau often hundred of mile in extent in proportion to they altitude quito at 9350 ft above the sea have a mean temperature of about 57 ° f give a lowering of 23 ° from that of manao at the mouth of the rio negro this be about a degree for each 400 foot while the general fall for isolate mountain be about one degree in 340 foot accord to humboldt who note the above difference between the rate of cool for altitude of the plain -- or more usually sheltered valley in which the town be situate -- and the expose mountain side it will be see that this lower rate would bring the temperature of mar at the equator down to 20 ° f below the freezing point of water from this cause alone -lrb- footnote 17 : a four inch barometer be equivalent to a height of 40000 foot above sea-level with we -rrb- but all enquirer have admit that if condition as to atmosphere be the same as on the earth its greater distance from the sun would reduce the temperature to-31 ° f equal to 63 ° below the freezing point it be therefore certain that the combined effect of both cause must bring the temperature of mar down to at least 70 ° or 80 ° below the freezing point the cause of this absolute dependence of terrestrial temperature upon density of the air-envelope be seldom discuss in text-book either of geography or of physics and there seem to be still some uncertainty about it some impute it wholly to the thinner air be unable to absorb and retain so much heat as that which be more dense but if this be the case the soil at great altitude not have so much of its heat take up by the air should be warmer than below since it undoubtedly _ receive _ more heat owe to the greater transparency of the air above it but it certainly do not become warmer the more correct view seem to be that the loss of heat by radiation be increase so much through the rarity of the air above it as to _ more _ than counterbalance the increase insolation so that though the surface of the earth at a give altitude may receive 10 per cent more direct sun-heat it lose by direct radiation combine with diminish air and cloud-radiation perhaps 20 or 25 per cent more whence there be a resultant cooling effect of 10 or 15 per cent this act by day as well as by night so that the greater heat receive at high altitude do not warm the soil so much as a less amount of heat with a denser atmosphere this effect be further intensify by the fact that a less dense can not absorb and transmit so much heat as a more dense atmosphere here then we have a absolute law of nature to be observe operate everywhere on the earth and the mode of action of which be fairly well understand this law be that reduce atmospheric pressure increase radiation or loss of heat _ more rapidly _ than it increase insolation or gain of heat so that the result be _ always _ a considerable _ lower _ of temperature what this lowering be can be see in the universal fact that even within the tropics perpetual snow cover the higher mountain summit while on the high plain of the ande at 15000 or 16000 foot altitude where there be very little or no snow traveller be often freeze to death when delay by storm yet at this elevation the atmosphere have much more than double the density of that of mar the error in mr lowell 's argument be that he claim for the scanty atmosphere of mar that it allow more sun-heat to reach the surface but he omit to take account of the enormously increase loss of heat by direct radiation as well as by the diminution of air-radiation which together necessarily produce a great reduction of temperature it be this great principle of the prepotency of radiation over absorption with a diminish atmosphere that explain the excessively low temperature of the moon 's surface a fact which also serve to indicate a very low temperature for mar as i have show in chapter vi these two independent argument -- from alpine temperature and from those of the moon -- support and enforce each other and afford a conclusive proof -lrb- as against anything advance by mr lowell -rrb- that the temperature of mar must be far too low to support animal life a third independent argument lead to the same result be dr johnstone stoney 's proof that aqueous vapor can not exist on mar and this fact mr lowell do not attempt to controvert to put the whole case in the fewest possible word : all physicist be agree that owe to the distance of mar from the sun it would have a mean temperature of about-35 ° f -lrb- = 456 ° f abs -rrb- even if it have a atmosphere as dense as ours -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the very low temperature on the earth under the equator at a height where the barometer stand at about three time as high as on mar prove that from scantiness of atmosphere alone mar can not possibly have a temperature as high as the freezing point of water and this proof be support by langley 's determination of the low _ maximum _ temperature of the full moon the combination of these two result must bring down the temperature of mar to a degree wholly incompatible with the existence of animal life -lrb- 3 -rrb- the quite independent proof that water-vapour can not exist on mar and that therefore the first essential of organic life -- water -- be non-existent the conclusion from these three independent proof which enforce each other in the multiple ratio of they respective weight be therefore irresistible -- that animal life especially in its higher form can not exist on the planet mar therefore be not only uninhabited by intelligent being such as mr lowell postulate but be absolutely uninhabitable end of project
