samuel johnson be bear in lichfield in 1709 he father michael johnson be a bookseller highly respect by the cathedral clergy and for a time sufficiently prosperous to be a magistrate of the town and in the year of he son 's birth sheriff of the county he open a bookstall on market-day at neighbouring town include birmingham which be as yet unable to maintain a separate bookseller the tradesman often exaggerate the prejudice of the class whose want he supply and michael johnson be probably a more devoted high churchman and tory than many of the cathedral clergy themselves he reconcile himself with difficulty to take the oath against the exile dynasty he be a man of considerable mental and physical power but torment by hypochondriacal tendency he son inherit a share both of he constitution and of he principle long afterwards samuel associate with he childish day a faint but solemn recollection of a lady in diamond and long black hood the lady be queen anne to whom in compliance with a superstition just die a natural death he have be take by he mother to be touch for the king 's evil the touch be ineffectual perhaps as boswell suggest he ought to have be present to the genuine heir of the stuart in rome disease and superstition have thus stand by he cradle and they never quit he during life the demon of hypochondria be always lie in wait for he and could be exorcise for a time only by hard work or social excitement of this we shall hear enough but it may be as well to sum up at once some of the physical characteristic which mark he through life and greatly influence he career the disease have scar and disfigure feature otherwise regular and always impressive it have seriously injured he eye entirely destroy it seem the sight of one he could not it be say distinguish a friend 's face half a yard off and picture be to he meaningless patch in which he could never see the resemblance to they object the statement be perhaps exaggerate for he could see enough to condemn a portrait of himself he express some annoyance when reynold have paint he with a pen hold close to he eye and protest that he would not be hand down to posterity as blinking sam it seem that habit of minute attention atone in some degree for this natural defect boswell tell we how johnson once correct he as to the precise shape of a mountain and mr thrale say that he be a close and exacting critic of lady ' dress even to the accidental position of a riband he could even lay down aesthetical canon upon such matter he reprove she for wear a dark dress as unsuitable to a little creature what he ask have not all insect gay color he insensibility to music be even more pronounced than he dulness of sight on hear it say in praise of a musical performance that it be in any case difficult he feeling comment be i wish it have be impossible the queer convulsion by which he amaze all beholder be probably connect with he disease though he and reynold ascribe they simply to habit when enter a doorway with he blind companion miss william he would suddenly desert she on the step in order to whirl and twist about in strange gesticulation the performance partook of the nature of a superstitious ceremonial he would stop in a street or the middle of a room to go through it correctly once he collect a laughing mob in twickenham meadow by he antic he hand imitate the motion of a jockey ride at full speed and he foot twist in and out to make heel and toe touch alternately he presently sit down and take out a _ grotius de veritate _ over which he seesaw so violently that the mob run back to see what be the matter once in such a fit he suddenly twist off the shoe of a lady who sit by he sometimes he seem to be obey some hidden impulse which command he to touch every post in a street or tread on the center of every paving-stone and would return if he task have not be accurately perform in spite of such oddity he be not only possess of physical power correspond to he great height and massive stature but be something of a proficient at athletic exercise he be conversant with the theory at least of boxing a knowledge probably acquire from a uncle who keep the ring at smithfield for a year and be never beat in boxing or wrestle he constitutional fearlessness would have make he a formidable antagonist hawkin describe the oak staff six foot in length and increase from one to three inch in diameter which lay ready to he hand when he expect a attack from macpherson of ossian celebrity once he be say to have take up a chair at the theater upon which a man have seat himself during he temporary absence and to have toss it and its occupant bodily into the pit he would swim into pool say to be dangerous beat huge dog into peace climb tree and even run race and jump gate once at least he go out foxhunting and though he despise the amusement be deeply touch by the complimentary assertion that he ride as well as the most illiterate fellow in england perhaps the most whimsical of he performance be when in he fifty-fifth year he go to the top of a high hill with he friend langton i have not have a roll for a long time say the great lexicographer suddenly and after deliberately empty he pocket he lay himself parallel to the edge of the hill and descend turn over and over till he come to the bottom we may believe as mr thrale remark upon he jump over a stool to show that he be not tire by he hunting that he performance in this kind be so strange and uncouth that a fear for the safety of he bone quench the spectator 's tendency to laugh in such a strange case be imprison one of the most vigorous intellect of the time vast strength hamper by clumsiness and associate with grievous disease deep and massive power of feeling limit by narrow though acute perception be characteristic both of soul and body these peculiarity be manifest from he early infancy miss seward a typical specimen of the provincial _ précieuse _ attempt to trace they in a epitaph which he be say to have write at the age of three here lie good master duck whom samuel johnson tread on if it have live it have be good luck for then we have have a odd one the verse however be really make by he father who pass they off as the child 's and illustrate nothing but the paternal vanity in fact the boy be regard as something of a infant prodigy he great power of memory characteristic of a mind singularly retentive of all impression be early develop he seem to learn by intuition indolence as in he after life alternate with brief effort of strenuous exertion he want of sight prevent he from share in the ordinary childish sport and one of he great pleasure be in read old romance -- a taste which he retain through life boy of this temperament be generally despise by they fellow but johnson seem to have have the power of enforce the respect of he companion three of the lad use to come for he in the morning and carry he in triumph to school seat upon the shoulder of one and support on each side by he companion after learn to read at a dame-school and from a certain tom brown of whom it be only record that he publish a spelling-book and dedicate it to the universe young samuel be send to the lichfield grammar school and be afterwards for a short time apparently in the character of pupil-teacher at the school of stourbridge in worcestershire a good deal of latin be whip into he and though he complain of the excessive severity of two of he teacher he be always a believer in the virtue of the rod a child he say who be flog get he task and there be a end o not whereas by exciting emulation and comparison of superiority you lay the foundation of lasting mischief you make brother and sister hate each other in practice indeed this stern disciplinarian seem to have be specially indulgent to child the memory of he own sorrow make he value they happiness and he rejoice greatly when he at last persuade a schoolmaster to remit the old-fashioned holiday-task johnson leave school at sixteen and spend two year at home probably in learn he father 's business this seem to have be the chief period of he study long afterwards he say that he know almost as much at eighteen as he do at the age of fifty-three -- the date of the remark he father 's shop would give he many opportunity and he devour what come in he way with the undiscriminating eagerness of a young student he intellectual resemble he physical appetite he gorge book he tear the heart out of they but do not study systematically do you read book through he ask indignantly of some one who expect from he such supererogatory labor he memory enable he to accumulate great store of a desultory and unsystematic knowledge somehow he become a fine latin scholar though never first-rate as a grecian the direction of he study be partly determine by the discovery of a folio of petrarch lie on a shelf where he be look for apple and one of he earliest literary plan never carry out be a edition of politian with a history of latin poetry from the time of petrarch when he go to the university at the end of this period he be in possession of a very unusual amount of read meanwhile he be begin to feel the pressure of poverty he father 's affair be probably get into disorder one anecdote -- it be one which it be difficult to read without emotion -- refer to this period many year afterwards johnson worn by disease and the hard struggle of life be stay at lichfield where a few old friend still survive but in which every street must have revive the memory of the many who have long since go over to the majority he be miss one morning at breakfast and do not return till supper-time then he tell how he time have be pass on that day fifty year before he father confine by illness have beg he to take he place to sell book at a stall at uttoxeter pride make he refuse to do away with the sin of this disobedience i this day go in a post-chaise to uttoxeter and go into the market at the time of high business uncover my head and stand with it bare a hour before the stall which my father have formerly use expose to the sneer of the standers-by and the inclemency of the weather a penance by which i trust i have propitiate heaven for this only instance i believe of contumacy to my father if the anecdote illustrate the touch of superstition in johnson 's mind it reveal too that sacred depth of tenderness which ennoble he character no repentance can ever wipe out the past or make it be as though it have not be but the remorse of a fine character may be transmute into a permanent source of nobler view of life and the world there be difficulty in determine the circumstance and duration of johnson 's stay at oxford he begin residence at pembroke college in 1728 it seem probable that he receive some assistance from a gentleman whose son take he as companion and from the clergy of lichfield to whom he father be know and who be aware of the son 's talent possibly he college assist he during part of the time it be certain that he leave without take a degree though he probably reside for nearly three year it be certain also that he father 's bankruptcy make he stay difficult and that the period must have be one of trial the effect of the oxford residence upon johnson 's mind be characteristic the lad already suffer from the attack of melancholy which sometimes drive he to the border of insanity at oxford law 's _ serious call _ give he the strong religious impression which remain through life but he do not seem to have be regard as a gloomy or a religious youth by he contemporary when tell in after year that he have be describe as a gay and frolicsome fellow he reply ah sir i be mad and violent it be bitterness which they mistake for frolic i be miserably poor and i think to fight my way by my literature and my wit so i disregard all power and all authority though a hearty supporter of authority in principle johnson be distinguish through life by the strongest spirit of personal independence and self-respect he hold too the sound doctrine deplore by he respectable biographer hawkin that the scholar 's life like the christian 's level all distinction of rank when a officious benefactor put a pair of new shoe at he door he throw they away with indignation he seem to have treat he tutor with a contempt which boswell politely attribute to great fortitude of mind but johnson himself set down as stark insensibility the life of a poor student be not one may fear even yet exempt from much bitterness and in those day the position be far more servile than at present the servitor and sizar have much to bear from richer companion a proud melancholy lad conscious of great power have to meet with hard rebuff and try to meet they by return scorn for scorn such distress however do not shake johnson 's rooted toryism he fully imbibe if he do not already share the strongest prejudice of the place and he misery never produce a revolt against the system though it may have foster insolence to individual three of the most eminent man with whom johnson come in contact in later life have also be student at oxford wesley he senior by six year be a fellow of lincoln whilst johnson be a undergraduate and be learn at oxford the necessity of rouse he countryman from the religious lethargy into which they have sink have not pride and haughtiness of spirit impatience and peevishness sloth and indolence gluttony and sensuality and even a proverbial uselessness be object to we perhaps not always by we enemy nor wholly without ground so say wesley preach before the university of oxford in 1744 and the word in he mouth imply more than the preacher 's formality adam smith johnson 's junior by fourteen year be so impressed by the utter indifference of oxford authority to they duty as to find in it a admirable illustration of the consequence of the neglect of the true principle of supply and demand imply in the endowment of learn gibbon he junior by twenty-eight year pass at oxford the most idle and unprofitable month of he whole life and be he say as willing to disclaim the university for a mother as she could be to renounce he for a son oxford as judge by these man be remarkable as a illustration of the spiritual and intellectual decadence of a body which at other time have be a center of great movement of thought johnson though he experience be rougher than any of the three love oxford as though she have not be a harsh stepmother to he youth sir he say fondly of he college we be a nest of singing-bird most of the strain be now pretty well forget and some of they must at all time have be such as we scarcely associate with the nightingale johnson however cherish he college friendship delighted in pay visit to he old university and be deeply touch by the academical honor by which oxford long afterwards recognize a eminence scarcely foster by its protection far from share the doctrine of adam smith he only regret that the university be not richer and express a desire which will be understand by advocate of the endowment of research that there be many place of a thousand a year at oxford on leave the university in 1731 the world be all before he he father die in the end of the year and johnson 's whole immediate inheritance be twenty pound where be he to turn for daily bread even in those day most gate be bar with gold and open but to golden key the greatest chance for a poor man be probably through the church the career of warburton who rise from a similar position to a bishopric might have be rival by johnson and he connexion with lichfield might one would suppose have help he to a start it would be easy to speculate upon cause which might have hinder such a career in later life he more than once refuse to take order upon the promise of a living johnson as we know he be a man of the world though a religious man of the world he represent the secular rather than the ecclesiastical type so far as he mode of teaching go he be rather a disciple of socrate than of st paul or wesley accord to he a tavern-chair be the throne of human felicity and supply a better arena than the pulpit for the utterance of he message to mankind and though he external circumstance doubtless determine he method there be much in he character which make it congenial johnson 's religious emotion be such as to make habitual reserve almost a sanitary necessity they be deeply color by he constitutional melancholy fear of death and hell be prominent in he personal creed to trade upon he feeling like a charlatan would have be abhorrent to he masculine character and to give they full and frequent utterance like a genuine teacher of mankind would have be to imperil he sanity if he have go through the excitement of a methodist conversion he would probably have end he day in a madhouse such consideration however be not one may guess distinctly present to johnson himself and the offer of a college fellowship or of private patronage might probably have alter he career he might have become a learn recluse or a struggle parson adam college fellowship be less open to talent then than now and patron be never too propitious to the uncouth giant who have to force he way by sheer labor and fight for he own hand accordingly the young scholar try to coin he brain into money by the most depressing and least hopeful of employment by become a usher in a school he could at least turn he talent to account with little delay and that be the most pressing consideration by one schoolmaster he be reject on the ground that he infirmity would excite the ridicule of the boy under another he pass some month of complicated misery and could never think of the school without horror and aversion finding this situation intolerable he settle in birmingham in 1733 to be near a old schoolfellow name hector who be apparently begin to practice as a surgeon johnson seem to have have some acquaintance among the comfortable family in the neighborhood but he means of living be obscure some small literary work come in he way he contribute essay to a local paper and translate a book of travels in abyssinium for this he first publication he receive five guinea in 1734 he make certain overture to cave a london publisher of the result of which i shall have to speak presently for the present it be pretty clear that the great problem of self-support have be very inadequately solve have no money and no prospects johnson naturally marry the attraction of the lady be not very manifest to other than she husband she be the widow of a birmingham mercer name porter she age at the time -lrb- 1735 -rrb- of the second marriage be forty-eight the bridegroom be not quite twenty-six the biographer 's eye be not fix upon johnson till after he wife 's death and we have little in the way of authentic description of she person and character garrick who have know she say that she be very fat with cheek color both by paint and cordial flimsy and fantastic in dress and affect in she manners she be say to have treat she husband with some contempt adopt the air of a antiquated beauty which he return by elaborate deference garrick use he wonderful power of mimicry to make fun of the uncouth caress of the husband and the courtly beauclerc use to provoke the smile of he audience by repeat johnson 's assertion that it be a love-match on both side one incident of the wedding-day be ominous as the newly-married couple ride back from church mr johnson show she spirit by reproach she husband for ride too fast and then for lag behind resolve not to be make the slave of caprice he push on briskly till he be fairly out of sight when she rejoin he as he of course take care that she should soon do she be in tear mr johnson apparently know how to regain supremacy but at any rate johnson love she devotedly during life and clung to she memory during a widowhood of more than thirty year as fondly as if they have be the most pattern hero and heroine of romantic fiction whatever mrs johnson 's charm she seem to have be a woman of good sense and some literary judgment johnson 's grotesque appearance do not prevent she from say to she daughter on they first introduction this be the most sensible man i ever meet she praise be we may believe sweeter to he than those of the severest critic or the most fervent of personal flatterer like all good man johnson love good woman and like to have on hand a flirtation or two as warm as might be within the bound of due decorum but nothing affect he fidelity to he letty or displace she image in he mind he remember she in many solemn prayer and such word as this be dear letty 's book : or this be a prayer which dear letty be accustom to say be find write by he in many of she book of devotion mr johnson have one other recommendation -- a fortune namely of # 800 -- little enough even then as a provision for the support of the married pair but enough to help johnson to make a fresh start in 1736 there appear a advertisement in the _ gentleman 's magazine _ at edial near lichfield in staffordshire young gentleman be board and teach the latin and greek language by samuel johnson if as seem probable mr johnson 's money supply the fund for this venture it be a unlucky speculation johnson be not fit to be a pedagogue success in that profession imply skill in the management of pupil but perhaps still more decidedly in the management of parent johnson have little qualification in either way as a teacher he would probably have be alternately despotic and over-indulgent and on the other hand at a single glance the rough dominie sampson would be enough to frighten the ordinary parent off he premise very few pupil come and they seem to have profit little if a story as tell of two of he pupil refer to this time after some month of instruction in english history he ask they who have destroy the monastery one of they give no answer the other reply jesus christ johnson however could boast of one eminent pupil in david garrick though by garrick 's account he master be of little service except as afford a excellent mark for he early power of ridicule the school or academy fail after a year and a half and johnson once more at a loss for employment resolve to try the great experiment make so often and so often unsuccessfully he leave lichfield to seek he fortune in london garrick accompany he and the two bring a common letter of introduction to the master of a academy from gilbert walmsley registrar of the prerogative court in lichfield long afterwards johnson take a opportunity in the _ life of the poet _ of express he warm regard for the memory of he early friend to whom he have be recommend by a community of literary taste in spite of party difference and great inequality of age walmsley say in he letter that one johnson be about to accompany garrick to london in order to try he fate with a tragedy and get himself employ in translation johnson he add be a very good scholar and poet and i have great hope will turn out a fine tragedy writer the letter be date march 2nd 1737 before record what be know of he early career thus start it will be well to take a glance at the general condition of the profession of literature in england at this period chapter ii literary career no man but a blockhead say johnson ever write except for money the doctrine be of course perfectly outrageous and specially calculate to shock people who like to keep it for they private use instead of proclaim it in public but it be a good expression of that huge contempt for the foppery of high-flown sentiment which as be not uncommon with johnson pass into something which would be cynical if it be not half-humorous in this case it imply also the contempt of the professional for the amateur johnson despise gentleman who dabble in he craft as a man whose life be devote to music or painting despise the lady and gentleman who treat those art as fashionable accomplishment a author be accord to he a man who turn out book as a bricklayer turn out house or a tailor coat so long as he supply a good article and get a fair price he be a fool to grumble and a humbug to affect loftier motive johnson be not the first professional author in this sense but perhaps the first man who make the profession respectable the principal habitat of author in he age be grub street -- a region which in later year have cease to be ashamed of itself and have adopt the more pretentious name bohemia the original grub street it be say first become associate with authorship during the increase of pamphlet literature produce by the civil war fox the martyrologist be one of its original inhabitant another of its hero be a certain mr welby of whom the sole record be that he live there forty year without be see of any in fact it be a region of hole and corner calculate to illustrate that great advantage of london life which a friend of boswell 's describe by say that a man could there be always close to he burrow the burrow which receive the luckless wight be indeed no pleasant refuge since poor green in the earliest generation of dramatist buy he groat ` sworth of wit with a million of repentance too many of he brethren have trodden the path which lead to hopeless misery or death in a tavern brawl the history of man who have to support themselves by they pen be a record of almost universal gloom the name of spenser of butler and of otway be enough to remind we that even warm contemporary recognition be not enough to raise a author above the fear of die in want of necessaries the two great dictator of literature ben jonson in the earlier and dryden in the later part of the century only keep they head above water by help of the laureate 's pittance though reckless imprudence encourage by the precarious life be the cause of much of they suffering patronage give but a fitful resource and the author could hope at most but a occasional crust fling to he from better provide table in the happy day of queen anne it be true there have be a gleam of prosperity many author addison congreve swift and other of less name have win by they pen not only temporary profit but permanent place the class which come into power at the revolution be willing for a time to share some of the public patronage with man distinguish for intellectual eminence patronage be liberal when the fund come out of other man 's pocket but as the system of party government develop it soon become evident that this involve a waste of power there be enough political partisan to absorb all the comfortable sinecure to be have and such money as be still spend upon literature be give in return for service equally degrade to giver and receiver nor do the patronage of literature reach the poor inhabitant of grub street addison 's poetical power might suggest or justify the gift of a place from he elegant friend but a man like de foe who really look to he pen for great part of he daily subsistence be below the region of such prize and be oblige in later year not only to write inferior book for money but to sell himself and act as a spy upon he fellow one great man it be true make a independence by literature pope receive some # 8000 for he translation of homer by the then popular mode of subscription -- a kind of compromise between the system of patronage and public support but he success cause little pleasure in grub street no love be lose between the poet and the dweller in this dismal region pope be its deadliest enemy and carry on a internecine warfare with its inmate which have enrich we language with a great satire but which waste he power upon low object and tempt he into disgraceful artifice the life of the unfortunate victim pillory in the _ dunciad _ and accuse of the unpardonable sin of poverty and dependence be too often one which might have extort sympathy even from a thin-skinned poet and critic illustration of the manners and custom of that grub street of which johnson be to become a inmate be only too abundant the best writer of the day could tell of hardship endure in that dismal region richardson go on the sound principle of keep he shop that he shop might keep he but the other great novelist of the century have paint from life the misery of a author 's existence fielding smollett and goldsmith have describe the poor wretch with a vivid force which give sadness to the reflection that each of those great man be draw upon he own experience and that they each die in distress the _ case of author by profession _ to quote the title of a pamphlet by ralph be indeed a wretched one when the greatest of they number have a incessant struggle to keep the wolf from the door the life of a author resemble the proverbial existence of the flying-fish chase by enemy in sea and in air he only escape from the slavery of the bookseller 's garret to fly from the bailiff or rot in the debtor 's ward or the spunging-house many strange half-pathetic and half-ludicrous anecdote survive to recall the sorrow and the recklessness of the luckless scribbler who like one of johnson 's acquaintance live in london and hang loose upon society there be samuel boyse for example whose poem on the _ deity _ be quote with high praise by fielding once johnson have generously exert himself for he comrade in misery and collect enough money by sixpence to get the poet 's clothes out of pawn two day afterwards boyse have spend the money and be find in bed cover only with a blanket through two hole in which he pass he arm to write boyse it appear when still in this position would lay out he last half-guinea to buy truffle and mushroom for he last scrap of beef of another scribbler johnson say i honor derrick for he strength of mind one night when floyd -lrb- another poor author -rrb- be wander about the street at night he find derrick fast asleep upon a bulk upon be suddenly awake derrick start up ` my dear floyd i be sorry to see you in this destitute state will you go home with I to my _ lodgings _ ' author in such circumstance might be force into such a wonderful contract as that which be report to have be draw up by one gardner with rolt and christopher smart they be to write a monthly miscellany sell at sixpence and to have a third of the profit but they be to write nothing else and the contract be to last for ninety-nine year johnson himself sum up the trade upon earth by the line in which virgil describe the entrance to hell thus translate by dryden : -- just in the gate and in the jaw of hell revengeful care and sullen sorrow dwell and pale disease and repine age want fear and famine 's unresisted rage : here toil and death and death 's half-brother sleep -- form terrible to view they sentry keep now say johnson almost all these apply exactly to a author these be the concomitant of a printing-house judicious author indeed be learn how to make literature pay some of they belong to the class who understand the great truth that the scissors be a very superior implement to the pen consider as a tool of literary trade such for example be that respectable dr john campbell whose party johnson cease to frequent lest scotchman should say of any good bit of work ay ay he have learn this of cawmell campbell he say quaintly be a good man a pious man i be afraid he have not be in the inside of a church for many year but he never pass a church without pull off he hat this show he have good principle -- of which in fact there seem to be some less questionable evidence campbell support himself by writings chiefly of the encyclopedia or gazetteer kind and become still in johnson 's phrase the richest author that ever graze the common of literature a more singular and less reputable character be that impudent quack sir john hill who with he insolent attack upon the royal society pretentious botanical and medical compilation play novel and magazine article have long sink into utter oblivion it be say of he that he pursue every branch of literary quackery with greater contempt of character than any man of he time and that he make as much as # 1500 in a year -- three time as much it be add as any one writer ever make in the same period the political scribbler -- the arnall gordon trenchard guthry ralph and amherst whose name meet we in the note to the _ dunciad _ and in contemporary pamphlet and newspaper -- form another variety of the class they general character may be estimate from johnson 's classification of the scribbler for a party with the commissioner of excise as the two lowest of all human being ralph say one of the note to the _ dunciad _ end in the common sink of all such writer a political newspaper the prejudice against such employment have scarcely die out in we own day and may be still trace in the account of pendenni and he friend warrington people who do dirty work must be pay for it and the secret committee which inquire into walpole 's administration report that in ten year from 1731 to 1741 a sum of # 50077 18_s _ have be pay to writer and printer of newspaper arnall now remembered chiefly by pope 's line -- spirit of arnall aid I whilst i lie have receive in four year # 10997 6_s _ 8_d _ of this amount the more successful writer might look to pension or preferment franci for example the translator of horace and the father in all probability of the most formidable of the whole tribe of such literary gladiator receive it be say 900_l _ a year for he work besides be appoint to a rectory and the chaplaincy of chelsea it must moreover be observe that the price of literary work be rise during the century and that in the latter half considerable sum be receive by successful writer religious as well as dramatic literature have begin to be commercially valuable baxter in the previous century make from 60_l _ to 80_l _ a year by he pen the copyright of tillotson 's _ sermon _ be sell it be say upon he death for # 2500 considerable sum be make by the plan of publishing by subscription it be say that 4600 people subscribe to the two posthumous volume of conybeare 's _ sermon _ a few poet tread in pope 's step young make more than # 3000 for the satire call the _ universal passion _ publish i think on the same plan and the duke of wharton be say though the report be doubtful to have give he # 2000 for the same work gay make # 1000 by he _ poem _ # 400 for the copyright of the _ beggar 's opera _ and three time as much for its second part _ polly _ among historian hume seem to have receive # 700 a volume smollett make # 2000 by he catchpenny rival publication henry make # 3300 by he history and robertson after the bookseller have make # 6000 by he _ history of scotland _ sell he _ charle v _ for # 4500 amongst the novelist field receive # 700 for _ tom jone _ and # 1000 for _ amelium _ sterne for the second edition of the first part of _ tristram shandy _ and for two additional volume receive # 650 besides which lord fauconberg give he a living -lrb- most inappropriate acknowledgment one would say -rrb- and warburton a purse of gold goldsmith receive 60 guinea for the immortal _ vicar _ a fair price accord to johnson for a work by a then unknown author by each of he play he make about # 500 and for the eight volume of he _ natural history _ he receive 800 guinea towards the end of the century mr radcliffe get # 500 for the _ mystery of udolpho _ and # 800 for she last work the _ italian _ perhaps the largest sum give for a single book be # 6000 pay to hawkesworth for he account of the south sea expedition horne tooke receive from # 4000 to # 5000 for the _ diversion of purley _ and it be add by he biographer though it seem to be incredible that hayley receive no less than # 11000 for the _ life of cowper _ this be of course in the present century when we be already approach the period of scott and byron such sum prove that some few author might achieve independence by a successful work and it be well to remember they in consider johnson 's life from the business point of view though he never grumble at the bookseller and on the contrary be always ready to defend they as liberal man he certainly fail whether from carelessness or want of skill to turn they to as much profit as many less celebrated rival meanwhile pecuniary success of this kind be beyond any reasonable hope a man who have to work like he own dependent levett and to make the modest toil of every day supply the want of every day must discount he talent until he can secure leisure for some more sustained effort johnson come up from the country to seek for work could have but a slender prospect of rise above the ordinary level of he grub street companion and rival one publisher to whom he apply suggest to he that it would be he wisest course to buy a porter 's knot and carry trunk and in the struggle which follow johnson must sometimes have be tempt to regret that the advice be not take the detail of the ordeal through which he be now to pass have naturally vanish johnson long afterwards burst into tear on recall the trial of this period but at the time no one be interested in note the history of a obscure literary drudge and it have not be describe by the sufferer himself what we know be derive from a few letter and incidental reference of johnson in later day on first arrive in london he be almost destitute and have to join with garrick in raise a loan of five pound which we be glad to say be repay he dine for eightpence at a ordinary : a cut of meat for sixpence bread for a penny and a penny to the waiter make out the charge one of he acquaintance have tell he that a man might live in london for thirty pound a year ten pound would pay for clothes a garret might be hire for eighteen-penny a week if any one ask for a address it be easy to reply i be to be find at such a place threepence lay out at a coffee-house would enable he to pass some hour a day in good company dinner might be have for sixpence a bread-and-milk breakfast for a penny and supper be superfluous on clean shirt day you might go abroad and pay visit this leave a surplus of nearly one pound from the thirty johnson however have a wife to support and to raise fund for even so ascetic a mode of existence require steady labor often it seem he purse be at the very lowest ebb one of he letter to he employer be sign _ impransus _ and whether or not the dinnerless condition be in this case accidental or significant of absolute impecuniosity the less pleasant interpretation be not improbable he would walk the street all night with he friend savage when they combine fund could not pay for a lodge one night as he tell sir joshua reynold in later year they thus perambulate st jame 's square warming themselves by declaim against walpole and nobly resolve that they would stand by they country patriotic enthusiasm however as no one know better than johnson be a poor substitute for bed and supper johnson suffer acutely and make some attempt to escape from he misery to the end of he life he be grateful to those who have lend he a help hand harry hervey he say of one of they shortly before he death be a vicious man but very kind to I if you call a dog hervey i shall love he pope be impress by the excellence of he first poem _ london _ and induce lord gower to write to a friend to beg swift to obtain a degree for johnson from the university of dublin the term of this circuitous application curious as bring into connexion three of the most eminent man of letter of the day prove that the youngest of they be at the time -lrb- 1739 -rrb- in deep distress the object of the degree be to qualify johnson for a mastership of # 60 a year which would make he happy for life he would rather say lord gower die upon the road to dublin if a examination be necessary than be starve to death in translate for bookseller which have be he only subsistence for some time past the application fail however and the want of a degree be equally fatal to another application to be admit to practice at doctor 's common literature be thus perforce johnson 's sole support and by literature be mean for the most part drudgery of the kind indicate by the phrase translate for bookseller while still in lichfield johnson have as i have say write to cave propose to become a contributor to the _ gentleman 's magazine _ the letter be one of those which a modern editor receive by the dozen and answer as perfunctorily as he conscience will allow it seem however to have make some impression upon cave and possibly lead to johnson 's employment by he on he first arrival in london from 1738 he be employ both on the magazine and in some job of translation edward cave to whom we be thus introduce be a man of some mark in the history of literature johnson always speak of he with affection and afterwards write he life in complimentary term cave though a clumsy phlegmatic person of little cultivation seem to have be one of those man who whilst destitute of real critical power have a certain instinct for recognize the commercial value of literary wares he have become by this time well-known as the publisher of a magazine which survive to this day journal contain summary of pass event have already be start boyer 's _ political state of great britain _ begin in 1711 _ the historical register _ which add to a chronicle some literary notice be start in 1716 _ the grub street journal _ be another journal with fuller critical notice which first appear in 1730 and these two seem to have be supersede by the _ gentleman 's magazine _ start by cave in the next year johnson see in it a opening for the employment of he literary talent and regard its contribution with that awe so natural in youthful aspirant and at once so comic and pathetic to writer of a little experience the name of many of cave 's staff be preserve in a note to hawkin one or two of they such as birch and akenside have still a certain interest for student of literature but few have hear of the great mose browne who be regard as the great poetical light of the magazine johnson look up to he as a leader in he craft and be graciously take by cave to a alehouse in clerkenwell where wrap in a horseman 's coat and a great bushy uncombed wig he see mr browne sit at the end of a long table in a cloud of tobacco-smoke and feel the satisfaction of a true hero-worshipper it be needless to describe in detail the literary task-work do by johnson at this period the latin poem which he contribute in praise of cave and of cave 's friend or the jacobite squib by which he relieve he anti-ministerialist feeling one incident of the period doubtless refresh the soul of many author who have share campbell 's gratitude to napoleon for the sole redeeming action of he life -- the shooting of a bookseller johnson be employ by osborne a rough specimen of the trade to make a catalogue of the harleian library osborne offensively reprove he for negligence and johnson knock he down with a folio the book with which the feat be perform -lrb- _ biblium graeca septuaginta fol _ 1594 frankfort -rrb- be in existence in a bookseller 's shop at cambridge in 1812 and should surely have be place in some safe author 's museum the most remarkable of johnson 's performance as a hack writer deserve a brief notice he be one of the first of reporter cave publish such report of the debate in parliament as be then allow by the jealousy of the legislature under the title of _ the senate of lilliput _ johnson be the author of the debate from nov 1740 to February 1742 person be employ to attend in the two house who bring home note of the speech which be then put into shape by johnson long afterwards at a dinner at foote 's franci -lrb- the father of junius -rrb- mention a speech of pitt 's as the best he have ever read and superior to anything in demosthene hereupon johnson reply i write that speech in a garret in exeter street when the company applaud not only he eloquence but he impartiality johnson reply that be not quite true i save appearance tolerably well but i take care that the whig dog should not have the best of it the speech pass for a time as accurate though in truth it have be prove and it be easy to observe that they be in fact very vague reflection of the original the editor of chesterfield 's work publish two of the speech and to johnson 's considerable amusement declare that one of they resemble demosthene and the other cicero it be plain enough to the modern reader that if so both of the ancient orator must have write true johnsonese and in fact the style of the true author be often as plainly mark in many of these composition as in the _ rambler _ or _ rassela _ for this deception such as it be johnson express penitence at the end of he life though he say that he have cease to write when he find that they be take as genuine he would not be accessory to the propagation of falsehood another of johnson 's work which appear in 1744 require notice both for its intrinsic merit and its autobiographical interest the most remarkable of he grub-street companion be the richard savage already mention johnson 's life of he write soon after he death be one of he most forcible performance and the best extant illustration of the life of the struggle author of the time savage claim to be the illegitimate son of the countess of macclesfield who be divorce from she husband in the year of he birth on account of she connexion with he suppose father lord river accord to the story believe by johnson and publish without she contradiction in the mother 's lifetime she not only disavow she son but cherish a unnatural hatred for he she tell he father that he be dead in order that he might not be benefit by the father 's will she try to have he kidnap and send to the plantation and she do she best to prevent he from receive a pardon when he have be sentence to death for kill a man in a tavern brawl however this may be and there be reason for doubt the story be generally believe and cause much sympathy for the suppose victim savage be at one time protect by the kindness of steele who publish he story and sometimes employ he as a literary assistant when steele become disgusted with he he receive generous help from the actor wilk and from mr oldfield to whom he have be introduce by some dramatic effort then he be take up by lord tyrconnel but abandon by he after a violent quarrel he afterwards call himself a volunteer laureate and receive a pension of 50_l _ a year from queen caroline on she death he be throw into deep distress and help by a subscription to which pope be the chief contributor on condition of retire to the country ultimately he quarrel with he last protector and end by die in a debtor 's prison various poetical work now utterly forget obtain for he scanty profit this career sufficiently reveal the character savage belong to the very common type of man who seem to employ they whole talent to throw away they chance in life and to disgust every one who offer they a help hand he be however a man of some talent though he poem be now hopelessly unreadable and seem to have have a singular attraction for johnson the biography be curiously mark by johnson 's constant effort to put the best face upon fault which he have too much love of truth to conceal the explanation be partly that johnson conceive himself to be avenge a victim of cruel oppression this mother he say after record she vindictiveness be still alive and may perhaps even yet though she malice be often defeat enjoy the pleasure of reflect that the life which she often endeavor to destroy be at last shorten by she maternal office that though she could not transport she son to the plantation bury he in the shop of a mechanic or hasten the hand of the public executioner she have yet have the satisfaction of embitter all he hour and force he into exigency that hurry on he death but it be also probable that savage have a strong influence upon johnson 's mind at a very impressible part of he career the young man still ignorant of life and full of reverent enthusiasm for the literary magnate of he time be impress by the varied experience of he companion and it may be flatter by he intimacy savage he say admiringly have enjoy great opportunity of see the most conspicuous man of the day in they private life he be shrewd and inquisitive enough to use he opportunity well more circumstance to constitute a critic on human life could not easily concur the only phrase which survive to justify this remark be savage 's statement about walpole that the whole range of he mind be from obscenity to politics and from politics to obscenity we may however guess what be the special charm of the intercourse to johnson savage be a expert in that science of human nature learn from experience not from book upon which johnson set so high a value and of which he be destine to become the authorize expositor there be moreover resemblance between the two man they be both admire and seek out for they conversational power savage indeed seem to have live chiefly by the people who entertain he for talk till he have disgust they by he insolence and he utter disregard of time and propriety he would like johnson sit up talk beyond midnight and next day decline to rise till dinner-time though he favorite drink be not like johnson 's free from intoxicate property both of they have a lofty pride which johnson heartily commend in savage though he have difficulty in palliate some of its manifestation one of the story remind we of a anecdote already related of johnson himself some clothes have be leave for savage at a coffee-house by a person who out of delicacy conceal he name savage however resent some want of ceremony and refuse to enter the house again till the clothes have be remove what be honorable pride in johnson be indeed simple arrogance in savage he ask favor he biographer say without submission and resent refusal as a insult he have too much pride to acknowledge not not too much to receive obligation enough to quarrel with he charitable benefactor but not enough to make he rise to independence of they charity he pension would have suffice to keep he only that as soon as he receive it he retire from the sight of all he acquaintance and come back before long as penniless as before this conduct observe he biographer be very particular it be hardly so singular as objectionable and we be not surprise to be tell that he be rather a friend of goodness than himself a good man in short we may say of he as beauclerk say of a friend of boswell 's that if he have excellent principle he do not wear they out in practice there be something quaint about this picture of a thorough-paced scamp admiringly paint by a virtuous man force in spite of himself to make it a likeness and strive in vain to make it attractive but it be also pathetic when we remember that johnson share some part at least of he hero 's misery on a bulk in a cellar or in a glass-house among thief and beggar be to be find the author of _ the wanderer _ the man of exalted sentiment extensive view and curious observation the man whose remark on life might have assist the statesman whose idea of virtue might have enlighten the moralist whose eloquence might have influence senator and whose delicacy might have polish court very shocking no doubt and yet hardly surprising under the circumstance to we it be more interesting to remember that the author of the _ rambler _ be not only a sympathizer but a fellow-sufferer with the author of the _ wanderer _ and share the queer lodgings of he friend as floyd share the lodgings of derrick johnson happily come unscathed through the ordeal which be too much for poor savage and could boast with perfect truth in later life that no man who ever live by literature have live more independently than i have do it be in so strange a school and under such questionable teaching that johnson form he character of the world and of the conduct befitting its inmate one characteristic conclusion be indicate in the opening passage of the life it have always be observe he say that man eminent by nature or fortune be not generally happy : whether it be that apparent superiority incite great design and great design be naturally liable to fatal miscarriage or that the general lot of mankind be misery and the misfortune of those whose eminence draw upon they a universal attention have be more carefully record because they be more generally observe and have in reality be only more conspicuous than those of other not more frequent or more severe the last explanation be that which really commend itself to johnson nobody have better reason to know that obscurity might conceal a misery as bitter as any that fall to the lot of the most eminent the gloom due to he constitutional temperament be intensify by the sense that he and he wife be dependent upon the goodwill of a narrow and ignorant tradesman for the scantiest maintenance how be he to reach some solid standing-ground above the hopeless mire of grub street as a journeyman author he could make both end meet but only on condition of incessant labor illness and misfortune would mean constant dependence upon charity or bondage to creditor to get ahead of the world it be necessary to distinguish himself in some way from the herd of needy competitor he have come up from lichfield with a play in he pocket but the play do not seem at present to have much chance of emerge meanwhile he publish a poem which do something to give he a general reputation _ london _ -- a imitation of the third satire of juvenal -- be publish in may 1738 the plan be doubtless suggest by pope 's imitation of horace which have recently appear though necessarily follow the line of juvenal 's poem and conform to the conventional fashion of the time both in sentiment and versification the poem have a biographical significance it be indeed odd to find johnson who afterwards think of london as a lover of he mistress and who despise nothing more heartily than the cant of rousseau and the sentimentalist adopt in this poem the ordinary denunciation of the corruption of town and sing the praise of a innocent country life doubtless the young writer be like other young man take up a strain still imitative and artificial he have a quiet smile at savage in the life because in he retreat to wale that enthusiast declare that he could not debar himself from the happiness which be to be find in the calm of a cottage or lose the opportunity of listen without intermission to the melody of the nightingale which he believe be to be hear from every bramble and which he do not fail to mention as a very important part of the happiness of a country life in _ london _ this insincere cockney adopt savage 's view thale who be generally suppose to represent savage -lrb- and this coincidence seem to confirm the opinion -rrb- be to retire from the dungeon of the strand and to end a healthy life in pruning walk and twine bower in he garden there every bush with nature 's music ring there every breeze bear health upon its wing johnson have not yet learn the value of perfect sincerity even in poetry but it must also be admit that london as see by the poor drudge from a grub street garret probably present a prospect gloomy enough to make even johnson long at time for rural solitude the poem reflect too the ordinary talk of the heterogeneous band of patriot jacobite and disappointed whig who be begin to gather enough strength to threaten walpole 's long tenure of power many reference to contemporary politics illustrate johnson 's sympathy with the inhabitant of the contemporary cave of adullam this poem as already state attract pope 's notice who make a curious note on a scrap of paper send with it to a friend johnson be describe as a man afflict with a infirmity of the convulsive kind that attack he sometimes so as to make he a sad spectacle this seem to have be the chief information obtain by pope about the anonymous author of whom he have say on first read the poem this man will soon be _ déterré _ _ london _ make a certain noise it reach a second edition in a week and attract various patron among other general oglethorpe celebrate by pope and through a long life the warm friend of johnson one line however in the poem print in capital letter give the moral which be doubtless most deeply feel by the author and which do not lose its meaning in the year to come this mournful truth he say -- be everywhere confess would slow rise worth by poverty depress would ten year later -lrb- in January 1749 -rrb- appear the _ vanity of human wish _ a imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal the difference in tone show how deeply this and similar truth have be impress upon its author in the interval though still a imitation it be as significant as the most original work could be of johnson 's settled view of life it be write at a white heat as indeed johnson write all he best work its strong stoical morality its profound and melancholy illustration of the old and ever new sentiment _ vanita vanitatum _ make it perhaps the most impressive poem of the kind in the language the line on the scholar 's fate show that the iron have enter he soul in the interval should the scholar succeed beyond expectation in he labor and escape melancholy and disease yet he say -- yet hope not life from grief and danger free nor think the doom of man reverse on thee deign on the pass world to turn thine eye and pause awhile from letter to be wise there mark what ill the scholar 's life assail toil envy want the patron and the jail see nation slowly wise and meanly just to bury merit raise the tardy bust if dream yet flatter once again attend hear lydiat 's life and galileo 's end for the patron johnson have originally write the garret the change be make after a experience of patronage to be presently describe in connexion with the _ dictionary _ for _ london _ johnson receive ten guinea and for the _ vanity of human wish _ fifteen though indirectly valuable as increase he reputation such work be not very profitable the most promising career in a pecuniary sense be still to be find on the stage novelist be not yet the rival of dramatist and many author have make enough by a successful play to float they through a year or two johnson have probably be determine by he knowledge of this fact to write the tragedy of _ irene _ no other excuse at least can be give for the composition of one of the heaviest and most unreadable of dramatic performance interesting now if interesting at all solely as a curious example of the result of bestow great power upon a totally uncongenial task young man however may be pardon for such blunder if they be not repeat and johnson though he seem to have retain a fondness for he unlucky performance never indulge in play writing after leave lichfield the best thing connect with the play be johnson 's retort to he friend walmsley the lichfield registrar how ask walmsley can you contrive to plunge you heroine into deeper calamity sir say johnson i can put she into the spiritual court even boswell can only say for _ irene _ that it be entitle to the praise of superior excellence and admit its entire absence of dramatic power garrick who have become manager of drury lane produce he friend 's work in 1749 the play be carry through nine night by garrick 's friendly zeal so that the author have he three night ' profit for this he receive # 195 17_s _ and for the copy he have # 100 people probably attend as they attend modern representation of legitimate drama rather from a sense of duty than in the hope of pleasure the heroine originally have to speak two line with a bowstr round she neck the situation produce cry of murder and she have to go off the stage alive the objectionable passage be remove but _ irene _ be on the whole a failure and have never i imagine make another appearance when ask how he feel upon he ill-success he reply like the monument and indeed he make it a principle throughout life to accept the decision of the public like a sensible man without murmur meanwhile johnson be already embark upon a undertaking of a very different kind in 1747 he have put forth a plan for a english dictionary address at the suggestion of dodsley to lord chesterfield then secretary of state and the great contemporary maecena johnson have apparently be mature the scheme for some time i know he say in the plan that the work in which i engage be generally consider as drudgery for the blind as the proper toil of artless industry a book that require neither the light of learn nor the activity of genius but may be successfully perform without any higher quality than that of bear burden with dull patience and beat the track of the alphabet with sluggish resolution he add in a sub-sarcastic tone that although prince and statesman have once think it honorable to patronize dictionary he have consider such benevolent act to be prodigy record rather to raise wonder than expectation and he be accordingly pleased and surprised to find that chesterfield take a interest in he undertaking he proceed to lay down the general principle upon which he intend to frame he work in order to invite timely suggestion and repress unreasonable expectation at this time humble as he aspiration might be he take a view of the possibility open to he which have to be lower before the publication of the dictionary he share the illusion that a language might be fix by make a catalogue of its word in the preface which appear with the complete work he explain very sensibly the vanity of any such expectation whilst all human affair be change it be as he say absurd to imagine that the language which repeat all human thought and feeling can remain unaltered a dictionary as johnson conceive it be in fact work for a harmless drudge the definition of a lexicographer give in the book itself etymology in a scientific sense be as yet non-existent and johnson be not in this respect ahead of he contemporary to collect all the word in the language to define they meaning as accurately as might be to give the obvious or whimsical guess at etymology suggest by previous writer and to append a good collection of illustrative passage be the sum of he ambition any systematic training of the historical process by which a particular language have be develop be unknown and of course the result could not be anticipate the work indeed require a keen logical faculty of definition and wide reading of the english literature of the two precede century but it could of course give no play either for the higher literary faculty on point of scientific investigation a dictionary in johnson 's sense be the highest kind of work to which a literary journeyman could be set but it be still work for a journeyman not for a artist he be not add to literature but provide a useful implement for future man of letter johnson have thus get on hand the biggest job that could be well undertake by a good workman in he humble craft he be to receive fifteen hundred and seventy-five pound for the whole and he expect to finish it in three year the money it be to be observe be to satisfy not only johnson but several copyist employ in the mechanical part of the work it be advance by instalment and come to a end before the conclusion of the book indeed it appear when account be settle that he have receive a hundred pound more than be due he could however pay he way for the time and would gain a reputation enough to ensure work in future the period of extreme poverty have probably end when johnson get permanent employment on the _ gentleman 's magazine _ he be not elevated above the need of drudgery and economy but he might at least be free from the dread of neglect he could command he market -- such as it be the necessity of steady labor be probably unfelt in repel he fit of melancholy he name be begin to be know and man of reputation be seek he acquaintance in the winter of 1749 he form a club which meet weekly at a famous beef-steak house in ivy lane among its member be hawkin afterwards he biographer and two friend bathurst a physician and hawkesworth a author for the first of whom he entertain a unusually strong affection the club like its more famous successor give johnson a opportunity of display and improve he great conversational power he be already dread for he prowess in argument he dictatorial manners and vivid flash of wit and humor the more effective from the habitual gloom and apparent heaviness of the discourser the talk of this society probably suggest topic for the _ rambler _ which appear at this time and cause johnson 's fame to spread further beyond the literary circle of london the wit and humor have indeed left few trace upon its ponderous page for the _ rambler _ mark the culminate period of johnson 's worst quality of style the pompous and involved language seem indeed to be a fit clothing for the melancholy reflection which be its chief staple and in spite of its unmistakable power it be as heavy reading as the heavy class of lay-sermonizing to which it belong such literature however be often strangely popular in england and the _ rambler _ though its circulation be limited give to johnson he position as a great practical moralist he take he literary title one may say from the _ rambler _ as the more familiar title be derive from the _ dictionary _ the _ rambler _ be publish twice a week from march 20th 1750 to march 17th 1752 in five number alone he receive assistance from friend and one of these write by richardson be say to have be the only number which have a large sale the circulation rarely exceed 500 though ten english edition be publish in the author 's lifetime besides scotch and irish edition the payment however namely two guinea a number must have be welcome to johnson and the friendship of many distinguished man of the time be a still more valuable reward a quaint story illustrate the hero-worship of which johnson now become the object dr burney afterwards a intimate friend have introduce himself to johnson by letter in consequence of the _ rambler _ and the plan of the _ dictionary _ the admiration be share by a friend of burney 's a mr bewley know -- in norfolk at least -- as the philosopher of massingham when burney at last gain the honor of a personal interview he wish to procure some relic of johnson for he friend he cut off some bristle from a hearth-broom in the doctor 's chamber and send they in a letter to he fellow-enthusiast long afterwards johnson be please to hear of this simple-minded homage and not only send a copy of the _ life of the poet _ to the rural philosopher but deign to grant he a personal interview dearer than any such praise be the approval of johnson 's wife she tell he that well as she have think of he before she have not consider he equal to such a performance the voice that so charm he be soon to be silence for ever mr johnson die -lrb- march 17th 1752 -rrb- three day after the appearance of the last _ rambler _ the man who have pass through such a trial know well that whatever may be in store for he in the dark future fate can have no heavier blow in reserve though johnson once acknowledge to boswell when in a placid humor that happier day have come to he in he old age than in he early life he would probably have add that though fame and friendship and freedom from the harrowing care of poverty might cause he life to be more equably happy yet they reward could represent but a faint and mock reflection of the best moment of a happy marriage he strong mind and tender nature reel under the blow here be one pathetic little note write to the friend dr taylor who have come to he in he distress that which first announce the calamity and which say taylor express grief in the strongest manner he have ever read be lose dear sir -- let I have you company and instruction do not live away from I my distress be great pray desire mr taylor to inform I what mourning i should buy for my mother and miss porter and bring a note in write with you remember I in you prayer for vain be the help of man i be dear sir sam johnson we need not regret that a veil be draw over the detail of the bitter agony of he passage through the valley of the shadow of death it be enough to put down the wail which he write long afterwards when visibly approach the close of all human emotion and interest : -- this be the day on which in 1752 dear letty die i have now utter a prayer of repentance and contrition perhaps letty know that i prayed for she perhaps letty be now pray for I god help I thou god art merciful hear my prayer and enable I to trust in thee we be marry almost seventeen year and have now be part thirty it seem half profane even at this distance of time to pry into grief so deep and so lasting johnson turn for relief to that which all sufferer know to be the only remedy for sorrow -- hard labor he set to work in he garret a inconvenient room because he say in that room only i never see mr johnson he help he friend hawkesworth in the _ adventurer _ a new periodical of the _ rambler _ kind but he main work be the _ dictionary _ which come out at last in 1755 its appearance be the occasion of a explosion of wrath which mark a epoch in we literature johnson as we have see have dedicate the plan to lord chesterfield and he language imply that they have be to some extent in personal communication chesterfield 's fame be in curious antithesis to johnson 's he be a man of great ability and seem to have deserve high credit for some part of he statesmanship as a viceroy in ireland in particular he show quality rare in he generation to johnson he be know as the nobleman who have a wide social influence as a acknowledged _ arbiter elegantiarum _ and who reckon among he claim some of that literary polish in which the earlier generation of noble have certainly be superior to they successor the art of life expound in he _ letter _ differ from johnson as much as the elegant diplomatist differ from the rough intellectual gladiator of grub street johnson speak he mind of he rival without reserve i think he say that this man have be a lord among wit but i find he be only a wit among lord and of the _ letter _ he say more keenly that they teach the moral of a harlot and the manners of a dancing-master chesterfield 's opinion of johnson be indicate by the description in he _ letter _ of a respectable hottentot who throw he meat anywhere but down he throat this absurd person say chesterfield be not only uncouth in manners and warm in dispute but behave exactly in the same way to superior equal and inferior and therefore by a necessary consequence absurdly to two of the three _ hinc illae lacryma _ johnson in my opinion be not far wrong in he judgment though it would be a gross injustice to regard chesterfield as nothing but a fribble but man represent two such antithetic type be not likely to admire each other 's good quality whatever have be the intercourse between they johnson be naturally annoy when the dignified noble publish two article in the _ world _ -- a periodical support by such polite personage as himself and horace walpole -- in which the need of a dictionary be set forth and various courtly compliment describe johnson 's fitness for a dictatorship over the language nothing could be more prettily turn but it mean and johnson take it to mean i should like to have the dictionary dedicate to I : such a compliment would add a feather to my cap and enable I to appear to the world as a patron of literature as well as a authority upon manners after make pert profession as johnson say he have for many year take no notice of I but when my _ dictionary _ be come out he fall a scribble in the _ world _ about it johnson therefore bestow upon the noble earl a piece of he mind in a letter which be not publish till it come out in boswell 's biography my lord -- i have be lately inform by the proprietor of the _ world _ that two papers in which my _ dictionary _ be recommend to the public be write by you lordship to be so distinguished be a honor which be very little accustomed to favor from the great i know not well how to receive or in what term to acknowledge when upon some slight encouragement i first visit you lordship i be overpower like the rest of mankind by the enchantment of you address and could not forbear to wish that i might boast myself _ le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre _ -- that i might obtain that regard for which i see the world contend but i find my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer I to continue it when i have once address you lordship in public i have exhaust all the art of please which a wearied and uncourtly scholar can possess i have do all that i could and no man be well pleased to have he all neglect be it ever so little seven year my lord have now pass since i wait in you outward room and be repulse from you door during which time i have be push on my work through difficulty of which it be useless to complain and have bring it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance one word of encouragement and one smile of favor such treatment i do not expect for i never have a patron before the shepherd in _ virgil _ grow at last acquaint with love and find he a native of the rock be not a patron my lord one who look with unconcern on a man struggle for life in the water and when he have reach the ground encumber he with help the notice which you have be please to take of my labor have it be early have be kind but it have be delay till i be indifferent and can not enjoy it till i be solitary and can not impart it till i be know and do not want it i hope it be no very cynical asperity not to confess obligation where no benefit have be receive or to be unwilling that the public should consider I as owe that to a patron which providence have enable I to do for myself have carry on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learn i shall not be disappoint though i should conclude it should loss be possible with loss for i have be long waken from that dream of hope in which i once boast myself with so much exultation my lord you lordship 's most humble most obedient servant sam johnson the letter be one of those knock-down blow to which no answer be possible and upon which comment be superfluous it be as mr carlyle call it the far-famed blast of doom proclaim into the ear of lord chesterfield and through he of the listen world that patronage should be no more that be all that can be say yet perhaps it should be add that johnson remark that he have once receive # 10 from chesterfield though he think the assistance too inconsiderable to be mention in such a letter hawkin also state that chesterfield send overture to johnson through two friend one of whom long sir thoma robinson state that if he be rich enough -lrb- a judicious clause -rrb- he would himself settle # 500 a year upon johnson johnson reply that if the first peer of the realm make such a offer he would show he the way downstair hawkin be startle at this insolence and at johnson 's uniform assertion that a offer of money be a insult we can not tell what be the history of the # 10 but johnson in spite of hawkin 's righteous indignation be in fact too proud to be a beggar and owe to he pride he escape from the fate of savage the appearance of the _ dictionary _ place johnson in the position describe soon afterwards by smollett he be henceforth the great cham of literature -- a monarch sit in the chair previously occupy by he namesake ben by dryden and by pope but which have since that time be vacant the world of literature have become too large for such authority complaint be not seldom utter at the time goldsmith have urge that boswell wish to make a monarchy of what ought to be a republic goldsmith who would have be the last man to find serious fault with the dictator think the dictatorship objectionable some time indeed be still to elapse before we can say that johnson be firmly seat on the throne but the _ dictionary _ and the _ rambler _ have give he a position not altogether easy to appreciate now that the _ dictionary _ have be supersede and the _ rambler _ go out of fashion he name be the highest at this time -lrb- 1755 -rrb- in the rank of pure literature the fame of warburton possibly bulk larger for the moment and one of he flatterer be compare he to the colossus which bestride the petty world of contemporary but warburton have subside into episcopal repose and literature have be for he a stepping-stone rather than a ultimate aim hume have write work of far more enduring influence than johnson but they be little read though generally abused and scarcely belong to the purely literary history the first volume of he _ history of england _ have appear -lrb- 1754 -rrb- but have not succeed the second be just come out richardson be still give law to he little seraglio of adoring woman field have die -lrb- 1754 -rrb- wear out by labor and dissipation smollett be active in the literary trade but not in such a way as to increase he own dignity or that of he employment gray be slowly write a few line of exquisite verse in he retirement at cambridge two young irish adventurer burke and goldsmith be just come to london to try they fortune adam smith make he first experiment as a author by review the _ dictionary _ in the _ edinburgh review _ robertson have not yet appear as a historian gibbon be at lausanne repenting of he old brief lapse into catholicism as a act of undergraduate 's folly and cowper after three year of giggling and make giggle with thurlow in a attorney 's office be now enter at the temple and amusing himself at time with literature in company with such small man of letter as colman bonnell thornton and lloyd it be a slack tide of literature the generation of pope have pass away and leave no successor and no writer of the time could be put in competition with the giant now know as dictionary johnson when the last sheet of the _ dictionary _ have be carry to the publisher millar johnson ask the messenger what do he say sir say the messenger he say ` thank god i have do with he ' i be glad reply johnson that he thanks god for anything thankfulness for relief from seven year ' toil seem to have be johnson 's predominant feeling : and he be not anxious for a time to take any new labor upon he shoulder some year pass which have leave few trace either upon he personal or he literary history he contribute a good many review in 1756-7 to the _ literary magazine _ one of which a review of soame jenyn be amongst he best performance to a weekly paper he contribute for two year from April 1758 to April 1760 a set of essay call the _ idler _ on the old _ rambler _ plan he do some small literary cobbler 's work receive a guinea for a prospectus to a newspaper and ten pound for correct a volume of poetry he have advertise in 1756 a new edition of shakspeare which be to appear by christmas 1757 : but he dawdle over it so unconscionably that it do not appear for nine year and then only in consequence of taunt from churchill who accuse he with too much plausibility of cheat he subscriber he for subscriber bait he hook and take you cash : but where 's the book no matter where wise fear you know forbid the rob of a foe but what to serve we private end forbid the cheating of we friend in truth he constitutional indolence seem to have gain advantage over he when the stimulus of a heavy task be remove in he meditation there be many complaint of he sluggishness and resolution of amendment a kind of strange oblivion have spread over I he say in April 1764 so that i know not what have become of the last year and perceive that incident and intelligence pass over I without leave any impression it seem however that he be still frequently in difficulty letter be preserved show that in the beginning of 1756 richardson become surety for he for a debt and lend he six guinea to release he from arrest a event which happen three year later illustrate he position and character in January 1759 he mother die at the age of ninety johnson be unable to come to lichfield and some deeply pathetic letter to she and she stepdaughter who live with she record he emotion here be the last sad farewell upon the snap of the most sacred of human tie dear honor mother he say in a letter enclose to lucy porter the step-daughter neither you condition nor you character make it fit for I to say much you have be the best mother and i believe the best woman in the world i thank you for you indulgence to I and beg forgiveness of all that i have do ill and of all that i have omit to do well god grant you he holy spirit and receive you to everlasting happiness for jesus christ 's sake amen lord jesus receive you spirit i be dear dear mother you dutiful son samuel johnson johnson manage to raise twelve guinea six of they borrow from he printer to send to he die mother in order to gain money for she funeral expense and some small debt he write the story of _ rassela _ it be compose in the evening of a single week and send to press as it be write he receive # 100 for this perhaps the most successful of he minor writings and # 25 for a second edition it be widely translate and universally admire one of the strangest of literary coincidence be the contemporary appearance of this work and voltaire 's _ candide _ to which indeed it bear in some respects so strong a resemblance that but for johnson 's apparent contradiction we would suppose that he have at least hear some description of its design the two story though widely differ in tone and style be among the most powerful expression of the melancholy produce in strong intellect by the sadness and sorrow of the world the literary excellence of _ candide _ have secure for it a wider and more enduring popularity than have fall to the lot of johnson 's far heavier production but _ rassela _ be a book of singular force and bear the most characteristic impression of johnson 's peculiar temperament a great change be approach in johnson 's circumstance when george iii come to the throne it strike some of he adviser that it would be well as boswell put it to open a new and brighter prospect to man of literary merit this commendable design be carry out by offer to johnson a pension of three hundred a year consider that such man as horace walpole and he like be enjoy sinecure of more than twice as many thousand for be they father 's son the bounty do not strike one as excessively liberal it seem to have be really intend as some set-off against other pension bestow upon various hanger-on of the scotch prime minister bute johnson be couple with the contemptible scribbler shebbeare who have lately be in the pillory for a jacobite libel -lrb- a he-bear and a she-bear say the facetious newspaper -rrb- and when a few month afterwards a pension of # 200 a year be give to the old actor sheridan johnson growl out that it be time for he to resign he own somebody kindly repeat the remark to sheridan who would never afterwards speak to johnson the pension though very welcome to johnson who seem to have be in real distress at the time suggest some difficulty johnson have unluckily speak of a pension in he _ dictionary _ as generally understand to mean pay give to a state hirele for treason to he country he be assure however that he do not come within the definition and that the reward be give for what he have do not for anything that he be expect to do after some hesitation johnson consent to accept the payment thus offer without the direct suggestion of any obligation though it be probably calculate that he would in case of need be the more ready as actually happen to use he pen in defense of authority he have not compromise he independence and might fairly laugh at angry comment i wish he say afterwards that my pension be twice as large that they might make twice as much noise i can not now curse the house of hanover be he phrase on another occasion : but i think that the pleasure of cursing the house of hanover and drinking king jame 's health all amply overbalance by three hundred pound a year in truth he jacobitism be by this time whatever it have once be nothing more than a humorous crotchet give opportunity for the expression of tory prejudice i hope you will now purge and live cleanly like a gentleman be beauclerk 's comment upon hearing of he friend 's accession of fortune and as johnson be now emerge from grub street it be desirable to consider what manner of man be to be present to the wider circle that be open to receive he chapter iii johnson and he friend it be not till some time after johnson have come into the enjoyment of he pension that we first see he through the eye of competent observer the johnson of we knowledge the most familiar figure to all student of english literary history have already long pass the prime of life and do the greatest part of he literary work he character in the common phrase have be form year before as indeed people 's character be chiefly form in the cradle and not only he character but the habit which be learn in the great schoolroom of the world be fix beyond any possibility of change the strange eccentricity which have now become a second nature amaze the society in which he be for over twenty year a prominent figure unsympathetic observer those especially to whom the chesterfield type represent the ideal of humanity be simply disgusted or repel the man they think might be in he place at a grub street pot-house but have no business in a lady 's drawing-room if he have be modest and retire they might have put up with he defect but johnson be not a person whose quality good or bad be of a kind to be ignore naturally enough the fashionable world care little for the rugged old giant the great say johnson have try he and give he up they have see enough of he and he reason be pretty much to the purpose great lord and great lady do not love to have they mouth stop especially not one may add by a unwashed fist it be easy to blame they now everybody can see that a saint in beggar 's rag be intrinsically better than a sinner in gold lace but the principle be one of those which serve we for judge the dead much more than for regulate we own conduct those at any rate may throw the first stone at the horace walpole and chesterfield who be quite certain that they would ask a modern johnson to they house the trial would be severe poor mr boswell complain grievously of she husband 's idolatry i have see many a bear lead by a man she say but i never before saw a man lead by a bear the truth be as boswell explain that the sage 's uncouth habit such as turn the candle ' head downward to make they burn more brightly and let the wax drop upon the carpet could not but be disagreeable to a lady he have other habit still more annoying to people of delicate perception a hearty despiser of all affectation he despise especially the affectation of indifference to the pleasure of the table for my part he say i mind my belly very studiously and very carefully for i look upon it that he who do not mind he belly will hardly mind anything else avow this principle he would innocently give himself the air of a scientific epicure i madam he say to the terror of a lady with whom he be about to sup who live at a variety of good table be a much better judge of cookery than any person who have a very tolerable cook but live much at home for he palate be gradually adapt to the taste of he cook whereas madam in try by a wider range i can more exquisitely judge but he pretension to exquisite taste be by no means bear out by independent witness he laugh say tom davy like a rhinoceros and he seem to have eat like a wolf -- savagely silently and with undiscriminating fury he be not a pleasant object during this performance he be totally absorb in the business of the moment a strong perspiration come out and the vein of he forehead swell he like coarse satisfying dish -- boil pork and veal-pie stuff with plum and sugar and in regard to wine he seem to have accept the doctrine of the critic of a certain fluid profess to be port who ask what more can you want it be black and it be thick and it make you drunk claret as johnson put it be the liquor for boy and port for man but he who aspire to be a hero must drink brandy he could however refrain though he could not be moderate and for all the latter part of he life from 1766 he be a total abstainer nor it should be add do he ever appear to have seek for more than exhilaration from wine he earliest intimate friend hector say that he have never but once see he drunk he appetite for more innocent kind of food be equally excessive he would eat seven or eight peach before breakfast and declare that he have only once in he life have as much wall-fruit as he wish he consumption of tea be prodigious beyond all precedent hawkin quote bishop burnet as have drunk sixteen large cup every morning a feat which would entitle he to be reckon as a rival a harden and shameless tea-drinker johnson call himself who with tea amuse the evening with tea solace the midnight and with tea welcome the morning one of he teapot preserve by a relic-hunter contain two quart and he profess to have consume five and twenty cup at a sit poor mr thrale complain that he often keep she up make tea for he till four in the morning he reluctance to go to bed be due to the fact that he night be period of intense misery but the vast potation of tea can scarcely have tend to improve they the huge frame be clothe in the raggedest of garment until he acquaintance with the thrale lead to a partial reform he wig be generally burn in front from he shortsighted knack of read with he head close to the candle and at the thrale the butler stand ready to effect a change of wig as he pass into the dining-room once or twice we have account of he burst into unusual splendor he appear at the first representation of _ irene _ in a scarlet waistcoat lace with gold and on one of he first interview with goldsmith he take the trouble to array himself decently because goldsmith be report to have justified slovenly habit by the precedent of the leader of he craft goldsmith judge by certain famous suit seem to have profit by the hint more than he preceptor as a rule johnson 's appearance before he become a pensioner be worthy of the proverbial manner of grub street beauclerk use to describe how he have once take a french lady of distinction to see johnson in he chamber on descend the staircase they hear a noise like thunder johnson be pursue they strike by a sudden sense of the demand upon he gallantry he brush in between beauclerk and the lady and seize she hand conduct she to she coach a crowd of people collect to stare at the sage dress in rusty brown with a pair of old shoe for slipper a shrivel wig on the top of he head and with shirtsleeve and the knee of he breeches hang loose in those day clergyman and physician be only just abandon the use of they official costume in the street and johnson 's slovenly habit be even more marked than they would be at present i have no passion for clean linen he once remark and it be to be fear that he must sometimes have offend more sens than one in spite of he uncouth habit of dress and manners johnson claim and in a sense with justice to be a polite man i look upon myself he say once to boswell as a very polite man he could show the stately courtesy of a sound tory who cordially accept the principle of social distinction but have far too strong a sense of self-respect to fancy that compliance with the ordinary convention can possibly lower he own position rank of the spiritual kind be especially venerable to he i should as soon have think of contradict a bishop be a phrase which mark the highest conceivable degree of deference to a man whom he respect nobody again could pay more effective compliment when he please and the many female friend who have write of he agree that he could be singularly attractive to woman woman be perhaps more inclined than man to forgive external roughness in consideration of the great charm of deep tenderness in a thoroughly masculine nature a characteristic phrase be he remark to miss monckton she have declare in opposition to one of johnson 's prejudice that sterne 's writings be pathetic : i be sure she say they have affect I why say johnson smile and roll himself about that be because dearest you be a dunce when she mention this to he some time afterwards he reply : madam if i have think so i certainly should not have say it the truth could not be more neatly put boswell note with some surprise that when johnson dine with lord monboddo he insist upon rise when the lady leave the table and take occasion to observe that politeness be fictitious benevolence and equally useful in common intercourse boswell 's surprise seem to indicate that scotchman in those day be even greater bear than johnson he always insist as miss reynold tell we upon show lady to they carriage through bolt court though he dress be such that she reader would she think be astonish that any man in he sens should have show himself in it abroad or even at home another odd indication of johnson 's regard for good manners so far as he light would take he be the extreme disgust with which he often refer to a certain footman in paris who use he finger in place of sugar-tong so far as johnson could recognize bad manners he be polite enough though unluckily the limitation be one of considerable importance johnson 's claim to politeness be sometimes it be true put in a rather startling form every man of any education he once say to the amazement of he hearer would rather be call a rascal than accuse of deficiency in the grace gibbon who be present slily inquire of a lady whether among all she acquaintance she could not find _ one _ exception accord to mr thrale he go even further dr barnard he say be the only man who have ever do justice to he good breeding and you may observe he add that i be well-bred to a degree of needless scrupulosity he proceed accord to mr thrale but the report a little tax we faith to claim the virtue not only of respect ceremony but of never contradict or interrupt he hearer it be rather odd that dr barnard have once a sharp altercation with johnson and avenge himself by a sarcastic copy of verse in which after profess to learn perfectness from different friend he say -- johnson shall teach I how to place in varied light each borrow would grace from he i 'll learn to write copy he clear familiar style and by the roughness of he file grow like himself polite johnson on this as on many occasion repent of the blow as soon as it be strike and sit down by barnard literally smooth down he arm and knee and beseech pardon barnard accept he apology but go home and write he little copy of verse johnson 's shortcoming in civility be no doubt due in part to the narrowness of he faculty of perception he do not know for he could not see that he uncouth gesture and slovenly dress be offensive and he be not so well able to observe other as to shake off the manners contract in grub street it be hard to study a manual of etiquette late in life and for a man of johnson 's imperfect faculty it be probably impossible error of this kind be always pardonable and be now simply ludicrous but johnson often shock he companion by more indefensible conduct he be irascible overbearing and when angry vehement beyond all propriety he be a tremendous companion say garrick 's brother and man of gentle nature like charle fox often shrink from he company and perhaps exaggerate he brutality johnson who have long regard conversation as the chief amusement come in later year to regard it as almost the chief employment of life and he have study the art with the zeal of a man pursue a favorite hobby he have always as he tell sir joshua reynold make it a principle to talk on all occasion as well as he could he have thus obtain a mastery over he weapon which make he one of the most accomplished of conversational gladiator he have one advantage which have pretty well disappear from modern society and the disappearance of which have be destructive to excellence of talk a good talker even more than a good orator imply a good audience modern society be too vast and too restless to give a conversationalist a fair chance for the formation of real proficiency in the art friend should meet often sit long and be thoroughly at ease a modern audience generally break up before it be well warm through and include enough stranger to break the magic circle of social electricity the club in which johnson delighted be excellently adapt to foster he peculiar talent there a man could fold he leg and have he talk out -- a pleasure hardly to be enjoy now and there a set of friend meet regularly and meet to talk learn to sharpen each other 's skill in all dialectic maneuver conversation may be pleasantest as johnson admit when two friend meet quietly to exchange they mind without any thought of display but conversation consider as a game as a bout of intellectual sword-play have also charm which johnson intensely appreciate he talk be not of the encyclopedia variety like that of some more modern celebrity but it be full of apposite illustration and unrivalled in keen argument rapid flash of wit and humor scornful retort and dexterous sophistry sometimes he would fall he adversary at a blow he sword as boswell say would be through you body in a instant without preliminary flourish and in the excitement of talk for victory he would use any device that come to hand there be no argue with johnson say goldsmith quote a phrase from cibber for if he pistol miss fire he knock you down with the butt-end of it johnson 's view of conversation be indicate by he remark about burke that fellow he say at a time of illness call forth all my power be i to see burke now it would kill I it be when you come close to a man in conversation he say on another occasion that you discover what he real ability be to make a speech in a assembly be a knack now i honor thurlow sir thurlow be a fine fellow he fairly put he mind to yours johnson 's retort be fair play under the condition of the game as it be fair play to kick a opponent 's shin at football but of course a man who have as it be become the acknowledged champion of the ring and who have a irascible and thoroughly dogmatic temper be tempt to become unduly imperious in the company of which savage be a distinguished member one may guess that the conversational fervor sometimes degenerate into horse-play want of argument would be supply by personality and the champion would avenge himself by brutality on a opponent who happen for once to be get the best of he johnson as he grow older and get into more polished society become milder in he manners but he have enough of the old spirit leave in he to break forth at time with ungovernable fury and astonish the well-regulated mind of respectable lady and gentleman anecdote illustrative of this ferocity abound and he best friend -- except perhaps reynold and burke -- have all to suffer in turn on one occasion when he have make a rude speech even to reynold boswell state though with some hesitation he belief that johnson actually blush the record of he contest in this kind fill a large space in boswell 's page that they do not lead to worse consequence show he absence of rancor he be always ready and anxious for a reconciliation though he would not press for one if he first overture be reject there be no venom in the wound he inflict for there be no ill-nature he be rough in the heat of the struggle and in such case careless in distribute blow but he never enjoy give pain none of he tiff ripen into permanent quarrel and he seem scarcely to have lose a friend he be a pleasant contrast in this as in much else to horace walpole who succeed in the course of a long life in break with almost all he old friend no man set a higher value upon friendship than johnson a man he say to reynold ought to keep he friendship in constant repair or he would find himself leave alone as he grow older i look upon a day as lose he say later in life in which i do not make a new acquaintance make new acquaintance do not involve drop the old the list of he friend be a long one and include as it be successive layer superpose upon each other from the earliest period of he life this be so marked a feature in johnson 's character that it will be as well at this point to notice some of the friendship from which he derive the greatest part of he happiness two of he schoolfellow hector and taylor remain he intimate through life hector survive to give information to boswell and taylor then a prebendary of westminster read the funeral service over he old friend in the abbey he show say some of the bystander too little feel the relation between the two man be not one of special tenderness indeed they be so little congenial that boswell rather gratuitously suspect he venerable teacher of have a eye to taylor 's will it seem fairer to regard the acquaintance as a illustration of that curious adhesiveness which make johnson cling to less attractive person at any rate he do not show the complacence of the proper will-hunter taylor be rector of bosworth and squire of ashbourne he be a fine specimen of the squire-parson a justice of the peace a warm politician and what be worse a warm whig he raise gigantic bull brag of sell cow for 120 guinea and more and keep a noble butler in purple clothes and a large white wig johnson respect taylor as a sensible man but be ready to have a round with he on occasion he snort contempt when taylor talk of break some small vessel if he take a emetic bah say the doctor who regard a valetudinarian as a scoundrel if you have so many thing that will break you have better break you neck at once and there be a end o not nay if he do not condemn taylor 's cow he criticize he bulldog with cruel acuteness no sir he be not well shape for there be not the quick transition from the thickness of the fore-part to the _ tenuity _ -- the thin part -- behind which a bulldog ought to have on the more serious topic of politics he jacobite fulmination rouse taylor to a pitch of bellow johnson roar out that if the people of england be fairly poll -lrb- this be in 1777 -rrb- the present king would be send away to-night and he adherent hang to-morrow johnson however render taylor the substantial service of write sermon for he two volume of which be publish after they be both dead and taylor must have be a bold man if it be true as have be say that he refuse to preach a sermon write by johnson upon mr johnson 's death on the ground that it speak too favourably of the character of the deceased johnson pay frequent visit to lichfield to keep up he old friend one of they be lucy porter he wife 's daughter with whom accord to miss seward he have be in love before he marry she mother he be at least tenderly attach to she through life and for the most part the good people of lichfield seem to have be proud of they fellow-townsman and give he a substantial proof of they sympathy by continue to he on favourable term the lease of a house originally grant to he father there be indeed one remarkable exception in miss seward who belong to a genus specially contemptible to the old doctor she be one of the fine lady who dabble in poetry and aim at be the center of a small literary circle at lichfield she letter be amongst the most amusing illustration of the petty affectation and squabble characteristic of such a provincial clique she evidently hate johnson at the bottom of she small soul and indeed though johnson once pay she a preposterous compliment -- a weakness of which this stern moralist be apt to be guilty in the company of lady -- he no doubt tread pretty roughly upon some of she pet vanity by far the most celebrated of johnson 's lichfield friend be david garrick in regard to whom he relation be somewhat peculiar reynold say that johnson consider garrick to be he own property and would never allow he to be praise or blame by any one else without contradiction reynold compose a pair of imaginary dialogue to illustrate the proposition in one of which johnson attack garrick in answer to reynold and in the other defend he in answer to gibbon the dialogue seem to be very good reproduction of the johnsonian manner though perhaps the courteous reynold be a little too much impress by its roughness and they probably include many genuine remark of johnson 's it be remarkable that the praise be far more pointed and elaborate than the blame which turn chiefly upon the general inferiority of a actor 's position and in fact this seem to have correspond to johnson 's opinion about garrick as gather from boswell the two man have at bottom a considerable regard for each other found upon old association mutual service and reciprocal respect for talent of very different order but they be so widely separate by circumstance as well as by a radical opposition of temperament that any close intimacy could hardly be expect the bear and the monkey be not likely to be intimate friend garrick 's rapid elevation in fame and fortune seem to have produce a certain degree of envy in he old schoolmaster a grave moral philosopher have of course no right to look askance at the reward which fashion lavish upon man of lighter and less lasting merit and which he profess to despise johnson however be trouble with a rather excessive allowance of human nature moreover he have the good old-fashioned contempt for player characteristic both of the tory and the inartistic mind he assert roundly that he look upon player as no better than dancing-dogs but sir you will allow that some player be better than other yes sir as some dog dance better than other so when goldsmith accuse garrick of grossly flattering the queen johnson exclaim and as to meanness -- how be it mean in a player a showman a fellow who exhibit himself for a shilling to flatter he queen at another time boswell suggest that we might respect a great player what sir exclaim johnson a fellow who clap a hump upon he back and a lump on he leg and cry ' _ i be richard iii _ ' nay sir a ballad-singer be a higher man for he do two thing : he repeat and he sing there be both recitation and music in he performance -- the player only recite such sentiment be not very likely to remain unknown to garrick nor to put he at ease with johnson whom indeed he always suspect of laugh at he they have a little tiff on account of johnson 's edition of shakspeare from some misunderstanding johnson do not make use of garrick 's collection of old play johnson it seem think that garrick should have court he more and perhaps send the play to he house whereas garrick know that johnson treat book with a roughness ill-suited to they constitution think that he have do quite enough by ask johnson to come to he library the revenge -- if it be revenge -- take by johnson be to say nothing of garrick in he preface and to glance obliquely at he non-communication of he rarity he seem to have think that it would be a lowering of shakspeare to admit that he fame owe anything to garrick 's exertion boswell innocently communicate to garrick a criticism of johnson 's upon one of he poem -- i would smile with the simple and feed with the poor let I smile with the wise and feed with the rich be johnson 's tolerably harmless remark garrick however do not like it and when boswell try to console he by say that johnson gore everybody in turn and add _ foenum habet in cornu _ ay say garrick vehemently he have a whole mow of it the most unpleasant incident be when garrick propose rather too freely to be a member of the club johnson say that the first duke in england have no right to use such language and say accord to mr thrale if garrick do apply i 'll blackball he surely we ought to be able to sit in a society like ours -- ` unelbowed by a gamester pimp or player ' nearly ten year afterwards however johnson favor he election and when he die declare that the club should have a year 's widowhood no successor to garrick be elect during that time johnson sometimes venture to criticise garrick 's act but here garrick could take he full revenge the purblind johnson be not we may imagine much of a critic in such matter garrick report he to have say of a actor at lichfield there be a courtly vivacity about the fellow when in fact say garrick he be the most vulgar ruffian that ever go upon board in spite of such collision of opinion and mutual criticism johnson seem to have speak in the highest term of garrick 's good quality and they have many pleasant meeting garrick take a prominent part in two or three of the best conversation in boswell and seem to have put he interlocutor in specially good temper johnson declare he to be the first man in the world for sprightly conversation he say that dryden have write much better prologue than any of garrick 's but that garrick have write more good prologue than dryden he declare that it be wonderful how little garrick have be spoil by all the flattery that he have receive no wonder if he be a little vain : a man who be perpetually flatter in every mode that can be conceive : so many bellows have blow the fuel that one wonder he be not by this time become a cinder if all this have happen to I he say on another occasion i should have have a couple of fellow with long pole walk before I to knock down everybody that stand in the way consider if all this have happen to cibber and quin they would have jump over the moon yet garrick speak to we smile he admit at the same time that garrick have raise the profession of a player he defend garrick too against the common charge of avarice garrick as he point out have be bring up in a family whose study it be to make fourpence go as far as fourpence-halfpenny johnson remember in early day drink tea with garrick when peg woffington make it and make it as garrick grumble as red as blood but when garrick become rich he become liberal he have so johnson declare give away more money than any man in england after garrick 's death johnson take occasion to say in the _ life of the poet _ that the death have eclipse the gaiety of nation and diminish the public stock of harmless pleasure boswell venture to criticise the observation rather spitefully why _ nation _ do he gaiety extend further than he own nation why sir reply johnson some imagination must be allow besides we may say _ nation _ if we allow the scotch to be a nation and to have gaiety -- which they have not on the whole in spite of various drawback johnson 's report observation upon garrick will appear to be discriminative and yet on the whole strongly favourable to he character yet we be not quite surprised that mr garrick do not respond to a hint throw out by johnson that he would be glad to write the life of he friend at oxford johnson acquire the friendship of dr adam afterwards master of pembroke and author of a once well-known reply to hume 's argument upon miracle he be a amiable man and be proud to do the honor of the university to he old friend when in later year johnson revisit the much-loved scene of he neglect youth the warmth of johnson 's regard for old day be oddly illustrate by a interview record by boswell with one edward a fellow-student whom he meet again in 1778 not have previously see he since 1729 they have live in london for forty year without once meet a fact more surprising then than now boswell eagerly gather up the little scrap of college anecdote which the meeting produce but perhaps he best find be a phrase of edward himself you be a philosopher dr johnson he say i have try too in my time to be a philosopher but i do not know how cheerfulness be always break in the phrase as boswell truly say record a exquisite trait of character of the friend who gather round johnson during he period of struggle many have vanish before he become well know the best loved of all seem to have be dr bathurst a physician who fail to obtain practice join the expedition to havannah and fall a victim to the climate -lrb- 1762 -rrb- upon he johnson pronounce a panegyric which have contribute a proverbial phrase to the language dear bathurst he say be a man to my very heart 's content : he hate a fool and he hate a rogue and he hate a whig he be a _ very good hater _ johnson remember bathurst in he prayer for year after he loss and receive from he a peculiar legacy franci barker have be the negro slave of bathurst 's father who leave he he liberty by will dr bathurst allow he to enter johnson 's service and johnson send he to school at considerable expense and afterwards retain he in he service with little interruption till he own death once barker run away to sea and be discharge oddly enough by the good office of wilke to whom smollett apply on johnson 's behalf barker become a important member of johnson 's family some of whom reproach he for he liberality to the nigger no one ever solve the great problem as to what service be render by barker to he master whose wig be as impenetrable by a comb as a quickset hedge and whose clothes be never touch by the brush among the other friend of this period must be reckon he biographer hawkin a attorney who be afterwards chairman of the middlesex justice and knight on present a address to the king boswell regard poor sir john hawkin with all the animosity of a rival author and with some spice of wounded vanity he be grievously offend so at least say sir john 's daughter on be describe in the _ life of johnson _ as mr jame boswell without a solitary epithet such as celebrated or well-known if that be really he feeling he have he revenge for no one book ever so suppress another as boswell 's life suppress hawkin 's in truth hawkin be a solemn prig remarkable chiefly for the unusual intensity of he conviction that all virtue consist in respectability he have a special aversion to goodness of heart which he regard as another name for a quality properly call extravagance or vice johnson 's tenacity of old acquaintance introduce he into the club where he make himself so disagreeable especially as it seem by rudeness to burke that he find it expedient to invent a pretext for resignation johnson call he a very unclubable man and may perhaps have intend he in the quaint description : i really believe he to be a honest man at the bottom though to be sure he be rather penurious and he be somewhat mean and it must be own he have some degree of brutality and be not without a tendency to savageness that can not well be defend in a list of johnson 's friend it be proper to mention richardson and hawkesworth richardson seem to have give he substantial help and be repay by favourable comparison with fielding scarcely bear out by the verdict of posterity fielding say johnson could tell the hour by look at the clock whilst richardson know how the clock be make there be more knowledge of the heart he say at another time in one letter of richardson 's than in all _ tom jone _ johnson 's preference of the sentimentalist to the man whose humor and strong sense be so like he own show how much he criticism be biass by he prejudice though of course richardson 's external decency be a recommendation to the moralist hawkesworth 's intimacy with johnson seem to have be chiefly in the period between the _ dictionary _ and the pension he be consider to be johnson 's best imitator and have vanish like other imitator he fate very doubtful if the story believe at the time be true be a curious one for a friend of johnson 's he have make some sceptical remark as to the efficacy of prayer in he preface to the south sea voyage and be so bitterly attack by a christian in the papers that he destroy himself by a dose of opium two younger friend who become disciple of the sage soon after the appearance of the _ rambler _ be prominent figure in the later circle one of these be bennet langton a man of good family fine scholarship and very amiable character he exceedingly tall and slender figure be compare by best to the stork in raphael 's cartoon of the miraculous draught of fish miss hawkin describe he sit with one leg twisted round the other as though to occupy the smallest possible space and play with he gold snuff-box with a mild countenance and sweet smile the gentle modest creature be love by johnson who could warm into unusual eloquence in singing he praise the doctor however be rather fond of discuss with boswell the fault of he friend they seem to have chiefly consist in a certain languor or sluggishness of temperament which allow he affair to get into perplexity once when argue the delicate question as to the propriety of tell a friend of he wife 's unfaithfulness boswell after he peculiar fashion choose to enliven the abstract statement by the purely imaginary hypothesis of mr and mr langton be in this position johnson say that it would be useless to tell langton because he would be too sluggish to get a divorce once langton be the unconscious cause of one of johnson 's oddest performance langton have employ chamber a common friend of he and johnson 's to draw he will johnson talk to chamber and boswell be suddenly strike by the absurdity of he friend 's appear in the character of testator he companion however be utterly unable to see in what the joke consist but johnson laugh obstreperously and irrepressibly : he laugh till he reach the temple gate and when in fleet street go almost into convulsion of hilarity holding on by one of the post in the street he send forth such peal of laughter that they seem in the silence of the night to resound from temple bar to fleet ditch not long before he death johnson apply to langton for spiritual advice i desire he to tell I sincerely in what he think my life be faulty langton write upon a sheet of paper certain text recommend christian charity and explain upon inquiry that he be point at johnson 's habit of contradiction the old doctor begin by thank he earnestly for he kindness but gradually wax savage and ask langton in a loud and angry tone what be you drift sir he complain of the well-meant advice to boswell with a sense that he have be unjustly treat it be a scene for a comedy as reynold observe to see a penitent get into a passion and belabor he confessor through langton johnson become acquaint with the friend whose manner be in the strongest contrast to he own topham beauclerk be a man of fashion he be commend to johnson by a likeness to charle ii from whom he be descend be the grandson of the first duke of st alban 's beauclerk be a man of literary and scientific taste he inherit some of the moral laxity which johnson choose to pardon in he ancestor some year after he acquaintance with boswell he marry lady diana spencer a lady who have be divorce upon he account from she husband lord bolingbroke but he take care not to obtrude he fault of life whatever they may have be upon the old moralist who entertain for he a peculiar affection he specially admire beauclerk 's skill in the use of a more polished if less vigorous style of conversation than he own he envy the ease with which beauclerk bring out he sly incisive retort no man he say ever be so free when he be go to say a good thing from a look that express that it be come or when he have say it from a look that express that it have come when beauclerk be die -lrb- in 1780 -rrb- johnson say with a falter voice that he would walk to the extremity of the diameter of the earth to save he two little anecdote be expressive of he tender feeling for this incongruous friend boswell have ask he to sup at beauclerk 's he start but on the way recollect himself say i can not go but _ i do not love beauclerk the less _ beauclerk have put upon a portrait of johnson the inscription -- ingenium ingen inculto latet hoc sub corpore langton who buy the portrait have the inscription remove it be kind in you to take it off say johnson and after a short pause not unkind in he to put it on early in they acquaintance the two young man beau and lanky as johnson call they have sit up one night at a tavern till three in the morning the courageous thought strike they that they would knock up the old philosopher he come to the door of he chamber poker in hand with a old wig for a nightcap on hear they errand the sage exclaim what be it you you dog i 'll have a frisk with you and so johnson with the two youth he junior by about thirty year proceed to make a night of it they amaze the fruiterer in covent garden they brew a bowl of bishop in a tavern while johnson quote the poet 's address to sleep -- short o short be then thy reign and give we to the world again they take a boat to billingsgate and johnson with beauclerk keep up they amusement for the follow day when langton desert they to go to breakfast with some young lady and johnson scold he for leave he friend to go and sit with a parcel of wretched _ unidea would _ girl i shall have my old friend to bail out of the round-house say garrick when he hear of this queer alliance and he tell johnson that he would be in the _ chronicle _ for he frolic he _ durst _ not do such a thing he wife would not let he be the moralist 's retort some friend know to fame by other title than they connexion with johnson have by this time gather round they among they be one whose art he be unable to appreciate but whose fine social quality and dignified equability of temper make he a value and respect companion reynold have settle in london at the end of 1752 johnson meet he at the house of miss cotterell reynold have specially admire johnson 's _ life of savage _ and on they first meeting happen to make a remark which delighted johnson the lady be regret the loss of a friend to whom they be under obligation you have however say reynold the comfort of be relieve from a burden of gratitude the say be a little too much like rochefoucauld and too true to be pleasant but it be one of those keen remark which johnson appreciate because they prick a bubble of commonplace moralizing without demand too literal a acceptation he go home to sup with reynold and become he intimate friend on another occasion johnson be offend by two lady of rank at the same house and by way of take down they pride ask reynold in a loud voice how much do you think you and i could get in a week if we both work as hard as we could he appearance say sir joshua 's sister miss reynold might suggest the poor author : as he be not likely in that place to be a blacksmith or a porter poor miss reynold who tell this story be another attraction to reynold ' house she be a shy retire maiden lady who vex she famous brother by follow in he step without he talent and be deeply hurt by he annoyance at the unintentional mockery johnson be through life a kind and judicious friend to she and have attract she on they first meeting by a significant indication of he character he say that when go home to he lodgings at one or two in the morning he often see poor child asleep on threshold and stall -- the wretched street arab of the day -- and that he use to put penny into they hand that they might buy a breakfast two friend who deserve to be place beside reynold come from ireland to seek they fortune in london edmund burke incomparably the greatest writer upon political philosophy in english literature the master of a style unrivalled for richness flexibility and vigor be radically oppose to johnson on party question though he language upon the french revolution after johnson 's death would have satisfy even the strongest prejudice of he old friend but he have quality which commend he even to the man who call he a bottomless whig and who generally speak of whig as rascal and maintain that the first whig be the devil if he intellect be wider he heart be as warm as johnson 's and in conversation he merit the generous applause and warm emulation of he friend johnson be never tire of praise the extraordinary readiness and spontaneity of burke 's conversation if a man he say go under a shed at the same time with burke to avoid a shower he would say ` this be a extraordinary man ' or if burke go into a stable to see he horse dress the ostler would say ` we have have a extraordinary man here ' when burke be first go into parliament johnson say in answer to hawkin who wonder that such a man should get a seat we who know mr burke know that he will be one of the first man in the country speaking of certain other member of parliament more after the heart of sir john hawkin he say that he grudge success to a man who make a figure by a knowledge of a few form though he mind be as narrow as the neck of a vinegar cruet but then he do not grudge burke 's be the first man in the house of common for he would be the first man everywhere and burke equally admit johnson 's supremacy in conversation it be enough for I he say to some one who regret johnson 's monopoly of the talk on a particular occasion to have ring the bell for he the other irish adventurer whose career be more nearly mould upon that of johnson come to london in 1756 and make johnson 's acquaintance some time afterwards -lrb- in or before 1761 -rrb- goldsmith like johnson have taste the bitterness of a usher 's life and escape into the scarcely more tolerable region of grub street after some year of trial he be become know to the bookseller as a serviceable hand and have two work in he desk destine to last celebrity he landlady -lrb- apparently 1764 -rrb- one day arrest he for debt johnson summon to he assistance send he a guinea and speedily follow the guinea have already be change and goldsmith be console himself with a bottle of madeira johnson cork the bottle and a discussion of way and mean bring out the manuscript of the _ vicar of wakefield _ johnson look into it take it to a bookseller get sixty pound for it and return to goldsmith who pay he rent and administer a sound rating to he landlady the relation thus indicate be characteristic johnson be as a rough but helpful elder brother to poor goldsmith give he advice sympathy and applause and at time criticise he pretty sharply or bring down he conversational bludgeon upon he sensitive friend he have nothing of the bear but he skin be goldsmith 's comment upon he clumsy friend and the two man appreciate each other at bottom some of they reader may be incline to resent johnson 's attitude of superiority the admirably pure and tender heart and the exquisite intellectual refinement imply in the _ vicar _ and the _ traveller _ force we to love goldsmith in spite of superficial foible and when johnson prune or interpolate line in the _ traveller _ we feel as though a woodman 's axe be hacking at a most delicate piece of carve the evidence of contemporary observer however must force impartial reader to admit that poor goldsmith 's foible be real however amply compensate by rare and admirable quality garrick 's assertion that he write like a angel but talk like poor poll express the unanimous opinion of all who have actually see he undoubtedly some of the story of he childlike vanity he frankly express envy and he general capacity for blunder owe something to boswell 's feeling that he be a rival near the throne and sometimes poor goldsmith 's humorous self-assertion may have be take too seriously by blunt english wit one may doubt for example whether he be really jealous of a puppet toss a pike and unconscious of he absurdity in say pshaw i could do it better myself boswell however be too good a observer to misrepresent at random and he have in fact explain very well the true meaning of he remark goldsmith be a excitable irishman of genius who tumble out whatever come uppermost and reveal the feeling of the moment with utter want of reserve he self-controlled companion wonder ridicule misinterpret and make fewer hit as well as fewer miss he anxiety to get in and share make he accord to johnson a unsocial companion goldsmith he say have not temper enough for the game he play he stake too much a man might always get a fall from he inferior in the chance of talk and goldsmith feel he fall too keenly he have certainly some trial of temper in johnson 's company stay stay say a german stop he in the full flow of he eloquence toctor johnson be go to say something a eton master call graham who be sup with the two doctor and have get to the pitch of look at one person and talk to another say doctor i shall be glad to see _ you _ at eton i shall be glad to wait on you say goldsmith no reply graham ` tis not you i mean doctor minor ` tis doctor major there poor goldsmith say afterwards graham be a fellow to make one commit suicide boswell who attribute some of goldsmith 's saying about johnson to envy say with probable truth that goldsmith have not more envy than other but only speak of it more freely johnson argue that we must be angry with a man who have so much of a odious quality that he could not keep it to himself but let it boil over the feeling at any rate be momentary and totally free from malice and goldsmith 's criticism upon johnson and he idolator seem to have be fair enough he objection to boswell 's substitute a monarchy for a republic have already be mention at another time he check boswell 's flow of panegyric by ask be he like burke who wind into a subject like a serpent to which boswell reply with charming irrelevance johnson be the hercule who strangle serpent in he cradle the last of goldsmith 's hit be suggest by johnson 's shake he side with laughter because goldsmith admire the skill with which the little fish in the fable be make to talk in character why dr johnson this be not so easy as you seem to think be the retort for if you be to make little fish talk they would talk like whale in spite of sundry little sparring johnson fully appreciate goldsmith 's genius possibly he authority hasten the spread of public appreciation as he seem to claim whilst repudiate boswell 's too flattering theory that it have materially raise goldsmith 's position when reynold quote the authority of fox in favor of the _ traveller _ say that he friend might suspect that they have be too partial johnson reply very truly that the _ traveller _ be beyond the need of fox 's praise and that the partiality of goldsmith 's friend have always be against he they would hardly give he a hearing goldsmith he add be a man who whatever he write always do it better than any other man could do johnson 's settle opinion in fact be that embody in the famous epitaph with its nihil tetigit quod non ornavit and though dedication be perhaps the only literary product more generally insincere than epitaph we may believe that goldsmith too mean what he say in the dedication of _ she stoop to conquer _ it may do I some honor to inform the public that i have live many year in intimacy with you it may serve the interest of mankind also to inform they that the greatest wit may be find in a character without impair the most unaffected piety though johnson be thus rich in friendship two connexion have still to be notice which have a exceptional bearing upon he fame and happiness in January 1765 he make the acquaintance of the thrale mr thrale be the proprietor of the brewery which afterwards become that of barclay and perkin he be marry in 1763 to a miss hester lynch salisbury who have become celebrate from she friendship with johnson -lrb- 1 -rrb- she be a woman of great vivacity and independence of character she have a sensitive and passionate if not a very tender nature and enough literary culture to appreciate johnson 's intellectual power and on occasion to play a very respectable part in conversation she have far more latin and english scholarship than fall to the lot of most lady of she day and wit enough to preserve she from degenerate like some of the blues into that most offensive of being -- a feminine prig she marriage have be one of convenience and she husband 's want of sympathy and jealousy of any interference in business matter force she she say to take to literature as she sole resource no wonder she add if i love my book and child it be perhaps more to be wonder at that she child seem to have have a rather subordinate place in she affection the marriage however though not of the happiest be perfectly decorous mr thrale discharge she domestic duty irreproachably even when she seem to have have some real cause of complaint to the world she eclipse she husband a solid respectable man whose mind accord to johnson strike the hour very regularly though it do not mark the minute -lrb- footnote 1 : mr thrale be bear in 1740 or 1741 probably the latter thrale be bear in 1724 -rrb- the thrale be introduce to johnson by they common friend arthur murphy a actor and dramatist who afterwards become the editor of johnson 's work one day when call upon johnson they find he in such a fit of despair that thrale try to stop he mouth by place he hand before it the pair then join in beg johnson to leave he solitary abode and come to they at they country-house at streatham he comply and for the next sixteen year a room be set apart for he both at streatham and in they house in southwark he pass a large part of he time with they and derive from the intimacy most of the comfort of he later year he treat mr thrale with a kind of paternal gallantry she age at the time of they acquaintance be about twenty-four and he fifty-five he generally call she by the playful name of my mistress address little poem to she give she solid advice and gradually come to confide to she he misery and ailment with rather surprising frankness she flatter and amuse he and soothe he suffering and do something towards humanize he rugged exterior there be one little grievance between they which require notice johnson 's pet virtue in private life be a rigid regard for truth he speak it be say of he as if he be always on oath he would not for example allow he servant to use the phrase not at home and even in the heat of conversation resist the temptation to give point to a anecdote the lively mr thrale rather fret against the restraint and johnson admonish she in vain he complain to boswell that she be willing to have that say of she which the best of mankind have die rather than have say of they boswell the faithful imitator of he master in this respect delighted in take up the parable now madam give I leave to catch you in the fact he say on one occasion it be not a old woman but a old man whom i mention as have tell I this and he recount he check to the lively lady with intense complacency as may be imagine boswell and mr thrale do not love each other in spite of the well-meant effort of the sage to bring about a friendly feeling between he disciple it be time to close this list of friend with the inimitable boswell jame boswell bear in 1740 be the eldest son of a whig laird and lord of session he have acquire some english friend at the scotch university among whom must be mention mr temple a english clergyman boswell 's correspondence with temple discover year after he death by a singular chance and publish in 1857 be after the life of johnson one of the most curious exhibition of character in the language boswell be intend for the scotch bar and study civil law at utrecht in the winter of 1762 it be in the follow summer that he make johnson 's acquaintance perhaps the fundamental quality in boswell 's character be he intense capacity for enjoyment he be as mr carlyle put it gluttonously fond of whatever would yield he a little solacement be it only of a stomachic character he love of good living and good drink would have make he a hearty admirer of he countryman burn have burn be famous in boswell 's youth nobody could have join with more thorough abandonment in the chorus to the poet 's liveliest song in praise of love and wine he would have make a excellent fourth when willie brew a peck of malt and rab and allan come to see and the drinking contest for the whistle commemorate in another lyric would have excite he keenest interest he be always delight when he could get johnson to discuss the ethic and statistics of drinking i be myself he say a lover of wine and therefore curious to hear whatever be remarkable concern drink the remark be _ à propo _ to a story of dr campbell drinking thirteen bottle of port at a sit lest this should seem incredible he quote johnson 's dictum sir if a man drink very slowly and let one glass evaporate before he take another i know not how long he may drink boswell 's faculty for make love be as great as he power of drink he letter to temple record with amusing frankness the vicissitude of some of he courtship and the versatility of he passion boswell 's taste however be by no means limit to sensual or frivolous enjoyment he appreciation of the bottle be combine with a equally hearty sensibility to more intellectual pleasure he have not a spark of philosophic or poetic power but within the ordinary range of such topic as can be discuss at a dinner-party he have a abundant share of liveliness and intelligence he palate be as keen for good talk as for good wine he be a admirable recipient if not a originator of shrewd or humorous remark upon life and manners what in regard to sensual enjoyment be mere gluttony appear in higher matter as a insatiable curiosity at time this faculty become intolerable to he neighbor i will not be bait with what and why say poor johnson one day in desperation why be a cow 's tail long why be a fox 's tail bushy sir say johnson on another occasion when boswell be cross-examine a third person about he in he presence you have but two subject yourself and I i be sick of both boswell however be not to be repel by such a retort as this or even by ruder rebuff once when discuss the means of get a friend to leave london johnson say in revenge for a previous offence nay sir we 'll send you to he if you presence do not drive a man out of he house nothing will boswell be horribly shocked but he still stick to he victim like a leech and pry into the minutest detail of he life and manners he observe with conscientious accuracy that though johnson abstain from milk one fast-day he do not reject it when put in he cup he note the whistling and puffing the trick of say too-too-too of he idol : and it be a proud day when he win a bet by venture to ask johnson what he do with certain scraped bit of orange-peel he curiosity be not satisfy on this occasion but it would have make he the prince of interviewer in these day nothing delighted he so much as rub shoulder with any famous or notorious person he scrape acquaintance with voltaire wesley rousseau and paolus as well as with mr rudd a forget heroine of the _ newgate calendar _ he be as eager to talk to hume the sceptic or wilke the demagogue as to the orthodox tory johnson and if repel it be from no deficiency in daring in 1767 he take advantage of he travels in corsica to introduce himself to lord chatham then prime minister the letter moderately end by ask _ could you lordship find time to honor I now and then with a letter _ i have be tell how favourably you lordship have speak of I to correspond with a paolus and with a chatham be enough to keep a young man ever ardent in the pursuit of virtuous fame no other young man of the day we may be sure would have dare to make such a proposal to the majestic orator he absurd vanity and the greedy craving for notoriety at any cost would have make boswell the most offensive of mortal have not he unfeigned good-humour disarm enmity nobody could help laughing or be incline to take offence at he harmless absurdity burke say of he that he have so much good-humour naturally that it be scarcely a virtue he vanity in fact do not generate affectation most vain man be vain of quality which they do not really possess or possess in a lower degree than they fancy they be always act a part and become touchy from a half-conscious sense of the imposture but boswell seem to have have few such illusion he thoroughly and unfeignedly enjoy he own peculiarity and think he real self much too charming a object to be in need of any disguise no man therefore be ever less embarrassed by any regard for he own dignity he be as ready to join in a laugh at himself as in a laugh at he neighbor he reveal he own absurdity to the world at large as frankly as pepy confide they to a journal in cypher he tell we how drunk he get one night in skye and how he cure he headache with brandy next morning and what a intolerable fool he make of himself at a evening party in london after a dinner with the duke of montrose and how johnson in vain do he best to keep he quiet he motive for the concession be partly the wish to illustrate johnson 's indulgence and in the last case to introduce a copy of apologetic verse to the lady whose guest he have be he reveal other weakness with equal frankness one day he say i own to johnson that i be occasionally trouble with a fit of narrowness why sir say he so be i _ but i do not tell it _ boswell enjoy the joke far too heartily to act upon the advice there be nothing however which boswell seem to have enjoy more heartily than he own good impulse he look upon he virtuous resolution with a sort of aesthetic satisfaction and with the glow of a virtuous man contemplate a promising penitent whilst suffer severely from the consequence of imprudent conduct he get a letter of virtuous advice from he friend temple he instantly see himself reform for the rest of he day my warm imagination he say look forward with great complacency on the sobriety the healthfulness and worth of my future life every instance of we do those thing which we ought not to have do and leave undo those thing which we ought to have do be attend as he elsewhere sagely observe with more or less of what be truly remorse but he seem rather to have enjoy even the remorse it be needless to say that the complacency be its own reward and that the resolution vanish like other more eccentric impulse music he once tell johnson affect he intensely produce in he mind alternate sensation of pathetic dejection so that i be ready to shed tear and of daring resolution so that i be incline to rush into the thickest of the -lrb- purely hypothetical -rrb- battle sir reply johnson i should never hear it if it make I such a fool elsewhere he express a wish to fly to the wood or retire into a desert a disposition which johnson check by one of he habitual gibe at the quantity of easily accessible desert in scotland boswell be equally frank in describe himself in situation more provocative of contempt than even drunkenness in a drawing-room he tell we how dreadfully frightened he be by a storm at sea in the hebride and how one of he companion with a happy readiness make he lay hold of a rope fasten to the masthead and tell he to pull it when he be order boswell be thus keep quiet in mind and harmless in body this extreme simplicity of character make poor boswell loveable in he way if he seek notoriety he do not so far mistake he power as to set up for independent notoriety -lrb- 1 -rrb- he be content to shine in reflect light : and the affectation with which he be charge seem to have be unconscious imitation of he great idol miss burney trace some likeness even in he dress in the later part of the _ life _ we meet phrase in which boswell be evidently ape the true johnsonian style so for example when somebody distinguish between moral and physical necessity boswell exclaim alas sir they come both to the same thing you may be as hard bind by chain when cover by leather as when the iron appear but he specially emulate the profound melancholy of he hero he seem to have take pride in he suffering from hypochondria though in truth he melancholy diverge from johnson 's by as great a difference as that which divide any two variety in jaques 's classification boswell 's be the melancholy of a man who spend too much drink too much fall in love too often and be force to live in the country in dependence upon a stern old parent when he be longing for a jovial life in london tavern still he be excusably vex when johnson refuse to believe in the reality of he complaint and show scant sympathy to he noisy would-be fellow-sufferer some of boswell 's freak be in fact very try once he give up write letter for a long time to see whether johnson would be induce to write first johnson become anxious though he half-guess the truth and in reference to boswell 's confession give he disciple a piece of he mind remember that all trick be either knavish or childish and that it be as foolish to make experiment upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity of a wife -lrb- footnote 1 : the story be often tell how boswell appear at the stratford jubilee with corsica boswell in large letter on he hat the account give apparently by himself be sufficiently amusing but the statement be not quite fair boswell not unnaturally appear at a masquerade in the dress of a corsican chief and the inscription on he hat seem to have be viva la libertà -rrb- in other way boswell be more successful in ape he friend 's peculiarity when in company with johnson he become delightfully pious my dear sir he exclaim once with unrestrained fervor i would fain be a good man and i be very good now i fear god and honor the king i wish to do no ill and to be benevolent to all mankind boswell hope for the felicity of human nature that many experience this mood though johnson judiciously suggest that he should not trust too much to impression in some matter boswell show a touch of independence by outvy the johnsonian prejudice he be a warm admirer of feudal principle and especially hold to the propriety of entail property upon heir male johnson have great difficulty in persuade he to yield to he father 's wish in a settlement of the estate which contravene this theory but boswell take care to declare that he opinion be not shake yet let I not be think he add harsh or unkind to daughter for my notion be that they should be treat with great affection and tenderness and always participate of the prosperity of the family he estimate of female rights be indicate in another phrase when mr knowle the quaker express a hope that the sex would be equal in another world boswell reply that be too ambitious madam _ we _ might as well desire to be equal with the angel boswell again differ from johnson -- who in spite of he love of authority have a righteous hatred for all recognize tyranny -- by advocate the slave-trade to abolish that trade would he say be robbery of the master and cruelty to the african savage nay he declare to abolish it would be to shut the gate of mercy on mankind boswell be accord to johnson the best travel companion in the world in fact for such purpose unfailing good-humour and readiness to make talk at all hazard be high recommendation if sir you be shut up in a castle and a new-born baby with you what would you do be one of he question to johnson -- _ à propo _ of nothing that be exquisitely ludicrous no doubt but a man capable of prefer such a remark to silence help at any rate to keep the ball roll a more objectionable trick be he habit not only of ask preposterous or indiscreet question but of set people by the ear out of sheer curiosity the appearance of so queer a satellite excited astonishment among johnson 's friend who be this scotch cur at johnson 's heel ask some one he be not a cur reply goldsmith he be only a bur tom davy fling he at johnson in sport and he have the faculty of stick the bur stick till the end of johnson 's life boswell visit london whenever he could and soon begin take careful note of johnson 's talk he appearance when engage in this task long afterwards be describe by miss burney boswell she say concentrate he whole attention upon he idol not even answer question from other when johnson speak he eye goggle with eagerness he lean he ear almost on the doctor 's shoulder he mouth drop open to catch every syllable and he seem to listen even to johnson 's breathing as though they have some mystical significance he take every opportunity of edge himself close to johnson 's side even at meal-time and be sometimes order imperiously back to he place like a faithful but over-obtrusive spaniel it be hardly surprising that johnson should have be touch by the fidelity of this queer follower boswell modestly enough attribute johnson 's easy welcome to he interest in all manifestation of the human mind and he pleasure in a undisguised display of its workings the last pleasure be certainly to be obtain in boswell 's society but in fact boswell though he quality be too much those of the ordinary good fellow be not without virtue and still less without remarkable talent he be to all appearance a man of really generous sympathy and capable of appreciate proof of a warm heart and a vigorous understanding foolish vain and absurd in every way he be yet a far kindlier and more genuine man than many who laugh at he he singular gift as a observer could only escape notice from a careless or inexperienced reader boswell have a little of the true shaksperian secret he let he character show themselves without obtrude unnecessary comment he never miss the point of a story though he do not ostentatiously call we attention to it he give just what be want to indicate character or to explain the full meaning of a repartee it be not till we compare he report with those of less skilful hearer that we can appreciate the skill with which the essence of a conversation be extract and the whole scene indicate by a few tell touch we be tempt to fancy that we have hear the very thing and rashly infer that boswell be simply the mechanical transmitter of the good thing utter any one who will try to put down the pith of a brilliant conversation within the same space may soon satisfy himself of the absurdity of such a hypothesis and will learn to appreciate boswell 's power not only of memory but artistic representation such a feat imply not only admirable quickness of appreciation but a rare literary faculty boswell 's accuracy be remarkable but it be the least part of he merit the book which so faithfully reflect the peculiarity of its hero and its author become the first specimen of a new literary type johnson himself be a master in one kind of biography that which set forth a condensed and vigorous statement of the essential of a man 's life and character other biographer have give excellent memoirs of man consider in relation to the chief historical current of the time but a full-length portrait of a man 's domestic life with enough picturesque detail to enable we to see he through the eye of private friendship do not exist in the language boswell 's originality and merit may be test by compare he book to the ponderous performance of sir john hawkin or to the dreary dissertation falsely call life of which dugald stewart 's _ life of robertson _ may be take for a type the writer be so anxious to be dignified and philosophical that the despairing reader seek in vain for a single vivid touch and discover even the main fact of the hero 's life by some indirect allusion boswell 's example have be more or less follow by innumerable successor and we owe it in some degree to he example that we have such delightful book as lockhart 's _ life of scott _ or mr trevelyan 's _ life of macaulay _ yet no later biographer have be quite as fortunate in a subject and boswell remain as not only the first but the best of he class one special merit imply something like genius macaulay have give to the usual complaint which distort the vision of most biographer the name of _ lue boswelliana _ it be true that boswell 's adoration of he hero be a typical example of the feeling but that which distinguish boswell and render the phrase unjust be that in he adoration never hinder accuracy of portraiture i will not make my tiger a cat to please anybody be he answer to well-meaning entreaty of hannah more to soften he account of johnson 's asperity he see instinctively that a man who be worth anything lose far more than he gain by such posthumous flattery the whole picture be tone down and the light be depress as well as the shadow the truth be that it be unscientific to consider a man as a bundle of separate good and bad quality of which one half may be conceal without injury to the rest johnson 's fit of bad temper like goldsmith 's blundering must be unsparingly reveal by a biographer because they be in fact expression of the whole character it be necessary to take they into account in order really to understand either the merit or the shortcoming when they be soften or omit the whole story become a enigma and we be often tempt to substitute some less creditable explanation of error for the true one we should not do justice to johnson 's intense tenderness if we do not see how often it be mask by a irritability pardonable in itself and not affect the deeper spring of action to bring out the beauty of a character by means of its external oddity be the triumph of a kindly humourist and boswell would have act as absurdly in suppress johnson 's weakness as sterne would have do have he make uncle toby a perfectly sound and rational person but to see this require a insight so rare that it be want in nearly all the biographer who have follow boswell 's step and be the most conclusive proof that boswell be a man of a higher intellectual capacity than have be generally admit chapter iv johnson as a literary dictator we have now reach the point at which johnson 's life become distinctly visible through the eye of a competent observer the last twenty year be those which be really familiar to we and little remains but to give some brief selection of boswell 's anecdote the task however be a difficult one it be easy enough to make a selection of the gem of boswell 's narrative but it be also inevitable that take from they set they should lose the greatest part of they brilliance we lose all the quaint semiconscious touch of character which make the original so fascinating and boswell 's absurdity become less amusing when we be able to forget for a instant that the perpetrator be also the narrator the effort however must be make and it will be best to premise a brief statement of the external condition of the life from the time of the pension until he death johnson be elevated above the fear of poverty he have a pleasant refuge at the thrale ' where much of he time be spend and many friend gather round he and regard he utterance with even excessive admiration he have still frequent period of profound depression he diary reveal a inner life torment by gloomy foreboding by remorse for past indolence and futile resolution of amendment but he could always escape from himself to a society of friend and admirer he abandonment of wine seem to have improve he health and diminish the intensity of he melancholy fit he literary activity however nearly cease he write a few political pamphlet in defense of government and after a long period of indolence manage to complete he last conspicuous work -- the _ life of the poet _ which be publish in 1779 and 1781 one other book of some interest appear in 1775 it be a account of the journey make with boswell to the hebride in 1773 this journey be in fact the chief interruption to the even tenor of he life he make a tour to wale with the thrale in 1774 and spend a month with they in paris in 1775 for the rest of the period he live chiefly in london or at streatham make occasional trip to lichfield and oxford or pay visit to taylor langton and one or two other friend it be however in the london which he love so ardently -lrb- a man he say once who be tire of london be tire of life -rrb- that he be chiefly conspicuous there he talk and drink tea illimitably at he friend ' house or argue and lay down the law to he disciple collect in a tavern instead of academic grove especially he be in all he glory at the club which begin its meeting in February 1764 and be afterwards know as the literary club this club be found by sir joshua reynold we romulus as johnson call he the original member be reynold johnson burke nugent beauclerk langton goldsmith chamier and hawkin they meet weekly at the turk 's head in gerard street soho at seven o'clock and the talk generally continue till a late hour the club be afterwards increase in number and the weekly supper change to a fortnightly dinner it continue to thrive and election to it come to be as great a honor in certain circle as election to a membership of parliament among the member elect in johnson 's lifetime be percy of the _ relique _ garrick sir w jone boswell fox steeven gibbon adam smith the warton sheridan dunning sir joseph bank windham lord stowell malone and dr burney what be best in the conversation at the time be doubtless to be find at its meeting johnson 's habitual mode of life be describe by dr maxwell one of boswell 's friend who make he acquaintance in 1754 maxwell generally call upon he about twelve and find he in bed or declaim over he tea a levée chiefly of literary man surround he and he seem to be regard as a kind of oracle to whom every one might resort for advice or instruction after talk all the morning he dine at a tavern stay late and then go to some friend 's house for tea over which he again loiter for a long time maxwell be puzzle to know when he could have read or write the answer seem to be pretty obvious namely that after the publication of the _ dictionary _ he write very little and that when he do write it be generally in a brief spasm of feverish energy one may understand that johnson should have frequently reproach himself for he indolence though he seem to have occasionally comfort himself by think that he could do good by talk as well as by write he say that a man should have a part of he life to himself and compare himself to a physician retire to a small town from practice in a great city boswell in spite of this say that he still wonder that johnson have not more pleasure in write than in not write sir reply the oracle you _ may _ wonder i will now endeavor with boswell 's guidance to describe a few of the characteristic scene which can be fully enjoy in he page alone the first must be the introduction of boswell to the sage boswell have come to london eager for the acquaintance of literary magnate he already know goldsmith who have inflamed he desire for a introduction to johnson once when boswell speak of levett one of johnson 's dependent goldsmith have say he be poor and honest which be recommendation enough to johnson another time when boswell have wonder at johnson 's kindness to a man of bad character goldsmith have reply he be now become miserable and that insure the protection of johnson boswell have hope for a introduction through the elder sheridan but sheridan never forget the contemptuous phrase in which johnson have refer to he fellow-pensioner possibly sheridan have hear of one other johnsonian remark why sir he have say sherry be dull naturally dull but it must have take he a great deal of pain to become what we now see he such a excess of stupidity sir be not in nature at another time he say sheridan can not bear I i bring he declamation to a point what influence can mr sheridan have upon the language of this great country by he narrow exertion sir it be burn a farthe candle at dover to show light at calai boswell however be acquaint with davy a actor turn bookseller now chiefly remember by a line in churchill 's _ rosciad _ which be say to have drive he from the stage -- he mouth a sentence as cur mouth a bone boswell be drink tea with davy and he wife in they back parlor when johnson come into the shop davy see he through the glass-door announce he approach to boswell in the spirit of horatio address hamlet : look my lord it come davy introduce the young scotchman who remember johnson 's proverbial prejudice do not tell he where i come from cry boswell from scotland say davy roguishly mr johnson say boswell i do indeed come from scotland but i can not help it that sir be the first of johnson 's many retort to he worshipper be what a great many of you countryman can not help poor boswell be stunned but he recover when johnson observe to davy what do you think of garrick he have refuse I a order for the play for miss william because he know the house will be full and that a order would be worth three shilling o sir intrude the unlucky boswell i can not think mr garrick would grudge such a trifle to you sir reply johnson sternly i have know david garrick longer than you have do and i know no right you have to talk to I on the subject the second blow might have crush a less intrepid curiosity boswell though silence gradually recover sufficiently to listen and afterwards to note down part of the conversation as the interview go on he even venture to make a remark or two which be very civilly receive davy console he at he departure by assure he that the great man like he very well i can not conceive a more humiliating position say beauclerk on another occasion than to be clap on the back by tom davy for the present however even tom davy be a welcome encourager to one who for the rest be not easily rebuff a few day afterwards boswell venture a call be kindly receive and detain for some time by the giant in he den he be still a little afraid of the say giant who have shortly before administer a vigorous retort to he countryman blair blair have ask johnson whether he think that any man of a modern age could have write _ ossian _ yes sir reply johnson many man many woman and many child boswell however get on very well and before long have the high honor of drink a bottle of port with johnson at the mitre and receive after a little autobiographical sketch the emphatic approval give I you hand i have take a liking to you in a very short time boswell be on sufficiently easy term with johnson not merely to frequent he levées but to ask he to dinner at the mitre he gather up though without the skill of he later performance some fragment of the conversational feast the great man aim another blow or two at scotch prejudice to a unlucky compatriot of boswell 's who claim for he country a great many noble wild prospects johnson reply i believe sir you have a great many norway too have noble wild prospects and lapland be remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects but sir let I tell you the noblest prospect which a scotchman ever see be the high road that lead he to england though boswell make a slight remonstrance about the rude grandeur of nature as see in caledonium he sympathize in this with he teacher johnson say afterwards that he never know any one with such a gust for london before long he be try boswell 's taste by ask he in greenwich park be not this very fine yes sir reply the promising disciple but not equal to fleet street you be right sir say the sage and boswell illustrate he dictum by the authority of a very fashionable baronet and moreover a baronet from rydal who declare that the fragrance of a may evening in the country might be very well but that he prefer the smell of a flambeau at the playhouse in more serious mood johnson delight he new disciple by discussion upon theological social and literary topic he argue with a unfortunate friend of boswell 's whose mind it appear have be poison by hume and who be moreover rash enough to undertake the defense of principle of political equality johnson 's view of all propagator of new opinion be tolerably simple hume and other sceptical innovator he say be vain man and will gratify themselves at any expense truth will not afford sufficient food to they vanity so they have betake themselves to error truth sir be a cow which will yield such people no more milk and so they be go to milk the bull on another occasion poor boswell not yet acquaint with the master 's prejudice quote with hearty laughter a very strange story which hume have tell he of johnson accord to hume johnson have say that he would stand before a battery of cannon to restore convocation to its full power and would i not sir thunder out the sage with flash eye and threatening gesture boswell judiciously bow to the storm and divert johnson 's attention another manifestation of orthodox prejudice be less terrible boswell tell johnson that he have hear a quaker woman preach a woman 's preach say johnson be like a dog 's walk on he hind leg it be not do well but you be surprise to find it do at all so friendly have the pair become that when boswell leave england to continue he study at utrecht johnson accompany he in the stage-coach to harwich amusing he on the way by he frankness of address to fellow-passenger and by the voracity of he appetite he give he some excellent advice remarking of a moth which flutter into a candle that creature be its own tormentor and i believe its name be boswell he refute berkeley by strike he foot with mighty force against a large stone till he rebound from it as the ship put out to sea boswell watch he from the deck whilst he remain roll he majestic frame in he usual manner and so the friendship be cement though boswell disappear for a time from the scene travel on the continent and visit paolus in corsica a friendly letter or two keep up the connexion till boswell return in 1766 with he head full of corsica and a project book of travels in the next year 1767 occur a incident upon which boswell dwell with extreme complacency johnson be in the habit of sometimes read in the king 's library and it come into the head of he majesty that he should like to see the uncouth monster upon whom he have bestow a pension in spite of he semi-humorous jacobitism there be probably not a more loyal subject in he majesty 's dominion loyalty be a word too often use to designate a sentiment worthy only of valet advertise tradesman and writer of claptrap article but it deserve all respect when it repose as in johnson 's case upon a profound conviction of the value of political subordination and a acceptance of the king as the authorize representative of a great principle there be no touch of servility in johnson 's respect for he sovereign a respect fully reconcilable with a sense of he own personal dignity johnson speak of he interview with a unfeigned satisfaction which it would be difficult in these day to preserve from the taint of snobbishness he describe it frequently to he friend and boswell with pious care ascertain the detail from johnson himself and from various secondary source he contrived afterwards to get he minute submit to the king himself who graciously authorize its publication when he be prepare he biography he publish this account with the letter to chesterfield in a small pamphlet sell at a prohibitory price in order to secure the copyright i find say johnson afterwards that it do a man good to be talk to by he sovereign in the first place a man can not be in a passion what other advantage he perceive must be unknown for here the oracle be interrupted but whatever the advantage it could hardly be reckon amongst they that there would be room for the hearty cut and thrust retort which enliven he ordinary talk to we accordingly the conversation be chiefly interesting as illustrate what johnson mean by he politeness he find that the king want he to talk and he talk accordingly he speak in a firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and not in the subdue tone customary at formal reception he dilate upon various literary topic on the library of oxford and cambridge on some contemporary controversy on the quack dr hill and upon the review of the day all that be worth repeat be a complimentary passage which show johnson 's possession of that courtesy which rest upon sense and self-respect the king ask whether he be write anything and johnson excuse himself by say that he have tell the world what he know for the present and have do he part as a writer i should have think so too say the king if you have not write so well no man say johnson could have pay a higher compliment and it be fit for a king to pay -- it be decisive when ask if he have reply he say no sir when the king have say it it be to be it be not for I to bandy civility with my sovereign johnson be not the less delighted sir he say to the librarian they may talk of the king as they will but he be the finest gentleman i have ever see and he afterwards compare he manners to those of loui xiv and he favorite charle ii goldsmith say boswell be silent during the narrative because -lrb- so he kind friend suppose -rrb- he be jealous of the honor pay to the dictator but he natural simplicity prevail he run to johnson and exclaim in ' a kind of flutter ' well you acquit yourself in this conversation better than i should have do for i should have bow and stammer through the whole of it the year 1768 and 1769 be a period of great excitement for boswell he be carry on various love affair which end with he marriage in the end of 1769 he be publish he book upon corsica and pay homage to paolus who arrive in england in the autumn of the same year the book appear in the beginning of 1768 and he beg he friend temple to report all that be say about it but with the restriction that he be to conceal _ all censure _ he particularly want gray 's opinion as gray be a friend of temple 's gray 's opinion not convey to boswell be express by he call it a dialogue between a green goose and a hero boswell who be cultivate the society of various eminent people exclaim triumphantly in a letter to temple -lrb- April 26 1768 -rrb- i be really the great man now johnson and hume have call upon he on the same day and garrick franklin and oglethorpe also partook of he admirable dinner and good claret this he say with the sense that he deserve he honor be enjoy the fruit of my labor and appear like the friend of paolus johnson in vain express a wish that he would empty he head of corsica which have fill it too long empty my head of corsica empty it of honor empty it of friendship empty it of piety exclaim the ardent youth the next year accordingly see boswell 's appearance at the stratford jubilee where he parade to the admiration of all beholder in a costume describe by himself -lrb- apparently -rrb- in a glowing article in the _ london magazine _ be it wrong sir he take speedy opportunity of inquire from the oracle to affect singularity in order to make people stare yes reply johnson if you do it by propagate error and indeed it be wrong in any way there be in human nature a general inclination to make people stare and every wise man have himself to cure of it and do cure himself if you wish to make people stare by do better than other why make they stare till they stare they eye out but consider how easy it be to make people stare by be absurd -- a proposition which he proceed to illustrate by example perhaps less telling than boswell 's recent performance the sage be less communicative on the question of marriage though boswell have anticipate some instructive conversation upon that topic he sole remark be one from which boswell humbly differ johnson maintain that a wife be not the worse for be learn boswell on the other hand define the proper degree of intelligence to be desire in a female companion by some verse in which sir thoma overbury say that a wife should have some knowledge and be by nature wise not learn much by art johnson say afterwards that mr boswell be in a proper degree inferior to she husband so far as we can tell she seem to have be a really sensible and good woman who keep she husband 's absurdity in check and be in she way a better wife than he deserve so happily be most wife johnson and boswell have several meeting in 1769 boswell have the honor of introduce the two object of he idolatry johnson and paolus and on another occasion entertain a party include goldsmith and garrick and reynold at he lodgings in old bond street we can still see the meeting more distinctly than many that have be swallow by a few day of oblivion they wait for one of the party johnson kindly maintain that six ought to be keep wait for one if the one would suffer more by the other sit down than the six by wait meanwhile garrick play round johnson with a fond vivacity take hold of the breast of he coat look up in he face with a lively archness and compliment he on he good health goldsmith strut about bragging of he dress of which boswell in the serene consciousness of superiority to such weakness think he seriously vain let I tell you say goldsmith when my tailor bring home my bloom-coloured coat he say ` sir i have a favor to beg of you when anybody ask you who make you clothes be please to mention john filby at the harrow water lane ' why sir say johnson that be because he know that the strange color would attract crowd to gaze at it and thus they might hear of he and see how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a color mr filby have go the way of all tailor and bloom-coloured coat but some of he bill be preserve on the day of this dinner he have deliver to goldsmith a half-dress suit of ratteen line with satin cost twelve guinea a pair of silk stocking-breeches for # 2 5_s _ and a pair of bloom-coloured ditto for # 1 4_s _ 6_d _ the bill include other item be pay it be satisfactory to add in February 1771 the conversation be chiefly literary johnson repeat the conclude line of the _ dunciad _ upon which some one -lrb- probably boswell -rrb- venture to say that they be too fine for such a poem -- a poem on what why say johnson on dunce it be worth while be a dunce then ah sir hadst _ thou _ live in those day johnson previously utter a criticism which have lead some people to think that he have a touch of the dunce in he he declare that a description of a temple in congreve 's _ mourning bride _ be the finest he know -- finer than anything in shakspeare garrick vainly protest but johnson be inexorable he compare congreve to a man who have only ten guinea in the world but all in one coin whereas shakspeare might have ten thousand separate guinea the principle of the criticism be rather curious what i mean be say johnson that you can show I no passage where there be simply a description of material object without any admixture of moral notion which produce such a effect the description of the night before agincourt be reject because there be man in it and the description of dover cliff because the boat and the crow impede yon fall they do not impress you mind at once with the horrible idea of immense height the impression be divide you pass on by computation from one stage of the tremendous space to another probably most people will think that the passage in question deserve a very slight fraction of the praise bestow upon it but the criticism like most of johnson 's have a meaning which might be worth examine abstractedly from the special application which shock the idolater of shakspeare presently the party discuss mr montagu whose essay upon shakspeare have make some noise johnson have a respect for she cause in great measure by a sense of she liberality to he friend miss william of whom more must be say hereafter he pay she some tremendous compliment observe that some china plate which have belong to queen elizabeth and to she have no reason to be ashamed of a possessor so little inferior to the first but he have he usual professional contempt for she amateur performance in literature she defense of shakspeare against voltaire do she honor he admit but it would do nobody else honor no sir there be no real criticism in it : none show the beauty of think as form on the workings of the human heart mr montagu be report once to have compliment a modern tragedian probably jephson by say i tremble for shakspeare when shakspeare say johnson have get jephson for he rival and mr montagu for he defender he be in a poor state indeed the conversation go on to a recently publish book _ kame 's element of criticism _ which johnson praise whilst goldsmith say more truly it be easier to write that book than to read it johnson go on to speak of other critic there be no great merit he say in tell how many play have ghost in they and how this ghost be better than that you must show how terror be impress on the human heart in the description of night in _ macbeth _ the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkness -- inspissated gloom after boswell 's marriage he disappear for some time from london and he correspondence with johnson drop as he say without coldness from pure procrastination he do not return to london till 1772 in the spring of that and the following year he renew he old habit of intimacy and inquire into johnson 's opinion upon various subject range from ghost to literary criticism the height to which he have rise in the doctor 's good opinion be mark by several symptom he be ask to dine at johnson 's house upon easter day 1773 and observe that he curiosity be as much gratify as by a previous dinner with rousseau in the wild of neufchatel he be now able to report to the amazement of many inquirer that johnson 's establishment be quite orderly the meal consist of very good soup a boil leg of lamb with spinach a veal pie and a rice pudding a stronger testimony of good-will be he election by johnson 's influence into the club it ought apparently to be say that johnson force he upon the club by let it be understand that till boswell be admit no other candidate would have a chance boswell however be as he proposer say a thoroughly clubable man and once a member he good humor secure he popularity on the important evening boswell dine at beauclerk 's with he proposer and some other member the talk turn upon goldsmith 's merit and johnson not only defend he poetry but prefer he as a historian to robertson such a judgment could be explain in boswell 's opinion by nothing but johnson 's dislike to the scotch once before when boswell have mention robertson in order to meet johnson 's condemnation of scotch literature in general johnson have evade he sir i love robertson and i will not talk of he book on the present occasion he say that he would give to robertson the advice offer by a old college tutor to a pupil read over you composition and whenever you meet with a passage which you think particularly fine strike it out a good anecdote of goldsmith follow johnson have say to he once in the poet 's corner at westminster -- forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur isti when they get to temple bar goldsmith point to the head of the jacobite upon it and slily suggest -- forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur _ isti _ johnson next pronounce a critical judgment which should be set against many sin of that kind he praise the _ pilgrim 's progress _ very warmly and suggest that bunyan have probably read spenser after more talk the gentleman go to the club and poor boswell remain tremble with a anxiety which even the claim of lady di beauclerk 's conversation could not dissipate the welcome news of he election be bring and boswell go to see burke for the first time and to receive a humorous charge from johnson point out the conduct expect from he as a good member perhaps some hint be give as to betrayal of confidence boswell seem at any rate to have have a certain reserve in repeat club talk this intimacy with johnson be about to receive a more public and even more impressive stamp the antipathy to scotland and the scotch already notice be one of johnson 's most notorious crotchet the origin of the prejudice be forget by johnson himself though he be willing to accept a theory start by old sheridan that it be resentment for the betrayal of charle i there be however nothing surprising in johnson 's partaking a prejudice common enough from the day of he youth when each people suppose itself to have be cheat by the union and englishman resent the advent of swarm of needy adventurer talk with a strange accent and hang together with honorable but vexatious persistence johnson be irritated by what be after all a natural defense against english prejudice he declare that the scotch be always ready to lie on each other 's behalf the irish he say be not in a conspiracy to cheat the world by false representation of the merit of they countryman no sir the irish be a fair people they never speak well of one another there be another difference he always express a generous resentment against the tyranny exercise by english ruler over the irish people to some one who defend the restriction of irish trade for the good of english merchant he say sir you talk the language of a savage what sir would you prevent any people from feed themselves if by any honest means they can do it it be better to hang or drown people at once than weaken they by unrelent persecution he feel some tenderness for catholic especially when oppress and a hearty antipathy towards prosperous presbyterian the lowland scotch be typify by john knox in regard to whom he express a hope after view the ruin of st andrew 's that he be bury in the highway this sturdy british and high church prejudice do not prevent the worthy doctor from have many warm friendship with scotchman and help many distressed scotchman in london most of the amanuensis employ for he _ dictionary _ be scotch but he nourish the prejudice the more as give a excellent pretext for many keen gibe scotch learning he say for example be like bread in a besiege town every man get a mouthful but no man a bellyful once strahan say in answer to some abusive remark well sir god make scotland certainly reply johnson but we must always remember that he make it for scotchman and comparison be odious mr strahan but god make hell boswell therefore have reason to feel both triumph and alarm when he induce the great man to accompany he in a scotch tour boswell 's journal of the tour appear soon after johnson 's death johnson himself write a account of it which be not without interest though it be in he dignified style which do not condescend to boswellian touch of character in 1773 the scotch highland be still a little known region justify a book descriptive of manners and custom and touch upon antiquity now the commonplace of innumerable guide book scott be still a infant and the day of enthusiasm real or affect for mountain scenery have not yet dawn neither of the traveller as boswell remark care much for rural beauty johnson say quaintly on the shore of loch ness it will very readily occur that this uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller that it be easy to sit at home and conceive rock and heath and waterfall and that these journey be useless labor which neither impregnate the imagination nor enlarge the understanding and though he shortly afterwards sit down on a bank such as a writer of romance might have delight to feign and there conceive the thought of he book he do not seem to have feel much enthusiasm he check boswell for describe a hill as immense and tell he that it be only a considerable protuberance indeed it be not surprising if he sometimes grow weary in long ride upon highland pony or if when weatherbound in a remote village in skye he declare that this be a waste of life on the whole however johnson bear he fatigue well preserve he temper and make sensible remark upon man and thing the pair start from edinburgh in the middle of August 1773 they go north along the eastern coast through st andrew 's aberdeen banff fort george and inverness there they take to horse ride to glenelg and take boat for skye where they land on the 2nd of September they visit rothsay col mull and iona and after some dangerous sailing get to the mainland at oban on October 2nd thence they proceed by inverary and loch lomond to glasgow and after pay a visit to boswell 's paternal mansion at auchinleck in ayrshire return to edinburgh in November it be too long to narrate they adventure at length or to describe in detail how johnson grieve over trace of the iconoclastic zeal of knox 's disciple seriously investigate story of second-sight cross-examined and brow-beat credulous believer in the authenticity of _ ossian _ and feel he piety grow warm among the ruin of iona once or twice when the temper of the traveller be try by the various worry incident to they position poor boswell come in for some severe blow but he be happy feeling as he remark like a dog who have run away with a large piece of meat and be devour it peacefully in a corner by himself boswell 's spirit be irrepressible on hear a drum beat for dinner at fort george he say with a pepys-like touch i for a little while fancied myself a military man and it please I he get scandalously drunk on one occasion and show reprehensible levity on other he bore johnson by inquire too curiously into he reason for not wear a nightcap -- a subject which seem to have interested he profoundly he permit himself to say in he journal that he be so much pleased with some pretty lady ' maid at the duke of argyll 's that he feel he could have be a knight-errant for they and he venerable fellow-traveller read the passage without censure he levity the great man himself could be equally volatile i _ have often think _ he observe one day to boswell 's amusement that if i keep a seraglio the lady should all wear linen gown -- as more cleanly the pair agree in try to stimulate the feudal zeal of various highland chief with whom they come in contact and who be unreasonable enough to show a hankering after the luxury of civilization though johnson seem to have be generally on he best behavior he have a rough encounter or two with some of the more civilized native boswell pilot he safely through a visit to lord monboddo a man of real ability though the proprietor of crochet as eccentric as johnson 's and consequently divide from he by strong mutual prejudice at auchinleck he be less fortunate the old laird who be the staunchest of whig have not relish he son 's hero-worship there be na hope for jamie mon jamie be gaen clean gyte what do you think mon he be do wus ' paolus -- he be off wus ' the land-louping scoundrel of a corsican and who be tail do you think he be pin himself to now mon here say sir walter scott the authority for the story the old judge summon up a sneer of most sovereign contempt ' a dominie mon -- a auld dominie -- he keep a schule and caauld it a acaademy ' the two manage to keep the peace till one day during johnson 's visit they get upon oliver cromwell boswell suppress the scene with obvious reluctance he openness be check for once by filial respect scott have fortunately preserve the climax of old boswell 's argument what have cromwell do for he country ask johnson god doctor he gart king ken that they have a _ lith _ in they neck retort the laird in a phrase worthy of mr carlyle himself scott report one other scene at which respectable commentator like croker hold up they hand in horror should we regret or rejoice to say that it involve a obvious inaccuracy the authority however be too good to allow we to suppose that it be without some foundation adam smith it be say meet johnson at glasgow and have a altercation with he about the well-known account of hume 's death as hume do not die till three year later there must be some error in this the dispute however whatever its date or subject end by johnson say to smith _ you lie _ and what do you reply be ask of smith i say ` you be a son of a ----- ' on such term say scott do these two great moralist meet and part and such be the classical dialogue between these two great teacher of morality in the year 1774 boswell find it expedient to atone for he long absence in the previous year by stay at home johnson manage to complete he account of the _ scotch tour _ which be publish at the end of the year among other consequence be a violent controversy with the lover of _ ossian _ johnson be a thorough sceptic as to the authenticity of the book he scepticism do not repose upon the philological or antiquarian reasoning which would be applicable in the controversy from internal evidence it be to some extent the expression of a general incredulity which astonish he friend especially when contrast with he tenderness for many puerile superstition he could scarcely be induce to admit the truth of any narrative which strike he as odd and it be long for example before he would believe even in the lisbon earthquake yet he seriously discuss the truth of second-sight he carefully investigate the cock-lane ghost -- a goblin who anticipate some of the modern phenomenon of so-called spiritualism and with almost equal absurdity he tell story to boswell about a shadowy be which have once be see by cave and declare that he have once hear he mother call sam when he be at oxford and she at lichfield the apparent inconsistency be in truth natural enough any man who cling with unreasonable pertinacity to the prejudice of he childhood must be alternately credulous and sceptical in excess in both case he judge by he fancy in defiance of evidence and accept and reject accord to he likes and dislike instead of he estimate of logical proof _ ossian _ would be naturally offensive to johnson as one of the earliest and most remarkable manifestation of that grow taste for what be call nature as oppose to civilization of which rousseau be the great mouthpiece nobody more heartily despise this form of cant than johnson a man who utterly despise the scenery of the hebride as compare with greenwich park or charing cross would hardly take kindly to the ossianesque version of the mountain passion the book strike he as sheer rubbish i have already quote the retort about many man many woman and many child a man he say on another occasion might write such stuff for ever if he would abandon he mind to it the precise point however upon which he rest he case be the tangible one of the inability of macpherson to produce the manuscript of which he have affirm the existence macpherson write a furious letter to johnson of which the purport can only be infer from johnson 's smash retort -- mr jame macpherson i have receive you foolish and impudent letter any violence offer I i shall do my best to repel and what i can not do for myself the law shall do for I i hope i shall never be deter from detect what i think a cheat by the menace of a ruffian what would you have I retract i think you book a imposture : i think it a imposture still for this opinion i have give my reason to the public which i here dare you to refute you rage i defy you ability since you _ homer _ be not so formidable and what i hear of you moral incline I to pay regard not to what you shall say but to what you shall prove you may print this if you will sam johnson and so lay in a tremendous cudgel the old gentleman -lrb- he be now sixty-six -rrb- await the assault which however be not deliver in 1775 boswell again come to london and renew some of the scotch discussion he attend a meeting of the literary club and find the member dispose to laugh at johnson 's tenderness to the story about second-sight boswell heroically avow he own belief the evidence he say be enough for I though not for he great mind what will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle i be fill with belief be you say colman then cork it up it be during this and the next few year that boswell labor most successfully in gather material for he book in 1777 he only meet johnson in the country in 1779 for some unexplained reason he be lazy in make note in 1780 and 1781 he be absent from london and in the following year johnson be visibly decline the tenor of johnson 's life be interrupt during this period by no remarkable incident and he literary activity be not great although the composition of the _ life of the poet _ fall between 1777 and 1780 he mind however as represent by he talk be in full vigor i will take in order of time a few of the passage record by boswell which may serve for various reason to afford the best illustration of he character yet it may be worth while once more to repeat the warning that such fragment move from they context must lose most of they charm on march 26th -lrb- 1775 -rrb- boswell meet johnson at the house of the publisher strahan strahan remind johnson of a characteristic remark which he have formerly make that there be few way in which a man can be more innocently employ than in get money on another occasion johnson observe with equal truth if less originality that cultivate kindness be a important part of life as well as money-making johnson then ask to see a country lad whom he have recommend to strahan as a apprentice he ask for five guinea on account that he might give one to the boy nay if a man recommend a boy and do nothing for he it be sad work a little thick short-legged boy be accordingly bring into the courtyard whither johnson and boswell descend and the lexicographer bend himself down administer some good advice to the awestruck lad with slow and sonorous solemnity end by the presentation of the guinea in the evening the pair form part of a corps of party wit lead by sir joshua reynold to the benefit of mr abingdon who have be a frequent model of the painter johnson praise garrick 's prologue and boswell kindly report the eulogy to garrick with whom he sup at beauclerk 's garrick treat he to a mimicry of johnson repeat with pause and half-whistle the line -- os hominus sublime dedit -- coelumque tuerus jussit -- et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus : look downward and at the end touch the ground with a contorted gesticulation garrick be generally jealous of johnson 's light opinion of he and use to take off he old master say davy have some convivial pleasantry about he but ` tis a futile fellow next day at thrale ' johnson fall foul of gray one of he pet aversion boswell deny that gray be dull in poetry sir reply johnson he be dull in company dull in he closet dull everywhere he be dull in a new way and that make people think he great he be a mechanical poet he proceed to say that there be only two good stanza in the _ elegy _ johnson 's criticism be perverse but if we be to collect a few of the judgment pass by contemporary upon each other it would be scarcely exceptional in its want of appreciation it be rather odd to remark that gray be generally condemn for obscurity -- a charge which seem strangely out of place when he be measure by more recent standard a day or two afterwards some one rally johnson on he appearance at mr abingdon 's benefit why do you go he ask do you see no sir do you hear no sir why then sir do you go because sir she be a favorite of the public and when the public care the thousandth part for you that it do for she i will go to you benefit too the day after boswell win a bet from lady di beauclerk by venture to ask johnson what he do with the orange-peel which he use to pocket johnson receive the question amicably but do not clear the mystery then say boswell the world must be leave in the dark it must be say he scrape they and he let they dry but what he do with they next he never could be prevail upon to tell nay sir reply johnson you should say it more emphatically -- he could not be prevail upon even by he dearest friend to tell this year johnson receive the degree of lld from oxford he have previously -lrb- in 1765 -rrb- receive the same honor from dublin it be remarkable however that familiar as the title have become johnson call himself plain mr to the end of he day and be generally so call by he intimate on April 2nd at a dinner at hoole 's johnson make another assault upon gray and mason when boswell say that there be good passage in mason 's _ elfrida _ he concede that there be now and then some good imitation of milton 's bad manner after some more talk boswell speak of the cheerfulness of fleet street why sir say johnson fleet street have a very animated appearance but i think that the full tide of human existence be at chare cross he add a story of a eminent tallow-chandler who have make a fortune in london and be foolish enough to retire to the country he grow so tired of he retreat that he beg to know the melting-day of he successor that he might be present at the operation on April 7th they dine at a tavern where the talk turn upon _ ossian _ some one mention as a objection to its authenticity that no mention of wolf occur in it johnson fall into a reverie upon wild beast and whilst reynold and langton be discuss something he break out pennant tell of bear what pennant tell be unknown the company continue to talk whilst johnson continue he monologue the word bear occur at interval like a word in a catch at last when a pause come he be go on : we be tell that the black bear be innocent but i should not like to trust myself with he gibbon mutter in a low tone i should not like to trust myself with _ you _ -- a prudent resolution say honest boswell who hate gibbon if it refer to a competition of ability the talk go on to patriotism and johnson lay down a apophthegm at which many will start many people in fact have little sense of humor such person may be remind for they comfort that at this period patriot have a technical meaning patriotism be the last refuge of a scoundrel on the 10th of April he lay down another dogma calculate to offend the weaker brethren he defend pope 's line -- man never _ be _ but always _ to be _ blest and be ask if man do not sometimes enjoy a momentary happiness reply never but when he be drunk it would be useless to defend these and other such utterance to any one who can not enjoy they without defense on April 11th the pair go in reynold 's coach to dine with cambridge at twickenham johnson be in high spirit he remark as they drive down upon the rarity of good humor in life one friend mention by boswell be he say _ acid _ and another _ muddy _ at last stretch himself and turn with complacency he observe i look upon myself as a good-humoured fellow -- a bit of self-esteem against which boswell protest johnson he admit be good-natured but be too irascible and impatient to be good-humoured on reach cambridge 's house johnson run to look at the book mr johnson say cambridge politely i be go with you pardon to accuse myself for i have the same custom which i perceive you have but it seem odd that one should have such a desire to look at the back of book sir reply johnson wheeling about at the word the reason be very plain knowledge be of two kind we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it when we inquire into any subject the first thing we have to do be to know what book have treat of it this lead we to look at catalogue and the back of book in library a pleasant talk follow johnson deny the value attribute to historical reading on the ground that we know very little except a few fact and date all the color he say be conjectural boswell chuckle over the reflection that gibbon who be present do not take up the cudgel for he favorite study though the first-fruit of he labor be to appear in the following year probably he do not like to trust himself with johnson the conversation presently turn upon the _ beggar 's opera _ and johnson sensibly refuse to believe that any man have be make a rogue by see it yet the moralist feel bind to utter some condemnation of such a performance and at last amidst the smother amusement of the company collect himself to give a heavy stroke : there be in it he say such a _ labefactation _ of all principle as may he dangerous to morality a discussion follow as to whether sheridan be right for refuse to allow he wife to continue as a public singer johnson defend he with all the high spirit of a roman senator he resolve wisely and nobly to be sure he be a brave man would not a gentleman be disgrace by have he wife sing publicly for hire no sir there can be no doubt here i know not if i should not prepare myself for a public singer as readily as let my wife be one the stout old supporter of social authority go on to denounce the politics of the day he assert that politics have come to mean nothing but the art of rise in the world he contrast the absence of any principle with the state of the national mind during the stormy day of the seventeenth century this give the pith of johnston 's political prejudice he hate whig blindly from he cradle but he justify he hatred on the ground that they be now all bottomless whig that be to say that pierce where you would you come upon no definite creed but only upon hollow formula intend as a cloak for private interest if burke and one or two of he friend be except the remark have but too much justice in 1776 boswell find johnson rejoice in the prospect of a journey to italy with the thrale before start he be to take a trip to the country in which boswell agree to join boswell gather up various bit of advice before they departure one seem to have commend itself to he as specially available for practice a man who have be drink freely say the moralist should never go into a new company he would probably strike they as ridiculous though he might be in unison with those who have be drink with he johnson propound another favorite theory a ship he say be worse than a gaol there be in a gaol better air better company better conveniency of every kind and a ship have the additional disadvantage of be in danger on march 19th they go by coach to the angel at oxford and next morning visit the master of university college who choose with boswell to act in opposition to a very sound bit of advice give by johnson soon afterwards -- perhaps with some reference to the proceeding never speak of a man in he own presence it be always indelicate and may be offensive the two however discuss johnson without reserve the master say that he would have give johnson a hundred pound for a discourse on the british constitution and boswell suggest that johnson should write two volume of no great bulk upon church and state which should comprise the whole substance of the argument he should erect a fort on the confines of each johnson be not unnaturally displeased with the dialogue and growl out why should i be always write presently they go to see dr adam the doctor 's old friend who have be answer hume boswell who have do he best to court the acquaintance of voltaire rousseau wilke and hume himself feel it desirable to reprove adam for have meet hume with civility he air he admirable sentiment in a long speech observe upon the connexion between theory and practice and remark by way of practical application that if a infidel be at once vain and ugly he might be compare to cicero 's beautiful image of virtue -- which would as he seem to think be a crush retort boswell always delighted in fight with he gigantic backer close behind he johnson as he have doubtless expect chime in with the argument you should do you best say johnson to diminish the authority as well as dispute the argument of you adversary because most people be bias more by personal respect than by reasoning you would not jostle a chimney-sweeper say adam yes reply johnson if it be necessary to jostle he down the pair proceed by post-chaise past blenheim and dine at a good inn at chapelhouse johnston boast of the superiority long since vanish if it ever exist of english to french inn and quote with great emotion shenstone 's line -- whoe'er have travell would life 's dull round where'er he stage may have be must sigh to think he still have find the warmest welcome at a inn as they drive along rapidly in the post-chaise he exclaim life have not many better thing than this on another occasion he say that he should like to spend he life drive briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman clever enough to add to the conversation the pleasure be partly owe to the fact that he deafness be less troublesome in a carriage but he admit that there be drawback even to this pleasure boswell ask he whether he would not add a post-chaise journey to the other sole cause of happiness -- namely drunkenness no sir say johnson you be drive rapidly _ from _ something or _ to _ something they go to birmingham where boswell pump hector about johnson 's early day and see the work of boulton watt 's partner who say to he i sell here sir what all the world desire to have -- _ power _ thence they go to lichfield and meet more of the rapidly thin circle of johnson 's oldest friend here boswell be a little scandalize by johnson 's warm exclamation on open a letter -- one of the most dreadful thing that have happen in my time this turn out to be the death of thrale 's only son boswell think the phrase too big for the event and be some time before he could feel a proper concern he be however curious to observe how dr johnson would be affect and be again a little scandalize by the reply to he consolatory remark that the thrale still have daughter sir say johnson do not you know how you yourself think sir he wish to propagate he name the great man be actually put the family sentiment of a brewer in the same category with the sentiment of the heir of auchinleck johnson however calm down but resolve to hurry back to london they stay a night at taylor 's who remark that he have fight a good many battle for a physician one of they common friend but you should consider sir say johnson that by every one of you victory he be a loser for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry and resolve not to employ he whereas if people get the better of you in argument about he they will think ` we 'll send for dr -- nevertheless ' it be after they return to london that boswell win the greatest triumph of he friendship he carry through a negotiation to which as burke pleasantly say there be nothing equal in the whole history of the _ corps diplomatique _ at some moment of enthusiasm it have occur to he to bring johnson into company with wilke the infidel demagogue be probably in the mind of the tory high churchman when he throw out that pleasant little apophthegm about patriotism to bring together two such opposite without provoke a collision would be the crowning triumph of boswell 's curiosity he be ready to run all hazard as a chemist might try some new experiment at the risk of a destructive explosion but be resolve he take every precaution with admirable foresight boswell have be invite by the dilly well-known bookseller of the day to meet wilke let we have johnson suggest the gallant boswell not for the world exclaim dilly but on boswell 's undertake the negotiation he consent to the experiment boswell go off to johnson and politely invite he in dilly 's name i will wait upon he say johnson provide sir i suppose say the diplomatic boswell that the company which he be to have be agreeable to you what do you mean sir exclaimed johnson what do you take I for do you think i be so ignorant of the world as to prescribe to a gentleman what company he be to have at he table boswell work the point a little farther till by judicious manipulation he have get johnson to commit himself to meet anybody -- even jack wilke to make a wild hypothesis -- at the dilly ' table boswell retire hope to think that he have fix the discussion in johnson 's mind the great day arrive and boswell like a consummate general who leave nothing to chance go himself to fetch johnson to the dinner the great man have forget the engagement and be buffet he book in a dirty shirt and amidst cloud of dust when remind of he promise he say that he have order dinner at home with mr william entreaty of the warmest kind from boswell soften the peevish old lady to whose pleasure johnson have refer he boswell fly back announce mr william 's consent and johnson roar frank a clean shirt and be soon in a hackney-coach boswell rejoice like a fortune-hunter who have get a heiress into a post-chaise with he to set out for gretna green yet the joy be with tremble arrive at dilly ' johnson find himself amongst stranger and boswell watch anxiously from a corner who be that gentleman whisper johnson to dilly mr arthur lee johnson whistle too-too-too doubtfully for lee be a patriot and a american and who be the gentleman in lace mr wilke sir johnson subside into a window-seat and fix he eye on a book he be fairly in the toil he reproof of boswell be recent enough to prevent he from exhibit he displeasure and he resolve to restrain himself at dinner wilke place next to johnson take up he part in the performance he pacify the sturdy moralist by delicate attention to he need he help he carefully to some fine veal pray give I leave sir it be better here -- a little of the brown -- some fat sir -- a little of the stuffing -- some gravy -- let I have the pleasure of give you some butter allow I to recommend a squeeze of this orange or the lemon perhaps may have more zest sir sir cry johnson i be oblige to you sir bow and turn to he with a look for some time of surly virtue and soon of complacency gradually the conversation become cordial johnson tell of the fascination exercise by foote who like wilke have succeed in please he against he will foote once take to sell beer and it be so bad that the servant of fitzherbert one of he customer resolve to protest they choose a little black boy to carry they remonstrance but the boy wait at table one day when foote be present and return to he companion say this be the finest man i have ever see i will not deliver you message i will drink he beer from foote the transition be easy to garrick whom johnson as usual defend against the attack of other he maintain that garrick 's reputation for avarice though unfounded have be rather useful than otherwise you despise a man for avarice but you do not hate he the clamor would have be more effectual have it be direct against he live with splendor too great for a player johnson go on to speak of the difficulty of get biographical information when he have wish to write a life of dryden he apply to two live man who remember he one could only tell he that dryden have a chair by the fire at will 's coffee-house in winter which be move to the balcony in summer the other -lrb- cibber -rrb- could only report that he remember dryden as a decent old man arbiter of critical dispute at will 's johnson and wilke have one point in common -- a vigorous prejudice against the scotch and upon this topic they crack they joke in friendly emulation when they meet upon a later occasion -lrb- 1781 -rrb- they still pursue this inexhaustible subject wilke tell how a privateer have completely plunder seven scotch island and re-embarked with three and sixpence johnson now remark in answer to somebody who say poor old england be lose sir it be not so much to be lament that old england be lose as that the scotch have find it you must know sir he say to wilke that i lately take my friend boswell and show he genuine civilized life in a english provincial town i turn he loose at lichfield that he might see for once real civility for you know he live among savage in scotland and among rake in london except say wilke when he be with grave sober decent people like you and I and we ashamed of he add johnson smile boswell have to bear some joke against himself and he countryman from the pair but he have triumph and rejoice greatly when he go home with johnson and hear the great man speak of he pleasant dinner to mr william johnson seem to have be permanently reconcile to he foe do we not hear so much say of jack wilke he remark next year we should think more highly of he conversation jack have a great variety of talk jack be a scholar and jack have the manners of a gentleman but after hear he name sound from pole to pole as the phoenix of convivial felicity we be disappoint in he company he have always be at _ I _ but i would do jack a kindness rather than not the contest be now over in fact wilke have cease to play any part in public life when johnson meet he next -lrb- in 1781 -rrb- they joke about such dangerous topic as some of wilke 's political performance johnson send he a copy of the _ live _ and they be see converse _ tête-à-tête _ in confidential whisper about george ii and the king of prussium to boswell 's mind it suggest the happy day when the lion should lie down with the kid or as dr barnard suggest the goat in the year 1777 johnson begin the _ life of the poet _ in compliance with a request from the bookseller who wish for preface to a large collection of english poetry johnson ask for this work the extremely modest sum of 200 guinea when he might easily accord to malone have receive 1000 or 1500 he do not meet boswell till September when they spend ten day together at dr taylor 's the subject which specially interested boswell at this time be the fate of the unlucky dr dodd hang for forgery in the previous June dodd seem to have be a worthless charlatan of the popular preacher variety he crime would not in we day have be think worthy of so severe a punishment but he contemporary be less shock by the fact of death be inflict for such a fault than by the fact of its be inflict on a clergyman johnson exert himself to procure a remission of the sentence by write various letter and petition on dodd 's behalf he seem to have be deeply move by the man 's appeal and could not bear the thought that any negligence of he should lead to the death of a fellow-creature but he say that if he have himself be in authority he would have sign the death-warrant and for the man himself he have as little respect as might be he say indeed that dodd be right in not join in the cant about leave a wretched world no no say the poor rogue it have be a very agreeable world to I dodd have allow to pass for he own one of the papers compose for he by johnson and the doctor be not quite pleased when however seward express a doubt as to dodd 's power of write so forcibly johnson feel bind not to expose he why should you think so depend upon it sir when any man know he be to be hang in a fortnight it concentrate he mind wonderfully on another occasion johnson express a doubt himself as to whether dodd have really compose a certain prayer on the night before he execution sir do you think that a man the night before he be to be hang care for the succession of the royal family though he _ may _ have compose this prayer then a man who have be cant all he life may cant to the last and yet a man who have be refuse a pardon after so much petition would hardly be pray thus fervently for the king the last day at taylor 's be characteristic johnson be very cordial to he disciple and boswell fancy that he could defend he master at the point of he sword my regard for you say johnson be greater almost than i have word to express but i do not choose to be always repeat it write it down in the first leaf of you pocket-book and never doubt of it again they become sentimental and talk of the misery of human life boswell speak of the pleasure of society alas sir reply johnson like a true pessimist these be only struggle for happiness he feel exhilarated he say when he first go to ranelagh but he change to the mood of xerx weep at the sight of he army it go to my heart to consider that there be not one in all that brilliant circle that be not afraid to go home and think but that the thought of each individual would be distressing when alone some year before he have go with boswell to the pantheon and take a more cheerful view when boswell doubt whether there be many happy people present he say yes sir there be many happy people here there be many people here who be watch hundred and who think hundred be watch they the more permanent feeling be that which he express in the serene autumn night in taylor 's garden he be willing however to talk calmly about eternal punishment and to admit the possibility of a mitigate interpretation after supper he dictate to boswell a argument in favor of the negro who be then claim he liberty in scotland he hate slavery with a zeal which the excellent boswell think to be without knowledge and on one occasion give as a toast to some very grave man at oxford here be to the next insurrection of negro in the west indy the hatred be combine with as hearty a dislike for american independence how be it he say that we always hear the loudest yelp for liberty amongst the driver of negro the harmony of the evening be unluckily spoil by a explosion of this prejudice boswell undertake the defense of the colonist and the discussion become so fierce that though johnson have express a willingness to sit up all night with he they be glad to part after a hour or two and go to bed in 1778 boswell come to london and find johnson absorb to a extent which apparently excite he jealousy by he intimacy with the thrale they have however several agreeable meeting one be at the club and boswell 's report of the conversation be the fullest that we have of any of its meeting a certain reserve be indicate by he use initial for the interlocutor of whom however one can be easily identify as burke the talk begin by a discussion of a antique statue say to be the dog of alcibiade and value at 1000_l _ burke say that the representation of no animal could be worth so much johnson whose taste for art be a vanish quantity say that the value be proportional to the difficulty a statue as he argue on another occasion would be worth nothing if it be cut out of a carrot everything he now say be valuable which enlarged the sphere of human power the first man who balance a straw upon he nose or ride upon three horse at once deserve the applause of mankind and so statue of animal should be preserve as a proof of dexterity though man should not continue such fruitless labor the conversation become more instructive under the guidance of burke he maintain what seem to he hearer a paradox though it would be interesting to hear he argument from some profounder economist than boswell that a country would be make more populous by emigration there be bull enough in ireland he remark incidentally in the course of the argument so sir i should think from you argument say johnson for once condescend to a irresistible pun it be record too that he once make a bull himself observe that a horse be so slow that when it go up hill it stand still if he now fail to appreciate burke 's argument he make one good remark another speaker say that unhealthy country be the most populous country which be the most populous reply johnson have the most destructive disease that be the true state of the proposition and indeed the remark apply to the case of emigration a discussion then take place as to whether it would be worth while for burke to take so much trouble with speech which never decide a vote burke reply that a speech though it do not gain one vote would have a influence and maintain that the house of common be not wholly corrupt we be all more or less govern by interest be johnson 's comment but interest will not do everything in a case which admit of doubt we try to think on the side which be for we interest and generally bring ourselves to act accordingly but the subject must admit of diversity of color it must receive a color on that side in the house of common there be member enough who will not vote what be grossly absurd and unjust no sir there must always be right enough or appearance of right to keep wrong in countenance after some deviation the conversation return to this point johnson and burke agree on a characteristic statement burke say that from he experience he have learn to think better of mankind from my experience reply johnson i have find they worse on commercial dealings more disposed to cheat than i have any notion of but more disposed to do one another good than i have conceive less just and more beneficent as another speaker suggest johnson proceed to say that consider the pressure of want it be wonderful that man would do so much for each other the greatest liar be say to speak more truth than falsehood and perhaps the worst man might do more good than not but when boswell suggest that perhaps experience might increase we estimate of human happiness johnson return to he habitual pessimism no sir the more we inquire the more we shall find man less happy the talk soon wander off into a disquisition upon the folly of deliberately test the strength of we friend 's affection the evening end by johnson accept a commission to write to a friend who have give to the club a hogshead of claret and to request another with a happy ambiguity of expression in the hope that it might also be a present some day afterwards another conversation take place which have a certain celebrity in boswellian literature the scene be at dilly 's and the guest include miss seward and mr knowle a well-known quaker lady before dinner johnson seize upon a book which he keep in he lap during dinner wrap up in the table-cloth he attention be not distract from the various business of the hour but he hit upon a topic which happily combine the two appropriate vein of thought he boast that he would write a cookery-book upon philosophical principle and declare in opposition to miss seward that such a task be beyond the sphere of woman perhaps this lead to a discussion upon the privilege of man in which johnson put down mr knowle who have some hankering for woman 's rights by the shakspearian maxim that if two man ride on a horse one must ride behind drive from she position in this world poor mr knowle hope that sex might be equal in the next boswell reprove she by the remark already quote that man might as well expect to be equal to angel he enforce this view by a illustration suggest by the rev mr brown of utrecht who have observe that a great or small glass might be equally full though not hold equal quantity mr brown intend this for a confutation of hume who have say that a little miss dress for a ball may be as happy as a orator who have win some triumphant success -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : boswell remark as a curious coincidence that the same illustration have be use by a dr king a dissent minister doubtless it have be use often enough for one instance see _ donne 's sermon _ -lrb- alford 's edition -rrb- vol i p 5 -rrb- the conversation thus take a theological turn and mr knowle be fortunate enough to win johnson 's high approval he defend a doctrine maintain by soame jenyn that friendship be a christian virtue mr knowle remark that jesus have twelve disciple but there be _ one _ whom he _ loved _ johnson with eye sparkling benignantly exclaim very well indeed madam you have say very well so far all have go smoothly but here for some inexplicable reason johnson burst into a sudden fury against the american rebel whom he describe as rascal robber pirate and roar out a tremendous volley which might almost have be audible across the atlantic boswell sit and tremble but gradually divert the sage to less exciting topic the name of jonathan edward suggest a discussion upon free will and necessity upon which poor boswell be much give to worry himself some time afterwards johnson write to he in answer to one of he lamentation : i hope you have get rid of all this hypocrisy of misery what have you to do with liberty and necessity or what more than to hold you tongue about it boswell could never take this sensible advice but he get little comfort from he oracle we know that we be all free and there be a end o not be he statement on one occasion and now he could only say all theory be against the freedom of the will and all experience for it some familiar topic follow which play a great part in boswell 's report among the favorite topic of the sentimentalist of the day be the denunciation of luxury and of civilized life in general there be a disposition to find in the south sea savage or american indian a embodiment of the fancied state of nature johnson heartily despise the affectation he be tell of a american woman who have to be bind in order to keep she from savage life she must have be a animal a beast say boswell sir say johnson she be a speaking cat somebody quote to he with admiration the soliloquy of a officer who have live in the wild of america : here be i free and unrestrained amidst the rude magnificence of nature with the indian woman by my side and this gun with which i can procure food when i want it what more can be desire for human happiness do not allow yourself sir reply johnson to be impose upon by such gross absurdity it be sad stuff it be brutish if a bull could speak he might as well exclaim ` here be i with this cow and this grass what being can enjoy greater felicity ' when johnson implore boswell to clear he mind of cant he be attack he disciple for affect a serious depression about public affair but the cant which he hate would certainly have include as its first article a admiration for the state of nature on the present occasion johnson defend luxury and say that he have learn much from mandeville -- a shrewd cynic in whom johnson 's hatred for humbug be exaggerate into a general disbelief in real as well as sham nobleness of sentiment as the conversation proceed johnson express he habitual horror of death and cause miss seward 's ridicule by talk seriously of ghost and the importance of the question of they reality and then follow a explosion which seem to have close this characteristic evening a young woman have become a quaker under the influence of mr knowle who now proceed to deprecate johnson 's wrath at what he regard as a apostasy madam he say she be a odious wench and he proceed to denounce she audacity in presume to choose a religion for herself she know no more of the point of difference he say than of the difference between the copernican and ptolemaic system when mr knowle say that she have the new testament before she he say that it be the most difficult book in the world and he proceed to attack the unlucky proselyte with a fury which shock the two lady mr knowle afterwards publish a report of this conversation and obtain another report with which however she be not satisfy from miss seward both of they represent the poor doctor as hopelessly confute by the mild dignity and calm reason of mr knowle though the triumph be paint in far the brightest color by mr knowle herself unluckily there be not a trace of johnson 's manner except in one phrase in either report and they be chiefly curious as a indirect testimony to boswell 's superior power the passage in which both the lady agree be that johnson on the expression of mr knowle 's hope that he would meet the young lady in another world retort that he be not fond of meeting fool anywhere poor boswell be at this time a water-drinker by johnson 's recommendation though unluckily for himself he never break off he drinking habit for long they have a conversation at paolus 's in which boswell argue against he present practice johnson remark that wine give a man nothing but only put in motion what have be lock up in frost it be a key suggest some one which open a box but the box might be full or empty nay sir say johnson conversation be the key wine be a picklock which force open the box and injure it a man should cultivate he mind so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine which wine give boswell characteristically say that the great difficulty be from benevolence it be hard to refuse a good worthy man who ask you to try he cellar this accord to johnson be mere conceit imply a exaggerated estimate of you importance to you entertainer reynold gallantly take up the opposite side and produce the one record instance of a johnsonian blush i will not argue any more with you sir say johnson who think every man to be elevated who drink wine you be too far go i should have think so indeed sir have i make such a speech as you have now do say reynold and johnson apologize with the aforesaid blush the explosion be soon over on this occasion not long afterwards johnson attack boswell so fiercely at a dinner at reynold 's that the poor disciple keep away for a week they make it up when they meet next and johnson solace boswell 's wound vanity by highly commend a image make by he to express he feeling i do not care how often or how high johnson toss I when only friend be present for then i fall upon soft ground but i do not like fall on stone which be the case when enemy be present the phrase may recall one of johnson 's happiest illustration when some one say in he presence that a _ congé d'élire _ might be consider as only a strong recommendation : sir reply johnson it be such a recommendation as if i should throw you out of a two-pair of stair window and recommend you to fall soft it be perhaps time to cease these extract from boswell 's report the next two year be less fruitful in 1779 boswell be careless though twice in london and in 1780 he do not pay he annual visit boswell have partly fill up the gap by a collection of saying make by langton some passage from which have be quote and he correspondence give various detail garrick die in January of 1779 and beauclerk in march 1780 johnson himself seem to have show few symptom of increase age but a change be approach and the last year of he life be destine to be cloud not merely by physical weakness but by a change of circumstance which have great influence upon he happiness chapter v the closing year of johnson 's life in follow boswell 's guidance we have necessarily see only one side of johnson 's life and probably that side which have least significance for the man himself boswell saw in he chiefly the great dictator of conversation and though the report of johnson 's talk represent he character in spite of some qualification with unusual fulness there be many trait very inadequately reveal at the mitre or the club at mr thrale 's or in meeting with wilke or reynold we may catch some glimpse from he letter and diary of that inward life which consist generally in a long succession of struggle against a oppressive and often paralyse melancholy another most noteworthy side to he character be reveal in he relation to person too humble for admission to the table at which he exert a despotic sway upon this side johnson be almost entirely loveable we often have to regret the imperfection of the record of that best portion of a good man 's life he little nameless unremembered act of kindness and of love everywhere in johnson 's letter and in the occasional anecdote we come upon indication of a tenderness and untiring benevolence which would make we forgive far worse fault than have ever be lay to he charge nay the very asperity of the man 's outside become endear to we by the association he irritability never vent itself against the helpless and he rough impatience of fanciful trouble imply no want of sympathy for real sorrow one of mr thrale 's anecdote be intend to show johnson 's harshness : -- when i one day lament the loss of a first cousin kill in america ` pr ` ythee my dear ' say he ` have do with cant how would the world be the worse for it i may ask if all you relation be at once spit like lark and roasted for presto 's supper ' presto be the dog that lay under the table while we talk the counter version give by boswell be that mr thrale related she cousin 's death in the midst of a hearty supper and that johnson shock at she want of feeling say madam it would give _ you _ very little concern if all you relation be spit like those lark and roasted for presto 's supper take the most unfavourable version we may judge how much real indifference to human sorrow be imply by see how johnson be affect by a loss of one of he humblest friend it be but one case of many in 1767 he take leave as he note in he diary of he dear old friend catherine chamber who have be for about forty-three year in the service of he family i desire all to withdraw he say then tell she that we be to part for ever and as christian we should part with prayer and that i would if she be willing say a short prayer beside she she express great desire to hear I and hold up she poor hand as she lay in bed with great fervor while i prayed kneel by she in nearly the follow word -- which shall not be repeat here -- i then kiss she he add she tell I that to part be the greatest pain that she have ever feel and that she hope we should meet again in a better place i express with swell eye and great emotion of kindness the same hope we kiss and part -- i humbly hope to meet again and part no more a man with so true and tender a heart could say serenely what with some man would be a mere excuse for want of sympathy that he hate to hear people whine about metaphysical distress when there be so much want and hunger in the world he have a sound and righteous contempt for all affectation of excessive sensibility suppose say boswell to he whilst they common friend barettus be lie under a charge of murder that one of you intimate friend be apprehend for a offence for which he might be hang i should do what i could reply johnson to bail he and give he any other assistance but if he be once fairly hang i should not suffer would you eat you dinner that day sir ask boswell yes sir and eat it as if he be eat with I why there be barettus who be to be try for he life to-morrow friend have rise up for he upon every side yet if he should be hang none of they will eat a slice of plum-pudd the less sir that sympathetic feeling go a very little way in depress the mind boswell illustrate the subject by say that tom davy have just write a letter to foote tell he that he could not sleep from concern about barettus and at the same time recommend a young man who keep a pickle-shop johnson sum up by the remark : you will find these very feel people be not very ready to do you good they _ pay _ you by _ feeling _ johnson never object to feeling but to the waste of feeling in a similar vein he tell mr thrale that a surly fellow like himself have no compassion to spare for wound give to vanity and softness whilst witness the common sight of actual want in great city on lady tavistock 's death say to have be cause by grief for she husband 's loss he observe that she life might have be save if she have be put into a small chandler 's shop with a child to nurse when mr thrale suggest that a lady would be grieve because she friend have lose the chance of a fortune she will suffer as much perhaps he reply as you horse do when you cow miscarry mr thrale testify that he once reproach she sternly for complain of the dust when he know he say how many poor family would perish next winter for want of the bread which the drought would deny he could not bear to hear lady sigh for rain on account of they complexion or they clothes while report such saying she add that he love the poor as she never see any one else love they with a earnest desire to make they happy he charity be unbounded he propose to allow himself one hundred a year out of the three hundred of he pension but the thrale could never discover that he really spend upon himself more than 70_l _ or at most 80_l _ he have numerous dependant abroad as well as at home who do not like to see he latterly unless he bring 'em money he fill he pocket with small cash which he distribute to beggar in defiance of political economy when tell that the recipient only lay it out upon gin or tobacco he reply that it be savage to deny they the few coarse pleasure which the richer disdain numerous instance be give of more judicious charity when for example a benedictine monk whom he have see in pari become a protestant johnson support he for some month in london till he could get a living once come home late at night he find a poor woman lie in the street he carry she to he house on he back and find that she be reduce to the lowest stage of want poverty and disease he take care of she at he own charge with all tenderness until she be restore to health and try to have she put into a virtuous way of live he house in he later year be fill with various waif and stray to whom he give hospitality and sometimes support defend himself by say that if he do not help they nobody else would the head of he household be miss william who have be a friend of he wife 's and after come to stay with he in order to undergo a operation for cataract become a permanent inmate of he house she have a small income of some 40_l _ a year partly from the charity of connexion of she father 's and partly arise from a little book of miscellany publish by subscription she be a woman of some sense and cultivation and when she die -lrb- in 1783 -rrb- johnson say that for thirty year she have be to he as a sister boswell 's jealousy be excite during the first period of he acquaintance when goldsmith one night go home with johnson cry i go to miss william -- a phrase which imply admission to a intimacy from which boswell be as yet exclude boswell soon obtain the coveted privilege and testify to the respect with which johnson always treat the inmate of he family before leave she to dine with boswell at the hotel he ask she what little delicacy should be send to she from the tavern poor miss william however be peevish and accord to hawkin have be know to drive johnson out of the room by she reproach and boswell 's delicacy be shock by the supposition that she test the fulness of cup of tea by put she finger inside we be glad to know that this be a false impression and in fact miss william however unfortunate in temper and circumstance seem to have be a lady by manners and education the next inmate of this queer household be robert levett a man who have be a waiter at a coffee-house in pari frequent by surgeon they have enable he to pick up some of they art and he set up as a obscure practiser in physic amongst the lower people in london he take from they such fee as he could get include provision sometimes unfortunately for he of the potable kind he be once entrap into a queer marriage and johnson have to arrange a separation from he wife johnson it seem have a good opinion of he medical skill and more or less employ he service in that capacity he attend he patron at he breakfast breakfast say percy on the crust of a roll which johnson throw to he after tear out the crumb the phrase it be say go too far johnson always take pain that levett should be treat rather as a friend than as a dependant besides these humble friend there be a mr desmoulin the daughter of a lichfield physician johnson have have some quarrel with the father in he youth for reveal a confession of the mental disease which tortured he from early year he support mr desmoulin none the less give house-room to she and she daughter and make she a allowance of half-a-guinea a week a sum equal to a twelfth part of he pension franci barker have already be mention and we have a dim vision of a miss carmichael who complete what he facetiously call he seraglio it be anything but a happy family he sum up they relation in a letter to mr thrale william he say hate everybody levett hate desmoulin and do not love william desmoulin hate they both poll -lrb- miss carmichael -rrb- love none of they frank barker complain of miss william 's authority and miss william of frank 's insubordination intruder who have take refuge under he roof bring they child there in he absence and grumble if they dinner be ill-dressed the old man bear it all relieve himself by a occasional growl but reproach any who venture to join in the growl for they indifference to the suffering of poverty levett die in January 1782 miss william die after a linger illness in 1783 and johnson grieve in solitude for the loss of he testy companion a poem compose upon levett 's death record he feeling in language which want the refinement of goldsmith or the intensity of cowper 's pathos but which be yet so sincere and tender as to be more impressive than far more elegant composition it will be a fitting close to this brief indication of one side of johnson 's character too easily overlook in boswell 's page to quote part of what thackeray truly call the sacred verse upon levett : -- well try through many a vary year see levett to the grave descend officious innocent sincere of every friendless name the friend in misery 's darkest cavern know he ready help be ever nigh where hopeless anguish pour would he groan and lonely want retire to die no summons mock would by dull delay no petty gain disdain would by pride the modest want of every day the toil of every day supply he virtue walk would they narrow round nor make a pause nor leave a void and sure the eternal master find he single talent well employ the busy day the peaceful night unfelt uncounted glide by he frame be firm he eye be bright though now he eightieth year be nigh then with no throb of fiery pain no cold gradation of decay death break at once the vital chain and free he soul the easiest way the last stanza smell somewhat of the country tombstone but to read the whole and to realize the deep manly sentiment which it imply without tear in one 's eye be to I at least impossible there be one little touch which may be add before we proceed to the closing year of this tender-hearted old moralist johnson love little child call they little dear and cram they with sweetmeat though we regret to add that he once snub a little child rather severely for a want of acquaintance with the _ pilgrim 's progress _ he cat hodge should be famous amongst the lover of the race he use to go out and buy oyster for hodge that the servant might not take a dislike to the animal from have to serve it themselves he reproach he wife for beat a cat before the maid lest she should give a precedent for cruelty boswell who cherish a antipathy to cat suffer at see hodge scramble up johnson 's breast whilst he smile and rub the beast 's back and pull its tail bozzy remark that he be a fine cat why yes sir say johnson but i have have cat whom i like better than this and then lest hodge should be put out of countenance he add but he be a very fine cat a very fine cat indeed he tell langton once of a young gentleman who when last hear of be run about town shooting cat but he murmur in a kindly reverie hodge sha not be shoot no no hodge shall not be shoot once when johnson be stay at a house in wale the gardener bring in a hare which have be catch in the potato the order be give to take it to the cook johnson ask to have it place in he arm he take it to the window and let it go shout to increase its speed when he host complain that he have perhaps spoil the dinner johnson reply by insist that the rights of hospitality include a animal which have thus place itself under the protection of the master of the garden we must proceed however to a more serious event the year 1781 bring with it a catastrophe which profoundly affect the brief remainder of johnson 's life mr thrale whose health have be shake by fit die suddenly on the 4th of April the ultimate consequence be johnson 's loss of the second home in which he have so often find refuge from melancholy alleviation of physical suffering and pleasure in social converse the change do not follow at once but as the catastrophe of a little social drama upon the rights and wrong of which a good deal of controversy have be expend johnson be deeply affect by the loss of a friend whose face as he say have never be turn upon he through fifteen year but with respect and benignity he write solemn and affect letter to the widow and busy himself strenuously in she service thrale have make he one of he executor leave he a small legacy and johnson take it seem a rather simple-minded pleasure in deal with important commercial affair and sign cheque for large sum of money the old man of letter to whom three hundred a year have be superabundant wealth be amuse at find himself in the position of a man of business regulate what be then regard as a princely fortune the brewery be sell after a time and johnson bustle about with a ink-horn and pen in he button-hole when ask what be the value of the property he reply magniloquently we be not here to sell a parcel of boiler and vat but the potentiality of grow rich beyond the dream of avarice the brewery be in fact sell to barclay perkin and co for the sum of 135000_l _ and some year afterwards it be the largest concern of the kind in the world the first effect of the change be probably rather to tighten than to relax the bond of union with the thrale family during the winter of 1781-2 johnson 's infirmity be grow upon he in the beginning of 1782 he be suffer from a illness which excite serious apprehension and he go to mr thrale 's as the only house where he could use all the freedom that sickness require she nurse he carefully and express she feeling with characteristic vehemence in a curious journal which he have encourage she to keep it record she opinion about she affair and she family with a frankness remarkable even in write intend for no eye but she own here be mr johnson very ill she write on the 1st of February what shall we do for he if i lose _ he _ i be more than undo -- friend father guardian confidant god give I health and patience what shall i do there be no reason to doubt the sincerity of these sentiment though they seem to represent a mood of excitement they show that for ten month after thrale 's death mr thrale be keenly sensitive to the value of johnson 's friendship a change however be approach towards the end of 1780 mr thrale have make the acquaintance of a italian musician name piozzus a man of amiable and honorable character make a independent income by he profession but to the eye of most people rather inoffensive than specially attractive the friendship between mr thrale and piozzus rapidly become closer and by the end of 1781 she be on very intimate term with the gentleman whom she call my piozzus he have be make a professional trip to the continent during part of the period since she husband 's death and upon he return in November johnson congratulate she upon have two friend who love she in term which suggest no exist feeling of jealousy during 1782 the mutual affection of the lady and the musician become stronger and in the autumn they have avow it to each other and be discuss the question of marriage no one who have have some experience of life will be incline to condemn mr thrale for she passion rather the capacity for a passion not excite by a intrinsically unworthy object should increase we esteem for she she marriage with thrale have be as have be say one of convenience and though she bear he many child and do she duty faithfully she never love he towards the end of he life he have make she jealous by very marked attention to the pretty and sentimental sophy streatfield which once cause a scene at he table and during the last two year he mind have be weaken and he conduct have cause she anxiety and discomfort it be not surprising that she should welcome the warm and simple devotion of she new lover though she be of a ripe age and the mother of grown-up daughter it be however equally plain that a alliance with a foreign fiddler be certain to shock british respectability it be the old story of the quarrel between philistium and bohemia nor be respectability without much to say for itself piozzus be a catholic as well as a foreigner to marry he be in all probability to break with daughter just grow into womanhood whom it be obviously she first duty to protect the marriage therefore might be regard as not merely a revolt against conventional morality but as lead to a desertion of country religion and family she child she husband 's friend and she whole circle be certain to look upon the match with feeling of the strongest disapproval and she admit to herself that the objection be found upon something more weighty than a fear of the world 's censure johnson in particular among whose virtue one can not reckon a superiority to british prejudice would inevitably consider the marriage as simply degrade foresee this and wish to avoid the pain of reject advice which she feel unable to accept she refrain from retain she friend father and guardian in the position of confidant she situation in the summer of 1782 be therefore exceedingly try she be unhappy at home she child she complain do not love she she servant devour she she friend censure she and she expense be excessive whilst the loss of a lawsuit strain she resource johnson sickly suffering and descend into the gloom of approach decay be present like a charge thunder-cloud ready to burst at any moment if she allow he to approach the chief subject of she thought though not in love with mr thrale he have a very intelligible feeling of jealousy towards any one who threaten to distract she allegiance under such circumstance we might expect the state of thing which miss burney describe long afterwards -lrb- though with some confusion of date -rrb- mr thrale she say be absent and agitate restless in manner and hurry in speech force smile and avert she eye from she friend neglect every one include johnson and except only miss burney herself to whom the secret be confide and the situation therefore explain gradually accord to miss burney she become more petulant to johnson than she be herself aware give palpable hint of be worry by he company and finally excite he resentment and suspicion in one or two utterance though he doubtless feel the expedience of reserve he intrust he foreboding to miss burney and declare that streatham be lose to he for ever at last in the end of August the crisis come mr thrale 's lawsuit have go against she she think it desirable to go abroad and save money it have moreover be long she dearest wish to see italy with piozzus for a guide the one difficulty -lrb- as she say in she journal at the time -rrb- be that it seem equally hard to part with johnson or to take he with she till he have regain strength at last however she take courage to confide to he she plan for travel to she extreme annoyance he fully approve of they he advise she to go anticipate she return in two or three year and tell she daughter that he should not accompany they even if invite no behavior it may be admit could be more provoke than this unforeseen reasonableness to nerve oneself to part with a friend and to find the friend perfectly ready and all you battery of argument throw away be most vexatious the poor man should have beg she to stay with he or to take he with she he should have make the scene which she profess to dread but which would have be the best proof of she power the only conclusion which could really have satisfy she -- though she in all probability do not know it -- would have be a outburst which would have justify a rupture and allow she to protest against he tyranny as she now proceed to protest against he complacency johnson wish to go to italy two year later and he present willingness to be leave be probably cause by a grow sense of the danger which threaten they friendship mr thrale 's anger appear in she journal he have never really love she she declare he affection for she have be interested though even in she wrath she admit that he really love she husband he care less for she conversation which she have fancy necessary to he existence than for she roast beef and plumb pudden which he now devour too dirtily for endurance she be fully resolve to go and yet she could not bear that she going should fail to torture the friend whom for eighteen year she have love and cherish so kindly no one have a right at once to insist upon the compliance of he friend and to insist that it should be a painful compliance still mr thrale 's petulant outburst be natural enough it require notice because she subsequent account of the rupture have give rise to attack on johnson 's character she anecdote write in 1785 show that she real affection for johnson be still color by resentment for he conduct at this and a later period they have a apologetic character which show itself in a statement as to the origin of the quarrel curiously different from the contemporary account in the diary she say substantially and the whole book be write so as to give probability to the assertion that johnson 's bearishness and demand upon she indulgence have become intolerable when he be no longer under restraint from she husband 's presence she therefore take advantage of she lose lawsuit and other trouble to leave london and thus escape from he domestic tyranny he no longer as she add suffer from anything but old age and general infirmity -lrb- a tolerably wide exception -rrb- and do not require she nursing she therefore withdraw from the yoke to which she have contentedly submit during she husband 's life but which be intolerable when she coadjutor be no more johnson 's society be we may easily believe very try to a widow in such a position and it seem to be true that thrale be better able than mr thrale to restrain he oddity little as the lady shrink at time from reasonable plain-speaking but the later account involve something more than a bare suppression of the truth the excuse about he health be perhaps the worst part of she case because obviously insincere nobody could be more fully aware than mr thrale that johnson 's infirmity be rapidly gathering and that another winter or two must in all probability be fatal to he she know therefore that he be never more in want of the care which as she seem to imply have save he from the specific tendency to something like madness she know in fact that she be throw he upon the care of he other friend zealous and affectionate enough it be true but yet unable to supply he with the domestic comfort of streatham she clearly feel that this be a real injury inevitable it might be under the circumstance but certainly not to be extenuate by the paltry evasion as to he improved health so far from johnson 's health be now establish she have not dare to speak until he temporary recovery from a dangerous illness which have provoke she at the time to the strongest expression of anxious regret she have -lrb- accord to the diary -rrb- regard a possible breaking of the yoke in the early part of 1782 as a terrible evil which would more than ruin she even when resolve to leave streatham she one great difficulty be the dread of parting with johnson and the pecuniary trouble be the solid and conclusive reason in the later account the money question be the mere pretext the desire to leave johnson the true motive and the long-cherished desire to see italy with piozzus be judiciously drop out of notice altogether the truth be plain enough mr thrale be tear by conflict feeling she still love johnson and yet dread he certain disapproval of she strongest wish she respect he but be resolve not to follow he advice she wish to treat he with kindness and to be repay with gratitude and yet he presence and he affection be full of intolerable inconvenience when a old friendship become a burden the smaller infirmity of manner and temper to which we once submit willingly become intolerable she have bear with johnson 's mode of eating and with he rough reproof to herself and she friend during sixteen year of she married life and for nearly a year of she widowhood she still cling to he as the wisest and kindest of monitor he manners have undergo no spasmodic change they become intolerable when for other reason she resent he possible interference and want a very different guardian and confidant and therefore she wish to part and yet wish that the initiative should come from he the decision to leave streatham be take johnson part with deep regret from the house he read a chapter of the testament in the library he take leave of the church with a kiss he compose a prayer commend the family to the protection of heaven and he do not forget to note in he journal the detail of the last dinner of which he partake this quaint observation may have be due to some valetudinary motive or more probably to some odd freak of association once when eat a omelette he be deeply affect because it recall he old friend nugent ah my dear friend he say in a agony i shall never eat omelette with thee again and in the present case there be a obscure reference to some funeral connect in he mind with a meal the unlucky entry have cause some ridicule but need hardly convince we that he love of the family in which for so many year he have be a honor and honour-giving inmate be as miss seward amiably suggest in great measure kitchen-love no immediate rupture follow the abandonment of the streatham establishment johnson spend some week at brighton with mr thrale during which a crisis be take place without he knowledge in she relation to piozzi after vehement altercation with she daughter whom she criticize with great bitterness for they utter want of heart she resolve to break with piozzus for at least a time she plan be to go to bath and there to retrench she expense in the hope of be able to recall she lover at some future period meanwhile he leave she and return to italy after another winter in london during which johnson be still a frequent inmate of she house she go to bath with she daughter in April 1783 a melancholy period follow for both the friend mr thrale lose a younger daughter and johnson have a paralytic stroke in June death be send preliminary warning a correspondence be keep up which imply that the old term be not ostensibly broken mr thrale speak tartly more than once and johnson 's letter go into medical detail with he customary plainness of speech and he occasionally indulge in lament over the suppose change in she feeling the gloom be thicken and the old playful gallantry have die out the old man evidently feel himself desert and suffer from the breaking-up of the asylum he have love so well the final catastrophe come in 1784 less than six month before johnson 's death after much suffering in mind and body mr thrale have at last induce she daughter to consent to she marriage with piozzus she send for he at once and they be marry in June 1784 a painful correspondence follow mr thrale announce she marriage in a friendly letter to johnson excuse she previous silence on the ground that discussion could only have cause they pain the revelation though johnson could not have be quite unprepared produce one of he burst of fury madam if i interpret you letter rightly write the old man you be ignominiously marry if it be yet undo let we once more talk together if you have abandon you child and you religion god forgive you wickedness if you have forfeit you fame and you country may you folly do no further mischief if the last act be yet to do i who have love you esteemed you reverence you and serve you -- i who long think you the first of womankind -- entreat that before you fate be irrevocable i may once more see you i be i once be madam most truly yours sam johnson mr thrale reply with spirit and dignity to this cry of blind indignation speaking of she husband with become pride and resent the unfortunate phrase about she loss of fame she end by decline further intercourse till johnson could change he opinion of piozzus johnson admit in he reply that he have no right to resent she conduct express he gratitude for the kindness which have soothe twenty year of a life radically wretched and implore she -lrb- superfluously as she say -rrb- to induce piozzus to settle in england he then take leave of she with a expression of sad foreboding mr thrale now mr piozzus say that she reply affectionately but the letter be miss the friendship be break off and during the brief remainder of johnson 's life the piozzi be absent from england of she there be little more to be say after pass some time in italy where she become a light of that wretched little dellum cruscan society of which some faint memory be preserve by gifford 's ridicule now pretty nearly forget with its object she return with she husband to england she anecdote of johnson publish soon after he death have a success which in spite of much ridicule encourage she to some further literary effort of a sprightly but ephemeral kind she live happily with piozzus and never have cause to regret she marriage she be reconcile to she daughter sufficiently to renew a friendly intercourse but the elder one set up a separate establishment piozzus die not long afterwards she be still a vivacious old lady who celebrate she 80th birthday by a ball and be suppose at that ripe age to have make a offer of marriage to a young actor she die in may 1821 leave all that she could dispose of to a nephew of piozzus 's who have be naturalise in england meanwhile johnson be rapidly approach the grave he old inmate levett and miss william have go before he goldsmith and garrick and beauclerk have become memory of the past and the gloom gather thickly around he the old man cling to life with pathetic earnestness though life have be often melancholy he never affect to conceal the horror with which he regard death he frequently declare that death must be dreadful to every reasonable man death my dear be very dreadful he say simply in a letter to lucy porter in the last year of he life still later he shock a pious friend by admit that the fear oppress he dr adam try the ordinary consolation of the divine goodness and go so far as to suggest that hell might not imply much positive suffering johnson 's religious view be of a different color i be afraid he say i may be one of those who shall be damned what do you mean by damned ask adam johnson reply passionately and loudly send to hell sir and punish everlastingly remonstrance only deepen he melancholy and he silence he friend by exclaim in gloomy agitation i 'll have no more o not often in these last year he be hear mutter to himself the passionate complaint of claudio ah but to die and go we know not whither at other time he be speak of some lose friend and say poor man -- and then he die the peculiar horror of death which seem to indicate a tinge of insanity be combine with utter fearlessness of pain he call to the surgeon to cut deeper when perform a painful operation and shortly before he death inflict such wound upon himself in hope of obtain relief as very erroneously to suggest the idea of suicide whilst he strength remain he endeavor to disperse melancholy by some of the old method in the winter of 1783-4 he get together the few survive member of the old ivy lane club which have flourish when he be compose the _ dictionary _ but the old place of meeting have vanish most of the original member be dead and the gathering can have be but melancholy he start another club at the essex head whose member be to meet twice a week with the modest fine of threepence for non-attendance it appear to have include a rather strange mixture of people and thereby to have give some scandal to sir john hawkin and even to reynold they think that he craving for society increase by he loss of streatham be lead he to undignified concession amongst the member of the club however be such man as horsley and windham windham seem to have attract more personal regard than most politician by a generous warmth of enthusiasm not too common in the class in politics he be a ardent disciple of burke 's whom he afterwards follow in he separation from the new whig but though adhering to the principle which johnson detest he know like he preceptor how to win johnson 's warmest regard he be the most eminent of the younger generation who now look up to johnson as a venerable relic from the past another be young burke that very priggish and silly young man as he seem to have be whose loss none the less break the tender heart of he father friendship now more interesting be those with two of the most distinguished authoress of the day one of they be hannah more who be about this time come to the conclusion that the talent which have gain she distinction in the literary and even in the dramatic world should be consecrate to less secular employment she vivacity during the earlier year of they acquaintance expose she to a occasional rebuff she do not gain upon I sir i think she empty-headed be one of he remark and it be to she that he say accord to mr thrale though boswell report a softened version of the remark that she should consider what she flattery be worth before she choke he with it more frequently he seem to have repay it in kind there be no name in poetry he say which might not be glad to own she poem -- the _ bas bleu _ certainly johnson do not stick at trifle in intercourse with he female friend he be delighted shortly before he death to gallant it about with she at oxford and in serious moment show a respectful regard for she merit hannah more who thus sit at the foot of johnson encourage the juvenile ambition of macaulay and do not die till the historian have grow into manhood and fame the other friendship notice be with fanny burney who also live to we own time johnson 's affection for this daughter of he friend seem to have be amongst the tenderest of he old age when she be first introduce to he at the thrale she be overpower and indeed have she head a little turn by flattery of the most agreeable kind that a author can receive the great literary leviathan show himself to have the recently publish _ evelina _ at he finger ' end he quote and almost act passage la polly he exclaim in a pert feminine accent only think miss have dance with a lord how many modern reader can assign its place to that quotation or answer the question which poor boswell ask in despair and amidst general ridicule for he ignorance what be a brangton there be something pleasant in the enthusiasm with which man like johnson and burke welcome the literary achievement of the young lady whose first novel seem to have make a sensation almost as lively as that produce by miss brontë and far superior to anything that fall to the lot of miss austen johnson seem also to have regard she with personal affection he have a tender interview with she shortly before he death he beg she with solemn energy to remember he in she prayer he apologize pathetically for be unable to see she as he weakness increase and send she tender message from he deathb as the end draw near johnson accept the inevitable like a man after spend most of the latter month of 1784 in the country with the friend who after the loss of the thrale could give he most domestic comfort he come back to london to die he make he will and settle a few matter of business and be please to be tell that he would be bury in westminster abbey he utter a few word of solemn advice to those who come near he and take affect leave of he friend langton so warmly love be in close attendance johnson say to he tenderly _ te teneam moriens deficiente manu _ windham break from political occupation to sit by the die man once langton find burke sit by he bedside with three or four friend i be afraid say burke that so many of we must be oppressive to you no sir it be not so reply johnson and i must be in a wretched state indeed when you company would not be a delight to I my dear sir say burke with a breaking voice you have always be too good to I and part from he old friend for the last time of reynold he beg three thing : to forgive a debt of thirty pound to read the bible and never to paint on sunday a few flash of the old humor break through he say of a man who sit up with he : sir the fellow 's a idiot he be as awkward as a turnspit when first put into the wheel and as sleepy as a dormouse he last recorded word be to a young lady who have beg for he blessing : god bless you my dear the same day December 13th 1784 he gradually sink and die peacefully he be lay in the abbey by the side of goldsmith and the playful prediction have be amply fulfil : -- forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur isti the name of many greater writer be inscribe upon the wall of westminster abbey but scarcely any one lie there whose heart be more acutely responsive during life to the deepest and tenderest of human emotion in visit that strange gathering of depart hero and statesman and philanthropist and poet there be many whose word and deed have a far greater influence upon we imagination but there be very few whom when all have be say we can love so heartily as samuel johnson chapter vi johnson 's writings it remain to speak of johnson 's position in literature for reason sufficiently obvious few man whose life have be devote to letter for a equal period have leave behind they such scanty and inadequate remain johnson as we have see work only under the pressure of circumstance a very small proportion of he latter life be devote to literary employment the work hour of he earlier year be spend for the most part in production which can hardly be call literary seven year be devote to the _ dictionary _ which whatever its merit could be a book only in the material sense of the word and be of course destine to be soon superseded much of he hack-work have doubtless pass into oblivion and though the ordinary relic-worship have gather together fragment enough to fill twelve decent octavo volume -lrb- to which may be add the two volume of parliamentary report -rrb- the part which can be call alive may be compress into very moderate compass johnson may be consider as a poet a essayist a pamphleteer a traveller a critic and a biographer among he poem the two imitation of juvenal especially the _ vanity of human wish _ and a minor fragment or two probably deserve more respect than would be concede to they by adherent of modern school he most ambitious work _ irene _ can be read by man in whom a sense of duty have be abnormally develop among the two hundred and odd essay of the _ rambler _ there be a fair proportion which will deserve but will hardly obtain respectful attention _ rassela _ one of the philosophical tale popular in the last century give the essence of much of the _ rambler _ in a different form and to these may be add the essay upon soame jenyn which deal with the same absorb question of human happiness the political pamphlet and the _ journey to the hebride _ have a certain historical interest but be otherwise readable only in particular passage much of he criticism be pretty nearly obsolete but the child of he old age -- the _ life of the poet _ -- a book in which criticism and biography be combine be a admirable performance in spite of serious defect it be the work that best reflect he mind and intelligent reader who have once make its acquaintance will be apt to turn it into a familiar companion if it be easy to assign the cause which limit the quantity of johnson 's work it be more curious to inquire what be the quality which once gain for it so much authority and which now seem to have so far lose its savor the peculiar style which be associate with johnson 's name must count for something in both process the mannerism be strongly marked and of course offensive for by mannerism as i understand the word be mean the repetition of certain form of language in obedience to blind habit and without reference to they propriety in the particular case johnson 's sentence seem to be contorted as he gigantic limb use to twitch by a kind of mechanical spasmodic action the most obvious peculiarity be the tendency which he notice himself to use too big word and too many of they he have to explain to miss reynold that the shakesperian line -- you must borrow I garagantua 's mouth have be apply to he because he use big word which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce they it be not however the mere bigness of the word that distinguish he style but a peculiar love of put the abstract for the concrete of use awkward inversion and of balance he sentence in a monotonous rhythm which give the appearance as it sometimes correspond to the reality of elaborate logical discrimination with all its fault the style have the merit of masculine directness the inversion be not such as to complicate the construction as boswell remark he never use a parenthesis and he style though ponderous and wearisome be as transparent as the smarter snip-snap of macaulay this singular mannerism appear in he earliest writings it be most marked at the time of the _ rambler _ whilst in the _ life of the poet _ although i think that the trick of inversion have become commoner the other peculiarity have be so far soften as -lrb- in my judgment at least -rrb- to be inoffensive it be perhaps needless to give example of a tendency which mark almost every page of he write a passage or two from the _ rambler _ may illustrate the quality of the style and the oddity of the effect produce when it be apply to topic of a trivial kind the author of the _ rambler _ be suppose to receive a remonstrance upon he excessive gravity from the lively flirtillum who wish he to write in defense of masquerade conscious of he own incapacity he apply to a man of high reputation in gay life who on the fifth perusal of flirtillum 's letter break into a rapture and declare that he be ready to devote himself to she service here be part of the apostrophe put into the mouth of this brilliant rake behold flirtillum at thy foot a man grow gray in the study of those noble art by which right and wrong may be confound by which reason may be blind when we have a mind to escape from she inspection and caprice and appetite instate in uncontrolled command and boundless dominion such a casuist may surely engage with certainty of success in vindication of a entertainment which in a instant give confidence to the timorous and kindle ardor in the cold a entertainment where the vigilance of jealousy have so often be cloud and the virgin be set free from the necessity of languish in silence where all the outwork of chastity be at once demolish where the heart be lay open without a blush where bashfulness may survive virtue and no wish be crush under the frown of modesty here be another passage in which johnson be speak upon a topic more within he proper province and which contain sound sense under its weight of word a man he say who read a print book be often contented to be please without critical examination but he add if the same man be call to consider the merit of a production yet unpublished he bring a imagination heat with objection to passage which he have never yet hear he invoke all the power of criticism and store he memory with taste and grace purity and delicacy manners and unity sound which have be once utter by those that understand they have be since re-echoed without meaning and keep up to the disturbance of the world by constant repercussion from one coxcomb to another he consider himself as oblige to show by some proof of he ability that he be not consult to no purpose and therefore watch every opening for objection and look round for every opportunity to propose some specious alteration such opportunity a very small degree of sagacity will enable he to find for in every work of imagination the disposition of part the insertion of incident and use of decoration may be vary in a thousand way with equal propriety and as in thing nearly equal that will always seem best to every man which he himself produce the critic whose business be only to propose without the care of execution can never want the satisfaction of believe that he have suggest very important improvement nor the power of enforce he advice by argument which as they appear convince to himself either he kindness or he vanity will press obstinately and importunately without suspicion that he may possibly judge too hastily in favor of he own advice or inquiry whether the advantage of the new scheme be proportionate to the labor we may still notice a repercussion of word from one coxcomb to another though somehow the word have be change or translate johnson 's style be characteristic of the individual and of the epoch the precede generation have exhibit the final triumph of common sense over the pedantry of a decaying scholasticism the movement represent by locke 's philosophy by the rationalize school in theology and by the so-called classicism of pope and he follower be different phase of the same impulse the quality value above all other in philosophy literature and art be clear bright common sense to expel the mystery which have serve as a cloak for charlatan be the great aim of the time and the method be to appeal from the professor of explode technicality to the judgment of cultivate man of the world berkeley place he utopia in happy clime -- where nature guide and virtue rule _ where man shall not impose for truth and sense the pedantry of court and school _ simplicity clearness directness be therefore the great virtue of thought and style berkeley addison pope and swift be the great model of such excellence in various department of literature in the succeed generation we become aware of a certain leaven of dissatisfaction with the aesthetic and intellectual code thus inherit the supremacy of common sense the superlative importance of clearness be still fully acknowledge but there be a grow undertone of dissent in form and substance attempt be make to restore philosophical conception assail by locke and he follower the rationalism of the deistic or semi-deistic writer be declare to be superficial they optimistic theory disregard the dark side of nature and provide no sufficient utterance for the sadness cause by the contemplation of human suffering and the polished monotony of pope 's verse begin to fall upon those who shall tread in he step some daring sceptic be even inquire whether he be a poet at all and simultaneously though addison be still a kind of sacred model the best prose writer be begin to aim at a more complex structure of sentence fit for the expression of a wider range of thought and emotion johnson though no conscious revolutionist share this grow discontent the _ spectator _ be write in the language of the drawing-room and the coffee-house nothing be ever say which might not pass in conversation between a couple of wit with at most some graceful indulgence in pass mood of solemn or tender sentiment johnson though devote to society in he own way be anything but a producer of small talk society mean to he a escape from the gloom which beset he whenever he be abandon to he thought neither he education nor the manners acquire in grub street have qualify he to be a observer of those lighter foible which be touch by addison with so dexterous a hand when he venture upon such topic he flounder dreadfully and rather remind we of a artist who should attempt to paint miniature with a mop no man indeed take more of interest in what be call the science of human nature and when rouse by the stimulus of argument he could talk as have be show with almost unrivalled vigor and point but he favorite topic be the deeper spring of character rather than superficial peculiarity and he vigorous saying be concentrated essence of strong sense and deep feeling not dainty epigram or graceful embodiment of delicate observation johnson be not like some contemporary antiquarian a systematic student of the english literature of the precede century but he have a strong affection for some of its chief masterpiece burton 's _ anatomy of melancholy _ be he declare the only book which ever get he out of bed two hour sooner than he wish sir thoma browne be another congenial writer who be suppose to have have some influence upon he style he never seem to have directly imitate any one though some nonsense have be talk about he form a style but it be probable that he feel a closer affinity to those old scholar with they elaborate and ornate language and they deep and solemn tone of sentiment than to the brilliant but comparatively superficial writer of queen anne 's time he be one may say a scholar of the old type force by circumstance upon the world but always retain a sympathy for the scholar 's life and temper accordingly he style acquire something of the old elaboration though the attempt to conform to the canon of a later age render the structure disagreeably monotonous he tendency to pomposity be not redeem by the _ naïveté _ and spontaneity of he master the inferiority of johnson 's write to he speak utterance be indicative of he divided life there be moment at which he write take the terse vigorous tone of he talk in he letter such as those to chesterfield and macpherson and in occasional passage of he pamphlet we see that he could be pithy enough when he choose to descend from he latinized abstraction to good concrete english but that be only when he become excited he face when in repose we be tell appear to be almost imbecile he be constantly sink in reverie from which he be only rouse by a challenge to conversation in he writings for the most part we seem to be listen to the reverie rather than the talk we be overhear a soliloquy in he study not a vigorous discussion over the twentieth cup of tea he be not fairly put upon he mettle and be content to expound without enforce we seem to see a man heavy-eyed ponderous in he gesture like some huge mechanism which grind out a ponderous tissue of verbiage as heavy as it be certainly solid the substance correspond to the style johnson have something in common with the fashionable pessimism of modern time no sentimentalist of to-day could be more convinced that life be in the main miserable it be he favorite theory accord to mr thrale that all human action be prompt by the vacuity of life man act solely in the hope of escape from themselves evil as a follower of schopenhauer would assert be the positive and good merely the negative of evil all desire be at bottom a attempt to escape from pain the doctrine neither result from nor generate a philosophical theory in johnson 's case and be in the main a generalization of he own experience not the less the aim of most of he writing be to express this sentiment in one form or other he differ indeed from most modern sentimentalist in have the most hearty contempt for useless whine if he dwell upon human misery it be because he feel that it be as futile to join with the optimist in ignore as with the pessimist in howl over the evil we be in a sad world full of pain but we have to make the best of it stubborn patience and hard work be the sole remedy or rather the sole means of temporary escape much of the _ rambler _ be occupy with variation upon this theme and express the kind of dogged resolution with which he would have we plod through this weary world take for example this passage : -- the controversy about the reality of external evil be now at a end that life have many misery and that those misery be sometimes at least equal to all the power of fortitude be now universally confess and therefore it be useful to consider not only how we may escape they but by what mean those which either the accident of affair or the infirmity of nature must bring upon we may be mitigate and lighten and how we may make those hour less wretched which the condition of we present existence will not allow to be very happy the cure for the greatest part of human misery be not radical but palliative infelicity be involve in corporeal nature and interwoven with we be all attempt therefore to decline it wholly be useless and vain the army of pain send they arrow against we on every side the choice be only between those which be more or less sharp or tinged with poison of greater or less malignity and the strongest armor which reason can supply will only blunt they point but can not repel they the great remedy which heaven have put in we hand be patience by which though we can not lessen the torment of the body we can in a great measure preserve the peace of the mind and shall suffer only the natural and genuine force of a evil without heighten its acrimony or prolong its effect it be hardly desirable for a moralist to aim at originality in he precept we must be content if he enforce old truth in such a manner as to convince we of the depth and sincerity of he feeling johnson it must be confess rather abuse the moralist 's privilege of be commonplace he descant not unfrequently upon proposition so trite that even the most earnest enforcement can give they little interest with all drawback however the moralizing be the best part of the _ rambler _ many of the papers follow the precedent set by addison in the _ spectator _ but without addison 's felicity like addison he indulge in allegory which in he hand become unendurably frigid and clumsy he try light social satire and be fain to confess that we can spy a beard under the muffler of he feminine character he treat we to criticism which like addison 's go upon explode principle but unlike addison 's be apt to be almost wilfully outrageous he odd remark upon milton 's versification be the worst example of this weakness the result be what one might expect from the attempt of a writer without a ear to sit in judgment upon the greatest master of harmony in the language these defect have consign the _ rambler _ to the dustiest shelf of library and account for the wonder express by such a critic as m taine at the english love of johnson certainly if that love be nourish as he seem to fancy by assiduous study of the _ rambler _ it would be a curious phenomenon and yet with all its fault the reader who can plod through its page will at least feel respect for the author it be not unworthy of the man whose great lesson be clear you mind of cant -lrb- 1 -rrb- who feel most deeply the misery of the world but from the bottom of he heart despise querulous and sentimental complaint on one side and optimist glass upon the other to he as to some other of he temperament the affectation of look at the bright side of thing seem to have present itself as the bitterest of mockery and nothing would tempt he to let fine word pass themselves off for genuine sense here be some remark upon the vanity in which some author seek for consolation which may illustrate this love of reality and conclude we quotation from the _ rambler _ -lrb- footnote 1 : of this well-known sentiment it may be say as of some other familiar quotation that its direct meaning have be slightly modify in use the emphasis be change johnson 's word be clear you _ mind _ of cant you may talk as other people do you may say to a man sir i be you humble servant you be _ not _ he most humble servant you may _ talk _ in this manner it be a mode of talk in society but do not _ think _ foolishly -rrb- by such act of voluntary delusion do every man endeavor to conceal he own unimportance from himself it be long before we be convince of the small proportion which every individual bear to the collective body of mankind or learn how few can be interested in the fortune of any single man how little vacancy be leave in the world for any new object of attention to how small extent the brightest blaze of merit can be spread amidst the mist of business and of folly and how soon it be cloud by the intervention of other novelty not only the writer of book but the commander of army and the deliverer of nation will easily outlive all noisy and popular reputation : he may be celebrate for a time by the public voice but he action and he name will soon be consider as remote and unaffecting and be rarely mention but by those whose alliance give they some vanity to gratify by frequent commemoration it seem not to be sufficiently consider how little renown can be admit in the world mankind be keep perpetually busy by they fear or desire and have not more leisure from they own affair than to acquaint themselves with the accident of the current day engage in contrive some refuge from calamity or in shorten they way to some new possession they seldom suffer they thought to wander to the past or future none but a few solitary student have leisure to inquire into the claim of ancient hero or sage and name which hope to range over kingdom and continent shrink at last into cloister and college nor be it certain that even of these dark and narrow habitation these last retreat of fame the possession will be long keep of man devote to literature very few extend they view beyond some particular science and the greater part seldom inquire even in they own profession for any author but those whom the present mode of study happen to force upon they notice they desire not to fill they mind with unfashionable knowledge but contentedly resign to oblivion those book which they now find censured or neglect the most remarkable of johnson 's utterance upon he favorite topic of the vanity of human wish be the story of _ rassela _ the plan of the book be simple and recall certain part of voltaire 's simultaneous but incomparably more brilliant attack upon optimism in _ candide _ there be suppose to be a happy valley in abyssinium where the royal prince be confine in total seclusion but with ample supplies for every conceivable want rassela who have be thus educate become curious as to the outside world and at last make he escape with he sister she attendant and the ancient sage and poet imlac under imlac 's guidance they survey life and manners in various station they make the acquaintance of philosopher statesman man of the world and recluse they discuss the result of they experience pretty much in the style of the _ rambler _ they agree to pronounce the sentence vanity of vanity and finally in a conclusion where nothing be conclude they resolve to return to the happy valley the book be little more than a set of essay upon life with just story enough to hold it together it be want in those brilliant flash of epigram which illustrate voltaire 's page so as to blind some reader to its real force of sentiment and yet it leave a peculiar and powerful impression upon the reader the general tone may be collect from a few passage here be a fragment the conclusion of which be perhaps the most familiar of quotation from johnson 's writings imlac in narrate he life describe he attempt to become a poet the business of a poet say imlac be to examine not the individual but the species to remark general property and large appearance he do not number the streak of the tulip or describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest he be to exhibit in he portrait of nature such prominent and striking feature as recall the original to every mind and must neglect the minute discrimination which one may have remark and another have neglect for those characteristic which be alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness but the knowledge of nature be only half the task of a poet he must be acquaint likewise with all the mode of life he character require that he estimate the happiness and misery of every condition observe the power of all the passion in all they combination and know the change of the human mind as they be modify by various institution and accidental influence of climate or custom from the sprightliness of infancy to the despondency of decrepitude he must divest himself of the prejudice of he age or country he must consider right and wrong in they abstracted and invariable state he must disregard present law and opinion and rise to general and transcendental truth which will always be the same he must therefore content himself with the slow progress of he name contemn the applause of he own time and commit he claim to the justice of posterity he must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind and consider himself as preside over the thought and manners of future generation as a be superior to time and place he labor be not yet at a end he must know many language and many science and that he style may be worthy of he thought must by incessant practice familiarize to himself every delicacy of speech and grace of harmony imlac now feel the enthusiastic fit and be proceed to aggrandize he profession when the prince cry out enough thou hast convinced I that no human being can ever be a poet indeed johnson 's conception of poetry be not the one which be now fashionable and which would rather seem to imply that philosophical power and moral sensibility be so far disqualification to the true poet here again be a view of the superfine system of moral philosophy a meeting of learn man be discuss the ever-recurring problem of happiness and one of they speak as follow : -- the way to be happy be to live accord to nature in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with which every heart be originally impressed which be not write on it by precept but engraven by destiny not instil by education but infuse at we nativity he that live accord to nature will suffer nothing from the delusion of hope or importunity of desire he will receive and reject with equability of temper and act or suffer as the reason of thing shall alternately prescribe other man may amuse themselves with subtle definition or intricate ratiocination let he learn to be wise by easier means : let he observe the hind of the forest and the linnet of the grove let he consider the life of animal whose motion be regulate by instinct they obey they guide and be happy let we therefore at length cease to dispute and learn to live throw away the incumbrance of precept which they who utter they with so much pride and pomp do not understand and carry with we this simple and intelligible maxim that deviation from nature be deviation from happiness the prince modestly inquire what be the precise meaning of the advice just give when i find young man so humble and so docile say the philosopher i can deny they no information which my study have enable I to afford to live accord to nature be to act always with due regard to the fitness arise from the relation and quality of cause and effect to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity to co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the present system of thing the prince soon find that this be one of the sage whom he should understand less as he hear he longer here finally be a characteristic reflection upon the right mode of meeting sorrow the state of a mind oppress with a sudden calamity say imlac be like that of the fabulous inhabitant of the new create earth who when the first night come upon they suppose that day would never return when the cloud of sorrow gather over we we see nothing beyond they nor can imagine how they will be dispel yet a new day succeed to the night and sorrow be never long without a dawn of ease but as they who restrain themselves from receive comfort do as the savage would have do have they put out they eye when it be dark we mind like we body be in continual flux something be hourly lose and something acquire to lose much at once be inconvenient to either but while the vital power remain uninjured nature will find the means of reparation distance have the same effect on the mind as on the eye and while we glide along the stream of time whatever we leave behind we be always lessen and that which we approach increase in magnitude do not suffer life to stagnate it will grow muddy for want of motion commit yourself again to the current of the world pekuah will vanish by degree you will meet in you way some other favorite or learn to diffuse yourself in general conversation in one respect _ rassela _ be curiously contrast with _ candide _ voltaire 's story be aim at the doctrine of theological optimism and whether that doctrine be well or ill understand have therefore a openly sceptical tendency johnson to whom nothing could be more abhorrent than a alliance with any assailant of orthodoxy draw no inference from he pessimism he be content to state the fact of human misery without perplexing himself with the result problem as to the final cause of human existence if the question have be explicitly bring before he he would doubtless have reply that the mystery be insoluble to answer either in the sceptical or the optimistic sense be equally presumptuous johnson 's religious belief in fact be not such as to suggest that kind of comfort which be to be obtain by explain away the existence of evil if he too would have say that in some sense all must be for the best in a world rule by a perfect creator the sense must be one which would allow of the eternal misery of indefinite multitude of he creature but in truth it be characteristic of johnson to turn away he mind from such topic he be interested in ethical speculation but on the practical side in the application to life not in the philosophy on which it might be ground in that direction he could see nothing but a milking of the bull -- a fruitless or rather a pernicious waste of intellect a intense conviction of the supreme importance of a moral guidance in this difficult world make he abhor any rash inquiry by which the basis of exist authority might be endanger this sentiment be involve in many of those prejudice which have be so much and in some sense justifiably ridicule man have be wretched and foolish since the race begin and will be till it end one chorus of lamentation have ever be rise in countless dialect but with a single mean the plausible scheme of philosopher give no solution to the everlasting riddle the nostrum of politician touch only the surface of the deeply-rooted evil it be folly to be querulous and as silly to fancy that man be grow worse as that they be much better than they use to be the evil under which we suffer be not skin-deep to be eradicate by change the old physician for new quack what be to be do under such condition but to hold fast as vigorously as we can to the rule of life and faith which have serve we ancestor and which whatever they justification be at least the only consolation because they supply the only guidance through this labyrinth of trouble macaulay have ridicule johnson for what he take to be the ludicrous inconsistency of he intense political prejudice combine with he assertion of the indifference of all form of government if say macaulay the difference between two form of government be not worth half a guinea it be not easy to see how whiggism can be viler than toryism or the crown can have too little power the answer be surely obvious whiggism be vile accord to the doctor 's phrase because whiggism be a negation of all principle it be in he view not so much the preference of one form to another as a attack upon the vital condition of all government he call burke a bottomless whig in this sense imply that whiggism mean anarchy and in the next generation a good many people be lead rightly or wrongly to agree with he by the experience of the french revolution this dogged conservatism have both its value and its grotesque side when johnson come to write political pamphlet in he later year and to deal with subject little familiar to he mind the result be grotesque enough loving authority and hold one authority to be as good as another he defend with uncompromising zeal the most preposterous and tyrannical measure the pamphlet against the wilkite agitator and the american rebel be little more than a huge rhinoceros snort of contempt against all who be fool enough or wicked enough to promote war and disturbance in order to change one form of authority for another here be a characteristic passage give he view of the value of such demonstrator : -- the progress of a petition be well know a eject placeman go down to he county or he borough tell he friend of he inability to serve they and he constituent of the corruption of the government he friend readily understand that he who can get nothing will have nothing to give they agree to proclaim a meeting meat and drink be plentifully provide a crowd be easily bring together and those who think that they know the reason of the meeting undertake to tell those who know it not ale and clamor unite they power the crowd condensed and heated begin to ferment with the leaven of sedition all see a thousand evil though they can not show they and grow impatient for a remedy though they know not what a speech be then make by the cicero of the day he say much and suppress more and credit be equally give to what he tell and what he conceal the petition be hear and universally approve those who be sober enough to write add they name and the rest would sign it if they could every man go home and tell he neighbor of the glory of the day how he be consult and what he advise how he be invite into the great room where he lordship caress he by he name how he be caress by sir franci sir joseph and sir george how he eat turtle and venison and drink unanimity to the three brother the poor loiterer whose shop have confine he or whose wife have lock he up hear the tale of luxury with envy and at last inquire what be they petition of the petition nothing be remember by the narrator but that it speak much of fear and apprehension and something very alarming but that he be sure it be against the government the other be convince that it must be right and wish he have be there for he love wine and venison and resolve as long as he live to be against the government the petition be then hand from town to town and from house to house and wherever it come the inhabitant flock together that they may see that which must be send to the king name be easily collect one man sign because he hate the papist another because he have vow destruction to the turnpike one because it will vex the parson another because he owe he landlord nothing one because he be rich another because he be poor one to show that he be not afraid and another to show that he can write the only writing in which we see a distinct reflection of johnson 's talk be the _ life of the poet _ the excellence of that book be of the same kind as the excellence of he conversation johnson write it under pressure and it have suffer from he characteristic indolence modern author would fill as many page as johnson have fill line with the biography of some of he hero by industriously sweeping together all the rubbish which be in any way connect with the great man by elaborately discuss the possible significance of infinitesimal bit of evidence and by disquisition upon general principle or the whole mass of contemporary literature it be easy to swell volume to any desire extent the result be sometimes highly interesting and valuable as it be sometimes a new contribution to the dust-heap but in any case the design be something quite different from johnson 's he have leave much to be supply and correct by later scholar he aim be simply to give a vigorous summary of the main fact of he hero ' live a pithy analysis of they character and a short criticism of they production the strong sense which be everywhere display the massive style which be yet easier and less cumbrous than in he earlier work and the uprightness and independence of the judgment make the book agreeable even where we be most inclined to dissent from its conclusion the criticism be that of a school which have die out under the great revolution of modern taste the bookseller decide that english poetry begin for they purpose with cowley and johnson have therefore nothing to say about some of the greatest name in we literature the loss be little to be regret since the biographical part of earlier memoirs must have be scanty and the criticism inappreciative johnson it may be say like most of he contemporary consider poetry almost exclusively from the didactic and logical point of view he always inquire what be the moral of a work of art if he do not precisely ask what it prove he pay excessive attention to the logical solidity and coherence of its sentiment he condemn not only insincerity and affectation of feeling but all such poetic imagery as do not correspond to the actual prosaic belief of the writer for the purely musical effect of poetry he have little or no feeling and allow little deviation from the alternate long and short syllable neatly bind in pope 's couplet to many reader this would imply that johnson omit precisely the poetic element in poetry i must be here content to say that in my opinion it imply rather a limitation than a fundamental error johnson err in suppose that he logical test be at all adequate but it be i think a still greater error to assume that poetry have no connexion because it have not this kind of connexion with philosophy he criticism have always a meaning and in the case of work belong to he own school a very sound meaning when he be speak of other poetry we can only reply that he remark may be true but that they be not to the purpose the remark on the poetry of dryden addison and pope be generally excellent and always give the genuine expression of a independent judgment whoever think for himself and say plainly what he think have some merit as a critic this it be true be about all that can be say for such criticism as that on _ lycida _ which be a delicious example of the wrong way of apply strong sense to inappropriate topic nothing can be truer in a sense and nothing less relevant in this poem he say there be no nature for there be no truth there be no art for there be nothing new its form be that of a pastoral easy vulgar and therefore disgusting whatever image it can supply be easily exhaust and its inherent improbability always force dissatisfaction on the mind when cowley tell of hervey that they study together it be easy to suppose how much he must miss the companion of he labor and the partner of he discovery but what image of tenderness can be excite by these line -- we drive afield and both together hear what time the gray fly wind she sultry horn batten we flock with the fresh dew of night we know that they never drive a-field and have no flock to batten and though it be allow that the representation may be allegorical the true meaning be so uncertain and remote that it be never seek because it can not be know when it be find among the flock and copse and flower appear the heathen deity : jove and phoebus neptune and aeolus with a long train of mythological imagery such as a college easily supply nothing can less display knowledge or less exercise invention than to tell how a shepherd have lose he companion and must now feed he flock alone without any judge of he skill in piping how one god ask another god what have become of lycida and neither god can tell he who thus grieve will excite no sympathy he who thus praise will confer no honor this be of course utterly outrageous and yet much of it be undeniably true to explain why in spite of truth _ lycida _ be a wonderful poem would be to go pretty deeply into the theory of poetic expression most critic prefer simply to shriek be at any rate safe from the error of independent judgment the general effect of the book however be not to be infer from this or some other passage of antiquated and eccentric criticism it be the shrewd sense everywhere crop up which be really delightful the keen remark upon life and character though perhaps rather too severe in tone be worthy of a vigorous mind store with much experience of many class and brace by constant exercise in the conversational arena passage everywhere abound which though a little more formal in expression have the forcible touch of he best conversational sally some of the prejudice which be express more pithily in _ boswell _ be defend by a reason exposition in the _ live _ sentence be pass with the true judicial air and if he do not convince we of he complete impartiality he at least basis he decision upon solid and worthy grounds it would be too much for example to expect that johnson should sympathize with the grand republicanism of milton or pardon a man who defend the execution of the bless martyr he fail therefore to satisfy the ardent admirer of the great poet yet he judgment be not harsh or ungenerous but at worst the judgment of a man strive to be just in spite of some inevitable want of sympathy the quality of johnson 's incidental remark may be infer from one or two brief extract here be a observation which johnson must have have many chance of verify speaking of dryden 's money difficulty he say it be well know that he seldom live frugally who live by chance hope be always liberal and they that trust she promise make little scruple of revel to-day on the profit of the morrow here be another shrewd comment upon the compliment pay to halifax of whom pope say in the character of bufo -- feed with soft dedication all day long horace and he go hand and hand in song to charge all unmerited praise with the guilt of flattery or to suppose that the encomiast always know and feel the falsehood of he assertion be surely to discover great ignorance of human nature and of human life in determination depend not on rule but on reference and comparison judgment be always in some degree subject to affection very near to admiration be the wish to admire every man willingly give value to the praise which he receive and consider the sentence pass in he favor as the sentence of discernment we admire in a friend that understand that select we for confidence we admire more in a patron that bounty which instead of scatter bounty indiscriminately direct it to we and if the patron be a author those performance which gratitude forbid we to blame affection will easily dispose we to exalt to these prejudice hardly culpable interest add a power always operate though not always because not willingly perceive the modesty of praise gradually wear away and perhaps the pride of patronage may be in time so increase that modest praise will no longer please many a blandishment be practice upon halifax which he would never have know have he no other attraction than those of he poetry of which a short time have wither the beauty it would now be esteem no honor by a contributor to the monthly bundle of verse to be tell that in strain either familiar or solemn he sing like halifax i will venture to make a longer quotation from the life of pope which give i think a good impression of he manner : -- of he social quality if a estimate be make from he letter a opinion too favourable can not easily be form they exhibit a perpetual and unclouded effulgence of general benevolence and particular fondness there be nothing but liberality gratitude constancy and tenderness it have be so long say as to be commonly believe that the true character of man may be find in they letter and that he who write to he friend lay he heart open before he but the truth be that such be the simple friendship of the golden age and be now the friendship only of child very few can boast of heart which they dare lay open to themselves and of which by whatever accident expose they do not shun a distinct and continued view and certainly what we hide from ourselves we do not show to we friend there be indeed no transaction which offer stronger temptation to fallacy and sophistication than epistolary intercourse in the eagerness of conversation the first emotion of the mind often burst out before they be consider in the tumult of business interest and passion have they genuine effect but a friendly letter be a calm and deliberate performance in the cool of leisure in the stillness of solitude and surely no man sit down by design to depreciate he own character friendship have no tendency to secure veracity for by whom can a man so much wish to be think better than he be as by he whose kindness he desire to gain or keep even in write to the world there be less constraint the author be not confront with he reader and take he chance of approbation among the different disposition of mankind but a letter be address to a single mind of which the prejudice and partiality be know and must therefore please if not by favor they by forbear to oppose they to charge those favourable representation which man give of they own mind with the guilt of hypocritical falsehood would show more severity than knowledge the writer commonly believe himself almost every man 's thought while they be general be right and most heart be pure while temptation be away it be easy to awaken generous sentiment in privacy to despise death when there be no danger to glow with benevolence when there be nothing to be give while such idea be form they be feel and self-love do not suspect the gleam of virtue to be the meteor of fancy if the letter of pope be consider merely as composition they seem to be premeditated and artificial it be one thing to write because there be something which the mind wish to discharge and another to solicit the imagination because ceremony or vanity require something to be write pope confess he early letter to be vitiate with _ affectation and ambition _ to know whether he disentangle himself from these perverter of epistolary integrity he book and he life must be set in comparison one of he favorite topic be contempt of he own poetry for this if it have be real he would deserve no commendation and in this he be certainly not sincere for he high value of himself be sufficiently observe and of what could he be proud but of he poetry he write he say when ` he have just nothing else to do ' yet swift complain that he be never at leisure for conversation because he ` have always some poetical scheme in he head ' it be punctually require that he writing-box should be set upon he bed before he rise and lord oxford 's domestic related that in the dreadful winter of '40 she be call from she bed by he four time in one night to supply he with paper lest he should lose a thought he pretend insensibility to censure and criticism though it be observe by all who know he that every pamphlet disturb he quiet and that he extreme irritability lay he open to perpetual vexation but he wish to despise he critic and therefore hope he do despise they as he happen to live in two reign when the court pay little attention to poetry he nurse in he mind a foolish disesteem of king and proclaim that ` he never see court ' yet a little regard show he by the prince of wale melt he obduracy and he have not much to say when he be ask by he royal highness ` how he could love a prince while he dislike king ' johnson 's best poetry be the versified expression of the tone of sentiment with which we be already familiar the _ vanity of human wish _ be perhaps the finest poem write since pope 's time and in pope 's manner with the exception of goldsmith 's still finer performance johnson it need hardly be say have not goldsmith 's exquisite fineness of touch and delicacy of sentiment he be often ponderous and verbose and one feel that the mode of expression be not that which be most congenial and yet the vigor of thought make itself feel through rather clumsy mode of utterance here be one of the best passage in which he illustrate the vanity of military glory : -- on what foundation stand the warrior 's pride how just he hope let swedish charle decide a frame of adamant a soul of fire no danger fright he and no labor tire o'er love o'er fear extend he wide domain unconquer would lord of pleasure and of pain no joy to he pacific sceptre yield war sound the trump he rush to the field behold surround king they power combine and one capitulate and one resign : peace court he hand but spread she charm in vain think nothing gain would he cry till nought remain on moscow 's wall till gothic standard fly and all be mine beneath the polar sky the march begin in military state and nation on he eye suspend wait stern famine guard the solitary coast and winter barricade the realm of frost he come nor want nor cold he course delay -- hide blush glory hide pultowa 's day the vanquish would hero leave he broken band and show he misery in distant land condemn would a needy supplicant to wait while lady interpose and slave debate -- but do not chance at length she error mend do no subvert empire mark he end do rival monarch give the fatal wound or hostile million press he to the ground he fall be destine to a barren strand a petty fortress and a dubious hand he leave the name at which the world grow pale to point a moral and adorn a tale the conclude passage may also fitly conclude this survey of johnson 's writings the sentiment be less gloomy than be usual but it give the answer which he would have give in he calmer mood to the perplexed riddle of life and in some form or other it be perhaps the best or the only answer that can be give : -- where then shall hope and fear they object find must dull suspense corrupt the stagnant mind must helpless man in ignorance sedate roll darkle down the torrent of he fate must no dislike alarm no wish rise no cry invoke the mercy of the sky inquirer cease petition yet remain which heaven may hear nor deem religion vain still raise for good the supplicating voice but leave to heaven the measure and the choice safe in he power whose eye discern afar the secret ambush of a specious prayer implore he aid in he decision rest secure whate'er he give -- he give the best yet when the scene of sacred presence fire and strong devotion to the sky aspire pour forth thy fervor for a healthful mind obedient passion and a will resign would for love which scarce collective man can fill for patience sovereign o'er transmute ill for faith that pant for a happier seat count death kind nature 's signal of retreat these goods for man the law of heaven ordain these goods he grant who grant the power to gain with these celestial wisdom calm the mind and make the
