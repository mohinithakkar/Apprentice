new _ chapter i introductory -- a word of wisdom find write like the most ancient on leather ` ah old man 's boot do not go there sir ' say the bootmaker to I one day as he point to the toe of a pair i have just bring he for mend it be a significant observation i think and as i go on my way home write another such chronicle with every spring step it fill I with much reflection -- largely of the nature of platitude i have little doubt : such reflection reader as be even already i doubt less ripple the surface of you mind with ever-widening circle yes you sigh with a air it be in the unconscious autobiography we be every moment writing -- not those we publish in two volume and a supplement -- where the truth about we be hide truly it be a thought that have ` thrill dead bosom ' i agree but why be afraid of it for that reader truth be not become a platitude only in we day ` the preacher ' know it for such some considerable time ago and yet he do not fear to ` write and set in order many proverb ' you have keep a diary for how many year thirty dear I but have you keep you wine-bill if you ever engage I to write that life which of course must some day be write -- i would not write it myself -- do not trouble about you diary lend I you private ledger ` there the action lie in he true nature ' yet i should hardly perhaps have evoke this particular corollary from that man of leather 's observation if i have not chance one evening to come across those old book-bill of my friend narcissus about which i have undertake to write here and be strike -- well-nigh awe-struck -- by the wonderful manner in which there lay reveal in they the story of the year over which they run to a stranger i be sure they would be full of mean but to I who live so near he through so much of the time how truly pregnant do each briefest entry seem to messr oldbuck and son they alas often come to be but so many account render to you be a philosopher they would as i have say mean more but to I they mean all that great sunrise the youth of narcissus many modern poet still young enough be fond of tell we where they youth lie bury that of narcissus -- would ye know -- rest among these old account lo i would perform a incantation i throw these old leave into the _ elixir vita _ of sweet memory as dr heidegger that old rise into he wonderful crystal water have i power to make narcissus ' rise to bloom again so that you may know something of the beauty it wear for we i wonder i would i have i must try chapter ii still introductory but this time of a greater than the writer on the left-hand side of tithefield just as one turn out of prince street in a certain well-known lancashire town be the unobtrusive bookshop of mr samuel dale it must however be a very superficial glance which do not discover in it something characteristic distinguish it from other ` second-hand ' shop of the same size and style there be alas treatise on farriery in the window geography chemistry and french grammar on the trestle outside for samuel albeit so great a philosopher as indeed to have found quite a school must nevertheless live those two cigar and that ` noggin ' of whiskey which he purchase with such a fine solemnity as he and i go home together for occasional symposium in he bachelor lodge -- those i say come not without sale of such treatise such geography chemistry and french grammar but i be digress there be a distinguishing air i but mean to say about the little shop look closer one generally find that it come of a choice bit of old binding or the quaint title-page of some tuneful elizabethan it be a old crashaw that first draw I inside and though for some reason i do not buy it then i buy it a year after because to it i owe the friendship of samuel dale and thus for three bright year that little shop come to be for a daily hour or so a bless palm-tree away from the burden and heat of the noon a holy place whither the money-changers and such as sell dove might never come let they clamor in the outer court ring never so loud there in samuel 's talk do two weary-hearted bond-servant of egypt draw a breath of the infinite into they life of the desk there could they sit awhile by the eternal spring and feel the beating of the central heart so it happen one afternoon about five year ago that i drop in there accord to wont but samuel be engage with some one in that dim corner at the far end of the shop where he desk and arm-chair tripod of that new philosophy stand : so i turn to a neighbouring shelf to fill the time at first i do not notice he visitor but as in take down this book and that i have come nearer to the talker i be strike with something familiar in the voice of the stranger it come upon I like a old song and look up -- why of course it be narcissus the letter n do not make one of the initial on the gladstone bag which he have with he on that occasion and which fill with book lay open on the floor close by nor do it appear on any of those tobacco-pouch cigar-case or handkerchief with which man beloved of fair woman be familiar and narcissus might moreover truthfully say that _ it _ have never appear upon any manner of stamped paper come under a certain notable act to be less indulgent to a vice from which the reader will i fear have too frequent occasion to suffer in these page and for which he may have a stronger term than digression let I at once say that narcissus be but the name love know he by love and the reader for that name by which he be know to the postman -- and other -- be no necessity here how and why he come to be so name will appear soon enough yes it be the same old narcissus and he be wield just the same old magic i could see as in we class-room and playground five year before what be it in he that make all man take he so on he own term make he talk hold one so though it so often stumble in the dark and fall dumb on many a verbal _ cul-de-sac _ whatever it be samuel feel it and with that fine worshipful spirit of he -- a attitude which always remind I of the elder listen to the boy jesus -- be do that homage for which no beauty or greatness ever appeal to he in vain what a eye for soul have samuel how inevitably it pierce through all husk and excrescence to the central beauty in that short talk he know narcissus through and through three year or thirty year could add but little but the talk be not end yet indeed it seem like so many of those tithefield talk as if in the ` eternal fitness of thing ' it never could would or should end it be i at last who give it pause and -- yes indeed it be he we have somehow not meet for quite three year chum as we have be at school he have leave there for a office some time before i do and oddly enough this be we first meeting since then a purchaser for one of those aforesaid treatise on farriery just then come in dislodge we so bidding samuel good-bye -- he and narcissus already arrange for ' a night ' -- we obey a mutual instinct and presently find ourselves in the snuggery of a quaint tavern which be often to figure hereafter in we sentimental history though probably little in these particular chapter of it the thing ` see do at the mermaid ' may some day be write in another place where the reader will know from the begin what to expect and not feel that he have be induce to buy a volume under false pretence chapter iii in which narcissus open he ` gladstone ' though it be so long since we have meet -- be not three year indeed ` so long ' in youth -- we have hardly to wait for we second glass to be again _ en rapport _ few man grow so rapidly as narcissus do in those young day but fewer still can look back on old enthusiasm and superannuated ideal with a tenderness so delicately considerate most man hasten to witness they present altitude by kick away the old ladder on the first opportunity like vulgar lover they seek to flatter to-day at the expense of yesterday but narcissus be of another fiber he could as soon have insult the memory of he first love so before long we have pass together into a sweet necropolis of dream whither if the reader care i will soon take he by the hand but just now i would have he concern himself with the afternoon of which i write in that sad tense the past present indeed we do not ourselves tarry long among the shades for we be young and youth have little use for the preterite its verb be wont to have but two tense we soon come up to the surface in one with eye turn instinctively on the other narcissus ' bag seem somehow a symbol and i have catch sight of a binding or two as it lay open in tithefield that make I curious to see it open again he be only begin to collect when we have part at school if ` collect ' be not too sacred a word : begin to _ buy _ more truly express that first glutting of the bookish hunger which like the natural appetite never pass in some beyond the primary utilitarian stage of ` eat to live ' otherwise ` buy to read ' three year however work miracle of refinement in any hunger that be at all capable of culture and it be evident when narcissus do open he ` gladstone ' that it have take he by no means so long to attain that sublimation of taste which may be express as ` read to buy ' each volume have that air -- of breed one might almost say -- by which one can always know a genuine _ bouquin _ at a glance a alluvial richness of bloom come upon one like a aromatic fragrance in so many old thing in old lawn in old flower old wine and many another delicious simile one could not but feel that each have turn its golden brown just as a apple redden -- as indeed it have i do not propose to solemnly enumerate and laboriously describe these good thing because i hardly think they would serve to distinguish narcissus except in respect of luck from other bookman in the first furor of bookish enthusiasm they be such volume as mr pendenni run up account for at oxford narcissus have many other point in common with that gentleman such volume as morning after morning sadden one 's breakfast-table in that tantalus _ menu _ the catalogue black letter early print first edition elizabethan and victorian every poor fly amber in large paper etc etc in short he run through the gamut of that craze which take its turn in due time with marble peg-tops beetle and foreign stamp -- with probably the two exception of bewick for whom he could never batter up a enthusiasm and ` facetiae ' these latter need too much camphor he use to say he two most cherish possession be a fine copy of the _ stultitiae laus _ print by froben which have once be give by william burton the historian to he brother robert when the latter be a youngster of twenty and a first edition of one of walton 's life ' a presentation copy from the author ' the former be rich with the autograph and marginalia of both brother and on the latter a friend of he have already hang a tale which may or may not be know to the reader in the reverent handling of these treasure two question inevitably force themselves upon I : where the d -- l narcissus a apprentice with a allowance that would hardly keep most of we in tobacco have find the money for such indulgence and how he could find in he heart to sell they again so soon a sorrowful interjection as he close he bag explain all : -- ` yes ' he sigh ` they have cost I thirty pound and guess how much i have be offer for they ' i suggest ten ` five ' groan my poor friend ' i try several to get that h be say each one indifferently turn the most precious in he hand this would hardly be any use to I and this i might have to keep month before i could sell that i could make you a offer for what have you think of for it with a great tug at you heart and well-nigh in tear you name the absurdest minimum you have give five you halve it -- surely you can get that but o no i can give nothing like that figure in that case it be no use to talk of it in despair you cry well what will you offer with a choke voice fifteen shilling would be about my figure for it answer the fiend relentless as a machine -- and so on ' ' i try pawn they at first ' he continue ` because there be hope of get they back some time that way but trudge from shop to shop with many prayer a sovereign for the lot be all i could get worse than dress-clothes ' conclude the frank creature for narcissus to be in debt be nothing new : he have always be so at school and probably always will be have you reproach he with it in those young self-conscious day of glorious absurdity he would probably have retort with a toss of he vain young head : -- ` well and so be shelley ' i venture to enquire the present difficulty that compel he to make sacrifice of thing so dear ` why to pay for they of course ' be the answer and so i first become initiate into the mad method by which narcissus have such a library about he at twenty-one from some unexplained reason largely i have little doubt on account of the charm of he manners he have the easy credit of those respectable bookseller to whom reference have be make above no extravagance seem to shake they confidence i remember call upon they with he one day some month follow that afternoon -- for the madness as usual would have its time and no suffering seem to teach he prudence -- and he take I up to a certain ` fine set ' that he have actually resist he say for a fortnight alas i know what that mean yes he must have it it be just the thing to help he with a something he be write -- ` not to read you know but to make a atmosphere ' etc so he use to talk and the odd thing be that we always take the wildness seriously he seem to make we see just what he want ' i say john ' be the next i hear at the other end of the shop ` will you kindly send I round that set of ' so-and-so ` and charge it to my account ' ` john ' the son of old oldbuck and for a short time a sort of friend of narcissus would answer ` certainly ' with a voice of the most cheerful trust and yet when we have go it be indeed no less a sum than # 10 10s which he add to the left-hand side of mr n 's account do not mistake this for a certain vulgar quality with a vulgar little name of five letter no one could have less of that than narcissus he be often on the contrary quite painfully diffident no it be not ` cheek ' reader it be a kind of irrational innocence i do not think it ever occur to he till the bill come in at the half-year what ` charge it to my account ' really mean perhaps it be because poor lad he have so small a practical acquaintance with it that he know so little the value of money but how he suffer when those account do come in of course there be nothing to be do but to apply to some long-suffering friend denial of lunch and threadbare coat but nibble at the amount -- especially as a fast to-day often find revulsion in a festival to-morrow to save be not in narcissus i promise to digress reader and i have keep my word now to return to that afternoon again it so chance that on that day in the year i happen to have in my pocket -- what you might meet I every day in five year without find there -- a ten-pound note it be for this i feel after we have be muse awhile -- narcissus probably on everything else in the world except he debt -- and it be with this i awake he from he reverie he look at he hand and then at I in bewilderment poor fellow how he want to keep it yet how he try to look as if he could not think of do so he could not help he joy shine through ` but i want you to take it ' i say ` believe I i have no immediate need of it and you can pay I at you leisure ' ten pound towards the keep of a poet once in a lifetime be after all but little interest on the gold he bring we at last i ` prevail ' shall i say but on no account without the solemnity of a iou and a fixed date for repayment on which matter poor n be always extremely emphatic alas mr george meredith have already tell we how this passionate anxiety to be bind by the heaven above the earth and the water under the earth be the most fatal symptom by which to know the confirm in this kind captain costigan have it it may be remembered and the same solicitude the same tearful gratitude i know accompany every such transaction of my poor narcissus whether it be as apparent on the due date or whether of that ten pound i have ever look upon the like again be surely no affair of the reader 's but lest he should do my friend a injustice i have better say -- i have not chapter iv account render nothing strike one more in look back either on we own life or on those of other than how little we assimilate from the greatest experience in nothing be nature 's apparent wastefulness of means more ironically impressive a great love come and set one 's whole be singing like a harp fill high heaven with rainbow and make we dingy alley for awhile bright as the street of the new jerusalem and yet if five year after we seek for what its incandescence have leave we we find maybe a newly helpful epithet maybe a fancy at most a sonnet nothing strike one more unless perhaps the obverse when we see some trifling pebble-cast ripple into eternity some fateful second prolific as the fly aphis and so i find it all again example in these old account the book that mean most for narcissus to-day could be carry in the hand without a strap and could probably be buy for a sovereign the rest have survive as a quaint cadence in he style have leave cling about he thought a delicate incense of mysticism or be bind up in the retrospective tenderness of boyish love long since go to dream another observation in the same line of reflection also must often strike one : -- for what very different quality than those for which we be first passionate do we come afterwards to value we old enthusiasm in the day of they bloom it be the thing itself the craze the study for its own sake now it be the discipline or any broad human culture in which they may have be influential the boy chase the butterfly and think not of the wood and the blue heaven but those only do the man remember for the mark of they beauty upon he so unconsciously impressed for the health of they power and sweetness still live in he blood -- for these do that chase seem alone of worth when the dusty entomological relic thereof be in limbo and so that long and costly shelf groan beneath the weight of grose and dugdale and many a mighty slab of topographical prose those pilgrimage to remote parish church with all they attendant ardor of careful ` rubbing ' those notebook fill with patient datum those long letter to brother antiquary -- of sixteen even that famous exshire tour itself which be to have rival pennant 's own -- what remain to show where this old passion stand with all the clustering foliage of a dream what but that quaint cadence i speak of and a anecdote or two which seem but of little import then with such breathless business afoot as a old font or a roman road one particular roman road i know be but remember now because in the rich twilight of a old June evening it lead up the gorsy stretch of lancashire ` height ' to a solemn plateau wide and solitary as salisbury plain from the dark border of which a warm human note against the lonely infinite of heath and sky beam the little whitewashed ` traveller 's rest ' its yellow light grow stronger as the dusk deepen meet the eye with a sense of companionship become a vague need just then the seem spiritual significance of such forlorn waste of no-man 's land have i know a specially strong appeal for narcissus and in some mood the challenge which they seem to call from some ` dark tower ' of spiritual adventure would have lead he wander there till star-light but a day of rambling alone in a strange country among unknown face bring a social hunger by evening and a craving for some one to speak to and a voice in return become almost a fear a bright kitchen-parlour warm with the health of six workman group round a game of domino and one huge quart pot of ale use among they as woman in the early world be a grateful inglenook indeed wherein to close the day of course friend n join they and take he pull and pay he round like a walt whitman i like to think of he slight figure amongst they he delicate almost girl-like profile against theirs he dreamy eye and pale brow surmount by one of those dark cluster of hair in which the finger of woman love to creep -- a incongruity though of surface only which certain who know he but ` by sight ' as the phrase be might be at a loss to understand that be one of the surprise of he constitution nature have give he the dainty and dreamy form of the artist to which habit have add a bookish touch end in a _ tout ensemble _ of gentleness and distinction with little apparent affinity to a scene like that in the ` traveller 's rest ' but there be many whom a suspicion of the dilettante in such a exterior belie and narcissus be one of they he have very strongly develop that instinct of manner to which sympathy be a daily courtesy and he thus readily when it suit he could take the complexion of he company and he capacity of ` bend ' be well-nigh genius of course all this be but to say that he be a gentleman yet be not that in itself a fine kind of originality besides he have a genuine appetite for the thing of earth such as many another delicate thing -- a damask rose-bush for example -- must be convict of too and often when some one have ask he ` what he could have in common with so-and-so ' i have hear he answer : ` tobacco and beer ' samuel dale once describe he as shelley with a chin and perhaps the chin account for the absence of any of those sentimental scruple with regard to beefsteak and certain variety of joke for which the saint-like deserter of harriet westbrook be distinguish a supremely quaint instance of this gift of accommodation befall during that same holiday which should not pass unrecorded but which i offer to the reader with a emphatic _ honus soit qui mal y pense _ despairing of reach a certain large manufacturing town on foot in time to put up there one evening he be do the last mile or two by rail and as the train slacken speed he turn to he companion in the carriage to enquire if they could tell he of a good hotel he have but carelessly notice they before : a old man a slight young woman of perhaps thirty and a girl about fifteen work people evidently but mark by that air of cleanly poverty which in some seem but a touch of ascetic refinement the young woman at once mention _ the bull _ and thereupon a little embarrassed consultation in undertone seem to pass between she and the old man result in a timid question as to whether narcissus would mind put up with they as they be poor folk and could well do with any little he care to offer for he accommodation there be something of a sad winningness in the woman which have predispose he to the group and without hesitation he at once accept and soon be walk with they to they home through street echo with lancashire ` clog ' on the way he learn the circumstance of he companion the young woman be a widow and the girl she daughter both work through the day at one of the great cotton mill while the old man father and grandfather stay at home and ` fend ' for they thus they manage to live in a comfort which though straiten do not deny they such a occasional holiday as to-day have be or the old man the comfort of tobacco the home be very small but clean and sweet and it be not long before they be all sit down together over a tea of wholesome bread and butter and egg in the preparation of which it seem odd to see the old man take he share that over he and narcissus sit to smoke and talk of the neighbouring countryside n on the look-out for folk-lore and especially for any sign in he companion of a linger loyalty of belief in the tradition thereabout a loyalty which have something in it of a sacred duty to he in those day those be the day when he still turn to the east a-sunday and go out in the early morning with herrick under he arm to gather may-dew with a great uplifting of the spirit in what indeed be a very real act of worship but to my story as bedtime approach narcissus could not but be aware of a grow uneasiness in the manner of the young woman at last it be explain with blush effort she stammer out the question : would he object to share he bed with -- the old man ` of course not ' answer n at once as though he have all the time intended do that very thing and indeed think it the most delightful arrangement in the world so up to bed go the oddly consorted pair but the delicious climax be yet to come on enter the room narcissus find that there be two bed there why should we leave that other bed empty -- he have almost ask but a laugh wonder shot through he and he stop in time the old man be soon among the blanket but narcissus dally over undress look at this and that country quaintness on the wall and then while he be in a state of half man and half trousers the voice of the woman call from the foot of the stair : be they in bed yet ` surely it can not be it be too irresistibly simple ' be he thought but he have immediately answer ` in a moment ' as if such a question be quite a matter of course in that space he have blow the candle out and be by the old man 's side : and then in the darkness he hear the two woman ascend the stair just outside he door which he have leave ajar they seem to turn off into a small adjoining room from whence come immediately the soft delicious sound of female disrobe they be but factory woman yet narcissus thought of saint agne and madeline we may be sure and then at last -- indeed there be to be no mistake about it -- the door be softly push open and two dim form whisper across to the adjoining bed and after a little preliminary rustle settle down to a rather flutter breathing no one have speak : not even a goodnight but narcissus could hardly refrain from ring out a great mirthful cry while he heart beat strangely and the darkness seem to ripple like sunlight in a cup with suppress laughter the thought of the little innocent deception as to they sleeping-room which poverty have cause they to practice probably hold the breath of the woman while the shyness of sex be a common bond of silence -- at least on the part of the three younger it be long before narcissus be able to fall asleep for he keep picture the elder woman with burn cheek and open eye in a kind of ` listen fear ' beneath the coverlet and the oddity of the thing be so original so like some _ conte _ of a _ decameron _ or _ heptameron _ with the wickedness leave out but at last wonder give place to weariness and sleep begin to make a still odder magic of the situation the difficulty of meeting at breakfast next morning which have at once suggest itself to n 's mind prove a vain fear for when he arise that other bed be as smooth as though it have lie untouched through the night and the daughter of labor have be go two hour but it be not quite without sign that they have go for narcissus have a dreamlike impression of open he eye in the early light to find a sweet woman 's face lean over he and i be sure he want to believe that it have bent down still further till it have kiss he lip -- ' for he mother 's sake ' she have say in she heart as she slip away and be see no more ` if this be fiction instead of a veracious study from life ' to make use of a phrase which one rarely find out of a novel it would be unfitting to let such a incident as that just related fall to the ground except as the seed of future development but this be as i have state there be nothing more to say of that win _ ouvrière _ narcissus see she no more but surely of all man he could best afford that one such pleasant chance should put forth no other blossom save that half-dreamed kiss -- and how can one ever foresee but that we so cherishable spray of bloom may in time add but another branch to that orchard of dead sea fruit which grow inevitably about all man 's dwelling i do not suppose that narcissus be really as exceptional in the number and character of he numerous boyish love as we always regard he as be it be no uncommon matter of course and alas for a youth between the age of seventeen and nineteen to play the juggler at keep three or even half-a-dozen female correspondent go at once each of whom sleep nightly with copious documentary evidence of she sole and incontrovertible possession of the sacred heart nor have narcissus be the only lover i suspect who in the season of the wane of the moon have send such excuse for scrappy epistolary make-shift as ` the strident din of a office a air so cruelly unsympathetic as frost to bud to the blossoming of all those word of love that press for birth ' when as a matter of fact he have be unblushingly eat the lotus in the laziest chair at home in the quietest night of summer such insincerity be a common beset sin of the young male invariably i almost think if he have the artistic temperament yet i do not think it present itself to he mind in its nudity but come clothe with that sophistry in which youth the most thoroughgoing of _ philosophe _ be so ingenious consideration for the beloved object it be call -- yes beloved indeed though such be the paradox in the order of thing but one of the several vestal of the sacred fire one can not help occasional disinclination on a lazy evening confound it but it make one twinge to think of pain she with such a confession and a story of that sort -- well it be a lie of course but it be one without any harm any seed of potential ill in it so the letter go maybe to take its place as the 150th of the sacred writings and make poor daffodilium who have love to count the grow score happy with the completion of the half-century but the disinclination go not though the poor passion have of course its occasional leaping in the socket and the pain have to come at last for all that dainty consideration which moreover have be all the time feed larger capacity for suffer for of course no man think of marry he twelfth love though in the thirteenth there be usually danger and he who have jilt so to say a earl 's daughter as he sixth may come to see ` the god of love ah benedicite how mighty and how great a lord be he ' in the thirteenth miss simpkin but this be to write as a outsider : for that thirteenth by a mystical process which have give to each of its series in its day the same primal quality be of course not only the last but the first and indeed with little casuistry that thirteenth may be truly hold to be the first for it be a fact determine not so much by the choose maid as by he who choose though he himself be persuade quite otherwise to he he amorous career have be hitherto a unsuccessful pursuit because each follow fair in turn when at length he have catch she fly skirt and look into she face have prove not that ` ideal ' -- ` that not impossible she that shall command my heart and I ' -- but another to be shake free again in disappointment in truth however the lack have be in himself all this time he have yet to learn what loving indeed mean : and he love the thirteenth not because she be pre-eminent beyond the rest but because she have come to he at the moment when that ` lore of love ' have be reveal have any of those earlier maiden fall on the happy conjunction they would doubtless have prove no less loveworthy and seem no less that ` ideal ' which they have since become one may be sure for some other illuminated soul of course some find that love early -- the baby-love whom one never marry and then the faithful service probably it happen so with the majority of man for it be i think especially to the artist nature that it come thus late living so vividly within the circle of its own experience by its very constitution so necessarily egoistic the latter more particularly in its early year be always a narcissus caring for nought or none except in so much as they reflect back its own beauty or its own dream the face such a youth look for as he turn the coy capture head to meet he glance be quite unconsciously he own and the ` ideal ' he seek be but the perfect mirror yet it be not that mirror he marry after all : for when at last he have come to know what that word -- one so distasteful so ` soil ' to he ear ` with all ignoble ' domesticity -- what that word ` wife ' really express he have learn too to discredit those cynical guide of he youth who love so well to write ego as the last word of human nature but the particular narcissus of whom i write be a long way off that thirteenth maid in the day of he antiquarian ramble and he pagan-catholic ardor and the above digression be at least out of date a copy of keat which i have by I as i write be a memorial of one of the pretty love typical of that period it be mark all through in black lead -- not so gracefully as one would have expect from the ` taper finger ' which hold the pencil but rather it would appear more with regard to emphasis than grace narcissus have lend it to the queen of the hour with special instruction to that end so that when it come to he again he might ravish he soul with the hug assurance give by the thick lead to certain ecstatic line of _ endymion _ such as -- ` my soul doth melt for the unhappy youth ' ` he surely can not now thirst for another love ' and luxuriate in a genial sense of godship where the tremulous pencil have leave the record of a sigh against -- ` each tender maiden whom he once think fair ' but it be a magnanimous godship and after a moment 's lean back with closed eye to draw in all the sweet incense how nobly would he act in imaginative vignette the king cophetua to this poor suppliant of love with what a generous waive of he power -- and with what a grace -- do he see himself raise she from she knee and seat she at he right hand yet those pencil-mark alas mark but a secondary interest in that volume a little sketch on the fly-leaf ` by another hand ' witness the prettier memory a sacred valley guard by smooth green hill in the midst a little lake feed at one end by a singing stream swallow at the other by the roar darkness of a mill green rush prosperous in the shallows and along the other bank a old hedgerow a little island in the midst circle by silver lily and in the distance rise from out a cloud of tangled green above the little river a old church tower below though not ` in the picture ' a quaint country house surround by a garden of fair fruit-tree and wonderful bower through which run the stream free once again and singing for joy of the light in the great lone house a solitary old man cherish and rule by -- ` the miller 's daughter ' be scene ever more in need of a fairy prince narcissus sigh as he break upon it one rosy evening to think what little mean all its beauty have suffer that lack but as he have come thither with the purpose at once firm and vague of give it a memory he could afford to sigh till morning 's light bring maybe the opportunity of that transfigure action he be to spend a easter fortnight there as the guest of some farmer-relative with whom he have stay year before in a period to which be nineteen he already allude as he ` boyhood ' and it be not quite accurate to say that it have no memory for he for he bring with he one of that very miller 's daughter though indeed it be of the shadowiest silver it have chance at that early time that a influx of visitor to the farm have exceed the sleep room and he and another little fellow have be provide with a bed in the miller 's house he have never quite forget that bedroom -- its huge old-fashioned four-poster slumbrous with great dark hanging such as queen elizabeth seem always to have sleep in its wall dim with tapestry and its screen of antique bead-work but it be round the toilet table that memory grow brightest for thereon be a crystal phial of a most marvellous perfume and two great mother-of-pearl shell shed a mystical radiance -- the most commonplace rimmel 's without doubt and the shell ` dreadful ' one may be sure but to he as he take a reverent breath of that phial it seem the very sweetbriar fragrance of she gown that catch he sense and surely he never in all the world find scent like that again thus long after she would come to he in day-dream waft on its strange sweetness and clothe about with that mystical lustre of pearl there be five year between he and that memory as he step into that enchanted land for the second time the sweet figure of young womanhood to which he have turn he boyish soul in hopeless worship when it should have be busy rather with bird ' nest and rabbit-snare have it be true come to he in dimmer outline each spring but with magic the deeper for that as the form fade from the silver halo and pass more and more into mythology it seem indeed as if she have never live for he at all save in dream or on another star still he memory hold by those great shell and he have come at last to the fabled country on the perilous quest -- who of we dare venture such a one to-day -- of a ` lose saint ' enquiry of he friend that evening cautious as of one on some half-suspected diplomacy tell he that one with the name of he remembrance do live at the mill-house -- with a old father too but how all the beauty of the singing morning become a scentless flower when on make the earliest possible call he be meet at the door with that hollow word ` away ' -- a word that seem to echo through long room of infinite emptiness and turn the daylight shabby -- till the addendum ` for the day ' set the bird singing again and call the sunshine back a few night after he be sit at she side by a half-opened window with he arm about she waist and she head thrillingly near he with he pretty gift of recitation he be pour into she ear that sugared passage in _ endymion _ appropriately begin ' o know unknown ' previously ` get up ' for the purpose but alas not too perfectly to prevent a break-down though fortunately at a point that admit a ready turn to the dilemma : -- ` still let I entwine thee surer surer ' here exigency compel n to make surety doubly yea trebly sure but memory still forsake he the rascal have put deeper and deeper significance into he voice with each repetition drop it altogether as he draw she close to he and seem to fail from the very excess of love a hour after he be bound into the moonlight in a intoxication of triumph she be win the beckon wonder have come down to he and yet it be real moonlight -- be not that he own grace in silhouette make a mirror even of the hard road -- real grass over which he have softly stept from she window real tree all real except -- yes be it real love in the life of all passionate lover of woman there be two broadly-marked period and in some a third : slavery lordship and service the first be the briefest and the third perhaps seldom come the second be the most familiar awakening like we forefather from the deep sleep of childish thing the boy find a be by he side of a strange hushing fairness as though in the night he have open he eye and find a angel by he bed speech he have not at all and he glance dare not rise beyond she bosom till the presence seem gracious he dare at length stretch out he hand and touch she gown whereon a inexplicable new joy tremble through he as though he stand naked in a may meadow through the golden rain of a summer shower should she finger touch he arm by chance it be as though they sweep a harp and a music of pierce sweetness run with a sudden cry along he blood but by and by he come to learn that he have make a comical mistake about this wonder with he head bent low in worship he have not see the wistfulness of she gaze on he and one day lo it be she who press close to he with the timid appeal of a fawn indeed she have all this time be to he as some beautiful woodland creature might have seem break for the first time upon the sight of primitive man fear wonder inexpressible worship till a sudden laughing thought of comprehension then a lordly protectiveness and after that -- the hunt at once the masculine self-respect return and the wonder though no less sweet in itself become but another form of tribute with narcissus this evolution have take place early : it be very long ago -- he feel old even then to think of it -- since hesperus have sing like a nightingale above he first kiss and he memory count many trophy of lordship but surely this last be of all the starriest perhaps indeed so wonderful be it it might prove the very love which would bring back again the dream that have seem lose for ever with the passing of that mythical first maid so long ago a love in which worship should be all once more and godship none at all but be not such a question all too certainly its own answer nay narcissus if indeed you find that wonder-maid again you will not question so you will forget to watch that graceful shadow in the moonlight you will but ask to sit by she silent as of old to follow she to the end of the world ah I ` how many queen have rule and pass since first we meet how thick and fast the letter use to come at first how thin at last then cease and winter for a space until another hand bring spring into the land and go the season ' pace ' that miller 's daughter although ` so dear so dear ' why of course she be not that maid : but again the silver halo have grow about she again narcissus ask himself ` do she live or do i dream ' again she come to he at while waft on that strange incense and clothe about in that mystical lustre of pearl doubtless she live in that fabled country still : but narcissus have grow sadly wise since then and he go on pilgrimage no more chapter v a idyll of alice sunshine which really belong to the last chapter if the reader have hear enough of the amourette of the young gentleman upon whose memoirs i be engage let he skip this chapter and pass to the graver chapter beyond my one aim be the reader 's pleasure and i carry my solicitude so far that if he find he happiness to lie outside these page altogether have no choice among these various chapter but prefer none to any i be quite content such a spirit of self-abnegation the reader must admit be true love perhaps it be a early unconscious birth-impulse of the true love some day to be bear in he heart that cause narcissus to make a confession to he miller 's daughter on one of they pretty decorative evening when they sit together at the fireside while the scent of the climb rose and the light of the climb moon come in at the window the immediate effect of the confession be -- no wonder -- to draw tear and how beautiful she look in tear who would dive for pearl when the pearl-fishery of a woman 's eye be he to rifle beautiful beautiful tear flow on -- no dull leaden rain no mere monotonous deluge but a living singing fountain crown with such rainbow as hang rose and star in the fine mist of samite waterfall irradiate by gleam shaft of lovely anger and scorn like northern light on autumn evening the maiden 's eye pierce narcissus through and through with many-coloured spear there be thunder too the earth shake -- just a little : but soon narcissus see the white dive of peace fly to he through the glance shower for all she sorrow he be the peace of confession he little lie have be acknowledge he treason self-betrayed and it be this i have hint that narcissus like the catholic church worship many saint at this time one of they by a thrilling coincidence chance to have she shrine at a boarding-school some fifteen mile or so from the mill-pond on whose bank the miller 's daughter have draw into she lovely face so much of the beauty of the world alice sunshine shall we call she be perhaps more of a cherub than a saint a rosy laughing plump little arrangement of sunshiny pink and white flesh with blue eye and golden hair alice be not overburdened with intellectuality and like other of she sex she heart be nothing like so soft as she bosom narcissus have first be in love with she sister but he and the sister -- a bud woman of the world -- have soon agree that they be not bear for each other and narcissus have make the transfer of he tragic passion with inexpensive informality as the late anthony trollope would finish one novel to-night and begin another to-morrow morning so would narcissus be off with the old love this Sunday and visibly on with the new the next dear little plump vegetable-marrow alice will narcissus ever forget that Sunday night when the church have at last release its weary worshipper he steal not as aforetime to the soft side of emily but to the still softer side of the little bewildered alice for though alice have worship he all the time and certainly during the whole of the service she have never dare to hope that he would pass she dash dark-eyed sister to love _ she _ -- little blonde phlegmatic blue-eyed alice but apollo be bent on the capture of he daphne truth to say it be but the work of a moment the golden arrow be in she heart the wound kiss whole again and the new heaven and the new earth all arrange for in hardly longer time than it take to tell in youth the mystery of woman be still so fresh and new that to make a fuss about a particular woman seem like look a gift-horse of the god in the mouth the light on the face of womanhood in general be so bewilderingly beautiful that the young man literally can not tell one woman from another they be all equally wonderful masculine observation lead one to suppose that woman 's first vision of man similarly preclude discrimination ah I it be easy to laugh to-day but it be heart -- bleeding tragedy when those power that ought not to be decree alice 's exile to a boarding-school in some central africa of the midland county the hemorrhage of those two young heart but for a time each plaster the other 's wound with letter -- dear letter -- letter every post for the postal authority make no objection to narcissus corresponding with two or more maiden at once and it be only fair to alice to say that she know as little of the miller 's daughter as the miller 's daughter know of she so when narcissus be recite _ endymion _ to he miller 's maid it be not without a minor chord plain through the major harmony of the present happiness the sense that alice be but fifteen mile away -- so near she could almost hear he if he call -- only fifteen mile away and it be a long three month since they have meet it now become necessary to admit a prosaic fact hitherto conceal from the reader narcissus ride a bicycle it be i must confess a rather ` modern ' thing to do but surely the flash airy wheel be the most poetical mode of locomotion yet invent and one look more like a fairy prince than ever in knickerbockers whenever narcissus turn he gleaming spoke along some map but none the less mysterious county -- road he think of lohengrin in he barge draw by white swan to he mystic tryst he think of the seven-leagued boot the fly carpet the wishing-cap and the wooden pegasus -- so call because it mount into the cloud on the turning of a peg as he pass along by mead and glade he wheel sing to he and he sing to he wheel it be a daisied daisied world there be buttercup and violet in it too as he speed along in the early morning of a unforgotten easter Sunday draw so he have shamelessly tell he miller 's daughter by antiquarian passion to visit the famous old parish church near which alice be at school antiquarian passion well certainly it be a antiquarian passion now but then -- how he heart beat how he eye shine as with burn kohl that there be anything to be ashamed of in this steal ride never even occur to he and perhaps there be little wrong in it after all perhaps when the secret of all heart be reveal it will come out that the miller 's daughter take the opportunity to meet narcissus ' understudy -- who can tell but the wonderful fresh morning-scented air be a delicious fact beyond dispute that be sincere ah there use to be real morning then -- not merely interrupted night and it be the easter-morning of romance there be a sweet passionate sabbath-feeling everywhere sabbath-bell and sabbath-bird and sabbath-flower there be even a feeling of restful sabbath-cheer about the old inn where at last enter with much awe the village where alice nightly sleep -- clothe in white samite mystic wonderful -- narcissus provide for the demand of romance by a hearty country breakfast a manna of blessing seem to lie thick upon every thing the very ham and egg seem as if they have be bless by the pope it be yet a hour to church-time a hour usually one of spiteful alacrity but this morning it seem in defiance of the clock cruelly unpunctual after breakfast narcissus stroll about the town and inquire the way to miss curlpaper 's school it stand outside the little town it be point out to he in the distance across billowy cloud of pear and apple-blossom make the hollow in which the town nestle seem a vast pot-pourri jar overflow with newly gather rose-leaf have the miller 's daughter be able to watch he movement she would have remark that he antiquarian ardor draw he not to the church but to a sombre many-windowed house upon the hill narcissus reconnoitr the prison-like edifice from behind a hedge then summon courage to walk past with slow nonchalance all be as dead and dull as though alice be not there yet somewhere within those prison-wall she young beauty be dress itself to meet the spring perhaps in delicious linen soft and white she be dash cool water about she rosebud face or flush with exhilaration be pin up the golden fleece of she hair perhaps she be eat wonderful bacon and egg could she be think of he she little know how near he be to she he have not write of he come letter at miss curlpaper 's have to pass a inspection much more rigorous than the custom but still smuggling be not unknown for success however carefully lay plan and regular date be necessary and narcissus ' visit have fall between the date no there be no sign of she she be as invisible as the moon at mid-day and there be the church-bell begin to call she : ` alice alice put on you thing ' ` alice alice put on you thing the bird be call the church bell ring the sun be shine and i be here wait -- and wait -- for you my dear alice alice doff you gown of night draw on you bodice as lily white draw on you petticoat clasp you stay -- oh alice alice those milky way alice alice how long you be the hour be late and the church be far slowly more slowly the church bell ring -- alice alice put on you thing ' really it be not in narcissus ' plan to wait at the school till alice appear the miss curlpaper be terrible unknown quantity to he for a girl to have a boy hang about the premise be a capital crime he know boy be to girl ' school what anarchist be to public building they come under the explosive act it be not indeed within the range of he hope that he might be able to speak to alice a look a long immortal all-expressive look be all he have travel fifteen mile to give and win for that he would have travel fifteen hundred he idea be to sit right in front of the nave where alice could not miss see he -- where other could see he too in he pretty close-fitting suit of lincoln green so down through the lane he go among the pear and apple orchard from out whose blossom the clang tower of the old church jut sheer like some bass rock amid rosy clustering billow they love have be closely associate from its beginning with the sacred thing of the church so regular have be they attendance not only on sunday but at week-night service to alice and narcissus there be two sabbath in the week Sunday and Wednesday i suppose they be far from be the only young people interested in they particular form of church-work leander meet hero it will be remember on the way to church and the reader may recall marlowe 's beautiful description of she dress upon that fatal morning : ` the outside of she garment be of lawn the lining purple silk with gilt star draw she wide sleeve green and border with a grove where venus in she naked glory strove to please the careless and disdainful eye of proud adoni that before she lie she kirtle blue whereon be many a stain make with the blood of wretched lover slay ' alice wear pretty dress too if less elaborate and despite its change of name be not the church where she and narcissus meet as the church wherein hero and leander first look upon each other the temple of love certainly the country church to which narcissus self-consciously pass through group of sunday-clothed villager be deck as for no christian festival this sabbath morning the garland that twine about the old norman column the clump of primrose and violet that spring at they foot as at the root of gigantic beech the branch of palm and black-thorn that transform the chancel to a bower : probably for more than know it these symbol of the joy and beauty of earth have simpler more instinctive meaning than those of any arbitrary creed for other in the church besides narcissus no doubt they speak of young love the bloom and the fragrance thereof of mate bird and pair man and maid of the eternal principle of loveliness which in spite of winter and of wrong bring flower and face to bless and beautify this church of the world as narcissus sit in he front row he eye draw up in a prayer to the paint glory of the great east window he whole soul lift up on the wing of color scent and sound -- the whole sacred house have but one meaning : just he love for alice nothing in the world be too holy to image that the window the music the flower all be metaphor of she : and as the organ swirl he soul along in the rapid of its passionate prayerful sound it seem to he that alice and he already stand at the gate of heaven presently across he mingled sensation come a measure tramp as of boy-soldier march in line you have hear it you have _ listen _ for it it be the dear unmistakable sound of a girl ' school on the march quickly it come nearer it be in the porch -- it be in the church narcissus give a swift glance round he dare not give a real search look yet he heart beat too fast he cheek burn too red but he see it be a detachment of girl -- it certainly be alice 's school then come the white-robed chorister and the white-haired priest : _ if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth be not in we but if we confess we sin he be faithful and just to forgive we we sin and to cleanse we from all unrighteousness _ dearly beloved brethren he heart swell with a sob exaltation of worship such as he have not know for year you could hardly have believe that a little apple-dumpling of a pink and white girl be the real inspirer of that look in he young face that make old lady even more than young one gaze at he and remark afterwards on the strange boy with the lovely spiritual expression but all the time narcissus feel that alice 's great eye be on he glowing with glad surprise the service proceed but yet he forbear to seek she he take a delight in husband he come joy he would not crudely snatch it it would be all the sweeter for wait and the fire in alice 's eye would all the time be grow softer and softer he nearly look as he think of that and surely that be she dear voice call to he in the secret language of the psalm he sing back to she with a wild rapture thus the morning star sing together he think and when the prayer lay lovely hand across the eye of the worshipper still he seek not alice but pray for she as perhaps only a boy can : o lord god be good to alice -- already she be one of thy angel may she life be fill with light and joy and if in the time to come i be worthy of be ever by she side may we live we life together high and pure and holy as always in thy sight lord thou knowest how pure be my love how i worship she as i worship the holy angel themselves but whatsoever be imperfect perfect by the inspiration of thy holy spirit so pray the soul of the boy for the soul of the girl and he eye fill with tear as he pray the cup of the wonder and holiness of the world run over already it seem that alice and he lay clasp together in the arm of god so narcissus pray and sing he love in term of a alien creed he sing of the love of christ he think but of the love of alice and still he refrain from pluck that wonderful passion-flower of she glance at length he have wait the whole service through and with the last hallowed vibration of the benediction he turn he eye brimful of love-light greedily eagerly fearful lest one single ray should be waste on intermediate and irrelevant worshipper wonderful eye of love -- but alas where be they alice wildly they glance along the rosy rank of chubby girlhood but where be they alice and then the rank form in line and once more the sound the ecstatic sound it have seem but a short time before of girl march -- but no -- no -- there be no alice in sick despair narcissus stalk that amazonian battalion crouch behind hedge drop into by-lanes lurk in coppice -- he hold he breath as they pass two and two within a yard of he two follow two but still no alice narcissus lay in wait dinnerless all that afternoon he walk about that dreary house like a patrol till at last he be observe of the inmate and knot of girl gather at the window -- alas only to giggle at he forlorn and desperate appearance still there be no alice and then it begin to rain and he become aware how hungry he be so he return to he inn with a sad heart and all the time poor little alice lay in bed with a sore throat oblivious of those passionate boyish eye that you would have think must have pierce the very wall of she seclusion and after all it be not she voice narcissus have hear in the church it be but the still sweeter voice of he own heart chapter vi the sibylline book i hope it will be allow to I that i treat the reader with all respectful courtesy and that i be well breed enough to assume he familiar with all manner of exquisite experience though in my heart i may be no less convinced that he have probably go through life with nothing worth call experience whatsoever it be we jaunty modern fashion and i follow it so far as i be able i take for grant for instance that every man have at one time or another -- in he salad day you know before he be embark in he particular provision business -- have foolish yearning towards poesy i respect the mythical dream of he ` young day ' i assume that he have be really in love but pray press I not too curiously as to whether i believe it all as to whether i really imagine that he youth know other dream than those of the foolish young ` masherdom ' one meet in the train every morning or that he have marry a wife for other than purely ` masculine ' reason these matter i do not mind leave in the form of a postulate -- let they be grant : but that every man have at one time or another have the craze for save the world i will not assume narcissus take it very early and though he have be silent concern he mission for some time and when last we hear of it have considerably modify he propaganda he still cherish it somewhere in secret i have little doubt and one may not be surprise one of these day to find it again burst out ` into sudden flame ' he spiritual experience have probably be the deepest and keenest of he life i do not propose to trace he evolution from anabaptism to agnosticism the step of such development be comparatively familiar they have be trace by greater pen than mine the ` mean ' may vary but the process be uniform whether a man desert the ancestral brahminism that have so long be ` good enough for he parent ' and listen to the voice of the buddhist missionary or join lucian in the seat of the scornful shrugging at augur and philosopher alike whether it be voltaire or tom paine or thoma carlyle or walt whitman or a socialist tract that be the emancipator the emancipation be all one the seed that be to rend the rock come in all manner of odd and often unremembered way but somehow it be there rain and dew unnoticed feed it and surely one day the rock be rent the light be pour in and we be free it be often a matter of anguish that strive as we may it be impossible to remember what help hand it be that sow for we we fickle memory seem to convict we of ingratitude and yet we know how far that sin be from we and how if those sower could but be reveal to we we would fall upon they neck or at they foot i talk of this one day with narcissus and some time after he send I a few note head ` spiritual pastor ' in which he have strive to follow the beautiful example set by marcus aurelius in the anxiously loving acknowledgment with which he open he meditation i know he regard it as miserably inefficient but as it do actually indicate some of the more individual side of he experience and be moreover characteristic in its style i shall copy a few passage from it here : -- ` to some person or person unknown exceed gratitude for the suggestion in some dim talk antenatal it would almost seem that roman catholic might after all be save bless fecundate suggestion that be the earliest loophole ` to my father i owe a mind that once set on a clue must follow it if need be to the nethermost darkness though he have choose to restrict the operation of he own within certain limit and to my mother a natural lean to the transcendental side of a alternative which have save I so many a time when reason have throw I into the abyss but one 's greatest debt to a good mother must be simply -- herself ` to the rev father ignatius for he earnest preach which might almost have make I a monk have not thomas carlyle and he _ hero _ especially the lecture on mahomet give I to understand the true significance of a messiah ` to bulwer for he _ zanonus _ which first give I a hint of the possible natural supernatural and thus for ever save I from dogmatise in negative against the transcendental ` to sir edwin arnold for he _ light of asia _ also to mr sinnett for he _ esoteric buddhism _ book which come to I about the same time together with some other like they first give some occupation to a unchartered freedom gain in many forget step in the form of a faith which transfigure my life for many month into the most beautiful enthusiasm a man could know -- and which have almost send I to the himalaya ` that it do not quite achieve that though much of the light it give I still remain i owe to rm who with no dialectic but with one bald question and the reading of one poem rob I of my fairy palace of oriental speculation in the twinkling of a eye why it go i have never really quite known but surely it be go and the wind and the bare star-light be alone in its place ` dear mac i have not see you for ever so long and surely you have forget how that night long ago you ask with such a strange almost childlike simplicity : _ be _ there a soul but i have not forget nor how i make no answer at all but only staggered and how with you strange dreamy voice you chant for comfort : -- ` this hot hard flame with which we body burn will make some meadow blaze with daffodil ay and those argent breast of thine will turn to water-lily the brown field man till will be more fruitful for we love to-night : nothing be lose in nature all thing live in death 's despite \* \* \* \* \* ` so when man bury we beneath the yew thy crimson-stained mouth a rose will be and thy soft eye lush blue-bell dim with dew and when the white narcissus wantonly kiss the wind its playmate some faint joy will thrill we dust and we will be again fond maid and boy ' how my heart leap up to think of that grand living after death in beast and bird and flower when this cup be fill too full of spirit burst for breath and with the pale leaf of some autumn day the soul earth 's earliest conqueror become earth 's last great prey ' o think of it we shall inform ourselves into all sensuous life the goat-foot faun the centaur or the

firmly on earth for the first time there be great darkness with I for many week but as it lift the earth seem greener than ever of old the sunshine a goodlier thing and verily a blessedness indeed to draw the breath of life i have learn the value and significance of flesh i no longer scorn a carnal diet and once again i turn my eye on the damsel in the street ` but a influence soon come to I that keep I from go all the way with you and teach I to say i know not where you would say it be not blessing on thee who do throw a rainbow that may mean a promise across the void that awake the old instinct of faith within I and have leave I a agnostic with a faith quite content with the brown earth if that be all but with the add significance a mystery give to living -- thou who first do teach I love 's lore aright to thee do i owe this thing ` to jaw i owe the first great knowledge of that other love between man and man which whitman have since teach we to call the dear love of comrade and to he i owe that i never burn those early rhyme or break my little reed -- a unequivocal service to I whatever the public should it be consult may think ` to a dear sister i owe that still more exquisite and subtle comradeship which can only exist between man and woman but from which the more disturbing element of sex must be absent and here let I also thank god that i be bring up in quite a garden of good sister ` to messr c and w solicitor and notary i owe albeit i will say no thanks to they the opportunity of that hardly learn good which dwell for those who can wrest it in a hateful taskwork that faculty of detachment which marcus aurelius learn so long ago by means of which the soul may withdraw into a inaccessible garden and sing while the head bend above a ledger or in other word the faculty of dream with one side of the brain while calculate with the other mr brown 's great _ aurora leigh _ help I more to the attainment of that than any book i know ` in they office too among many other great thing i learn that a man may be a good fellow and hate poetry -- possibility undreamed of by sentimental youth also that messr bass and cope be not unworthy of they great reputation and i have various nonsense knock out of I though they never succeed in persuade I in that little matter of the ambrosial curl ` through samuel dale i first come to understand how whatever be _ can _ be best and also win a faith in god which i rather catch by infection than gain by any process of he reasoning of all else i owe to samuel how write he know ` to a certain friend mention last because he be not least i owe : the sum of ten pound and a loving companionship up hill and down dale for which again i have no word and no -- sovereign ' when i first read through these i be somewhat surprise at the omission of all reference to book which i know marked most striking period in narcissus ' spiritual life : _ sartor resartus _ thoreau 's _ walden _ for example mr pater 's _ marius the epicurean _ and browning 's _ dramati persona _ as i reflect however i come to the conclusion that such omission be but justice to he own individuality for none of these book have create a _ initiative _ in narcissus ' thought but rather come as after all i suppose they come to most of we as great confirm expression of state of mind at which he have already arrive though as it be but by moonlight in they be the sunrise bring all into clear sight and sure knowledge it would seem indeed that the growth of the soul in the higher spirit of we race be analogous to the growth of a child in the womb in this respect : that in each case the whole gamut of earlier type be run through before the ultimate form be attain in which it be decree that the particular vital energy shall culminate and as in the physical world the various ` halt ' so to say of the progress be illustrate by the co-existence and continual succession of those earlier type so in the world of mind at every point of spiritual evolution a man may meet with a historical individuality who be a concrete embodiment of the particular state to which he have just attain this of course be what goethe mean when he refer to mysticism as be a frame of mind which one could experience all round and then leave behind to quote whitman in another connection : -- ` we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond ' but a individuality must ` crystallise out ' somewhere and its final value will not so much depend on the number of state it have pass through as how it have live each on the way with what depth of conviction and force of sincerity for a modern young man to thus experience all round and pass and continue beyond where such great one as st bernard pascal and swedenborg have anchor they starry soul to shine thence upon man for all time be no uncommon thing it be more the rule than the exception : but one would hardly say that in go further they have go higher or end greater the footpath of pioneer individualism must inevitably become the highway of the race every american be not a columbus there be two way in which we may live we spiritual progress : as critic or poet most man live theirs in that critical attitude which refuse to commit itself which taste all but enjoy none but the greatest in that earnest final rooted creative fashion which be the way of the poet the one be as a man who spend he day pass from place to place in search of a dwelling to he mind but die at last in a inn have know nought of the settle peace of a home but the other howsoever often he have to change he quarter for howsoever short a time he may remain in any one of he resting-place make of each a home with root that shoot in a night to the foundation of the world and blossom branch that mingle with the star criticism be a good thing but poetry be a better indeed criticism properly _ be _ not it be but a process to a end we could really do without it much better than we imagine : for after all the question be not so much _ how _ we live but _ do _ we live who would not a hundred time rather be a fruitful parsee than a barren _ philosophe _ yes all lie of course in original greatness of soul and there be really no state of mind which be not like hamlet 's pipe -- if we but know the ` touch of it ' ` it will discourse most eloquent music ' now it be that great sincerity in narcissus that have always make we take he so seriously and here i would remark in parenthesis that trivial surface insincerity such as we have have glimpse of in he dealings do not affect such a great organic sincerity as i be speaking of they be excrescence which the great central health will sooner or later clear away it be because he never hold a opinion to which he be not when call upon practically faithful never dream a dream without at once set about its translation into daylight never profess a creed for a week without some essay after the realisation of its new ideal it be because he have the power and the courage to glow mightily and to some purpose because he life have a fiery center which he eye be not afraid of reveal -- that i speak of he great sincerity a great capacity for intense life shallow patterer of divine creed be therefore most abhorrent to he ` you must excuse I sir ' i remember he once say to such a one ` but what be you do with cigarette and salutari if i hold such a belief as yours i would stand sandall with a rope round my waist before to-morrow ' one quaint instance of this earnest attitude in all thing occur to I out of he schoolday he be a divine right man a fiery jacobite in those day and probably not without some absurd unconfessed dream in he heart that it might somehow help the dead old cause he one afternoon flutter the hanoverian heart -- all the man we meet in street and mart be hanoverian of course -- of we little literary club by solemnly rise ` to give notice ' that at the follow meeting he would read a paper to prove that ` the house of hanover have no right to the english throne ' great be the excitement through the fortnight intervene extend even to the master and the meeting be a full one and no little stormy narcissus rise with the air of a condemn strafford and with all he boyish armoury of eloquence and scorn fight over again the long-lost battle hiss and groan fall unheeded into the stream of he young voice but vain vain hard be the hanoverian heart in boy as in man and all you glowing period be in vain -- vain as you peroration tell we ` be the blood of gallant heart shed on culloden 's field ' poor n you have but one timorous supporter even I so early you _ fidus achate _ -- but one against so many yet be you crestfallen galileo with he ' e pur si muove ' disraeli with he ` the time will come ' wear such a mien as yours as we turn from that well-foughten field yes and you love to take in earnest vague hanoverian threat of possible arrest for you baby-treason and for some time i know you never pass a policeman without a dignified tremor as of one who might at any moment find a lodging in the tower but the most serious of all n 's ` mad ' enthusiasm be that of which the reader have already receive some hint in the few paragraph of he own confession above that which ` have almost send he to the himalaya ' it belong to nature like he always through life to cherish a half belief in they old fairy tale and a longing however late in the day to prove they true at last to many such the revelation with which madame blavatsky as with some mystic trumpet startle the western world some year ago must have come with most passionate appeal and to narcissus they come like a love arise from the dead long before he have ` sup full ' of all the necromantic excitement that poet or romancer could give guy mannering have introduce he to lilly lytton and hawthorne have send he search in many a musty folio for elixir vita and the stone like scythrop in ` nightmare abbey ' he have for a long period sleep with horrid mystery beneath he pillow but suddenly he interest have fade : these phantom flee before a rationalistic cock-crow and eugenius philalethe and robert fludd go with mejnor and zanonus into a twilight forgetfulness there be no hand to show the hidden way to the land that might be and there be hand beckon and voice call he along the highway to the land that be so dream-light pass he must perforce reconcile himself to daylight with its dusty beam and its narrow horizon judge then with what a leap heart he chance on some newspaper gossip concern the sibyl for it be so that he first stumble across she mission ironical indeed that the so impossible ` key ' to the mystery should come by the hand of ` we own correspondent ' but so it be and that paragraph sell no small quantity of ` occult ' literature for the next twelve month mr sinnett doorkeeper in the house of blavatsky who as a precaution against the vision of bluebeard that the word oriental be apt to conjure up in western mind be always dress in the latest mode and so to say offer he cigar-case along with some horrid mystery -- it be to he prospectus of the new gospel he really delightful page that narcissus first apply then he enter within the gloomier egyptian portal of the _ isis _ itself and from thence -- well in brief he go in for a course of redway and little that figure in that gentleman 's thrilling announcement be long in reach he hand at last a day come when he eye fall upon a notice couch in suitably mysterious term to the effect that really earnest seeker after divine truth might after necessary probation etc join a brotherhood of such -- which it be darkly hint could give more than it dare promise up to this point narcissus have be indecisive he be remember quite in earnest and to actually accept this new evangel mean to he -- well as he say nothing less in the end than the himalaya pend he decision however he have gradually develop a certain austerity and experiment in vegetarianism and though he be oddly enough free of amorous bond that might have hold he to earth yet he have grow to love it rather rootedly since the earlier day when he be a ` seeker ' moreover though he read much of ` the path ' no actual mejnor have yet be reveal to set he foot therein but with this paragraph all indecision soon come to a end he feel there a clear call to neglect which would be to have see the light and not to have follow it ever for he the most tragic error to be make in life he natural predisposition towards it be too great for he to do other than trust this new revelation and now he must gird himself for ` the sacrifice which truth always demand ' but sacrifice of what and for what a undefined social warmth he be begin to feel in the world some meretricious ambition and a great friendship -- to which in the long run would he not be all the truer by the great new power he be to win if hand might no longer spring to hand and friendship vie in little daily act of brotherhood might he not afar on he mountain-top keep loving watch with clearer eye upon the dear life he have leave behind and be its vigilant fate surely and there be nothing worth in life that would not gain by such a devotion all life 's good be of the spirit and to give that a clearer shine even in one soul must help the rest for if its light shine as now through the grimy horn-lantern of the body in narrow lane and along the miasmatic flat of the world even so help man how much more must it rise above that earthly fume in a hidden corner no longer but in the open heaven a star above the city sacrifice yes it be just such a tug as a man in the dark warmth of morning sleep feel it to leave the pillow the mountain-top of morning gleam cold and bare : but o when staff in hand he be out amid the dew the lark rise like fountain above he the gorse bright as a golden fleece on the hill-side and all the world a shine singing vision what thought of the lose warmth then what warmth be not well lose for this keen exhilarated sense in every nerve in limb in eye in brain what potion have sleep like this crystalline air it almost take one 's breath to drink of such a maddening chastity be its grot-cool sparkle what intoxication can she give we for this larger better rapture so do narcissus a old son of the morning figure to himself the struggle and pronounce ` the world well lose ' but i feel as i write how little i can give the reader of all the ` splendid purpose in he eye ' as he make this resolve perhaps i be the less able to do so as -- let I confess -- i also share he dream one could hardly come near he without in some measure do that at all time though with I it could only be a dream for i be not free i have scriptural example to plead ` therefore i can not come ' though in any case i fear i should have hold back for i have no such creative instinct for realisation as narcissus and have i fear dream many a dream i have not the courage even to think of clothing in flesh and blood like may i say the many who be poet for all save song -- poet in chrysali all those who dream of what some do and make the audience of those great articulate one but there be one or two trifling doubt to set at rest before final decision the reader have greatly misconceive narcissus if he have deem he one of those simple soul whom any quack can gull and the good faith of this mysterious fraternity be a difficult point to settle a tentative application through the address give a appropriate _ nom de mystère _ have introduce the ugly detail of preliminary expense divine truth have to pay its postage its rent its tax and so on and the ` guru ' feed not on air -- although of course be a ` guru ' he come as near it as the flesh will allow : therefore and surely reader a guinea per annum be after all reasonable enough suspect as much as one will but how gainsay also before the applicant could be admit to noviciate even he horoscope must be cast and -- well the poor astrologer also need bread and -- no not butter -- five shilling for all he calculation circle and signification -- well that again be only reasonable h be ye-e-s but it be dubious and mad as we be i do not think we ever get outside that dubiety but make up we mind like other convert to gulp the primary postulate and pay the twenty-six shilling from the first however narcissus have never actually entrust all he spiritual venture in this particular craft : he see the truth independent of they not they alone hold she for he though she might hold they and they might be that one of the many avenue for which he have wait to lead he nearer to she heart that be all he belief in the new illumination neither stand nor fall with they though he ardor for it culminate in the experience one must take the most doubtful experiment seriously if we be in earnest for result so next come the sacred name of ` the order ' which reader i can not tell thee as i have never know it narcissus be bind by horrid oath to whisper it to no man and to burn at midnight the paper which give it to he eye from this time also we could exchange no deep confidence of the kind at all for the various mss by means of which he be to begin he excursion into uranium and which he ` guru ' send from time to time -- at first it must be admit with a diligent frequency -- be secret too so several month go by and my knowledge of he ` chela-ship ' be confine to what i could notice and such trifling harmless gossip as ` hear from guru this morning ' ` copy a old m last night ' and so on what i could notice be truly as lamb would say ` great mastery ' for lo narcissus whose eye have never miss a maiden since he could walk and lay in wait to wrest he tribute of glance and blush from every one that pass lo he have change all that and saint anthony in a old master look not more resolutely ` the other way ' than he he very thought crush he flesh with invisible pincers no more softly-scented missive lie upon he desk a-morning and instead of blow out the candle to dream of daffodilium he open he eye in the dark to defy -- the dweller on the threshold if haply he should indeed already confront he one thrilling piece of news in regard to the latter he be unable to conceal he read it out to I one flush morning : -- ' _ i -- have -- see -- he -- and -- be -- he -- master _ ' write the ` guru ' in answer to he neophyte 's half fearful question fitly underline and sufficiently space it be a statement calculate to awe if only by its mendacity i wonder if that chapter of bulwer 's would impress one now as it use to do then it be better perhaps not to try the next news of these mystery be the conclusion of they when so darkly esoteric a body begin to issue a extremely catchpenny ` organ ' with advertisement of theosophic ` developer ' magic mirror and mesmeric disc and also advertise large copy of the dread symbol of the order ` suitable for frame ' at five shilling plain and seven and sixpence color it be of course impossible to take it seriously except in view of a police-court process and one be evidently in the hand of very poor bungler indeed such be the new departure in propaganda institute by a little magazine mean in appearance as the mouthpiece of all despise ` ism ' seem to be with the first number of which need one say end narcissus ' ascent of ` the path ' i do not think he be deeply sad at be disillusionise unconsciously a broader philosophy have slowly be undermine he position and all be ready for the fall it cost no such struggle to return to the world as it have take to leave it for the poet have overgrow the philosopher and the open mystery of the common day be already exercise a appeal beyond that of any melodramatic ` arcana ' of course the period leave its mark upon he but it be most conspicuous upon he bookshelf chapter vii the child of apollo ` he be a _ true _ poet ' or ` he be a _ genuine _ artist ' be phrase which irritate one day after day in modern criticism one have think that ` poet ' and ` artist ' be enough but there must be a need we regretfully suppose for these re-enforcing qualification and there can be but the one that the false in each kind do so exceedingly abound that none can be take as genuine without such special certificate the widespread confusion with the poet of the rhetorician and sentimentalist in verse and again of the mere rhymer without even rhetoric not to refer to finer differentiation of error be also a fruitful source of bewilderment the misuse of the word have parallel : for instance the spurious generic use of the word ` man ' for ` male ' the substitution of ` artist ' for ` painter ' but here we have only to deal with that one particular abuse some rule how to know a poet may conceivably be of interest though of no greater value of course the one first and last test be he work but ` how to know poetry ' be another matter which i do not propose treat of here my intention rather be to dot down a few personal characteristic -- not so much he ` work ' as he ` way ' i write as they come into my head and to any reader about to cry out against digression let I add : i write thinking of narcissus for know all man friend or philistine if you have yet to learn it my narcissus be a poet first as to the great question of ` garment ' the superstition that the hat and the cloak ` do it ' have go out in mockery but only that the other superstition might reign in its stead -- that the hat and cloak can not do it because one great poet dispense with ` pontificals ' and yet bring the fire from heaven henceforward ` pontificals ' be humbug and the wearer thereof but charlatan despite -- ` the master yonder in the isle ' pegasus must pack in favor of a british hunter and even the poet at last wear the smug regimental of mediocrity and mammon ye younger choir especially have a care for though you sing with the tongue of man and angel and wear not a silk hat it shall avail you nothing neither time which be mudie nor eternity which be fame will know you and you verse remain till doom in a ironical _ editio princep _ which not even the foolish bookman shall rescue from the threepenny box it be very unlikely that you will escape as do narcissus for though indeed ` he sweep a fine majestic sweep of toga tennysonian wear strange soft hat that such as you would tremble to be know in ' nevertheless he somehow win happier fate on which perhaps it would be unbecome in so close a friend to dilate the ` true ' poet be first of all a gentleman usually modest never arrogant and only assertive when push he do not by instinct take himself seriously as the ` poet-ape ' doth though if he meet with recognition it become of course he duty to acknowledge he faculty and make good scriptural use of it he be probably least confident however when praise and never except in rare moment especially of eclipse have he a strong faith in the truth that be in he therefore crush he saith the philistine as we crush the vine strike he as one strike the lyre when young he imagine the world to be fill with one ambition later on he find that so indeed it be -- but the name thereof be not poesy strange sigh he and if when he be seventeen he write a fluent song and he fellow-clerk admire it why it be nothing surely the ledger-man have such scrap in he poke or at least can roll off better ` true bard believe all able to achieve what they achieve ' say naddo but lo that ambition be a word that begin with pound and end with penny -- like life quoth the ledger-man who after all have but card-score a tailor 's account and the bill for he wife 's confinement in he pocket all through he life he love he last-written most and no honey of hyblum be so sweet as a new rhyme let no maid hope to rival it with she lip -- she but interrupt : for the travail of a poet be even as that of he wife -- after the pain come that dear joy of a new thing bear into the world which doting sip dream beware to break fifty repetition of the new sweetness fifty deliberate rolling of it under the tongue be i understand the minimum duration of such before the passion be work off and the dream-child really breathe free of its dream-parent i have occasionally come upon narcissus about the twenty-fifth i suppose and wonder at my glum reception ` poetry go sour ' he once give as the reason try it not reader if indeed in thy colony of beaver a poet really dwell he be a bear palaeontologist : that be he can build up a epic from a hint and despite modern instance the old rule obtain for he he need not be learn -- that be not deeply or abundantly only at point -- superficially the superficial would say well yes he have a eye for know what surface mean the secret of the divine rod take it this way we want a expression say of the work of keat want to be tell wherein lie he individuality you take mr buxton forman 's four volume and ` work at ' keat and after thirty night and day bring you essay on the morning of the thirtieth the poet read again the _ grecian urn _ and at eventide write a sonnet and on the morning of the thirty-first essay and sonnet be side by side but by the evening you essay be in limbo -- or in type all be one -- while the sonnet be singing in we heart persistently haunt we brain some day the poet too write a essay and thus plainly show say the essayist how little he really know of the matter -- he do not actually know of the so-and-so -- and yet it be he ignorance that give we that illuminate line after all i doubt if one would be on safe ground in say : take now the subject of wine we all know how abstemious be the poetical habit and yet to read these song one would think 'twas bacchus ' self that write or that clarence who lay down to die in a butt of malmsey though the inference be open to question ' i often wonder if old omar drink one half the quantity he brag in song ' doubtless he sit longest and drink least of all the toper of naishapur and the bell for saki ring not from he corner half often enough to please mine host certainly the longevity of some modern poet can only be account for by some such supposition in they case the proposition be certainly prove inversely in the case of narcissus for he have not write one vinous line and yet -- well and yet furthermore it may interest future biographer to know that in he cup he be wont to recite hamlet 's advice to the player thron upon a tram-car the ` true ' poet make he magic with the least possible ado he and the untrue be as the angler who be bear to the angler who be make at the tackle-shop one encumber the small of he back with nameless engine talk much of creel have a rod like a weaver 's beam he travel first class to some distant show-lake among the hill and he toil all day as the fisherman of old toil all night while tom he gardener 's son but a mile outside the town with a willow wand and a bent pin have catch the family supper so be it with he who be proverbially bear not make he friend say : ' o you should go to such-and-such fall you would write poetry there if you like we all say so ' or ` what be you do in here scribble look through the window at the moonlight there be poetry for you go out into that if you want sonnet ' of course he never take he friend ' advice he have long know that they know nothing whatever about it he be probably quite ignorant of metrical law but one precept instinct teach he from the beginning and he find it express one day in wordsworth -lrb- with a bless comfort of assurance -- like in this little o may be like somehow in the great thing too -rrb- : ` poetry be emotion remember in tranquillity ' the wandlike moment he remember always come to he in haunt all remote indeed from poetry : a sudden touch at he heart and the air grow rhythmical and seem a-ripple with dream and albeit in whatever room of dust or must he be the song will find he will throw she arm about he so it seem will close he eye with she sweet breath that he may open they upon the hidden star ` impromptu ' be the quackery of the poetaster one may take it for grant as a general rule that anything write ` on the spot ' be worthless a certain young poet who could when he like do good thing print some verse which he declare in a sub-title be ` write on the top of snowdon in a thunderstorm ' he ask a opinion and one reply : ` write on the top of snowdon in a thunderstorm ' the poet be naturally angry -- and yet what need of further criticism the poet when young although as i say he be not likely to fall into the foolishness of conceit which belong to the poetaster be yet too apt in he zeal of dedication to talk much of he ` art ' or at least think much also to disparage life and to pronounce much gratuitous absolution in the name of poetry : -- do burn drink and wench -- yet he sing do coleridge opiate and neglect he family -- yet he sing do shelley -- well whatever shelley do of callous and foolish the list be long -- yet he sing as year pass however he grow out of this stage and while regard he art in a spirit of dedication equally serious and how much saner he come to realize that after all art but form one integral part however great of a healthy life and that for the greatest artist there be still duty in life more imperative than any art can lay upon he it be a great hour when he rise up in he resolution first to be a man in faith that if he be such the artist in he will look after itself -- first a man and surely all the greater artist for be that though if not still a man that be the duty that lie ' next ' to all of we do that and as we be tell the other will be clearer for we in that hour that earlier form of absolution will reverse itself on he lip into one of commination do they sing -- yet they sin here and here and as a man soweth so shall he reap singer or sot lo he song be star in heaven but he sin be snake in hell : each shall bless and torment he in turn pitiable indeed will seem to he in that hour the cowardice that dare to cloak its sin with some fine-spun theory that veil the gratification of its desire in some shrill evangel and wreck a woman 's life in the name of -- liberty and song art want no such follower : she bravest work be do by brave man and not by sneak opium-eater and libidinous ` reformer ' we all have sin and we all will go on sinning but for god 's sake let we be honest about it there be worse thing than honest sin if god help you you have ruin a girl do penance for it through you life pay you share but do not whatever you do hope to make up for a bad heart by a good brain foolish art-patterer may suffer the recompense to pass for likely they have all the one and none of the other but good man will care nothing about you or you work so long as bad tree refuse to bring forth good fruit or fig to grow on thistle we have more to learn from florentine artist than any ` craft mystery ' if the capacity for use the blossom while miss the evil fruit of which mr pater speak in the case of aurelius be only confine to those evil-bearing tree : alas it be all blossom with we modern good or bad alike and purity or putrescence be all one to we so that they shine i suppose few regard giotto 's circle as he greatest work : would that more do the lust of the eye with gautier as high-priest be too much with we the poet too who perhaps begin with the simple ambition of become a ` literary man ' soon find how radically incapable of ever be merely that he be alas how soon the nimbus fade from the sacred name of ` author ' at one time he have be ready to fall down and kiss the garment 's hem say of -- of a ` canterbury ' editor -lrb- this of course when very very young -rrb- as of a be from another sphere and a writer in _ the fortnightly _ have swim into he ken trail visible cloud of glory but by and by he find himself breathing with perfect composure in that rarefy air and in course of time the gray conviction settle upon he that these fabled people be in no wise different from the bookseller and business man he have find so sordid and dull -- no more individual or delightful as a race and he speedily come to the old conclusion he have be at a loss to understand a year or two ago that as a rule the people who do not write book be infinitely to be prefer to the people who do when he find exception they occur as they use to do in shop and office -- the charm be all independent of the call for just as surely as a man need not grow mean and hard and dry up however prosperous be he iron-foundry so sure be it that a man will not grow generous rich-minded loving and all that be golden by merely write of such virtue at so much a column the inherent insincerity more or less of all literary work be a fact of which he have not think i be speaking of the mere ` author ' the writer-tradesman the amateur 's superstition not of man of genius who despite cackle can not disappoint if they seem to do so it must be that we have not come close enough to know they but the man of genius be rarer perhaps in the rank of authorship than anywhere : you be far more likely to find he on the exchange they be as scarce as caxton : london possess hardly half-a-dozen example narcissus enjoy the delight of call one of these he friend ' a certain aristocratic poet who love all kind of superiority ' again to borrow from mr pater he have once see he afar off and worship as it be the blessedness of boy to be able to worship but never could he have dream in that day of the dear intimacy that be to come ` if he could but know I as i be ' he have sigh but that be all with the almost childlike naturalness which be he greatest charm he confess this sigh long after and win that poet 's heart well i remember he burst into we london lodging late one afternoon great-eyed and almost in tear for joy of that first visit he have pre-eminently the capacity which most fine man have of fall in love with man -- as one may be sure of a subtle greatness in a woman whose eye singles out a woman to follow on the stage at the theater -- and certainly no other phrase can express that state of shine tremble exaltation the passion of the friendship of narcissus and although he be rich in they -- rich that be as one can be say to be rich in treasure so rare -- save one only they have never prove that fairy-gold which such do often prove save that one golden fruit still hang for every white cluster of wonderful blossom ' i think you must care for I if you could but know I aright ' narcissus have say ` care for you why you beautiful boy you seem to have drop from the star ' the poet have reply in the caress fashion of a elder brother he have frankly fall in love too : for narcissus have tell I that he great charm be a boyish naturalness of heart that ingenuous gusto in living which be one of the sure witness to genius this be all the more piquant because no one would suspect it as i suppose few do probably indeed a consensus would declare he the last man in london of whom that be true no one would seem to take more seriously the _ beau monde _ of modern paganism with its hundred gospel of _ la nuance _ no one assuredly be more _ blasé _ than he with he languor of pose and face of so wan a flame the oscar wilde of modern legend be not more as a dweller in nirvana but narcissus maintain that all this be but a disguise which the condition of he life compel he to wear and in wear which he enjoy much subtle subterranean merriment while underneath the real man live fresh as morning vigorous as a young sycamore wild-hearted as a eagle ever ready to flash out the ` password primeval ' to such as alone could understand how else have he at once take the stranger lad to he heart with such a sunlight of welcome as the maid every boy must have sigh for but so rarely find who make not as if he love be a weariness which she endure and the kiss she suffer cold as green bud be charity but frankly glow to he avowal with ' i love you too dear jack ' and kiss he from the first with mouth like a June rise -- so do that _ blasé _ poet cast away he conventional fahrenheit and call narcissus friend in they first hour man of genius alone know that fine _ abandon _ of soul in such be the poet confess as unmistakably as in he verse for the one law of he life be that he be a elemental and the capacity for great simple impression be the spring of he power let he beware of lose that i sometimes wonder as i come across the last frivolous gossip concern that poet in the paragraph of the new journalism or meet he name in some distinguished bead-roll in _ the morning post _ whether narcissus be not after all mistaken about he and whether he could still season after season go through the same stale round of reception private view first night and all the various drill of fashion and folly if that boy 's heart be alive still one must believe it once throb in he : we have he poem for that and a poem can not lie but it be hard to think that it could still keep on its young beat beneath such a choke pressure of convention and in a air so ` sunken from the healthy breath of morn ' but on the other hand i have almost a superstitious reliance on narcissus ' intuition a faculty in he which not i alone have mark but which i know be the main secret of he appeal for woman they as the natural possessor of the power feel a singular kinship with a man who also possess it a gift as rarely find among he sex as that delicacy which largely depend on it and which be the other sure clue to a woman 's love she be so little used poor flower to be understand and to meet with other regard than the gaze of satyr however be narcissus ' intuition at fault or not in the main still it be very sure that the boy 's heart in that man of the world do wake from its sleep for a while at the wandlike touch of he youth and if after all as may be narcissus be but a new sensation in he jaded round at least he be a healthy one nor do the callous ingratitude of forgetfulness which follow so swiftly upon mere sensation ever add another to the sorrow of my friend : for during the last week before he leave we come a letter of love and cheer in that poet 's wonderful handwriting -- handwriting delicious with honeyed line each word a flower each letter round with the firm soft curve of hawthorn in bud or the delicate knob of palm against the sky chapter viii george muncaster when i speak of london 's man of genius i refer of course to such as be duly accredit certificate so to say by public opinion but of those other whose shine be under the bushel of obscurity few or many how can one affirm that there be such any man with any happy experience of living should be able to testify and i should say for fear of misunderstanding that i do not use the word genius in any technical sense not only of man who can _ do _ in the great triumphal way but also of those who can _ be _ in they quiet effective fashion within they own ` scanty plot of ground ' man who if ever conscious of it be content with the diffusion of they influence around the narrow limit of they daily life content to bend they creative instinct on the building and beautifying of home it be no lax use of the word genius to apply it to such for unless you profess the modern heresy that genius be but a multiply talent a coral-island growth that earn its right to a new name only when it have lift its head above the water of oblivion you must agree for ` you see at once ' say narcissus in reference to that poet ` that he writing be so delightful because he be more so ' he writings in fact be but the accidental emanation of he personality he might have give himself out to we in fugue or canvas or simply like the george muncaster of whom i be think in the sweet breath and happy shine of he home genius be a personal quality and if a man have it whatever he hand touch will bear the trace of he power a undying odour a unfading radiance when rossettus write ` beauty like hers be genius ' he be not deal in metaphor and meissonier should have abolish for ever the superstition of large canvas these desultory hint of the development of narcissus would certainly be more incomplete than necessity demand if i do not try to give the reader some idea of the man of genius of this unobtrusive type to whom i have just allude samuel dale use to call himself ` a artist in life ' and there could be no truer general phrase to describe george muncaster than that he whole life possess a singular unity such as be the most satisfying joy of a fine work of art consider which it never occur to one to think of the limitation of condition or material so with he life the shortness of man 's ` term ' be never feel one could win no completer effect with eternity than he with every day hurry and false start seem unknown in he round and he little home be a microcosm of the golden age it would even seem sometimes that he have a artistic rule over he ` accident ' for ` surprise ' have a wonderful knack of fall into the general plan of he life as though but wait for we first meeting with he be a singular instance of this i say ` we ' for narcissus and i chance to be walk a holiday together at the time it fall on this wise at tewkesbury it be we have arrive one dull September evening just in time to escape a wet from a gray drizzle then imminent and in no very buoyant spirit we turn into _ the swan inn _ a more dismal coffee-room for a dismal evening could hardly be -- gloomy vast and thinly furnish we enter sulkily seem the only occupant of the sepulchre however there be a small book on the table face the door sufficiently modern in appearance to catch one 's eye and arouse a faint ripple of interest ' a canterbury ' we cry ` and a whitman more 's the wonder ' cry narcissus who have snatch it up ` why some one 's have the sense too to cut out the abominable portrait i wonder whose it be the owner must evidently have some right feeling ' then before there be time for further exclamatory compliment of the unknown we be half-startled by the turn round of a arm-chair at the far end of the room and be aware of a manly voice of exquisite quality ask ` do you know whitman ' and move towards the speaker we be for the first time face to face with the strong and gentle george muncaster who since stand in we little gallery of type as whitman 's camarado and divine husband make flesh i wish reader that i could make you see he face but at best i have little faith in pen portrait it be comparatively easy to write a graphic description of _ a _ face but when it have be read have the reader realize _ the _ face i doubt it and be incline to believe that three different reader will carry away three different impression even from a really brilliant portrait laborious realism may at least i think be admit as hopeless the only chance be in a meredithian lightning-flash and those fly but from one or two bow i wonder if a image will help at all here think on a pebbly stream on a brisk bright morning dwell on the soft shine line of its flow and then recall the tonic influence the sensation of grip which the pebble give it dip you hand into it again in fancy realize how chaste it be and then again think how bright and good it be and if you realize these impression as they come to I you will have gain some idea of george muncaster 's face -- the essential spirit of it i mean ever so much more important than the mere feature such at least seem the meaning of he face even in the first moment of we intercourse that September dusk and so it have never cease to come upon we even until now and what a night that be what a talk how soon do we find each other out long before the maid knock at the door and hint by the delicate insinuation of a suppose ring that there be ' a bud morrow ' in the air but we passionate generosity of soul be run in too strong a tide just then to be stem by any such interference it could but be divert and muncaster 's bedroom serve we as well wherein to squat in one of those close rapt circle of talk such as i think after all man who love poetry can alone know -- man anyhow with _ a _ poetry bed that have for some time be call we unheeded as juliet 's nurse have at last to be obey but how grudgingly and how eagerly we spring from it at no late hour in the morning at the first thought of the sweet new thing that have come into the world -- like child who half in a doze before wake suddenly remember last night 's new wonder of a toy to awake in a instant and scramble into clothes to look at it again thus like child we rise but it be shy as lover we meet at the breakfast-table as lover shy after last night 's kissing -lrb- you may not have love a fellow-man in this way reader but we be any one of we as good man as you so keep you eyebrow down i beseech you -rrb- one most winsome trait of we new friend be soon apparent -- as have to we sorrow to part at the inn door right and leave we talk of meeting again at one or the other 's home : a delicate disinclination to irreverently ` make sure ' of the new joy a ` listen fear ' as though of a preside good spirit that might revoke he gift if one stretch out towards it with too greedy hand ` rather let we part and say nought you know where a letter will find I if we last night be a real thing we shall meet again never fear ' with some such word as those it be that he bid we good-bye of course letter find all three of we before a fortnight have go by and in but a short time we find he home there it be that george should be see away he be full of precious light but home be he setting to narcissus who find it in that green period when all youngster take vehement vow of celibacy and talk much of ` free love ' all ignorant one be in charity persuade of what they quite mean that home be certainly as great and last a revelation as the first hour of ` poetry 's divine first finger-touch ' it be not that he own home-life have be unhappy for it be the reverse and rich indeed in great and sweet influence but it be rather i think that the ideal of a home be not so easily to be reach from that home in which one be a child where one be too apt to miss the whole in consideration of one 's own part in it as from another on which we can look from the outside we parent even to the end partake too much of the nature of mythology it always need a effort to imagine they being with quite the same need and dream as ourselves we rarely get a glimpse of they poetry for the very reason that we ourselves be factor in it and be therefore too apt to dwell on the less happy detail of the domestic life detail which one ray of they poetry would transfigure as the sun transfigure the mote in he beam thus in that green age i speak of one 's sickly vision can but see the dusty world-worn side of domesticity the petty daily care of live the machinery so to say of ` house and home ' but when one stand in another home where these be necessarily unseen by we stand with the young husband the poetry-maker how different it all seem one see the creation bloom upon it one cease to blaspheme and learn to bless later when at length one understand why it be sweeter to say ` wife ' than ` sweetheart ' how even one may be reconcile to call one 's daffodilium ` little mother ' -- because of the child you know it would never do for they to say daffodilium -- then he will understand too how those petty detail formerly so ' _ banal _ ' be after all but note in the music and what poetry can flicker like its own blue flame around even the joint purchase of a frying-pan that narcissus ever understand this great old poetry he owe to george muncaster in the very silence of he home one hear a singing -- ` there lie the happiest land ' it be one of he own quaint touch that the first night we find he nest after the maid have give we admission there should be no one to welcome we into the bright little parlor but a wee boy of four standing in the doorway like a robin that have hop on to one 's window-sill but with what a dear grace do the little chap hold out he hand and bid we good evening and turn he little morsel of a bird 's tongue round we name to be back at once by a ring of laughter from the hidden ` prompter ' thereupon reveal o happy happy home may god for ever smile upon you there should be a special grace for happy home george 's set we ` collect ' such with result undreamed of by youthful cynic take courage reader if haply you stand with hesitate toe above the fatal plunge fear not you can swim if you will of course you must take care that you joint poetry-maker be such a one as george 's one must not seem to forget the loving wife who make such dream as he possible he do not and indeed have you tell he of he happiness he would but have turn to she with a smile that say ` all of thee my love ' while do one ask of this and that how quickly ` yes that be george 's idea ' laugh along she lip while we sit talk that first evening there suddenly come three cry as of three little head strain out of a nest for ` father ' and obedient with a laugh he leave we this we soon learn be a part of the sweet evening ritual of home after mother 's more practical service have be render the little one and they be cosily ` tuck in ' then come ` father 's turn ' which consist of he sit by they bedside -- owen and geoffrey on one hand and little queen phylli maidenlike in solitary cot on the other -- and croon to they a little evening song in the dark too i should say for it be one of he wise provision that they should be save from ever fear that and that whenever they awake to find it round they in the middle of the night it should bring they no other association but ` father 's voice ' a quaint recitative of he own which he generally contrived to vary each night be the song a loving croon of sleep and rest the brotherhood of rest one might name he theme for grown-up folk as in the morning we afterwards learn he be wont to sing they another little song of the brotherhood of work the aim of he whole beautiful effort for they be to fill they heart with a sense of the brotherhood of all live thing -- flower butterfly bee and bird the milk-boy the policeman the man at the cross the grocer 's pony all within the circle of they little life as living and work in one great _ camaraderie _ sometimes he would extemporise a little rhyme for they fill it out with he clear happy voice and that tender pantomime that come so naturally to a man who not merely love child -- for who be there that do not -- but one bear with the instinct for intercourse with they to those not so bear it be as difficult to enter into the life and prattle of bird i have once or twice creep outside the bedroom door when neither child nor george thought of eavesdropper and the follow little song be impression from memory of he you must imagine they chant by a voice full of the infinite tenderness of fatherhood and even then you will but dimly realize the music they have as he sing they i run the risk of he forgiving my print they here : -- morning song morning come to little eye waken bird and butterfly bid the flower uplift he head call the whole round world from bed up jump geoffrey up jump owen then up jump phylli and father 's go evening song the sun be weary for he run so far and fast to-day the bird be weary for who sing so many song as they the bee and butterfly at last be tire out for just think too how many garden through the day they little wing have flutter through and so as all tired people do they have go to lay they sleepy head deep deep in warm and happy bed the sun have shut he golden eye and go to sleep beneath the sky the bird and butterfly and bee have all creep into flower and tree and all lie quiet still as mouse till morning come like father 's voice so phyllis owen geoffrey you must sleep away till morning too close little eye lie down little head and sleep sleep sleep in happy bed as the reader have not be afflict with a great deal of verse in these page i shall also venture to copy here another little song which as he brain have grow older george have be fond of singing to they at bedtime and with which the reader be not likely to have enjoy a previous acquaintance : -- rest -lrb- 1 -rrb- when the sun and the golden day hand in hand be go away at you door shall sleep and night come and knock in the fair twilight let they in twin traveller bless each shall be a honor guest and give you rest they shall tell of the star and moon and they lip shall move to a glad sweet tune till upon you cool white bed fall at last you nodding head then in dreamland fair and blest farther off than east and west they give you rest night and sleep that goodly twain tho ' they go shall come again when you work and play be do and the sun and day be go hand in hand thro ' the scarlet west each shall come a honor guest and bring you rest watch at you window-sill if upon the eastern hill sun and day come back no more they shall lead you from the door to they kingdom calm and blest farther off than east or west and give you rest arrive down to breakfast earlier than expect next morning we discover george busy at some more of he loving ingenuity he half blush in he shy way but go on write in this wise with chalk upon a small blackboard : ' _ Thursday _ -- _ thor 's - day _ -- _ jack the giant killer 's day _ ' then in one corner of the board a sun be rise with a merry face and flame lock and beneath he be write ' _ phoebus-apollo ' _ while in the other corner be a setting moon ' _ lady cynthium _ there be other quaint matter too though they have escape my memory but these hint be sufficient to indicate george 's morning occupation thus he endeavor to implant in the young mind he feel so sacred a trust a ever-present impression of the full significance of life in every one of its detail the day of the week should mean for they what they do mean should come with a veritable personality such as the sun and the moon gain for they by thus have actual name like friend and playfellow this thor 's - day be a especially great day for they for in the evening when george have return from business and there be yet a hour to bedtime they would come round he to hear one of the adventure of the great thor -- adventure which he have already contrived he laughingly tell we to go on spin out of the edda through no less than the thursday of two year certainly he ingenuity of economy with he material be no little marvel and he confess to often be at he wit ' end for Thursday night be not alone star with story every night there be one to tell sometimes a incident of he day in town which he would dress up with the imaginative instinct of a bear teller of fairy-tale he have a knack too of spread one story over several day which would be invaluable to a serial writer i remember one simple instance of he device he sit in one of those great cane nursing chair phylli on one knee owen on the other and geoffrey perch in the hollow space in the back of the chair lean over he shoulder all as solemn as a court await judgment george begin with a preliminary glance behind at geoffrey : ` happy there my boy that be right well there be once a beautiful garden ' ` yes-s-s-s ' go the three solemn young head ` and it be full of the most wonderful thing ' ` yes-s-s-s ' ` great tree so green for the bird to hide and sing in and flower so fair and sweet that the bee say that in all they fly hither and thither they have never yet find any so full of honey in all the world and the bird too what song they know and the butterfly be there ever any so bright and many-coloured ' etc etc ` but the most wonderful thing about the garden be that everything in it have a wonderful story to tell ' ` yes-s-s s ' ` the bird and bee and butterfly even the tree and flower each know a wonderful fairy-tale ' ` oh-h-h-h ' ` but of all in the garden the grasshopper know the most he have be a great traveller for he have such long leg ' again a still deeper murmur of breathless interest ` now would you like to hear what the grasshopper have to tell ' ` oh yes-s-s-s ' ` well you shall -- to-morrow night ' so off he knee they go as he rise with a merry loving laugh and kiss away the long sigh of disappointment and send they to bed agog for all the morrow 's night should reveal need one say that the child be not the only disappointed listener besides they have long since know all the wonderful tale whereas one of the poorer grown-up still wonder wistfully what that grasshopper who be so great a traveller and have such long leg have to tell but i have better cease be i sure that the reader be see what i be see hearing as i i should not fear but how can i be sure of that have i the pen which that same george will persist in keep for he letter i should venture to delight the reader with more of he story one underhand hope of mine however for these poor hint be that they may by they very imperfection arouse he to give the world ` the true story ' of a happy home narcissus repeatedly threaten that if he do not take pen in hand he would some day ` make copy ' of he and now i have do it instead moreover i shall further presume on he forbearance by conclude with a quotation from one of he letter that come to I but a few month back : -- ` you know how deeply exercise the little one be on the subject of death and how i have answer they curiosity by the story that after death all thing turn into flower well what should startle the wife 's ear the other day but mother i wish you would die o why my dear because i should so like to water you be the delicious explanation the theory have moreover be call to stand at the bar of experience for a week or two ago one of phylli ' goldfish die there be tear at first of course but they suddenly dry up as geoffrey in he reflective way wonder what flower it would come to here be a dilemma one have never think of such contingency but of course it be soon solve what flower would you like it to be my boy i ask a poppy he answer and after consultation a poppy agree the other so a poppy it be to be a visit to the seedsman 's procure the necessary surreptitious poppy seed and so now poor sir goldfish sleep with the seed of sleep in he mouth and the child watch he grave day by day breathless for he resplendent resurrection will you write we a epitaph ' ariel forgive I here be what i send : ` five inch deep sir goldfish lie here last September be he lay poppy these that be he eye of fish-bone be these blue-bell make he fin of gold that to and fro wave and wave so long ago still as petal wave and wave to and fro above he grave hearken too for so he knell toll all day each tiny bell ' footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : from a tiny privately-printed volume of deliciously original lyric by mr rk leather since republish by mr fisher unwin 1890 and at present publish by mr john lane -rrb- chapter ix that thirteenth maid ` who chooseth I must give and hazard all he have ' -- _ merchant of venice _ it occur to I here to wonder whether there can be any reader ungrateful enough to ask with grumble voice ` what of the book-bill the head-line have be the sole mention of they now for many page and in the last chapter where a book be refer to the writer be perverse enough to choose one that never belong to narcissus at all ' to which i would venture to make humble rejoinder -- well goodman reader and what do you expect be it account with all they thrilling detail with total ` less discount ' and facsimile of the receipt stamp take another look at we first chapter i promise nothing of the sort there i be sure i promise simply to attempt for you the delineation of a personality which have have for all who come into contact with it endure charm in hope that though at second-hand you might have some pleasure of it also and i propose to do this mainly from the hint of document which really be more significant than any letter or other writings could be for the reason that they be of necessity so unconscious i certainly have no intention of burden you with the original datum any more than should you accept the offer i make also in that chapter and entrust I with you private ledger for biographical purpose i would think of print it _ in extenso _ and call it a biography though i should feel justified after the varied story have be deduce and write out in call the product metaphorical wise ` the private ledger of johanne browne esquire ' -- a title which by the way be copyright and duly ` enter ' such be my attempt and i maintain that i have so far keep my word because whole shelf have be dispose of in a line and a ninepenny ` canterbury ' have rustle out into page you have no right to complain for that be but the fashion of life as i have endeavor to show and let I say in pass that that say copy of mr rhy 's whitman though it could not manifestly appear in he book-bill do at the present moment rest upon he shelf -- ' a moment 's monument ' perhaps it would be well before proceed with this present ` place in the story ' to set out with a statement of the various ` authority ' for it as all this be veritable history perhaps one should but then reader here again i should have to catalogue quite a small library however i will enumerate a few of the more significant one ` swinburne 's _ tristram of lyonesse _ 9 \/ - less dis 6\/9 ' all that this great poem of ` springtide passion with its fire and flower ' mean to narcissus and he ` thirteenth maid ' in the morning of they love those that have love too will hardly need tell while those who have not could never understand though i spake with the tongue of the poet himself in this particular copy which i need hardly say do not rest upon n 's shelf but on another in a sweet little bedchamber there be a tender inscription and a sonnet which aim at acknowledge how the heart of those young lover have go out to that poet ` with mouth of gold and morning in he eye ' the latter i have beg leave to copy here : -- ` dear heart what thing may symbolise for we a love like ours what gift whate'er it be hold more significance ` twixt thee and I than paltry word a truth miraculous or the poor sign that in astronomy tell giant splendor in they gleam might yet love would still give such as in delight to mock they impotence -- so this for thee ` this book for thee we sweetest honeycomb of lovesome thought and passion-hearted rhyme build of gold and kiss and desire by that wild poet whom so many a time we hungering lip have bless until a fire burnt speech up and the wordless hour have come ' ` meredith 's _ richard feverel _ 6 \/ - less di 4\/6 ' narcissus be never weary of read those two wonderful chapter where lucy and richard meet and he use to say that some day he would beg leave from mr meredith to reprint at he own charge just those two chapter to distribute to all true lover in the kingdom it would be hard to say how often he and he maid have read they aloud together with amorous punctuation -- caress for comma and kiss for full-stop ` morris ' _ sigurd the volsung _ 12 \/ - less dis 9 \/ - ' this book they love when they love have grow to have more of earnest purpose in it and its first hysteric ecstasy have pass into the more solemn ardor of the love that go not with spring but love even unto the winter and beyond it be mark all through in pencil by narcissus but on one page where it open easily there be written initial in a woman 's hand against this great passage : -- ` she say : thou shalt never unsay it and thy heart be mine indeed : thou shalt bear thy love in thy bosom as thou helpest the earth-folk 's need : thou shalt wake to it dawn by dawn thou shalt sleep and it shall not be strange : there be none shall thrust between we till we earthly life shall change ah my love shall fare as a banner in the hand of thy renown in the arm of thy fame accomplish shall it lie when we lay we adown o deathless fame of sigurd o glory of my lord o birth of the happy brynhild to the measureless reward so they sit as the day grow dimmer and they look on day to come and the fair tale speeding onward and the glory of they home and they see they crown child and the kindred of the king and deed in the world arise and the day of better thing : all the earthly exaltation till they pomp of life should be pass and soft on the bosom of god they love should be lay at the last ' and on the page face this lie a press flower -- there use to be two -- guard by these tender rhyme : -- ` whoe'er shall read this mighty song in some forthcoming evensong we pray thee guard these simple flower for gentle reader they be ours ' but ill have some ` gentle reader ' attend to the behest for as i say but one of the flower remain one be lose -- and narcissus have go away this inscription be but one of many such scatter here and there through he book for he have a great facility in such minor grace as he have a neat hand at tie a bow i do not think he ever send a box of flower without he fertility serve he with some rose-leaf fancy to accompany they and on birthday and all red-letter day he be always to be count upon for a appropriate rhyme if he art serve no other purpose he friend would be grateful to he for that alone for many great day would have go without they ` white stone ' but for he when for instance jaw take that brave plunge of he which have since so abundantly justified he and more than fulfil prophecy or when samuel dale take that bolder namely a wife he be a philosopher -- incident reader on which i long so to digress and for which if you could only know beforehand you would i be sure give I freest hand but beautiful story both i may not tell of you here though if the reader and i ever spend together those hint night at the ` mermaid ' i then may but to return i say above that if i be to enumerate all the book so to say ` implicate ' in the love of narcissus and he thirteenth maid i should have to catalogue quite a small library i forget for the moment what literal truth i be write for it be indeed in quite a large library that they first meet in ` we town ' there be reader a old-world institution which i think you would well like transport to yours a quaint subscription library ` establish ' ever so long ago full of wonderful nook and corner where -lrb- of course if you be a member -rrb- one be sure almost at any time of the day of a solitary corner for a dream it be a sweet provision too that it be manage by lady whom you may if you can image to yourself as the hesperide for there be three of they and may not the innumerable gallery and spiral staircase serry with countless shelf cluster thick with tome on tome figure the great tree with its many branch and its wonderful gold fruit -- the tree of knowledge the absence of the dragon from the similitude be as well do not you think book of all thing should be tend by reverent hand and to my mind the perfunctory in thing ecclesiastical be hardly more distressing than the service of book as conduct in many great library one feel that the _ librarius _ should be a sacred order nearly ally to the monastic refine by vary step of initiation and certainly celibate they should give out they book as the priest he sacrament should wear sacred vestment and bear about with they the priestlike _ aura _ as of divine incarnation of the great spirit of truth and art in whose temple they be ministrant the next step to this ideal ministry be to have we book give out to we by woman though they may understand they not they handle they with gentle courtesy and be certainly in every way to be prefer to the youthful freckled monster with red spine upon he head and nail boot ` the work of the cyclops ' upon he foot whose physiognomy be contorted by cinnamon-ball at the very moment he carry in he arm some great golden-lip or gentle silver-tongue what good sweet woman there be too who would bless heaven for the occupation well as i say we in that particular library be more fortunate and two of the ` subscriber ' at least do at one time express they appreciation of its privilege by a daily dream among its shelf one day -- have hercule be there overnight -- we miss one of we fair attendant be it aegle arethusa or hesperium narcissus probably know and on the next she be still miss nor on the third have she return but lo there be another in she stead -- and on she narcissus bent he gaze accord to wont a little maid with noticeable eye and the hair rossettus love to paint -- call hesper ` by many ' say narcissus one day long after solemnly quote the vita nuova ` who know not wherefore ' ` why do _ you _ know ' i ask ` yes ' and then for the first time he have tell I the story i have now to tell again he have meanwhile rather surprise I by little touch of intimate observation of she which he occasionally let slip -- as for instance ` have you notice she forehead it have a fine distinction of form be pure ivory surely and you should watch how deliciously she hair spring out of it like little wavy thread of old gold set in the ivory by some cunning artist ' i have just look at he and wonder a moment but such attentive regard be hardly matter for surprise in he case and moreover i always try to avoid the subject of woman with he for it be the one on which alone there be danger of we disagree it be the only one in which he seem to show sign of cruelty in he disposition though it be i well know but a thoughtless cruelty and in my heart i always feel that he be too right-minded and noble in the other great matter of life not to come right on that too when ` the hour have strike ' meanwhile he have a way of classify amours by the number of verse inspire -- as ` heigho it be all over but never mind i get two sonnet out of she ' -- which seem to I a exhibition of the worst side of he artist disposition and which -- well reader jar much on one who already know what a true love mean it be however i could see quite unconscious and i try hard not to be intolerant towards he because fortune have bless I with a earlier illumination pray go not away with the misconception that narcissus be ever base to a woman no he leave that to circe 's hog and the one temptation he ever have towards it he turn into a shine salvation no he have nothing worse than the sin of the young egoist to answer for though he afterwards come to feel those pitiful and mean enough another noticeable feature of hesper 's face be a ever-present sadness -- not as of a dull grief but as of some shine sorrow a quality which give she face much arrest interest it seem one great rich tear one love to dwell upon it as upon those intense stretch of evening sky when the day yearn through half-shut eyelid in the west one continually wonder what story it mean for some it must mean watch she thus quietly day by day it seem to I that as the week from she first come go by this sadness deepen and i could not forbear one day question the elder hesperide about she thus bring upon myself a revelation i have little expect for say she ` she be glad i have speak to she for she have long wish to ask I to use my influence with my friend that he might cease pay hesper attention which he could not mean in earnest but which she know be already cause hesper to be fond of he have become friendly with she she have find out she secret and remonstrate with she with the result that she have avoid narcissus for some time but not without much misery to herself over which she be continually brood ' all this be a utter surprise and a saddening one for i have grow to feel much interest in the girl and have be especially please by all absence of the flighty tendency with which too many girl in public service tempt man to they own destruction she have seem to I to bear herself with a maidenly self-respect that speak of no little grace of breed she have two very strong claim on one 's regard she be evidently a woman in the deep tragic sense of that word and a lady in the only true sense of that the thought of a life so rich in womanly promise become but another of the idle plaything of narcissus fill I with something akin to rage and i be not long in say some strong word to he not that i fear for she the coarse ` ruin ' the world alone think of be that the worst that can befall woman what of the spiritual deflowering of which the bodily be but a symbol if the first fine bloom of the soul have go if the dream that be only dream once have grow up in the imagination and be once give the mere chastity of the body be a lie and whatever its fecundity the soul have nought but sterility to give to another it be not those kiss of the lip -- kiss that one forget as one forget the rose we smell last year -- which profane they but soil the vessel of the sacrament and it be the sacrament itself which those consume spirit-kiss which burn but through the eye may desecrate it be strange that man should have so long take the precisely opposite attitude in this matter care only for the observation of the vessel and apparently dream not of any other possible approach to the sanctity probably however he care have not be of sanctity at all indeed most have doubtless little suspicion of the existence of such and the symbol have be and be but a selfish superstition amongst they -- woman a symbol whose meaning be forget but still the object of a ignorant veneration not unrelated to the preservation of game narcissus take my remonstrance a little flippantly i think evidently feel that too much have be make out of very little for he aver that he ` attention ' to hesper have be of the slightest character hardly more than occasional look and whisper which from she cold reception of they he have feel be more distasteful to she than otherwise he have indeed he say cease even these the last few day as she reserve always make he feel foolish as a man fondle a fair face in he dream wake on a sudden to find that he be but grimace at the air this reassure I and i feel little further anxiety however this security only prove how little i really understand the weak side of my friend i have not realize how much he really be narcissus and how dear to he be a new mirror my speak to he be the one wrong course possible to be take instead of confirm he grow intention of indifference it have as might have be foresee the directly opposite effect and from the moment of he learn that hesper secretly love he she at once become invest with a new glamour and grow daily more and more the forbid fascination few can resist i do not learn this for many month meanwhile narcissus choose to deceive I for the first and only time at last he tell I all and how different be he manner of tell it from he former gay relation of conquest one need not to hear the word to see he be unveil a sacred thing a holiness so white and hide the most reverent word seem a profanation and as he labor for the least soil wherein to enfold the revelation he soul seem as a maid tear with the blush tremor of a new knowledge man only speak so after great and wonderful travail and by that token i know narcissus loved at last it have seem unlikely ground from which love have first spring forth that of a self-worship that could forgo no slightest indulgence -- but thence indeed it have come the silent service my word have give he to know that hesper 's heart be offer to he be not enough he must hear it articulate he nostril crave a actual incense to gain this he must deceive two -- he friend and she whose poor face would kindle with hectic hope at the false word he must say for the true word he _ must _ hear it be pitifully mean but whom have not he own hidden lust make to crawl like a thief afraid of a shadow in he own house narcissus ' young lust be himself and moloch know no more ruthless hunger than burn in such of course it do not present itself quite nakedly to he he persuade himself there could be little harm -- he mean none and so instead of avoid hesper he seek she the more persistently and by some means so far woo she from she reticence as to win she consent to a walk together one autumn afternoon how little do we know the measure of we own propose that walk be to be the most fateful he foot have ever trodden through field and wood yet it seem the most accidental of gallantry a little town-maid with a romantic passion for ` we ' it would be interesting to watch the child it would be like give she a day 's holiday so much sunshine ` in we presence ' and so on but what a entirely different complexion be the whole thing begin to take before they have walk a mile behind the flippancy one have go to meet be surely the grow feature of a solemnity why the child be a woman indeed she could talk she have brain idea -- and lord bless we theory she have that ` excellent thing in woman ' not only a voice which she have too but character narcissus begin to loose he regal robe and from be merely courteously to be genuinely interested why she be a discovery as they walk on she genuine delight in the autumnal nature the real imaginative appeal it have for she be another surprise she have evidently a deep poetry in she disposition rarest of all female endowment in a surprisingly few minute from the beginning of they walk he find himself take that ` little child ' with extreme seriousness and wonder many ` whether ' they walk out again and yet again and narcissus ' first impression deepen he have he theory too and surely here be the woman he be not in love -- at least not with she but with she fitness for he theory they sit by a solitary woodside beneath a great elm tree the hour be full of magic for though the sun have set the smile of she day 's joy with he have not yet fade from the face of earth it be the hour vulgarise in drawing-room ballad as the ` gloaming ' they sit very near to each other he hold she hand toy with it and now and again they eye meet with the look that flutter before flight that say ` dare i give thee all dare i throw my eye on thine as i would throw myself on thee ' and then at last come the inevitable moment when the eye of each seem to cry ' o yes ' to the other and the gate fly back all the hidden light spring forth the wood swim round and the lip meet with a strange shock while the eye of the spirit close in a lap dream of great peace if you be not ready to play the man beware of a kiss such as the lip of little hesper that never know to kiss before press upon the mouth of narcissus it send a chill shudder through he though it be so sweet for he could feel she whole life surge behind it and be the kiss he have give she for it such a kiss as that but he have speak much to she of he idea of marriage she know he be swear for ever against that she must know the kiss have no such meaning for besides do she not scorn the soil ` tie ' also be not they theory at one in that he would be do she no wrong it be she own desire yet he kiss do mean more than he could have imagine it mean a week before she have grow to be genuinely desirable if love tarry passion be awake -- that dangerous passion too to which the intellect have add its intoxication and that be so to say legitimise by a ` idea ' she woman 's intuition read the silence and answer to he thought ` have no fear ' she say with the deep deliberation of passion ' i love you with my whole life but i shall never burden you narcissus love I as long as you can i shall be content and when the end come though another woman take you i shall not hinder ' o great girl-soul what a poltroon indeed be narcissus beside you at that moment you ready to stake you life on the throw he temporise and bargaining as over the term of a lease surely if he could for one moment have see himself in the light of you greatness he have be crush beneath the misery of he own meanness but as yet he have no such vision he one thought be ` she will do it will she draw back ' and the feeble warning he be oblige to utter to keep he own term by assure he conscience of ` she free-will ' be they not half-fearfully whisper and with a inward haste lest they should give she pause ` but the world my dear -- think ' ` it will have cruel name for thee ' ` it will make thee outcast -- think ' ' i know all ' she have answer ` but i love you and two year of you love would pay for all there be no world for I but you till to-night i have never live at all and when you go i shall be as dead the world can not hurt such a one ' ah I it be a wild sweet dream for both of they one the woman 's one the poet 's of a ` sweet impossible ' take flesh for do not let we blame narcissus overmuch he be utterly sincere he mean no wrong he but dream of follow a creed to which he reason have long give a hopeless assent in a more kindly-organised community he might have follow it and all have be well but the world have to be deal with as one find it and we must get sad answer to many a fair calculation if we ` state ' it wrongly in the equation that there be one law for the male and another for the female have not as yet vitally enter into he consideration he be too dizzy with the dream or he must have see what a unequal bargain he be about to drive at last he do awake and see it all and in a burning shame go to hesper and tell she that it must not be she answer be unconsciously the most subtly dangerous she could have choose : ` if i like to give myself to you why should you not take I it be of my own free-will my eye be open ' it be he very think put into word and by she for a moment he waver -- who could blame he ` be i my brother 's keeper ' ` yes a thousand time yes ' cry he soul for he be awake now and he have come to see the dream as it be and to shudder at himself as he have well-nigh be just as one shudder at the thought of a precipice barely escape in that moment too the idea of she love in all its divineness burst upon he here be a heart capable of a great tragic love like the love of old he read of and whimper for in sonnet and what have he offer in exchange a poor philosophical compromise compound of pessimism and desire in which a man should have all to gain and nothing to lose for ` the light light love he have wing to fly at suspicion of a bond ' ' i would i do love she ' he heart be cry as he go away ` could i love she ' be he next thought ` do i love she ' -- but that be a question that always need longer than one day to answer already he be as much in love with she as most man when they take unto themselves wife she be desirable -- he have pleasure in she presence he have that half of love which commonly pass for all -- the passion but he lack the additional incentive which nerve the common man to face that fear which seem well-nigh as universal as the fear of death i mean the fear of marriage -- life 's two fear : that be he have no desire to increase he worldly possession by annex a dowry or ambition of settle down and procure a wife as part of he establishment after all how full of bachelor the world would be if it be not for these motive : for the one other motive to a true marriage the other half of love however one name it be it not a four-leaved clover indeed narcissus be happily poor enough to be above those motive even have hesper be anything but poor too and if he be to marry she it would be because he be capable of love she with that perfect love which of course have alone right to the sacred name that which can not take all and give nought but which rather hold as watchword that _ to love be better than to be love _ who shall hope to express the mystery yet be not thus much true that if it must be allow to the cynic that love rise in self it yet have its zenith and setting in another -- in woman as in man two meet and passion the joy of the selfish part of each be bear shall love follow depend on whether they have a particular grace of nature love be the thanksgiving of the unselfish part for the boon grant to the other the common nature snatch the joy and forget the giver but the finer never forget and deem life but a poor service for a gift so rare and though passion be long since pass love keep holy a eternal memory ` love take up the harp of life and smote on all the chord with might smite the chord of self that tremble pass would in music out of sight ' since the time of fairy-tale love have have a way of come in the disguise of duty what be the story of beauty and the beast but a allegory of true love we take this maid to be we wed wife for she sake it perhaps seem at the time she be sweet and beautiful and to be desire but all the same we have rather shake the loose leg of bachelordom if it might be however it be so we take she or maybe it be she take we with a feeling of martyrdom but lo when we be home together what wonderful new light be these begin to ray about she as though she have up till now keep a star hide in she bosom what be this new morning strength and peace in we life why we think it be but thestyli and lo it be diana after all for the thirteenth maid or the thirteenth man both alike rarely come as we have expect there seem no fitness in they arrival it seem so ridiculously accidental as i suppose the hour of death whenever it come will seem one have expect some high calm prelude of preparation end in a festival of choice like a indian prince 's when the maid of the land pass before he and he make deliberate selection of the fateful she but instead we be hurry among we day 's business maybe we last thought of she we turn a corner and suddenly she be before we or perhaps as it fall with narcissus we have try many love that prove but passion we have just bury the last and be mournfully leave its grave determine to seek no further to abjure bright eye at least for a long while when lo on a sudden a little maid be in we path hold out some sweet modest flower the maid have a sweet mouth too and the old adam be stronger than we infant resolution we smell the flower and kiss the mouth -- to find arm that somehow we know not why be cling as for life about we let we beware how we shake they off for thus it be decree shall a man meet she to have miss whom be to have miss all youth like that faithless generation in the scripture always craveth after a sign but rarely shall one be give it can only be know whether a man be worthy of love by the way in which he look upon duty rachel often come in the gray cloak of leah it rest with the man 's heart whether he shall know she beneath the disguise no other divining-rod shall aid he if it be as bassanio 's brave to ` give and hazard all he have ' let he not fear to pass the seeming gold the seeming silver to choose the seeming lead ` why _ that be _ the lady ' thou poor magnificent morocco nor shall the gold fail for she heart be that and for silver thou shalt have those ` silent silver light undreamed of ' of face and soul these be but scatter hint of the story of narcissus ' love as he tell it I at last in broken struggle word but with a light in he face one power alone could set there when he come to the end and to all that little hesper have prove to he all the strength and illumination she have bring he he fairly break down and sob as one may in a brother 's arm for of course he have come out of the ordeal a man and hesper have consent to be he wife often she have dream as he have pass she by with such heedless air : ` if i love he so can it be that my love shall have no power to make he mine somehow some day can i call to he so within my soul and he not hear can i wait and he not come ' and she love have be strong strong as a destiny she voice have reach he for it be the voice of god when i next see she what a strange brightness shone in she face what a new beauty be there ah love the great transfigurer and why too be it that he friend begin to be dissatisfy with they old photograph of narcissus though they have be take but six month before there seem something lack in the photograph they say yes there be but the face have lack it too what be the new thing -- ` grip ' be it joy peace yes all three but more besides and narcissus have but one name for all it be hesper strange too that in spite of promise we never receive a new one narcissus who use to be so punctual with such a request perhaps it be because he have break he looking-glass chapter x ` in vishnu-land what avatar ' ` if i love you for a year i shall love you for ever ' narcissus have say to he thirteenth maid he do love she so long and yet he have go away do you remember you _ les misérables _ that early chapter where valjean rob the child of he florin so soon after that great illuminating change of heart and mind have come to he well still more important do you remember the clue hugo give we to aberration there be comfort and strength for so many a heart-breaking failure there it be the old impetus we be tell that be as yet too strong for the new control the old instinct too dark for the new light in the brain it take every vessel some time to answer to its helm with we human vessel year maybe have you never suddenly become sensitive of a gracious touch in the air and ponder it to recognize that in some half-unconscious act you have that moment be answer for the first time the helm of a almost forget resolution ah I bless be it to see the prow strongly sweep up against the sky at last ` send not a poet to london ' say heine and it be a true word at least send he not till he thew be lace and he bone set he may miss somewhat of course there be no gain without a loss he may be in ignorance of the last _ nuance _ and if he deserve fame he must gain it unaided of the vulgar notoriety which if he have a friend or two in the new journalism they will be so eager to bestow but he will have keep he soul intact which after all be the main matter it be sweet doubtless to be one of those same mushroom-men sweet to be placard as ` the new ' this or that to step for a day into the triumphal car of newspaper renown draw by team of willing paragraph-man -- who do it never strike you be but do it all for hire and earn they bread by they bent neck yet for those to whom it be deny there be solid comfort for it be not fame and worse still it be not life ` tis but to be ' a bourbon in a crown of straw ' if one could only take poor foolish cockneydom right away outside this poor vainglorious city and show they how the star be smile to themselves above it nudge each other so to say at the silly light that ape they shine -- for such a little while yes that be one danger of the poet in london that he should come to think himself ` somebody ' though doubtless in proportion as he be a poet the other danger will be the greater that he should deem himself ` nobody ' modest by nature credulous of appearance the noisy pretension of the hundred and one small celebrity and the din of they retainer this side and that in comparison with he own unattended course what wonder if he heart sink and he give up the game how shall he little pipe though it be of silver hope to be hear in this land of bassoon to take london seriously be death both to man and artist narcissus have sufficient success there to make this a temptation and he fall he lose he hold of the great thing of life he forget the star he forget he love and what wonder that he art sicken also for a few month life be but a feverish clutch after varied sensation especially the dear tickle of applause he catch the facile atheistic flippancy of that poor creature the ` modern young man ' all-knowing and all-foolish and he come very near lose he soul in the nightmare but he have too much ballast in he to go quite under and at last strength come and he shake the weakness from he yet the fall have be too far and too cruel for he to be happy again soon he have go forth so confident in he new strength of manly love and to fall so and almost without a effort who have not call upon the mountain to cover he in such a hour of awakening and who will wonder that narcissus dare not look upon the face of hesper till solitude have wash he clean and bath he in its healing oil i alone bid he good-bye it be in this room wherein i be write the study we have take together where still he book look down at I from the shelf and all the memorial of he young life remain o _ can _ it have be but ' a phantom of false morning ' a milton snatch up at the last moment be the one book he take with he from that night until this he have make but one sign -- a little note which hesper have show I a sob and a cry to which even a love that have be more deeply wrong could never have turn a deaf ear surely not hesper for she have long forgive he know he weakness for what it be she and i sometimes sit here together in the evening and talk of he and every echo in the corridor set we listen for he may be at the other side of the world or but the other side of the street -- we know so little of he fate
