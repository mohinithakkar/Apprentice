divine let these deep draught of thy enchanted wine lift I with thee in soaring high and far prouder than pegasean or the car wherein apollo rapt the huntress maid so let I range mine hour too soon to fade into strange presence of the thing that be yet know that even amid this jarring noise of hate love creed together heap and hurl some echo faint of grace and grandeur stir from thy sweet hella home of noble joy first fruit and best of all we western world whate'er we hold of beauty half be hers introduction probably no poet of importance equal or approach to that of pindar find so few and so infrequent reader the cause be not far to seek : in the first and most obvious place come the great difficulty of he language in the second the frequent obscurity of he thought result mainly from he exceed allusiveness and he abrupt transition and in the third place that amount of monotony which must of necessity attach to a series of poem provide for a succession of similar occasion it be as a attempt towards obviate the first of these hindrance to the study of pindar the difficulty of he language that this translation be of course especially intend to whom and in what case be translation of poet useful to a perfect scholar in the original tongue they be superfluous to one wholly ignorant of it they be apt to be -lrb- unless here and there to a keat -rrb- meaningless flat and puzzling there remain the third class of those who have a certain amount of knowledge of a language but not enough to enable they to read unassisted its more difficult book without a expenditure of time and trouble which be virtually prohibitive it be to this class that a translation ought it would seem chiefly to address itself a intelligent person of cultivate literary taste and able to read the easier book in a acquire language will feel himself indebted to a hand which unlock for he the inner chamber of a temple in whose outer court he have already delighted to wander without therefore say that the merely ` english reader ' may never derive pleasure and instruction from a translation of a foreign poet for to this rule we current version of the hebrew psalmist and prophet furnish one marked exception at least -- still it be probably to what may be call the half-learned class that the translator must preeminently look to find a audience the other cause of pindar 's unpopularity to which reference be make above the obscurity of he thought and the monotony of he subject will in great measure disappear by means of attentive study of the poem themselves and of other source from which may be gather a understanding of the region of thought and feeling in which they move in proportion to we familiarity not only with hellenic mythology and history but with hellenic life and habit of thought generally will be we readiness and facility in seize the drift and import of what pindar say in divine what have pass through he mind : and in he case perhaps even more than in the case of other poet this facility will increase indefinitely with we increase acquaintance with he work and with the light throw on each part of they by the rest -lrb- 1 -rrb- the monotony of the ode though to some extent unquestionably and unavoidably real be to some extent also superficial and in appearance only the family of the victor or he country some incident of he past some possibility of he future life suggest in each case some different legendary matter some different way of treat it some different application of it general or particular or both out of such resource pindar be inexhaustible in build up in subtly vary form the splendid structure of he song yet doubtless the drawback in read pindar though they may be largely reduce will always in some degree exist : we shall always wish that he be easier to construe that he allusion to thing unfamiliar and sometimes undiscoverable to we be less frequent that family pride have not make it customary for he to spend so many line on a enumeration of prize win elsewhere and at other time by the victor of the occasion or by he kin such drawback can only fall into insignificance when eclipse by consideration of the far more than counterbalance attraction of the poem of they unique and surpassing interest poetical historical and moral of pindar as a poet it be hard indeed to speak adequately and almost as hard to speak briefly for a discussion of he poetical characteristic once begin may wander far before even a small part have be say of what might be to say that to he poetry in supreme degree belong the quality of force of vividness often of impressive weight of a lofty style seem to be the expression of a like personality of a mastery of rhythm and metre and imaginative diction of a profoundly hellenic spirit modify by a unmistakable individuality above all of a certain sweep and swiftness as of the flight of a eagle 's wing -- to say all this would be to suggest some of the most obvious feature of these triumphal ode and each of these quality and many more require exacter delineation might be illustrate with numberless instance which even in the faint image of a translation would furnish ample testimony -lrb- 2 -rrb- but as this introduction be intend for those who purpose reading pindar 's poetry or at any rate the present translation of it for themselves i will leave it to they to discover for themselves the quality which have give pindar he high place among poet and will pass on to suggest briefly he claim to interest we by reason of he place in the history of human action and human thought we know very little of pindar 's life he be bear in or about the year bc 522 at the village of kynoskephalaus near thebe he be thus a citizen of thebe and seem to have always have he home there but he travel among other state many of which have be glorify by he art for he praise of athen ` bulwark of hella ' the city which at artemision ` lay the foundation of freedom ' the theban be say to have fine he but the generous athenian pay the fine make he they proxeno and erect he statue at the public cost for the magnificent sicilian prince hieron of syracuse and theron of akraga not unlike the medicus in the position they hold pindar write five of the longest of he extant ode and probably visit they in sicily but he would not quit he home to be a ornament of they court when ask why he do not like simonide accept the invitation of these potentate to make he home with they he answer that he have choose to live he own life and not to be the property of another he die at the age of 79 that be probably in the year 443 twelve year before the peloponnesian war begin legend say that he die in the theater of argo in the arm of theoxeno the boy in whose honor he write a skolion of which a immortal fragment remain to we other myth gather round he name it be say that once when in childhood he have fall asleep by the way ' a bee have settle on he lip and gather honey ' and again that ` he see in a dream that he mouth be fill with honey and the honeycomb ' that pan himself learn a poem of he and rejoice to sing it on the mountain that finally while he await a answer from the oracle of ammon whence he have enquire what be best for man persephone appear to he in he sleep and say that she only of the god have have no hymn from he but that he should make she one shortly when he have come to she and that he die within ten day of the vision two several conqueror of thebe pausania of sparta and alexander of macedon ` bid spare the house of pindarus when temple and tower go to the ground ' at delphus they keep with reverence he iron chair and the priest of apollo cry nightly as he close the temple ` let pindar the poet go in unto the supper of the god ' thus pindar be contemporary with a age of greek history which justify the assertion of he consummate interest for the student of hellenic life in its prime it be impossible that a man of he genius and temperament should have live through these time without represent to we with breadth and intensity the spirit that be in they and there be several point in pindar 's circumstance which make he relation to he age peculiarly interesting we may look on he as in some point supplementary to the great athenian dramatist whose work be doubtless far the most valuable literary legacy of the time perhaps however the surpass brilliance of athenian literature and history have make we somewhat prone to forget the importance of non-athenian element in the complex whole of hellenic life and think athen be the eye of hella nay she have at marathon and salami make good she claim to be call the saving arm but there be other member not to be forget if we would picture to ourselves the national body in its completeness pindar be a boeotian of a country not rich in literary or indeed any kind of intellectual eminence yet by no means to be ignore in a estimate of the hellenic race politically indeed it only rise into pre-eminence under epameinonda before and afterwards boeotian policy under the domination of thebe be seldom either beneficent or glorious : it must be remembered however that the gallant plataean also be boeotian the people of boeotium seem to have have generally a easy rather sensually inclined nature which accord with they rich country and absence of nautical and commercial enterprise and excitement but in they best man this disposition remain only in the form of a genial simplicity pelopida in political and plutarch and pausania in literary history will be allow to be instance of this that the poetry which penetrate hellenic life be not want in boeotium we have proof enough in the existence of the sacred band that goodly fellowship of friend which seem to have unite what hallam have call the three strongest motive to enthusiastic action that have appear in history patriotism chivalric honor and religion nor be there any nobler figure in history than that of epameinonda one fact indeed there be which must always make the thought of pindar 's theban citizenship painful to we and that be the shameful part take by thebe in the persian war when compulsion of she expose situation and oligarchical cabal within she wall draw she into unholy alliance with the barbarian invader have it be otherwise how passionately pure would pindar 's joy have utter itself when the ` stone of tantalo ' that hang over the head of hella be smite into dust in that greatest crisis of the fortune of humanity he exult nobly as it be he do all honor to athen ` bulwark of hella ' but the shame of he own city he ` mother ' thebe must have cause he a pang as bitter as a great soul have ever bear for he very call of song-writer to all hellenic state without discrimination especially when the song he have to write be of the class which we still possess triumphal ode for victory in those great game which draw to they all man of hellenic blood at the foot of common deity and which with each recur festival could even hush the clamor of war in a imperious truce of god -- such a call and such association must have cherish in he the passion for panhellenic brotherhood and unanimity even have there not be much else both within and without he to join to the same generous end it be the time when panhellenic feeling be probably stronger than ever before or after before the state have be occupy in build up they own polity independently the hellenic activity have be disperse itself centrifugally among the trans-marine colony and those of italy and sicily seem at one time to make it doubtful whether the nucleus of civilization be to be there or in the mother-country but by the time of the persian war the best energy of the race have concentrate themselves between the aegean and ionian sea and the supreme danger of the war have bind the state together against the common enemy and teach they to forget smaller difference in the great strife between hellene and barbarian yet again when that supreme danger be past the old quarrel arise anew more deadly and more complicated : instead of a persian there be a peloponnesian war and the peloponnesian war in its latter stage come by virtue of the political principle involve to partake much of the character of a civil war but the time of pindar of aeschylus of sophocle of pheidia of polygnoto be that happy interval when hella have beat off the barbarian from she throat and have not yet murder herself and pindar 's imagination and generosity be both kindle by the moment there be no room in he mind for border squabble for commercial jealousy for oligarchic or democratic envy : these thing be override by a sentiment of nationality want indeed in many circumstance which modern nationality deem essential to the existence of such sentiment and many of which be really essential to its permanence -- yet a sentiment which no other nation ever before or since can have possess in the peculiar lustre which it then wear in hella for no other nation have ever before or since know what it be to stand alone immeasurably advance at the head of the civilization of the world pindar be of a noble family of the house of the aigeidaus and it be probable that he kinsman or some of they may have take the side of oligarchy in the often recur dissension at thebe but of this we know nothing certain he himself seem to have take no part in politics when he speak on the subject in he ode it be not with the voice of a partisan a ochlocracy be hateful to he but if he show himself a ` aristocrat ' it be in the literal and etymological meaning of the word doubtless if pindar have be ask where the best servant of the state in public life be most likely to be find he would have answer that it would be among those ancient family in whose vein run the blood of god and demigod who have spend blood and money for the city 's honor champion she in war or in the mimic strife of the game who have honorable tradition to be guide by and a honorable name to lose or save these thing be seldom undervalue by hellenic feeling : even in athen after it be already the headquarters of the democratic principle the noble and wealthy family obtain not probably without wisdom of they own in loyally accept a democratic position as fair a place and prospects as anywhere in hella but that when the noble nature the -lrb- greek : areta -rrb- which tradition of nobility ought to have secure be lack then wealth and birth be still entitle to power this be a doctrine repugnant utterly to pindar 's mind : nor would he indignation slumber when he see the rich and highborn however gifted forget at any time that they power be a trust for the community and use it for they own selfish profit a ` aristocrat ' after pindar 's mind would assuredly have a far keener eye to he duty than to he rights would consider indeed that in he larger share of duty lay he infinitely most precious right but he ` love that beauty should go beautifully ' personal excellence of some kind be in he eye essential but on this he would fain shed outward radiance and majesty he imagination rejoice in splendor -- splendor of stately palace -- hall where the column be of marble and the entablature of work gold splendor of temple of god where the sculptor 's waxing art have bring the very deity to dwell with man splendor of the white-pillared city that glitter across the aegean and sicilian sea splendor of the holy panhellenic game of whirlwind chariot and the fiery grace of thoroughbred of the naked shapely limb of the athlete man and boy on this characteristic of pindar it be needless to dwell for there be not many ode of those remain which do not impress it on we mind and it be more with he than a mere manner in poetical style the same defect which we feel more or less present in all poet of antiquity -- least of all perhaps in virgil and sophokle but even in they somewhat -- a certain want of widely sympathetic tenderness this be unquestionably present in pindar what of this quality may have find expression in he lose poem especially the dirge we can scarcely guess but in he triumphal ode it hardly appear at all unless in the touch of tender gracefulness into which he soften when speaking of the young and we find this want in he mainly because object of pity such as especially elicit that quality of tenderness be never or seldom present to pindar 's mind he see evil only in the shape of some moral baseness falsehood envy arrogance and the like to be scathe in pass by the good man 's scorn or else in the shape of a dark mystery of pain to be endure by those on whom it causelessly fall in a proud though undefiant silence it be not for he as for the great tragedian to ` purge the mind by pity and fear ' for those passion have scarcely a place in he own mind or in the mind of those of whom he in he high phantasy would fain have have the world consist and as in this point somewhat so still more in other do pindar remind we even more than might have be expect in a contemporary of aeschylus the latter by virtue of he athenian nurture as well as of he own greater natural gift reveal to we a greater number of thought and those more advanced and more interesting than we find in pindar but the similarity in moral temper and tone be very striking as also be the way in which we see this temper act on they belief both hold strongly as be the wont of powerful mind in a age of stability as oppose to a age of transition to the tradition and belief on which the society around they rest but both modify these tradition and belief accord to the light which arise in they and which be as much moral as intellectual light in so do they be indeed in harmony with the best instinct of the society around they but they lead and guide such instinct and give they shape and definiteness in the oresteän trilogy of aeschylus we have a ever-memorable assertion of the supreme claim of human morality to human allegiance of the eternal truth that humanity can know no object of reverence and worship except itself idealise its own virtue victorious over its own vice and exist in the greatest perfection which it can at any give time conceive somewhat the same lesson as that of the oresteium be teach later with more of sweetness and harmony but not with more force in the oedipus coloneus of sophokle and in pindar we see the same tendency inchoate like aeschylus he do by implication subordinate to morality both politics and religion he ignore or flatly deny tale that bring discredit on the god he will only bow down to they when they have the virtue he respect in man yet he like aeschylus and sophokle do so bow down sincerely and without hesitation and that poet of they temper could do so be well indeed for poetry by rare and happy fortune they be inspire at once by the rich and vary presence of mythology ` the fair humanities of old religion ' and also by the highest aspiration of a age of moral and intellectual advance we do not of course always or even often find the moral principle clearly and consciously express or consistently support but we can not but feel that they be present in the shape of instinct and those instinct pervade and architectonic and if we allow so much of ethical enlightenment to these great spokesman of the hellenic people we can not deny something of like honor to the race among whom they be rear let we apportion we debt of gratitude to we forerunner as it be justly due there would seem to be much of fallacy and of the injustice of a shallow judgment in the contrast as popularly draw between ` hellenism ' and ` hebraism ' accord to which the former be speak of as exclusively proclaim to the world the value of beauty the latter the value of righteousness in this there be surely much injustice do to hella because she teach the one she do not therefore leave the other untaught it may have be for a short time as she other greatness be for a short time though its effect be eternal but for that short time the national life of athen at any rate be at least as full of high moral feeling as that of any other people in the world will not the name of solon of aristeide of kallikratida of epameinonda of timoleon and many more remind we that life could be to the hellene something of deeper moral import than a brilliant game or a garden of vivid and sweet sight and sound where beauty and knowledge enter but goodness be forget and shut out for it be not merely that these man and very many more endowed with ample portion of they spirit be produce and rear among the race they be honor and value in a way that surely postulate the existence of high ethical feeling in they countryman and even when the day of unselfish statesman and magnanimous city be over there be philosopher whose school be not the less fill because they claim a high place for righteousness in human life to solon and aristeide succeed socrate and plato to epameinonda and timoleon succeed zeno and epictetus that the morality of the hellene be complete on all side it would of course be irrational to maintain they have not for instance any more than the hebrew or any other nation of antiquity learn to abhor slavery though probably it exist in a milder form at athen than anywhere else in the old or new world : they be more implacable in revenge and laxer in sexual indulgence than the christian ethic would allow in theory though not perhaps much more so than christendom have show itself in practice and though undoubtedly the greatest single impulse ever give to morality come from palestine yet the ground which nurture the seed of christianity be as much hellenic as hebrew it would be impossible here to enter on a exhaustive comparison of the ethical capacity of the two race but before we pronounce hastily for the superiority of the hebrew there be surely some difficulty to surmount we may well ask for example would hella ever have accept as she chief national hero such a man as david a man who in he life be conspicuous by he crime not less than by he brilliant gift and who die with the word of blood and perfidy on he lip charge he son with the last slaughterous satisfaction of he hate which he have swear before he god to forego and though the great hebrew prophet teach often a far loftier morality than this they can not have be nearly so representative of the feeling of this nation as be aeschylus and sophocle and pindar of the feeling of theirs the hebrew of the prophet ' age ` slew the prophet ' and leave it to the slayer ' descendant to ` build they sepulchre ' and at the same time to show they inherit character still more unmistakeably by once more slaying the last prophet and the greatest -lrb- 3 -rrb- in truth in the literature the art the life generally of hella in she prime the moral interest whenever it appear and that be not seldom claim for itself the grave and preponderant attention which it must claim if it be to appear with fit dignity but it be not thrust forward unseasonably or in exaggeration nor be it place in a false opposition to the interest of the aesthetic instinct which after all shade into the moral more imperceptibly than might be generally allow there must be a moral side to all society and the hellenic society the choicest that the world have see the completest that be at once in sensibility and in energy could not but show the excellence of its sensibility in receive moral impression the excellence of its energy in achieve moral conduct this however be no place to discuss at length question in the history of ethic yet it must be remember that in the ancient world department of thought and the affair of man generally be far less specialized than in modern time if the philosophy of hella be the most explicit witness to she ethical development she poetry be the most eloquent and scarcely at any time scarcely even in aristotle do hellenic philosophy in any department lose most significant trace of its poetical ancestry but enough here if i have succeed in point out that in the great poet with whom we be concern there be a ethical as well as a poetical and historical interest supply one more reason against neglect of he legacy of song yet indeed even now there remain a further question which to the mind of any one who at present labor in this field of classical scholarship must recur persistently if not depressingly and on which it be natural if not necessary to say a few word if the selection of pindar in particular as a greek poet with claim to be further popularize among englishman may be defend there be still a more general count to which all who make endeavor to attract or retain attention to greek literature will in these time be call upon to plead by voice which command respect to such plea this be not the place to give large room or to discriminate in detail between the reasonable and unreasonable element in the attack on a system of education in which a preeminent position be allot to the literature of antiquity while fully admit that much time and labor be still waste in effort to plant the study of ancient and especially of greek literature in uncongenial soil while admit also most fully the claim and the still imperfect recognition of the claim of physical science to a rank among the foremost in modern education i should yet be abundantly willing that this attempt to help in facilitate the study of a greek author should be look on as imply adhesion to the protest still sometimes raise that in the higher part of a liberal education no study can claim a more important place than the study of the history and the literature of hella the interest which belong to these be far wider and deeper than any mere literary interest to the human mind the most interesting of phenomenon be and ought to be the phenomenon of the human mind and this grant can there be any knowledge more desirable than the knowledge of the most vigorous and sensitive and in some way also the most fruitful action of human mind that the world have know hitherto but again we be tell that the age we seek thus toilsomely to illustrate and realize be too remote to justify the attempt that we civilisation be of too different a type from the hellenic and that a gulf of three-and-twenty century be too much for we sight to strain across but be not the hellenic life at least less remote now to western europe than it have ever be since the northern invasion though the separation in time widen do not the separation in think decrease be not one civilisation more like another than it can be to any barbarism and shall not this same physical science herself by accustom we to look on man in large mass at once and on the development of humanity as a process of infinite duration as a sectional growth include in universal evolution -- science in whose eye a thousand year be as a watch in the night -- shall she not thereby quicken we sympathy with the most gifted race that have appear in we short human history and arouse the same feeling toward it as a family may cherish toward the memory of they best and choicest who have die young only let we take heed that such regret shall make we not more but less unworthy of those noble forerunner one symptom of the renew influence of antiquity on the modern world be doubtless and have be from time to time since the revival of letter a tendency to selfish and somewhat sickly theory so-called of life where sensibility degenerate through self-consciousness into affectation and effort to appreciate fully the delightfulness of life and art be overstrain into a wearisome literary voluptuousness where duty have already disappear and the human sympathy on which duty be base scarcely linger in a faint aesthetic form soon to leave the would-be exquisiteness to putrefy into the vulgarity of egoism such tendency have less in common with the hellenic prime than with the court of leo the tenth though even that have perhaps a advantage over they as be in some way a more real thing but that the hellenic prime with all its exquisite sensibility be deficient in recognition of a high ideal of duty can never be believe among those who have study it candidly and attentively i have endeavor above to suggest that in this point take it all in all it yield to no age or race it would indeed be a mistaken following of those noble servant of humanity to draw from they memory a argument for selfish isolation or for despair of the commonwealth of man he who have drunk deeply of that divine well and gaze long at the fair vision of what then be will if he nature be capable of true sympathy with the various element of that wonderful age turn again without bitterness to the confused modern world saddened but not paralyse by the comparison grieving but with no querulous grief for the certainty that those day be do 1874 prefatory note the few note append to this translation be not intend to supply the place of such reference to dictionary of mythology antiquity and geography as be needful to the student of pindar who be not already somewhat accomplish in knowledge of the custom history and legendary tradition of hella and although it may reasonably be suppose that the chief of these will be already know to most reader of pindar yet so profusely allusive be this poet that to understand he allusion will very often require knowledge which would not have be derive from a study of the more commonly read hellenic writer nor have i attempt to trace in detail the connection of the part in each ode which bind they into one harmonious whole with many meaning -- a connection so consummately contrived where we can trace it that we may suppose it no less exquisite where we can not study and think will generally suggest explanation though these will sometimes approve themselves differently to different mind too often we must acknowledge as elsewhere in ancient literature that the key be lose beyond all certain hope of recovery still less have i attempt to discuss question of critical scholarship sometimes where there be more than one plausible reading i have signify which i adopt once only -lrb- ol 2 56 -rrb- i have venture on a emendation of my own for the most part i have as be natural follow the text of böckh and dissen in the spelling of name i remain in that inconsistency which at present attach to most modern writer who deal with they olympus athen corinth syracuse and the like be naturalized among we by long familiarity it seem at present at least pedantic to change they in the case of other less familiar name i have concur with the desire which seem in the main a reasonable one that the name of hellenic person and place should be reproduce as far as possible without latin mediation of the fragment i have translate six of the longest and most interesting they be 289 in all but the greater part be not longer than a line or two and very many even shorter the ode be unequal in poetical merit and many reader may not unreasonably wish to have those point out which in the judgement of one acquaint with all be among the best worth read though of course the choice of individual reader will not always be the same to those therefore who would wish to begin with a selection the follow may be recommend as at any rate among those of preeminent merit : pyth 4 9 1 10 3 ol 7 6 2 3 13 8 1 nem 5 10 isthm 2 7 all the fragment translate in the arrangement of the ode i have adhere to the traditional order i should much have like to place they in what must always be the most interesting and rational arrangement of a poet 's work that be in chronological order this would have be approximately possible as we know the date of the greater part of they but convenience of reference and of comparison with the greek text seem to supply a balance of reason on the other side subjoin

battle into the heart of man yet withal there cometh upon they bafflingly the cloud of forgetfulness and maketh the mind to swerve from the straight path of action for they though they have brand burn yet kindle not the seed of flame but with fireless rite they make a grove on the hill of the citadel for they zeus bring a yellow cloud into the sky and rain much gold upon the land and glaukopi herself give they to excel the dweller upon earth in every art of handicraft for on they road run the semblance of beast and creep thing : whereof they have great glory for to he that have knowledge the subtlety that be without deceit -lrb- 2 -rrb- be the greater altogether now the ancient story of man saith that when zeus and the other god make division of the earth among they not yet be island rhode apparent in the open sea but in the briny depths lay hide and for that helio be otherwhere none draw a lot for he so they leave he portionless of land that holy god and when he speak thereof zeus would cast lot afresh but he suffer he not for that he say that beneath the hoary sea he see a certain land wax from its root in earth that should bring forth food for many man and rejoice in

proclamation that he country be aigina of long oar where savior themi who sitteth in judgment by zeus the stranger 's succor be honor more than any elsewhere among man -lrb- 2 -rrb- for in a matter mighty and bear many way to judge with unswayed mind and suitably this be a hard essay yet have some ordinance of immortal give this sea-defended land to be to stranger out of every clime a pillar build of god may come time not weary of this work to a dorian folk be the land give in trust from aiako even the man whom leto 's son and far-ruling poseidon when they would make a crown for ilion call to work with they at the wall for that it be destine that at the uprising of war in city-wasting fight it should breathe forth fierce smoke now when it be new-built three dragon fiery-eyed leap at the rampart : two fall and perish in despair but the third spring in with a war-cry -lrb- 3 -rrb- then apollo ponder the sign spake straightway unto aiako by he side : ` hero where thy hand have work be pergamos take : thus saith this sign send of the son of krono loud-thundering zeus and that not without thy seed but with the first and fourth it shall be subdue ' -lrb- 4 -rrb- thus plainly

verily to teach be easier to he that knoweth : it be folly if one have not first learn for without trial the mind wavereth and beyond all other can melesia declare all work on that wise what method shall advance a man who from the sacred game may win the longed-for glory now for the thirtieth time be honor gain for he by the victory of alkimedon who by god 's grace nor fail himself in prowess have put off from he upon the body of four stripling the loathe return ungreeted of fair speech and the path obscure -lrb- 7 -rrb- and in he father 's father he have breathe new vigor to wrestle with old age a man that have do honorable deed taketh no thought of death but i must need arouse memory and tell of the glory of they hand that give victory to the blepsiad clan to whom this be now the sixth crown that have come from the wreathe game to bind they brow even the dead have they share when pay they with due rite and the grace of kinsman 's honor the dust concealeth not from herme '

1 : alkimedon 's brother he have win a victory at the nemean game -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : aigina have a high commercial reputation and stranger be equitably deal with in she court -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : the two first dragon typify the aiakid aia and achille who fail to enter troy the third typify achille ' son neoptolemo who succeed -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : aiako ' son telamon be with

and kallimacho the uncle of alkimedon -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : perhaps iphion and kallimacho die of some severe illness -rrb- ix for epharmosto of opous winner in the wrestling-match \* \* \* \* \* the date of this ode be uncertain its last line seem to imply that it be sing at a banquet at opous after crowning the altar of aias oileus tutelar hero of the lokrian from the beginning we gather that on the night of the victory at olympium epharmosto ' friend have sing in he honor the conventional triple strain of archilocho -- -lrb- greek : -lrb- o kallinike chair ' anax herakleae auto te k ' iolao aichmaeta duo taenellum kallinike -rrb- -rrb- to which perhaps some slight addition have be make but not by pindar \* \* \* \* \* the strain of archilocho sing without music at olympium the triple resonant psalm of victory suffice to lead to the hill of krono epharmosto triumph with he comrade friend : but now with dart of other sort shot from the muse ' far-delivering bow praise zeus of the red lightning and eli ' holy headland which on a time pelop the lydian hero choose to be hippodameium 's goodly dower and shoot a feathered arrow of sweet song pythoward for thy word shall not fall to the ground when thou tunest the throbbing lyre to the praise of the wrestling of a man from famous opous and celebratest she and she son for themi and she noble daughter eunomium the preserver have make she they own and she flourisheth in excellent deed both at kastalium and beside alpheo ' stream : whence come the choicest of all crown to glorify the mother city of lokrian the city of beautiful tree i to illuminate the city of my friend with eager blaze of song swifter than high-bred steed or winged ship will send everywhere these tiding so be it that my hand be bless at all in labor in the choice garden of the grace for they give all pleasant thing to man by fate divine receive man also valor and wisdom : how else -lrb- 1 -rrb- might the hand of herakle have wield he club against the trident when at pylo poseidon take he stand and prest hard on he ay and there prest he hard embattled phoibo with he silver bow neither would hade keep he staff unraised wherewith he leadeth down to way beneath the hollow earth the body of man that die o my mouth fling this tale from thee for to speak evil of god be a hateful wisdom and loud and unmeasured word strike a note that trembleth upon madness of such thing talk thou not leave war of immortal and all strife aside and bring thy word to the city of protogeneium where by decree of zeus of the bicker lightning-flash pyrrha and deukalion come down from parnasso first fix they home and without bed of marriage make out of stone a race to be one folk : and hence cometh the name of people -lrb- 2 -rrb- awake for they the clear-toned gale of song and if old wine be best yet among song prefer the newer flower truly man say that once a mighty water sweep over the dark earth but by the craft of zeus a ebb suddenly draw off the flood from these first man come anciently you ancestor of the brazen shield son of the woman of the stock of iapeto and of the mighty kronidaus king that dwell in the land continually until the olympian lord catch up the daughter -lrb- 3 -rrb- of opöeis from the land of the epeian and lay with she in a silent place among the ridge of mainalo and afterward bring she unto lokro that age might not bring he -lrb- 4 -rrb- low beneath the burden of childlessness but the wife bare within she the seed of the mightiest and the hero see the bastard bear and rejoice and call he by the name of he mother 's father and he become a man preeminent in beauty and great deed : and he father give unto he a city and a people to rule over then there come unto he stranger from argo and from thebe and from arcadium other and from pisa but the son of aktor and aigina menoitio he honor above all settler he whose son -lrb- 5 -rrb- go with the atreidaus to the plain of teuthra and stand alone beside achille when telepho have turn the valiant danaous to flight and drive they into the stern of they sea-ship so prove he to they that have understanding that patroklo ' soul be strong and thenceforward the son of theti persuade he that he should never in murderous battle take he post far from he friend 's conquer spear fit speech may i find for my journey in the muse ' car and let I therewith have daring and power of ample scope to back the prowess of a friend i come when lampromacho win he isthmian crown when on the same day both he and he brother overcome and afterward at the gate -lrb- 6 -rrb- of corinth two triumph again befall epharmosto and more in the valley of nemea at argo he triumph over man as over boy at athen and i might tell how at marathon he steal from among the beardless and confront the full-grown for the prize of silver vessel how without a fall he throw he man with swift and cunning shock and how loud the shout peal when round the ring he run in the beauty of he youth and he fair form and fresh from fairest deed also before the parrhasian host be he glorify at the assembly of lykaian zeus and again when at pellene he bare away a warm antidote of cold wind -lrb- 7 -rrb- and the tomb of iolao and eleusis by the sea be just witness to he honor the natural be ever best : yet many man by learning of prowess essay to achieve fame the thing do without god be better keep in silence for some way lead further than do other but one practice will not train we all alike skill of all kind be hard to attain unto : but when thou bringest forth this prize proclaim aloud with a good courage that by fate divine this man at least be bear deft-handed nimble-limbed with the light of valor in he eye and that now be victorious he have crown at the feast oilean alas ' altar -lrb- footnote 1 : this be the common interpretation imply that herakle in contend with the god here mention must have be help by other god but perhaps it might also be translate ` therefore how could the hand & c ' mean that since valor as have just be say come from a divine source it could not be use against god and that thus the story ought to be reject -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : perhaps the story of the stone arise from the like sound of -lrb- greek : lao -rrb- and -lrb- greek : laa -rrb- word here regard in the inverse relation to each other -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : protogeneium -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : lokro -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : patroklo -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : the isthmus the gate between the two sea -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : a cloak the prize -rrb- x for agesidamo of epizephyrian lokri winner in the boy ' boxing-match \* \* \* \* \* this ode bear somewhat the same relation to the next that the fourth do to the fifth it be to be sing at olympium on the night after the victory and pindar promise the boy to write a longer one for the celebration of he victory in he italian home the date be bc 484 \* \* \* \* \* sometimes have man most need of wind sometimes of shower water of the firmament the child of the cloud but when through he labor one fareth well then be due honey-voiced song be they even a prelude to word that shall come after a pledge confirm by oath in honor of high excellence ample be the glory store for olympian winner : thereof my shepherd tongue be fain to keep some part in fold but only by the help of god be wisdom -lrb- 1 -rrb- keep ever bloom in the soul son of archestrato agesidamo know certainly that for thy boxing i will lay a glory of sweet strain upon thy crown of golden -lrb- 2 -rrb- olive and will have in remembrance the race of the lokrian ' colony in the west there do ye o muse join in the song of triumph : i pledge my word that to no stranger-banishing folk shall ye come nor unacquainted with thing noble but of the highest in art and valiant with the spear for neither tawny fox nor roar lion may change he native temper -lrb- footnote 1 : perhaps -lrb- greek : sopho -rrb- -lrb- which mean often rather clever or skilful than wise -rrb- have here the special reference to poetic skill which it often have in pindar -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : golden here mean supremely excellent as in the first line of the eighth olympian -rrb- xi for agesidamo of epizephyrian lokri winner in the boy ' boxing-match \* \* \* \* \* it would seem by he own confession that pindar do not remember till long afterwards the promise he make to agesidamo in the last ode we do not know how long afterwards this be write but it must have be too late to greet the winner on he arrival in italy probably it be to be sing at the anniversary or some memorial celebration of he victory \* \* \* \* \* read I the name of the olympic winner archestrato ' son that i may know where it be write upon my heart : for i have forget that i owe he a sweet strain but do thou o muse and thou truth daughter of zeus put forth you hand and keep from I the reproach of have wrong a friend by break my pledge word for from afar have overtaken I the time that be then yet to come and have shame my deep debt nevertheless from that sore reproach i may be deliver by payment with usury : behold how -lrb- 1 -rrb- the rush wave sweepeth down the roll shingle and how we also will render for we friend 's honor a tribute to he and to he people truth inhabiteth the city of the lokrian of the west and kalliope they hold in honor and mailëd are yea even conquer herakle be foiled by that kykneän combat -lrb- 2 -rrb- now let agesidamo winner in the boxing at olympium so render thanks to ila -lrb- 3 -rrb- as patroklo of old to achille if one be bear with excellent gift then may another who sharpeneth he natural edge speed he god help to a exceed weight of glory without toil there have triumph a very few of that light in the life of a man before all other deed that first of contest the ordinance of zeus -lrb- 4 -rrb- have stir I to sing even the game which by the ancient tomb of pelop the mighty herakle found after that he slew kleato poseidon 's goodly son and slew also euryto that he might wrest from tyrannous augea against he will reward for service do -lrb- 5 -rrb- lie in ambush beneath kleonaus do herakle overcome they on the road for that formerly these same violent son of molo make havoc of he own tirynthian folk by hide in the valley of eli and not long after the guest-betraying king of the epean see he rich native land he own city beneath fierce fire and iron blow sink down into the deep moat of calamity of strife against stronger power it be hard to be rid likewise augeas last of all in he perplexity fall into captivity and escape not precipitate death then the mighty son of zeus have gather together all he host at pisa and all the booty measure a sacred grove for he sovereign father and have fence round the alti he mark the bound thereof in a clear space and the plain encompass it he ordain for rest and feast and pay honor to the river alpheo together with the twelve greatest god and he name it by the name of the hill of krono for theretofore it be without name when oinomao be king and it be sprinkle with much snow -lrb- 6 -rrb- and at this first-born rite the fate stand hard at hand and he who alone proveth sure truth even time he travel onward have tell we the clear tale of how the founder set apart the choicest of the spoil for a offering from the war and sacrifice and how he ordain the fifth-year feast with the victory of that first olympiad who then win to they lot the new-appointed crown by hand or foot or chariot setting before they the prize of glory in the game and win it by they act in the foot-race down the straight course of the stadion be likymnio ' son oiono first from nidea have he lead he host : in the wrestling be tegea glorified by echemo : doryklo win the prize of boxing a dweller in the city of tiryn and with the four-horse chariot samo of mantinea halirrhothio ' son : with the javelin phrastor hit the mark : in distance enikeus beyond all other hurl the stone with a circle sweep and all the warrior company thunder a great applause then on the evening the lovely shine of the fair-faced moon beam forth and all the precinct sound with song of festal glee after the manner which be to this day for triumph so follow the first beginning of old time we likewise in a song name of proud victory will celebrate the thunder and the flaming bolt of loud-pealing zeus the fiery lightning that goeth with all victory -lrb- 7 -rrb- and soft tone to the music of the flute shall meet and mingle with my verse which beside famous dirke have come to light after long time but even as a son by he lawful wife be welcome to a father who have now travel to the other side of youth and maketh he soul warm with love -- for wealth that must fall to a strange owner from without be most hateful to a die man -- so also agesidamo when a man who have do honorable deed goeth unsung to the house of hade this man have spend vain breath and win but brief

reading -lrb- greek : horat on hopa -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : this kykno seem to have be a lokrian freebooter say to have fight with success against herakle -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : he trainer -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : probably because zeus be especially concerned both with the fulfilment of promise and with the olympic game -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : for the story of these molione see nestor 's speech hom il xi 670-761 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : perhaps this imply a tradition of a colder climate anciently prevail in peloponneso : perhaps the mention of snow be merely picturesque refer to the habitual appearance of the hill in winter and the passage should then rather be render ` when oinomao be king its snow-sprinkled top be without name ' -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : the lokrian worship zeus especially as the thunderer as certain coin of theirs stamp with a thunderbolt still testify -rrb- xii for ergotele of himera winner in the long foot-race \* \* \* \* \* ergotele be a native of

some happiness profound son of philanor verily even the glory of thy fleet foot would have fall into the sere leaf unrenowned abide by the hearth of thy kin as a cock that fighteth but at home have

victory in the game and in this same year 474 he have defeat the etruscan or tuscan or tyrrhenian in a great sea-fight before cuma pindar might well delight to honor those who have be wage so well against the barbarian of the south and west the same war which the hellene of the mother-country wage against the barbarian of the east \* \* \* \* \* o golden lyre thou common treasure of apollo and

at the hand of god such as none of the hellene have reap a proud crown of wealth for after the ensample of philoktete he go but now to war : and when necessity be upon they even they of proud spirit seek of he a boon to lemno once they say come godlike hero to fetch thence the archer son of paian vexed of a ulcerous wound and he sack the city of priam and make a end of the danaous 's labor for

god-built freedom after the law of hyllic pattern have that city be found of hieron 's hand : for the desire of the son of pamphylo and of the herakleidaus dwelling beneath the height of taÿgetos be to abide continually in the dorian law of aigimio at amyklaus they dwell prosperously when they be come down out of pindo and draw near in honor to the tyndaridaus who ride on white horse and the

hieron of syracuse winner in the chariot-race \* \* \* \* \* the classification of this ode as pythian be probably a mistake : perhaps the victory be win at the theban festival in honor of herakle or of iolao anaxilao tyrant of rhegium and messana have be deter by hieron 's threat from attack the epizephyrian lokrian and the ode be partly occupy with congratulation of hieron on this protective act as anaxilao die bc 476 and hieron be only place at the head of the syracusan state two year before this seem to fix the date somewhere in these two year as pindar talk of send he song across the sea we may suppose that it be sing at syracuse there be much obscurity about the significance of this ode the poet 's motive in tell the story of ixion 's sin have be variously guess at some think it be mean to deter hieron from contrive the death of he brother polyzelo in battle in order to get possession of polyzelo ' wife -lrb- and if hieron be to be suspect of such a thought it would be quite in pindar 's manner to mingle warning and reproof with praise -rrb- : some think that it refer to the ingratitude of anaxilao toward hieron and most probably the latter part of the ode in which sincerity be approve and flattery and calumny be condemn have some special and personal reference though we need not suppose as the commentator be fond of do here and elsewhere that it be aim at bacchylide or other rival poet \* \* \* \* \* great city of syracuse precinct of warrior are of iron-armed man and steed the nursing-place divine to thee i come -lrb- 1 -rrb- bearing from my bright thebe this song

she by whose help he tame with soothing hand he colt of spangled rein for the archer maiden with both hand fitteth the glittering trappings and herme god of game whensoever hieron to the polished car

speech of cyprus echoeth around the name of kinyras he whom apollo of the golden hair love fervently and who dwell a priest in the house of aphrodite : for to such praise be man move by the thankfulness that followeth the recompense of friendly act but of thee o thou son of deinomene the maiden daughter of the lokrian in the west before the house-door telleth in she song be out of bewildering woe of war by thy might deliver so that she eye be not afraid for anything ixion they say by order of the god writhe on he winged wheel proclaimeth this message unto man : _ to he who doeth thee service make recompense of fair reward _ this lesson learn he plainly for when that among the friendly kronidaus he have get a life of pleasantness he bliss become greater than he could bear and with mad heart he lust after hera whose place be in the happy marriage-bed of zeus : yet insolence drive he to the exceed folly but quickly suffer he desert the man gain to himself a misery most rare two sin be the cause of he pain one that he first among the hero shed blood of kindred -lrb- 3 -rrb- craftily the other that in the chamber of the ample heaven he attempt the wife of zeus -- for in all thing it behoveth to take measure by oneself -lrb- 4 -rrb- yet a mock love-bed hurry he as he approach the couch -lrb- 5 -rrb- into a sea of trouble for he lay with a cloud pursue the sweet lie fond man : for its form be as the form of the most highest among the daughter of heaven even the child of krono and the hand of zeus have make it that it might be a snare unto he a fair mischief thus come he unto the four-spoked wheel he own destruction and have fall into chain without escape he become proclaimer of that message -lrb- 6 -rrb- unto many he mate -lrb- 7 -rrb- without favor of the grace bare unto he a monstrous son and like no other thing anywhere even as its mother be a thing with no place or honor neither among man neither in the society of god he she rear and call by the name kentauro and he in the valley of pelion lay with magnesian mare and there be bear thence a wondrous tribe like unto both parent they nether part like unto the dam and they upper part like unto the sire god achieveth all end whereon he thinketh -- god who overtaketh even the winged eagle and outstrippeth the dolphin of the sea and bringeth low many a man in he pride while to other he giveth glory incorruptible for I it be meet to eschew the sharp tooth of bitter word for though afar off i have see the fierce archilocho lack most thing and fattening but on cruel word of hate of most worth

saith that ever yet be any man of old time throughout hella who excel thee in honor or in the multitude of possession such a one with vain purpose essayeth a fruitless task upon the flower-crowned

by a unjust balance and they own heart they afflict with bitter pain till such time as they attain to that which they heart devise to take the car 's yoke on one 's neck and run on lightly this

uncertain but as phereniko the horse that win this race at pytho be the same that win at olympium bc 472 in honor of which event the first olympian be write the victory can not have be very long before that date though the language of the ode imply that it be write a good deal later probably for a anniversary of the victory it must at least have be write before hieron 's death in 467 it be much occupy with he illness \* \* \* \* \* fain be i -lrb- if meet it be to utter from my mouth the prayer conceive of all -rrb- that cheiron the son of philyra be alive and have not perish among man even the wide-ruling seed of krono the son of ourano and that there still lord it in pelion 's glen that beast untame whose soul be loving unto man even such as when of old he train the gentle deviser of limb-saving anodyne asklepio the hero that be a defense against all kind of bodily plague of he be the daughter -lrb- 1 -rrb- of phlegya of goodly steed not yet deliver by eileithuium aid of mother ere by the golden bow she be slay at the hand of artemi and from she child-bed chamber go down into the house of hade by contrive of apollo not idle be the wrath of son of zeus she in the folly of she heart have set apollo at nought and take another spouse without knowledge of she sire albeit ere then she have lie with phoibo of the unshorn hair and bare within she the seed of a very god neither await she the marriage-table nor the sound of many voice in hymeneal song such as the bride 's girl-mate be wont to sing at eventide with merry minstrelsy : but lo she have longing for thing otherwhere even as many before and after for a tribe there be most foolish among man of such as scorn the thing of home and gaze on thing that be afar off and chase a cheating prey with hope that shall never be fulfil of such sort be the frenzied strong desire fair-robed koroni harbour in she heart for she lay in the couch of a stranger that be come from arcady but one that watch beheld she : for albeit he be at sheep-gathering pytho yet be the temple 's king loxia aware thereof beside he unerring partner -lrb- 2 -rrb- for he give heed to he own wisdom he mind that knoweth all thing in lie it have no part neither in act or thought may god or man deceive he therefore when he be aware of how she lay with the stranger ischy son of elato and of she guile unrighteous he send he sister fierce with terrible wrath to go to lakereium -- for by the steep shore of the boibian lake be the home of she virginity -- and thus a doom adverse blast she life and smite she down : and of she neighbor many fare ill therefore and perish with she : so doth a fire that from one spark have leap upon a mountain lay waste wide space of wood but when she kinsfolk have lay the damsel upon the pile of wood and fierce brightness of hephaisto run around it then say apollo : ` not any longer may i endure in my soul to slay mine own seed by a most cruel death in company with its mother 's grievous fate ' he say and at the first stride he be there and from the corpse catch up the child and the blaze of the burning fiery pile be cleave before he asunder in the midst then to the kentaur of magne he bare the child that he should teach he to be a healer of the many-plaguing malady of man and thus all that come unto he whether plague with self-grown sore or with limb wound by the lustrous bronze or stone far-hurled or mar by summer heat or winter cold -- these he deliver loose each from he several infirmity some with emollient spell and some by kindly potion or else he hang they limb with charm or by surgery he raise they up to health yet have even wisdom be lead captive of desire of gain even he do gold in he hand glitter beguile for a great reward to bring back from death a man already prisoner thereto : wherefore the hand of the son of krono smite the twain of they through the midst and bereft they breast of breath and the bright lightning deal they doom it behoveth to seek from god thing meet for mortal soul know the thing that be in we path and to what portion we be bear desire not thou dear my soul a life immortal but use the tool that be to thine hand now be wise cheiron in he cavern dwelling yet and have we sweet-voiced song lay haply some fair magic on he soul then have i win he to grant to worthy man some healer of hot plague some offspring of leto 's son or of she son 's sire -lrb- 3 -rrb- and then in a ship would i have sail cleave the ionian sea to the fountain of arethusa to the home of my aitnaian friend who ruleth at syracuse a king of good will to the citizen not envious of the good to stranger wondrous fatherly have i but land there and bring unto he a twofold joy first golden health and next this my song of triumph to be a splendor in he pythian crown which of late phereniko -lrb- 4 -rrb- win by he victory at kirrha -- i say that then should i have come unto he after that i have pass over the deep sea a farther-shining light than any heavenly star but i be mind to pray to the mother -lrb- 5 -rrb- for he to the awful goddess unto whom and unto pan before my door nightly the maiden move in dance and song yet o hieron if thou art skilled to apprehend the true meaning of saying thou hast learn to know this from the man of old _ the immortal deal to man two ill thing for one good _ the foolish can not bear these with steadfastness but the good only put the fair side forward but thee a lot of happiness attendeth for if on any man have mighty destiny look favourably surely it be on a chief and leader of a people a life untroubled abode not either with peleus son of aiako or with godlike kadmo : yet of all mortal these they say have highest bliss who both erewhile listen to the singing of the muse golden-fillet the one in seven-gated thebe when he wed large-eyed harmonium the other on the mountainside when he take to he thetis to be he wife wise nereus ' glorious daughter and with both of they god sate at meat and they behold the son of krono sit as king on throne of gold and they receive from they gift for they espousal and by grace of zeus they escape out of they former toil and raise up they heart to gladness yet again in the after time the bitter anguish of those daughter -lrb- 6 -rrb- rob kadmo of a part of bliss : howbeit the father zeus come to white-armed thyone 's -lrb- 7 -rrb- longed-for couch and so do the son of peleus whom theti bare at phthia she only son die by a arrow in war and move the danaoi to lament aloud when he body be burn in fire now if any by wisdom have the way of truth he may yet lack good fortune which cometh of the happy god the blast of soar wind blow various way at various time not for long cometh happiness to man when it accompanieth they in exceed weight small will i be among the

kyrene in africa a occasion for tell the story of jason 's expedition with the argonaut the ostensible reason for introduce the story be that kyrene have be colonise from the island of thera by the descendant of the argonaut euphemo accord to the prophecy of medea related at the beginning of the ode but pindar have another reason he wish to suggest a analogy between the relation of the iolkian king pelia to jason and the relation of arkesila to he exile kinsman demophilo demophilo have be stay at thebe where pindar write this ode to be afterwards recite at kyrene it be write bc 466 when pindar be fifty-six year of age and be unsurpassed in he extant work or indeed by anything of this kind in all poetry \* \* \* \* \* this day o muse must thou tarry in a friend 's house the house of

a city of goodly chariot upon a white breast of the swell earth and might fulfil in the seventeenth generation the word of medea speak at thera which of old the passionate child of aiete queen of colchian breathe from immortal lip for on this wise spake she to the warrior jason 's god-begotten crew : ` hearken o son of high-hearted mortal and of god lo i say unto you that from this sea-lashed

misty plain -lrb- 6 -rrb- he sometime shall phoibo in he golden house admonish by oracle when in the latter day he shall go down into the inner shrine at pytho to bring a host in ship to the rich

into the chariot of he victory and biddeth we sing aloud to the mother -lrb- 1 -rrb- and she twin child who keep watch over high pytho in fellowship now there be a say among man that one hide not in silence on the ground a good deed do : and meet for such brave tale be divine song therefore will we arouse the peal lyre and rouse the flute in honor of the very crown of all contest of steed which adrasto in honor of phoibo ordain beside asopo ' stream whereof when i make mention with voiceful honor i will celebrate withal the hero -lrb- 2 -rrb- who then be king in that place do by the founding of a new feast and struggle of the strength of man and of carven car make he city know abroad and glorious for he be fly before amphiarao of bold counsel and before a dangerous civil strife from argo and he father 's house : for no longer be the son of talao lord therein for a sedition have thrust they forth the stronger man endeth the contention that have be before but when they have give to the son of oikleus for he wife as one should give surety of a oath eriphyle the slayer of she husband they become the greatest of the fair-haired danaous so thereafter lead they on a time against seven-gated thebe a host of man but not by a road of sign propitious : nor would the son of krono speed they on they mad journey from they home but by the quiver lightning he dart forth he bid they hold from they road -lrb- 3 -rrb- but unto a reveal calamity hast that company to go forth with bronze shield and the gear of steed and on the bank of ismeno stay from they sweet return they feed the

soul should be shame by the smiting of he in the back by periklymeno ' spear for when the terror cometh of heaven then flee even the son of god if it be possible o son of krono this trial of valor against phenician spear -lrb- 4 -rrb- for life or death i would fain defer unto the utmost : and i beg of thee to grant unto the son of the man of aitna for long time a portion in good law and to make they people to dwell among glory that the citizen have win man be there here that love steed and that have soul above desire of wealth hard of credence be the word i have speak for the spirit of honor which bringeth glory be steal secretly by lust of gain hadst thou be shield-bearer to chromio among foot and horse and in fighting of ship thou hadst judge concern he jeopardy in the fierce fray for in war do that divine honor stir he warrior-soul to ward off havoc of enyalio few be there who may prevail by strength or valor to contrive a turning of the cloud of imminent death against the rank of the enemy howbeit they tell how hektor 's glory flower beside skamander 's stream and thus on the steep cliff of heloro ' bank -lrb- 5 -rrb- where man call the ford the fountain of are have this light

youth have be do with righteousness there ripeneth toward old age a day of calm let chromio know that he have from the god a lot of wondrous bliss for if one together with much wealth have win he glorious renown it be impossible that a mortal 's foot touch any further mountain-top the banquet loveth peace and by a gentle song a victory flourisheth afresh and beside the bowl the singer 's voice waxeth brave let one mix it now that sweet proclaimer of the triumphal song and in silver goblet hand the grape ' potent child even the goblet which for chromio he mare erst win and send to he from sacred sikyon entwine with well-earned crown of leto 's son now claim i father zeus to have well sing this excellent deed by aid of the charite and beyond many to do honor to this victory by my word

the son of oikleus the storm-cloud of war moreover in woman of beautiful hair doth the land excel thereto in day of old zeus testify when he follow after alkmene and after danaë and in the father of adrasto and in lynkeus do argo mingle ripe wisdom with upright justice : and she rear the warrior amphitryon now he come to the height of honor in he descendant for in bronze armor he slew the teleboaus and in he likeness the king of the immortal enter he hall bear the seed of fearless herakle whose bride in olympo be hebe who by the side of she mother the queen of marriage walketh of all divinity most fair my tongue would fail to tell in full the honor wherein the sacred argive land have part : also the distaste -lrb- 5 -rrb- of man be ill to meet yet wake the well-strung lyre and take thought of wrestling a strife for the bronze shield stirreth the folk to sacrifice of oxen unto hera and to the issue of game wherein the son of oulias theaios have overcome twice have obtain forgetfulness of the toil he lightly bear also on a time at pytho he be first of the hellenic host and win crown at isthmo and at nemea lead thither by fair hap and give work for the muse ' plough by thrice win at the gate -lrb- 6 -rrb- of the sea and thrice on the famous plain in the pasture of adrasto ' home -lrb- 7 -rrb- of that he longeth for o father zeus he mouth be silent with thee be the issue of deed : but with a spirit strong to labor and of a good courage he prayeth thy grace both theaio and whosoever struggleth in the perfect consummation of all game know this even the supremacy of the ordinance of herakle that be holden at pisa -lrb- 8 -rrb- : yet sweet prelude strain be those that twice have welcome he triumph at the festival of the athenian : and in earthenware baked in the fire within the closure of figure urn there come among the goodly folk of hera -lrb- 9 -rrb- the prize of the olive fruit -lrb- 10 -rrb- on the renowned race of thy mother 's sire there waiteth glory of game by favor of the grace and the son of tyndareus together be i kinsman of thrasyklo and antias i would claim at argo not to hide mine eye for with how many victory have this horse-breeding city of proito flourish even in the corinthian corner and from the man of kleonaus -lrb- 11 -rrb- four time and from sikyon they come laden with silver even goblet for wine and out of pellene clothe in soft woof of wool -lrb- 12 -rrb- but to tell over the multitude of they prize of bronze be a thing impossible -- to count they longer leisure be need -- which kleitor and tegea and the achaian ' high-set city and the lykaion set for a prize by the race-course of zeus for the conqueror by strength of hand or foot and since kastor and he brother polydeuke come to be the guest of pamphae -lrb- 13 -rrb- no marvel be it that to be good athlete should be inborn in the race for they -lrb- 14 -rrb- it be who be guardian of the wide plain of sparta with herme and herakle mete out fair hap in game and to righteous man they have great regard faithful be the race of god now change clime alternately they dwell one day with they dear father zeus and the next in the secret place under the earth within the valley of therapnaus fulfil equal fate : because on this wise choose polydeuke to live he life rather than to be altogether god and abide continually in heaven when that kastor have fall in the fight he do idas wroth for he oxen smite with a bronze spearhead when from he watch upon taÿgetos lynkeus have see they sit within a hollow oak for he of all man walk the earth have keenest eye so with swift foot they be straightway come to the place and compass speedily a dreadful deed -lrb- 15 -rrb- but terrible also be the vengeance which by the devise of zeus those son -lrb- 16 -rrb- of aphareus suffer : for on the instant come leto 's son -lrb- 17 -rrb- in chase of they : and they stand up against he hard by the sepulchre of they father thence wrench they a carve headstone that be set to glorify the dead and they hurl it at the breast of polydeuke but they crush he not neither make he give back but rush onward with fierce spear he drave the bronze head into lynkeus ' side and against ida zeus hurl a thunderbolt of consume fire so be those brother in one flame -lrb- 18 -rrb- burnt unbefriended : for a strife with the stronger be grievous for man to mix in then quickly come back the son of tyndareus -lrb- 19 -rrb- to he great brother and find he not quite dead but the death-gasp rattle in he throat then polydeuke weep hot tear and groan and lift up he voice and cry : ` father kronion -- ah what shall make a end of woe bid I I also o king to die with he the glory be depart from a man bereave of friend few be they who in a time of trouble be faithful in companionship of toil ' thus say he and zeus come and stand before he face and spake these word : ` thou art my son : but thy brother afterward be by mortal seed begotten in thy mother of the hero that be she husband but nevertheless behold i give thee choice of these two lot : if shun death and hateful old age thou desirest for thyself to dwell in olympus with athene and with are of the shadow spear this lot be thine to take : but if in thy brother 's cause thou art so hot and art resolve in all to have equal share with he then half thy time thou shalt be alive beneath the earth and half in the golden

winner for whom the sixth pythian ode be write its date would seem to be 476 while that of the sixth pythian be 494 yet the opening passage of this ode seem to imply that xenokiate ' son thrasyboulo be still little more than a boy whereas in 494 he have be old enough to be he father 's charioteer and this would be eighteen year later but perhaps the passage be only a allusion to thrasyboulo ' boyhood as a time past and certainly both xenokrate and he brother theron seem to be speak of in this ode as already dead and we know that theron do not die till 473 perhaps therefore thrasyboulo be celebrate in 472 the anniversary of he deceased father 's victory four year after the victory itself \* \* \* \* \* the man of old thrasyboulo who go up into the muse 's car to give welcome with the

battle whatever it be the kleonymid clan to which melisso belong have lose four man the celebrity of the clan in the game seem to have be eclipse for some time but melisso revive it by a chariot-victory at nemea and this pankration-victory at the isthmus win in spite of he small stature which might have seem to place he at a disadvantage the ode compare he match against he antagonist with that of herakle against the african giant antaio very probably this ode be sing at a night meeting of the clan while the altar of herakle be blaze \* \* \* \* \* if any among man have good fortune and dwelling amid prize of renown or the power of wealth restraineth in he heart beset insolence this man be worthy to have part in he citizen ' good word but from thee o zeus cometh all high

that we sing the valiant and amid he triumphal company exalt he with fair honor of two prize be the lot fall to melisso to turn he heart unto sweet mirth for in the glen of isthmo have he win crown and again in the hollow vale of the deep-chested lion be winner in the chariot-race he make proclamation that he home be thebes thus shameth he not the prowess of he kinsman ye know the ancient fame of kleonymo with the chariot : also on the mother 's side be akin to the labdakidaus he race have be conversant with riches and bestow they on the labor of the four-horse car but time with rolling day bringeth change manifold : only the child of god be free of wound by grace of god i have way countless everywhere open unto I -lrb- 1 -rrb- : for thou hast show forth to I o melisso in the isthmian

drive all man with ever-changing drift these man verily be speak of as have honor at thebe from the beginning for that they cherish the inhabitant round about and have no part in loud insolence if there be bear about by the wind among man aught of witness to the great honor of quick or dead unto such have they attain altogether by the brave deed of they house they have touch the pillar of herakle that be at the end of thing beyond that follow thou no excellence horse-breeder moreover have they be and find favor with mail are but in one day the fierce snow-storm of war have make a happy

of earth who inhabiteth onchesto and the bridge -lrb- 2 -rrb- between sea that lieth before the valley of corinth now giveth to the house this hymn of wonder and leadeth up out of she bed the ancient

some pleasant thing before the people though it follow hard on pain : inasmuch as some god have put away from we the tantalos-stone that hang above we head a curse intolerable to hella but now have the passing of this terror end my sore disquietude and ever it be better to look only on the thing hard by for the guile of time hangeth above the head of man and maketh the way of they life crooked yet if freedom abide with they even such thing may mortal cure but it be meet that a man cherish good hope : and meet also that i whom seven-gated thebe rear proffer chiefly unto aigina the choicest

how it be pre-destine that the sea-goddess should bear a royal offspring mightier than he father whose hand should wield a bolt more terrible than the lightning or the dread trident if she come ever into the bed of zeus or of brethren of zeus ` cease ye herefrom : let she enter a mortal 's couch and see she son fall in war who shall be as are in the might of he hand and as the lightning in the swiftness of he foot my counsel be that ye give she to be the heaven-sent prize of peleus son of aiako whom the speech of man showeth to be they most righteous a offspring of iolko ' plain thus straightway let the message go forth to cheiron 's cave divine neither let the daughter of nereus put a second time into you hand the ballot-leaf of strife so on the evening of the mid-month moon

even the man who keep he back as he ply the work of slaughterous battle on the plain the strength of memnon and high-hearted hektor and other chief of pride unto all these do achille champion of the aiakid race point the way to the house of persephone and thereby do he glorify aigina and the root whence he be spring neither in death be he of song forsake for at he funeral pyre and beside he tomb stand the helikonian maiden-choir and pour thereon a dirge of many melody for so the immortal will to give charge unto the song of goddess over that valorous man even in he death and now also holdeth
