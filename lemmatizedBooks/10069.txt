version into a language as little attend to in this country as it may appear curious to those who take pleasure in philological inquiry i embrace this opportunity to communicate to you and with you approbation to the society all that i have be able to collect concern its history and present state this language be call _ romansh _ and be now speak in the most mountainous part of the country of the grison near the source of the rhine and the inn it consist of two main dialect which though partake both of the above general name differ however so widely as to constitute in a manner two distinct language book be print in both of they and each though it be universally understand in its respective district be yet sub-divide into almost as many secondary dialect as there be village in which it be speak which differ however but little except in the pronunciation one of the main dialect which be speak in the engadine a valley extend from the source of the inn to the frontier of the tyrolese be by the inhabitant call _ ladin _ it admit of some variation even in the book accord as they be print either in the upper or the lower part of this province the abovementioned bible be in the dialect of the lower engadine which however be perfectly understand in the upper part of that province where they use no other version the other dialect which be the language of the gray or upper league be distinguish from the former by the name of _ cialover _ : -lrb- a -rrb- and i must here observe that in the very center and most inaccessible part of this latter district there be some village situate in the narrow valley call rheinwald cepina -lrb- b -rrb- & c in which a third language be speak more similar to the german than to either of the above idiom although they be neither contiguous nor have any great intercourse with the part where the german be use it be impossible to form any idea of the origin and progress of a language without attend to the revolution that may have contribute to its formation and subsequent variation and this be particularly the case in the present instance wherein no series of document be extant to guide we in we research i shall briefly recapitulate the principal event which may have affect the language of the grison as i find they relate by author of approve veracity -lrb- c -rrb- ambigatus the first king of the celtic gaul upon record who -lrb- d -rrb- about 400 -lrb- e -rrb- year before christ govern all the country situate between the alp and the pyrenaean mountain send out two formidable army under the command of one of he nephew one of whom name segovisius force he way into the heart of germany : and the other bellovisius have pass the alp penetrate into italy as far as the settlement of the tuscan which at that time extend over the greatest part of the country now call lombardy these and several other swarm of invader whom the success of the former soon after attract have totally subdue that country build milan verona brescium and several other considerable town and govern with such tyrannic sway especially over the nobility whose riches they covet and seek by every means to extort from they that most of the principal family join under the conduct of rhætus -lrb- f -rrb- one of the most distinguished personage among they retire with the best part of they effect and attendant among the steepest mountain of the alp near the source of the rhine into the district which be now call the gray league the motive of they flight they civil deportment and perhaps more so the wealth they bring with they procure they a favourable reception from the original inhabitant of that inhospitable region who be mention by author -lrb- g -rrb- as be a celtic nation fabulously conjecture from they name -lrb- greek : leipontio -rrb- -lrb- h -rrb- to have be leave there by hercule in he expedition into spain the new adventurer have no sooner climb over the highest precipice but think themselves secure from the pursuit of they rapacious enemy they fix in a valley which from its great fertility in comparison of the country they have just pass they call domestica -lrb- i -rrb- they intermix with the old inhabitant and build some town and many castle whose present name manifestly bespeak they origin -lrb- j -rrb- they soon after spread all over the country which take the name of rhaetium from that of they leader and introduce a form of government similar to they own of which there be evident trace at this day especially in the administration of justice in which a _ laerte _ or president now call landamman or ministral together with twelve _ lucumone _ -lrb- k -rrb- or juror determine all cause both civil and criminal : -lrb- l -rrb- and livy -lrb- m -rrb- although he erroneously pretend that they retain none of they ancient custom yet allow that they continue the use of they language though somewhat adulterated by a mixture with that of the aborigine i must here interrupt the thread of this narration by observe that the only way to account for the present use of a different language in the center and most craggy part of the gray league be by allow that the tuscan who from the delicacy of they constitution and habit be little able and less inclined to encounter the hardship of so severe a climate and so barren a soil never attempt to mix with the original and more sturdy inhabitant of that unfavoured spot but leave they and they language which could only be a celtic idiom in the primitive state in which they find they -lrb- n -rrb- but to proceed -- several roman family dread the fury of the carthaginian under hannibal and perhaps since during the rage of the civil war and the subsequent oppressive reign interior commotion and foreign invasion forsake the latium and campanium and resort for a peaceful enjoyment of they liberty some into the island where venice now stand and many into the mountain of the grison where they chiefly fix they residence in the engadine -lrb- o -rrb- as appear not only from the testimony of author -lrb- p -rrb- but also from the name of several place and family which be evidently of roman derivation -lrb- q -rrb- the inhabitant these emigrant find in that place of refuge could not but be a mixture of the tuscan and original lepontius and the two language which meet upon this occasion must at the very first have have some affinity as the tuscan which derive immediately from the greek be know to have have a great share in the formation of the roman but as it be generally observe that the more polished people introduce they native tongue wherever they go to reside in any considerable number the arrival of these successive colony must gradually have produce a considerable change in the language of the country in which they settle -lrb- r -rrb- and this change give rise to the dialect since call ladin probably from the name of the mother country of its principal author -lrb- s -rrb- although the name of _ romansh _ which the whole language bear seem to be a badge of roman servitude yet the conquest of that nation if ever effect could not have produce a great alteration in a language which must already have be so similar to they own and its general name may as well be attribute to the pacific as to the hostile roman but when we consider that a coalition of the two main dialect which differ so far as not to be reciprocally understand must have be the inevitable consequence of a total reduction and that such a coalition be know never to have take place we may lay the greater stress upon the many passage of ancient author -lrb- t -rrb- in which it be imply that the boast victory of the roman over the rhaetus for which public honor have be decree to l munatus m anthony drusus and augustus amount to no more than frequent repuls of those hardy people into they mountain out of which they want of sufficient room and sustenance -lrb- which in we day drive considerable number into the service of foreign power -rrb- compel they at time to make desperate excursion in quest of necessaries and we may also from these collect authority be induce to give the greater credit to the commentator of lucan -lrb- u -rrb- and to the modern historian -lrb- v -rrb- who positively assert that the people live near the source of the rhine and the inn be never totally subdue by the roman arm but only repel in they attempt to harass they neighbor this whole country however from its central situation could not but be annumerate to one of the province of the empire and accordingly we find that rhaetium itself -lrb- which by the account of ancient geographer -lrb- w -rrb- appear to have extend its limit beyond the lake of constance augsburg and trent towards germany and to como and verona towards italy -rrb- be form into a roman province govern by a pro-consul or procurator who reside at augsburg and that when in the year 119 the emperor adrian divide it into rhaetium _ prima _ and _ secunda _ the governor of the former in which the country i be now speak of must have be comprize take up he residence in two castle situate where coire now stand whilst the other continue he seat at augsburg but notwithstanding these appearance no trace or monument of roman servitude be to be meet with in this district except the ambiguous name of one mountain -lrb- x -rrb- situate on the skirt of these highland and generally think to have be the _ non plus ultra _ of the roman arm on the italian side from the difficulty those persevere veteran experience in keep this stubborn people in awe i mean to infer that such strenuous asserter of they independence whom the flattering pen of ovid and horace represent as formidable even to augustus and prefer death to the loss of they liberty -lrb- y -rrb- favor by the natural strength and indigence of they country be not very likely to be so far subdue by any foreign power inferior to the roman as to suffer any considerable revolution in they custom and language : for as to the irruption of the goth vandal and lombard in the fifth and sixth century besides a profound silence in history concern any successful attempt of those barbarian upon this spot it be scarce credible that any of they should have either wish or endeavor to settle in a country perhaps far less hospitable than that which they have just forsake especially after they have open to themselves a way into the fertile plain of lombardy some stress must be lay upon this inference as the history of what befel this country after the decline of the roman empire be so intimately blended with that of suabium the tyrolese and the lower part of the grison which be know to have fall to the share of the rise power of the frank that nothing positive can be draw from author as to the interior state of this small tract the victory gain in the year 496 near cologn by clovi i king of the frank over the alemannus who have wrest from the roman all the dominion on the northern side of the alp and the defeat of both roman and goth in italy in the year 549 by the treacherous arm of theodebert king of austrasium whose dominion soon after devolve to the crown of france necessarily give the aspiring merovingian race a great ascendency over all the country surround the grison and accordingly we find that this district also be soon after without any military effort consider as part of the dominion of the revive western empire but it do not appear that those monarch ever make any other use of they supremacy in these part than agreeably to the feudal system which they introduce to constitute duke earl president and bailiff over rhaetium to grant out tenure upon the usual feudal term and consequently to levy force in most of they military expedition it must however be observe that these feudal substitute be seldom if ever stranger : those who be upon record to the latter end of the eighth century have all be choose from among the nobility of the country -lrb- z -rrb- and that no foreign garrison be ever maintain for any continuance of time in these part appear from a circumstance relate by they annalist -lrb- aa -rrb- who say that a inroad of the hun in 670 when external force would probably have be very acceptable to the native be repulse merely by a concourse of the inhabitant history continue to furnish we with proof of the little connexion this people have with other nation in they domestic affair notwithstanding they dependance upon a foreign power in the year 780 the bishop of coire who by the constitution of that see can only be a native -lrb- ab -rrb- obtain from charlemain besides many considerable honor and privilege in the empire a grant of the supreme authority in this country by the investiture of the office of hereditary president or bailiff over all rhaetia he successor not only enjoy this prerogative to the extinction of the carlovingian race of emperor in 911 but receive accumulate favor from other succeed monarch as the bigoted devotion of those time or motive of interest prompt they and so far do they munificence gradually extend that the sole property of one of the three league -lrb- ac -rrb- be at one time vest in the hand of the bishop this prelate and the noble the greatest part of whom become he retainer avail themselves like all the german prince of the confusion division and interreign which frequently distract the empire in the succeed century in order to establish a firm and unlimited authority of they own henceforth the annals of this country furnish we with little more than catalogue of the bishop and duke who be still at time nominate by the emperor and of the domain grant out by they to different indigenate family with account of the atrocious cruelty exercise by these lord over they vassal and with anecdote of the prowess of the native in several expedition into italy and palestine in which they still voluntarily accompany the emperor the repeat act of tyranny exercise by those arbitrary despot who have now shake off all manner of restraint at length exasperate the people into a general revolt and bring on the confederacy in which the bishop and most of the noble be glad to join in order to screen themselves from the fury of the insurgent the first step towards this happy revolution be make by some _ venerable old man dress in the coarse gray cloth _ of the country who in the year 1424 meet privately in a wood near a place call trun in the upper league where _ impressed with a sense of they former liberty _ -lrb- ad -rrb- they determine to remonstrate against and oppose the violent proceedings of they oppressor the abbot dissenti be the first who countenance they measure they joint influence gradually prevail over several of the most moderate among the noble and hence arise the league which from the color of its first promoter be ever call the gray league which from its be the first in the bold attempt to shake off the yoke of wanton tyranny have ever since retain the pre-eminence in rank before the two other league and which have even give its name to the whole country whose inhabitant from the circumstance of they deliverance pride themselves in the appellation of _ grisone _ or the _ grey-one _ -lrb- ae -rrb- from this period nothing have ever affect they freedom and absolute independence which they now enjoy in the most unlimited sense in spite of the repeat effort of the house of austrium to recover some degree of ascendency over they from this concise view of the history of the grison in which i have carefully guard against favor any particular hypothesis it appear that as no foreign nation ever gain any permanent footing in the most mountainous part of this country since the establishment of the tuscan and roman the language now speak could never have suffer any considerable alteration from extraneous mixture of modern language and to those who may object that language like all other human institution will though left to themselves be inevitably affect by the common revolution of time i shall observe that a language in which no book be write but which be only speak by a people chiefly devote to arm and agriculture and consequently not cultivate by the criticism of man of taste and learning be by no means expose to the vicissitude of those that be polish by refine nation -lrb- af -rrb- and that however paradoxical it may appear it be nevertheless true that the degeneracy of a language be more frequently to be attribute to a extravagant refinement than to the neglect of a illiterate people unless indeed external cause interfere may we not hence conclude that as the romansh have never be use in any regular composition in write till the sixteenth century nor affect by any foreign invasion or intimate connexion it be not likely to have receive any material change before the period of its be write and we have the authority of the book since print to prove that it be at present the identical language that be speak two hundred year ago these argument will receive additional weight from the proof i shall hereafter give of the great affinity there be between the language as it be now speak and the romance that be use in france nine century ago when we further consider the fact i have above briefly related the wonder will cease that in a cluster of mountain situate in the center of europe a distinct language -lrb- not a dialect or jargon of those speak by the contiguous nation as have be generally imagine -rrb- should have maintain itself through a series of age in spite of the many revolution which frequently change the whole face of the adjacent country and indeed so obstinately tenacious be these people of they independency law custom and consequently of they very language that as have be already observe they form of government especially in judicial matter still bear evident mark of the ancient tuscan constitution and that although they be frequently expose to inconvenience from they stubbornness in this respect they have not yet be prevail upon to adopt the gregorian reformation of the calendar as to the nature of this language it may now be advance with some degree of confidence that the _ cialover _ owe it origin to a mixture of the tuscan and of the dialect of the celtic speak by the lepontius and that the introduction of the vulgar roman affect it in some degree but particularly give rise to the _ ladin _ the vocabulary of which as any one may be convince by inspect a few line of the bible have a great affinity with that of the latin tongue but these assertion rest merely upon historical evidence for as to the _ cialover _ all that it may have retain of the tuscan or roman be so much disfigure by a uncouth pronunciation and a vague orthography that all etymological inquiry be thereby render intricate and unsatisfactory and as to the _ ladin _ although its derivation be more manifest yet we be equally at a loss from what period or branch of the latin tongue to trace its real origin for i have find after many tedious experiment that even the vocabulary in which the resemblance be most evident differ equally from the classical purity of tully caesar and sallust as it do from the primitive latin of the twelve table of ennius and the _ columna rostrali _ of duillius which have generally be think the parent of the gallic romance as also from the trivial language of varro vegetius and columellum may we not from this circumstance infer that as be the case in all vernacular tongue the vulgar dialect of the roman the _ sermo usuali rusticus pedestri _ -lrb- ag -rrb- of which there be no monument extant differ very widely both in pronunciation and construction from that which have at any time be use either in write or in the senate the grammatical variation the syntax and the genius of the language must in this as well as in several other modern european tongue have be derive from the celtic it be well know that the frequent use of article the distinction of case by preposition the application of two auxiliary in the conjugation do by no means agree with the latin turn of expression although a late french academician -lrb- ah -rrb- who have take great pain to prove that the gallic romance be solely derive from the roman quote several instance in which even the most classical writer have in this respect offend the purity of that refined language it can not here be deny that as new idea always require new sign to express they some foreign word and perhaps phrase must necessarily from time to time have insinuate themselves into the romansh by the military and some commercial intercourse of the grison with other nation and this account for several modern german word which be now incorporate into the language of the engadine -lrb- be -rrb- the little connexion there be in mountainous country between the inhabitant of the different valley and the absolute independence of each jurisdiction in this district which still lessen the frequency of they intercourse also account in a great measure for the variety of secondary dialect subsist in almost every different community or even village the oldest specimen of write in this language be some dramatical performance in verse upon scriptural subject which be extant only in manuscript the history of susanna of the prodigal son of judith and holoferne and of esther be among the first and be say to have be compose about the year 1560 the book that have since be print be chiefly upon religious subject and among those that be not so the only i have ever hear of be a small code of the law of the country in the cialover dialect and a epitome of sprecher 's chronicle by da porta in the ladin \* \* \* \* \* the language speak in gaul from the fifth to the twelfth century be evidently a mixture of the same roman and celtic ingredient and partaking of the same name with those of the grison it will i hope not be think foreign to the subject of this letter if i enter into a few particulars concern it as it seem to have be a essential part or rather the trunk of the language the history of which i be endeavor to elucidate one of the many instance how little the labor research of philologist into the origin of language be to be depend upon be the variety of opinion entertain by french author concern the formation of the gallic romance a learn benedictine -lrb- aj -rrb- first start the conjecture and then maintain it against the attack of a anonymous writer that the vulgar latin become the universal language of gaul immediately after caesar 's conquest and that its corruption with very little mixture of the original language of the country gradually produce the romance towards the eighth century bonamy -lrb- ak -rrb- on the other hand be of opinion that soon after that conquest a corruption of vulgar latin by the celtic form the romance which he take to be the language always mean by author when they speak of the _ lingua romana _ use in gaul the author of the celtic dictionary -lrb- al -rrb- tell we that the romance be derive from the _ latin _ the _ celtic _ which he more frequently call gallic and the _ teutonic _ in admit of which latter he deviate from most other author -lrb- be -rrb- who deny that the teutonic have any share in the composition of the romance since the frank find it already establish when they enter gaul and be long before they could prevail upon they new subject to adopt any part of they own mother tongue which however appear to have be afterwards instrumental in the formation of the modern french duclo -lrb- a -rrb- guide i imagine by du cange -lrb- ao -rrb- whose opinion appear to be the most sober and best authenticate maintain that the vulgar latin be undoubtedly the foundation of the romance but that much of the celtic gradually insinuate itself in spite of the policy of the roman who never fail to use all they endeavor in order to establish they language wherever they spread they arm among this variety of conjecture and acute controversy i find it however agree on all hand that the vocabulary of the roman and the idiom of the celtic have chiefly contribute to the formation of the gallic romance which be sufficient to prove that it partake of a common origin with that of the grison there be incontestable proof that this language be once universal all over france and that this and not immediately the latin have be the parent of the provençal and afterwards of the modern french the italian and the spanish the oath take by lewi the germanic in the year 842 in confirmation of a alliance between he and charle the bald he brother be a decisive proof of the general use of the romance by the whole french nation at that time and of they little knowledge of the teutonic which be the native tongue of lewi would certainly have be use by he in this oath have it be understand by the french to whom he address himself but nithardus -lrb- ap -rrb- a contemporary writer and near relation to the contracting party inform we that lewi take the oath in the romance language in order that it might be understand by the french nobility who be the subject of charle and that they in they turn enter into reciprocal engagement in _ they own language _ which the same author again declare to have be the romance and not the teutonic although one would imagine that have they at all understand this latter tongue they could not but have use it upon this occasion in return for the condescension of lewi as a comparison between this language and the romansh of the grison can not be consider as a mere object of curiosity but may also serve to corroborate the proof i have above allege of the antiquity of the latter i have annex in the appendix -lrb- aq -rrb- a translation of this oath into the language of engadine which approach nearest to it although i must observe that there be in the other dialect some word which have a still greater affinity with the language of the oath as appear by another translation i have procure in which both dialect be indifferently use to prevent any doubt concern the veracity of these translation i must here declare that i be indebted for they and for several anecdote concern that language to a man of letter who be a native and have long be a inhabitant of the grison and be lately come to reside in london i have add to this comparative view of those two language the latin word from which both seem to have be derive and as a proof of the existence of the gallic romance in france down to the twelfth century i have also subjoin the word use in that kingdom at that period as they be give we by the author of the article _ -lrb- langue -rrb- romane _ in the french encyclopedie to the comparison of the two romance and the similarity of they origin i may now with confidence add the authority of fontaninus -lrb- ar -rrb- to prove that they be one and the same language this author speaking of the ancient gallic romance assert that it be now speak in the country of the grison though not attend to the variety of dialect some of which have certainly nothing of the italian he suppose it to have be altogether adulterate by a mixture of that modern tongue whilst the grison neglect to improve they language and reject or indeed be out of the reach of every refinement it might have derive from polished stranger the taste and fertile genius of the troubadour foster by the countenance and elegance of the brilliant court and splendid nobility of provence do not long leave theirs in the rough state in which we find it in the ninth century but the change have be gradual and almost imperceptible the french historian have fix no epocha for the transition of the romance into the provençal that the former language have not receive any considerable alteration in the twelfth century may be gather from the comparison in the appendix : and that it still bear the same name appear from the title of several book which be say to have be write in or translate into the romance but though mention be make of that name even after this aera yet upon examine impartially what be give we for that language in this period it will be find so different from the romance of the ninth century that to trace it any further would be both a vain and a extravagant pursuit admit however the universal use of the romance all over france down to the twelfth century which no french author have yet doubt or deny and allow that what the writer of those time say of the gallic be to be understand of the romance as appear from chronological proof and the expression of several author prior to the fifth century -lrb- as -rrb- who by distinguish the _ gallic _ both from the _ latin _ and the _ celtic _ plainly indicate that they thereby mean the romance those be the only three language which before the invasion of the frank could possibly have be speak or even understand in gaul : admit these premise i say it necessarily follow that the language introduce into england under alfred and afterwards more universally establish by edward the confessor and william the conqueror must have be a emanation of the romance very near akin to that of the abovementioned oath and consequently to that which be now speak in the alp the intercourse between britain and gaul be know to have be of a very early date for even in the first century we find that the british lawyer derive the greatest part of they knowledge from those of the continent -lrb- at -rrb- while on the other hand the gallic druid be know to have resort to britain for instruction in they mysterious rite the briton therefore could not be totally ignorant of the gallic language and hence it will appear that grimbald john and the other doctor introduce by alfr -lrb- au -rrb- could find no great difficulty in propagate they native tongue in this island which tongue at that interval of time could only be the true romance since they be contemporary with lewi the germanic that the romance be almost universally understand in this kingdom under edward the confessor it be not only use at court but frequently at the bar and even sometimes in the pulpit be a fact too well know and attest -lrb- av -rrb- to need my further authenticate it with superfluous argument and testimony duclo in he history of the gallic ' romance -lrb- aw -rrb- give the abovementioned oath of lewi as the first monument of that language the second he mention be the code of law of william the conqueror -lrb- ax -rrb- whom the least proficient in the english history know to have render he language almost universal in this kingdom how little progress it have yet make towards the modern french and how great a affinity it still bear with the present romansh of the grison will appear from the annexed translation of the first paragraph of these law into the latter tongue -lrb- ay -rrb- if we may credit du cange -lrb- az -rrb- who grounds he assertion upon various instrument of the king of scotland during the twelfth century the romance have also penetrate into that kingdom before that period the same corruption or coalescence which give rise to the gallic romance and to that of the grison must also have produce in italy a language if not perfectly similar at least greatly approach to those two idiom nor do it want its northern nation to contribute what the two other branch derive from that source -lrb- ba -rrb- but be the origin what it will certain it be that a jargon very different from either the latin or the italian be speak in italy from the time of the irruption of the barbarian to the successful labor of dante and petrarca that this jargon be usually call the _ vulgar idiom _ but that speronus -lrb- bb -rrb- the father of a italian literature and other frequently call it the _ common italian romance _ and if fontaninus 's -lrb- bc -rrb- authority be sufficient it appear that even the gallic romance by the residence of the papal court at avignon and from other cause make its way into italy before it be polish into the provençal as to naple and sicily the expulsion of the saracen by the norman under robert guiscard in 1059 must have produce in that country nearly the same effect a similar event soon after bring about in england and in fact we have the authority of william of apulium -lrb- bd -rrb- to prove that the conqueror use all they effort to propagate they language and manners among the native that they might ever after be consider only as one people and hugo falcland -lrb- be -rrb- relate that in the year 1150 count henry refuse to take upon he the management of public affair under pretence of not know the language of the french which he add be absolutely necessary at court that the language of the roman penetrate very early into spain appear most evidently from a passage in strabo -lrb- bf -rrb- who assert that the turditani inhabit the bank of the boeti now the guadalquivir forget they original tongue and adopt that of the conqueror that the romance be use there in the fourteenth century appear from a correspondence between st vincent of ferriere and don martin son of peter the ivth of arragon -lrb- bg -rrb- and that this language must once have be common in that kingdom appear manifestly from the present name of the spanish which be still usually call romance -lrb- bh -rrb- these circumstance consider i be not so much inclined to discredit a fact relate by mabillon -lrb- bus -rrb- who say that in the eighth century a paralytic spaniard on pay he devotions at the tomb of a saint in the church of fulda converse with a monk of that abbey who _ because he be a italian _ understand the language of the spaniard neither do a oral tradition i hear some time ago appear so absurd to I as it do when it be first relate to I which say that two catalonian travel over the alp be not a little surprized when they come into the grison country to find that they native tongue be understand by the inhabitant and that they could comprehend most of the language of that district this universality of the romance in the french dominion during the eleventh century also account for its introduction in palestine and many other part of the levant by godfrey de bouillon and the multitude of adventurer who engage under he in the crusade the assizes of jerusalem and those of cyprus be stand monument of the footing that language have obtain in those part and if we may trust a spanish historian of some reputation -lrb- bj -rrb- who reside in greece in the thirteenth century the athenian and the inhabitant of morea speak at that time the same language that be use in france and there be great reason to imagine that the affinity the _ lingua franca _ bear to the french and italian be intirely to be derive from the romance which be once commonly use in the port of the levant the heroic atchievement and gallantry of the knight of the cross also give rise to the swarm of fabulous narrative which though not a invention of those day be yet from the name of the language in which they be write ever after distinguish by the appellation of _ romance _ -lrb- bk -rrb- i shall now conclude this letter by observe that far from presume that the romance have be preserve so near its primitive state only in the country of the grison there be great reason to suppose that it still exist in several other remote and unfrequented part when fontaninus inform we -lrb- bl -rrb- that the ancient romance be now speak in the country of the grison he add that it be also the common dialect of the friulese and of some district in savoy border upon dauphiné and rivet -lrb- bm -rrb- seriously undertake to prove that the patois of several part of the limousin quercy and auvergne -lrb- which in fact agree singularly with the _ romansh _ of the grison -rrb- be the very romance of eight century ago neither do i doubt but what some inquisitive traveller might still meet with manifest trace of it in many part of the pyrenaean and other mountainous region of spain where the moor and other invader have never
