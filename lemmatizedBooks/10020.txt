obtain the body must give way under the strain you see that i be very young dr halifax perhaps i look younger than i be -- my age be twenty-two my husband be twenty year my senior he would however be consider by most people still a young man he be a great scholar and have always have more or less the habit of a recluse he be fond of live in he library and like nothing better than to be surround by book of all sort every modern book worth reading be forward to he by its publisher he be a very interesting man and a brilliant conversationalist perhaps i ought to put all this in the past tense for now he scarcely ever speak -- he read next to nothing -- it be difficult to persuade he to eat -- he will not leave the house -- he use to have a rather ruddy complexion -- he be now deadly pale and terribly emaciate he sigh in the most heartrending manner and seem to be in a state of extreme nervous tension in short he be very ill and yet he seem to have no bodily disease he eye have a terribly startled expression in they -- he hand tremble so that he can scarcely raise a cup of tea to he lip in short he look like a man who have see a ghost when do these symptom begin to appear i ask it be

short hysterical sob i feel i must come to someone -- i have hear of you do do come and save we do come and find out what be the matter with my wretched husband i will write to you to-night i say in as kind a voice as i could muster for the pretty anxious wife interested I already it may not be possible for I to stay at studley grange for a week but in any case i can promise to come and see the patient one visit will probably be sufficient -- what you husband want be no doubt complete change oh yes yes she reply stand up now i have say so score of time but sir henry will not stir from studley -- nothing will induce he to go away he will not even leave he own special bedroom although i expect he have dreadful night two hectic spot burnt in she cheek as she speak i look at she attentively you will forgive I for speak i say but you do not look at all well yourself i should like to prescribe for you as well as you husband thank you she answer i be not very strong i never have be but that be nothing -- i mean that my health be not a thing of consequence at present well i must not take up any more of you time i shall expect to get a letter from you to-morrow morning please address it to lady studley grosvenor hotel victorium she touch my hand with finger that burn like a living coal and leave the room i think she very ill and be sure that if i could see my way to spend a week at studley grange i should have two patient instead of one it be always difficult for a busy doctor to leave home but after carefully think matter over i resolve to comply with lady studley 's request -lrb- illustration : lady studley have come herself to fetch I -rrb- accordingly two day later see I on my way to wiltshire and to studley grange a brougham with two smart horse be wait at the station to my surprise i see that lady studley have come herself to fetch I i do not know how to thank you she say give I a feverish clasp of she hand you visit fill I with hope -- i believe that you will discover what be really wrong home she say give a quick imperious direction to the footman who appear at the window of the carriage we bowl forward at a rapid pace and she continue : -- i come to meet you to-day to tell you that i have use a little guile with regard to you visit i have not tell sir henry that you be come here in the capacity of a doctor here she pause and give I one of she restless glance do you mind she ask what have you say about I to sir henry i inquire that you be a great friend of the onslow and that i have ask you here for a week 's change she answer immediately as a guest my husband will be polite and delightful to you -- as a doctor he would treat you with scant civility and would probably give you little or none of he confidence i be quite silent for a moment after lady studley have tell I this then i say : -- have i know that i be not to come to you house in the capacity of a medical man i might have re-considered my earnest desire to help you she turn very pale when i say this and tear fill she eye never mind i say now for i could not but be touch by she extremely pathetic and suffer face by the look of great illness which be manifest in every glance never mind now i be glad you have tell I exactly the term on which you wish I to approach you husband but i think that i can so put matter to sir henry that he will be glad to consult I in my medical capacity oh but he do not even know that i suspect he illness it would never do for he to know i suspect i see i fear but i say nothing sir henry would be much more miserable than he be now if he think that i guess that there be anything wrong with he it be impossible for I to come to the grange except as a medical man i answer firmly i will tell sir henry that you have see some change in he and have ask I to visit he as a doctor please trust I nothing will be say to you husband that can make matter at all uncomfortable for you lady studley do not venture any further remonstrance and we now approach the old grange it be a irregular pile build evidently accord to the want of the different family who have live in it the building be long and ramble with row of window fill up with pane of latticed glass in front of the house be a sweeping lawn which even at this time of the year present a velvety and well-kept appearance we drive rapidly round to the entrance door and a moment later i find myself in the presence of my host and patient sir henry studley be a tall man with a very slight stoop and a aquiline and rather noble face he eye be dark and he forehead incline to be bald there be a courtly old-world sort of look about he he greet I with extreme friendliness and we go into the hall a very large and lofty apartment to tea lady studley be vivacious and lively in the extreme while she talk the hectic spot come out again on she cheek my uneasiness about she increase as i notice these symptom i feel certain that she be not only consumptive but in all probability she be even now the victim of a advanced stage of phthisis i feel far more anxious about she than about she husband who appear to I at that moment to be nothing more than a somewhat nervous and hypochondriacal person this state of thing seem easy to account for in a scholar and a man of sedentary habit i remark about the age of the house and my host become interested and tell I one or two story of the old inhabitant of the grange he say that to-morrow he would have much pleasure in take I over the building -lrb- illustration : ` have you a ghost here ' i ask with a laugh -rrb- have you a ghost here i ask with a laugh i do not know what prompt I to ask the question the moment i do so sir henry turn white to he lip and lady studley hold up a warning finger to I to intimate that i be on dangerous ground i feel that i be and hasten to divert the conversation into safer channel inadvertently i have touch on a sore spot i scarcely regret have do so as the flash in the baronet 's troubled eye and the extreme agitation of he face show I plainly that lady studley be right when she speak of he nerve be in a very irritable condition of course i do not believe in ghost and wonder that a man of sir henry 's calibre could be at all under the influence of this old-world fear i be sorry that we have no one to meet you he say after a few remark of a commonplace character have divide we from the ghost question but to-morrow several friend be come and we hope you will have a pleasant time be you fond of hunting i answer that i use to be in the old day before medicine and patient occupy all my thought if this open weather continue i can probably give you some of you favorite pastime rejoin sir henry and now perhaps you would like to be show to you room my bedroom be in a modern wing of the house and look as cheerful and as unghostlike as it be possible for a room to be i do not rejoin my host and hostess until dinner-time we have a sociable little meal at which nothing of any importance occur and shortly after the servant withdraw lady studley leave sir henry and I to ourselves she give I another warn glance as she leave the room i have already quite make up my mind however to tell sir henry the motive of my visit the moment the door close behind he wife he start up and ask I if i would mind come with he into he library the fact be he say i be particularly glad you have come down i want to have a talk with you about my wife she be extremely unwell i signify my willingness to listen to anything sir henry might say and in a few minute we find ourselves comfortably establish in a splendid old room completely clothe with book from ceiling to floor these be my treasure say the baronet wave he hand in the direction of a old bookcase which contain i see at a glance some very rare and precious first edition these be my friend the companion of my hour of solitude now sit down dr halifax make yourself at home you have come here as a guest but i have hear of you before and be incline to confide in you i must frankly say that i hate you profession as a rule i do not believe in the omniscience of medical man but moment come in the life of all man when it be necessary to unburden the mind to another may i give you my confidence one moment first i say i can not deceive you sir henry i have come here not in the capacity of a guest but as you wife 's medical man she have be anxious about you and she beg of I to come and stay here for a few day in order to render you any medical assistance within my power i only know on my way here to-day that she have not acquaint you with the nature of my visit while i be speak sir henry 's face become extremely watchful eager and tense this be remarkable he say so lucillum be anxious about I i be not aware that i ever give she the least clue to the fact that i be not -- in perfect health this be very strange -- it trouble I he look agitate he place one long thin hand on the little table which stand near and pour out a glass of wine drink it off i notice as he do so the nervous tremble of he hand i glance at he face and see that it be thin to emaciation well he say i be oblige to you for be perfectly frank with I my wife scarcely do well to conceal the object of you visit but now that you have come i shall make use of you both for myself and for she then you be not well i ask well he answer with almost a shout good god no i think that i be go mad i know -- i know that unless relief soon come i shall die or become a rave maniac no nothing of the kind i answer soothingly you probably want change this be a fine old house but dull no doubt in winter why do not you go away -- to the riviera or some other place where there be plenty of sunshine why do you stay here the air of this place be too damp to be good for either you or you wife sir henry sit silent for a moment then he say in a terse voice : -- perhaps you will advise I what to do after you know the nature of the malady which afflict I first of all however i wish to speak of my wife i be ready to listen i reply you see he continue that she be very delicate yes i reply to be frank with you i should say that lady studley be consumptive he start when i say this and press he lip firmly together after a moment he speak you be right he reply i have she examine by a medical man -- sir joseph dunbar -- when i be last in london he say she lung be considerably affect and that in short she be far from well do he not order you to winter abroad he do but lady studley oppose the idea so strenuously that i be oblige to yield to she entreaty consumption do not seem to take quite the ordinary form with she she be restless she long for cool air she go out on quite cold day in a closed carriage it be true still except at night she do not regard herself in any sense as a invalid she have immense spirit -- i think she will keep up until she die you speak of she be a invalid at night i reply what be she symptom sir henry shudder quite visibly oh those awful night he answer how happy would many poor mortal be but for the terrible time of darkness lady studley have have dreadful night for some time : perspiration cough restlessness bad dream and all the rest of it but i must hasten to tell you my story quite briefly in the beginning of October we see sir joseph dunbar i should then by he advice have take lady studley to the riviera but she oppose the idea with such passion and distress that i abandon it sir henry pause here and i look at he attentively i remember at that moment what lady studley have say about she husband refuse to leave the grange under any circumstance what a strange game of cross-purposes these two be play how be it possible for I to get at the truth at my wife 's earnest request continue sir henry we return to the grange she declare she firm intention of remain here until she die soon after we return she suggest that we should occupy separate room at night remind I when she make the request of the infectious nature of consumption i comply with she wish on condition that i sleep in the room next hers and that on the smallest emergency i should be summon to she aid this arrangement be make and she room open into mine i have sometimes hear she move about at night -- i have often hear she cough and i have often hear she sigh but she have never once send for I or give I to understand that she require my aid she do not think herself very ill and nothing worry she more than to have she malady speak about that be the part of the story which relate to my wife she be very ill i say but i will speak of that presently now will you favor I with a account of you own symptom sir henry -lrb- illustration : he lock the door and put the key in he pocket -rrb- he start again when i say this and go across the room lock the door and put the key in he pocket perhaps you will laugh at I he say but it be no laughing matter i assure you the most terrible the most awful affliction have come to I in short i be visit nightly by a appalling apparition you do not believe in ghost i judge that by you face few scientific man do frankly i do not i reply so-called ghost can generally be account for at the most they be only the figment of a over-excited or diseased brain be that as it may say sir henry the diseased brain can give such torture to its victim that death be preferable all my life i have be what i consider a healthy mind man i have plenty of money and have never be trouble with the care which torture man of commerce or of small means when i marry three year ago i consider myself the most lucky and the happiest of mortal forgive a personal question i interrupted have you marriage disappointed you no no far from it he reply with fervor i love my dear wife better and more deeply even than the day when i take she as a bride to my arm it be true that i be weigh down with sorrow about she but that be entirely owe to the state of she health it be strange i say that she should be weigh down with sorrow about you for the same cause have you tell she of the thing which terrify you never never i have never speak of it to mortal it be remarkable that my wife should have tell you that i look like a man who have see a ghost alas alas but let I tell you the cause of my shattered nerve my agony and fail health pray do i shall listen attentively i reply oh doctor that i could make you feel the horror of it say sir henry bend forward and look into my eye three month ago i no more believe in visitation in apparition in so-called ghost than you do be you try as i be you scepticism would receive a severe shock now let I tell you what occur night after night lady studley and i retire to rest at the same hour we say good-night and lay we head on we separate pillow the door of communication between we be shut she have a night-light in she room -- i prefer darkness i close my eye and prepare for slumber as a rule i fall asleep my sleep be of short duration i awake with bead of perspiration standing on my forehead with my heart thump heavily and with every nerve wide awake and wait for the horror which will come sometimes i wait half a hour -- sometimes longer then i know by a faint tick sound in the darkness that the thing for i can clothe it with no name be about to visit I in a certain spot of the room always in the same spot a bright light suddenly flash out of its midst there gleam a preternaturally large eye which look fixedly at I with a diabolical expression as time go it do not remain long but as agony count it seem to take year of my life away with it it fade as suddenly into gray mist and nothingness as it come and wet with perspiration and struggle to keep back scream of mad terror i bury my head in the bed-clothes but have you never try to investigate this thing i say i do at first the first night i see it i rush out of bed and make for the spot it disappear at once i strike a light -- there be nothing whatever in the room why do you sleep in that room i must not go away from lady studley my terror be that she should know anything of this -- my greater terror be that the apparition fail I may visit she i daresay you think i be a fool halifax but the fact be this thing be kill I brave man as i consider myself do you see it every night i ask -lrb- illustration : it be the most ghastly the most horrible form of torture -rrb- not quite every night but sometimes on the same night it come twice sometimes it will not come at all for two night or even three it be the most ghastly the most horrible form of torture that could hurry a sane man into he grave or into a madhouse i have not the least shadow of doubt i say after a pause that the thing can be account for sir henry shake he head no no he reply it be either as you suggest a figment of my own diseased brain and therefore just as horrible as a real apparition or it be a supernatural visitation whether it exist or not it be reality to I and in no way a dream the full horror of it be present with I in my wake moment do you think anyone be play a awful practical joke i suggest certainly not what object can anyone have in scare I to death besides there be no one in the room that i can swear my outer door be lock lady studley 's outer door be lock it be impossible that there can be any trickery in the matter i say nothing for a moment i no more believe in ghost than i ever do but i feel certain that there be grave mischief at work sir henry must be the victim of a hallucination this might only be cause by functional disturbance of the brain but it be quite serious enough to call for immediate attention the first thing to do be to find out whether the apparition could be account for in any material way or if it be due to the state of sir henry 's nerve i begin to ask he certain question go fully into the case in all its bearing i then examine he eye with the ophthalmoscope the result of all this be to assure I beyond doubt that sir henry studley be in a highly nervous condition although i could detect no trace of brain disease do you mind take I to you room i say not to-night he answer it be late and lady studley might express surprise the object of my life be to conceal this horror from she when she be out to-morrow you shall come to the room and judge for yourself well i say i shall have a interview with you wife to-morrow and urge she most strongly to consent to leave the grange and go away with you shortly afterwards we retire to rest or what go by the name of rest in that sad house with its troubled inmate i must confess that comfortable as my room be i sleep very little sir henry 's story stay with I all through the hour of darkness i be neither nervous nor imaginative but i could not help see that terrible eye even in my dream i meet my host and hostess at a early breakfast sir henry propose that as the day be warm and fine i should ride to a neighbouring meet i be not in the humor for this however and say frankly that i should prefer remain at the grange one glance into the face of my host and hostess tell I only too plainly that i have two very serious patient on my hand lady studley look terribly weak and excited -- the hectic spot on she cheek the gleaming glitter of she eye the parched lip the long white emaciated hand all show only too plainly the stride the malady under which she be suffer be make after all i can not urge that poor girl to go abroad i say to myself she be hasten rapidly to she grave and no power on earth can save she she look as if there be extensive disease of the lung how restless she eye be too i would much rather testify to sir henry 's sanity than to hers sir henry studley also bear trace of a sleepless night -- he face be bloodless he avert he eye from mine he eat next to nothing immediately after breakfast i follow lady studley into she morning-room i have already make up my mind how to act she husband should have my full confidence -- she only my partial view of the situation well i say i have see you husband and talk to he i hope he will soon be better i do not think you need be seriously alarmed about he now for yourself lady studley i be anxious to examine you lung will you allow I to do so i suppose henry have tell you i be consumptive he say you be not well i answer i do not need he word to assure I of that fact -- i can see it with my own eye please let I examine you chest with my stethoscope she hesitate for a moment look something like a wild creature bring to bay then she sink into a chair and with tremble finger unfasten she dress poor soul she be almost a walk skeleton -- she beautiful face be all that be beautiful about she a brief examination tell I that she be in the last stage of phthisis -- in short that she day be number what do you think of I she ask when the brief examination be over you be ill i reply how soon shall i die god only know that my dear lady i answer oh you need not hide you thought she say i know that my day be very few oh if only if only my husband could come with I i be so afraid to go alone and i be fond of he very fond of he i soothe she as well as i could you ought to have someone to sleep in you room at night i say you ought not to be leave by yourself henry be near I -- in the next room she reply i would not have a nurse for the world -- i hate and detest nurse soon afterwards she leave I she be very erratic and before she leave the room she have quite get over she depression the sun shine out and with the gleam of brightness she volatile spirit rise i be go for a drive she say will you come with I not this morning i reply if you ask I to-morrow i shall be please to accompany you well go to henry she answer talk to he -- find out what ail he order tonic for he cheer he in every way in you power you say he be not ill -- not seriously ill -- i know better my impression be that if my day be number so be he she go away and i seek she husband as soon as the wheel of she brougham be hear bowl away over the gravel sweep we go up together to he room that eye come twice last night he say in a awestruck whisper to I i be a doomed man -- a doomed man i can not bear this any longer we be stand in the room as he say the word even in broad daylight i could see that he glance round he with apprehension he be shake quite visibly the room be decidedly old-fashioned but the greater part of the furniture be modern the bed be a albert one with a spring mattress and light cheerful dimity hanging the window be french -- they be wide open and let in the soft pleasant air for the day be truly a spring one in winter the paper on the wall be light this be a quaint old wardrobe i say it look out of place with the rest of the furniture why do not you have it remove -lrb- illustration : do not go near it -- i dread it -rrb- hush he say with a gasp do not go near it -- i dread it i have lock it it be always in that direction that the apparition appear the apparition seem to grow out of the glass of the wardrobe it always appear in that one spot i see i answer the wardrobe be build into the wall that be the reason it can not be remove have you get the key about you he fumble in he pocket and presently produce a bunch of key i wish you would not open the wardrobe he say i frankly admit that i dislike have it touch all right i reply i will not examine it while you be in the room you will perhaps allow I to keep the key certainly you can take it from the bunch if you wish this be it i shall be only too glad to have it well out of my own keep we will go downstairs i say we return to sir henry 's library it be my turn now to lock the door why do you do that he ask because i wish to be quite certain that no one overhear we conversation what have you get to say i have a plan to propose to you what be it i want you to change bedroom with I to-night what can you mean -- what will lady studley say lady studley must know nothing whatever about the arrangement i think it very likely that the apparition which trouble you will be discover to have a material foundation in short i be determine to get to the bottom of this horror you have see it often and you nerve be much shattered i have never see it and my nerve be i think in tolerable order if i sleep in you room to-night -- it may not visit you it may not but on the other hand it may i have a curiosity to lie on that bed and to face that wardrobe in the wall you must yield to my wish sir henry but how can the knowledge of this arrangement be keep from my wife easily enough you will both go to you room as usual you will bid she good-night as usual and after the door of communication be close i will enter the room and you will go to mine or to any other that you like to occupy you say you wife never come into you room during the hour of the night she have never yet do so she will not to-night should she by any chance call for assistance i will immediately summon you it be very evident that sir henry do not like this arrangement he yield however to my very strong persuasion which almost take the form of command for i see that i could do nothing unless i get complete mastery over the man lady studley return from she drive just as we arrangement be fully make i have not a moment during all the day to examine the interior of the wardrobe the sick woman 's restlessness grow greater as the hour advance she do not care to leave she husband 's side she sit with he as he examine he book she follow he from room to room in the afternoon to the relief of everyone some fresh guest arrive in consequence we have a cheerful evening lady studley come down to dinner in white from top to toe she dress be ethereal in texture and largely compose of lace i can not describe woman 's dress but with she shadowy figure and worn but still lovely face she look spiritual the gleam in she large blue eye be pathetic she love for she husband be touch to behold how soon how very soon they must part from each other only i as a doctor know how impossible it be to keep the lamp of life much longer burn in the poor girl 's frame we retire as usual to rest sir henry bid I a cheerful good-night lady studley nod to I as she leave the room -lrb- illustration : ` sleep well ' she say in a gay voice -rrb- sleep well she say in a gay voice it be late the next morning when we all meet round the breakfast table sir henry look better but lady studley many degree worse than the night before i wonder at she courage in retain she post at the head of she table the visitor who come in at interval and take they seat at the table look at she with wonder and compassion surely my hostess be very ill say a guest who sit next my side yes but take no notice of it i answer soon after breakfast i seek sir henry well -- well he say as he grasp my hand halifax you have see it i know you have by the expression of you face yes i reply i have how quietly you speak have not the horror of the thing seize you no i say with a brief laugh i tell you yesterday that my nerve be in tolerable order i think my surmise be correct and that the apparition have tangible form and can be trace to its foundation a unbelieving look sweep over sir henry 's face ah he say doctor be very hard to convince everything must be bring down to a cold material level to satisfy they but several night in that room would shatter even you nerve my friend you be quite right i answer i should be very sorry to spend several night in that room now i will tell you briefly what occur we be stand in the library sir henry go to the door lock it and put the key in he pocket can i come in say a voice outside the voice be lady studley 's in a minute my darling answer she husband i be engage with halifax just at present medically i suppose she answer yes medically he respond she go away at once and sir henry return to my side now speak he say be quick she be sure to return and i do not like she to fancy that we be talk secret this be my story i say i go into you room put out all the light and sit on the edge of the bed you do not get into bed then no i prefer to be up and to be ready for immediate action should the apparition the horror or whatever you call it appear good god it be a horror halifax it be sir henry a more diabolical contrivance for frightening a man into he grave could scarcely have be contrived i can comfort you on one point however the terrible thing you see be not a figment of you brain there be no likelihood of a lunatic asylum in you case someone be play you a trick i can not agree with you -- but proceed say the baronet impatiently i sit for about a hour on the edge of the bed i continue when i enter the room it be twelve o'clock -- one have sound before there be the least stir or appearance of anything then the tick noise you have describe be distinctly audible this be follow by a sudden bright light which seem to proceed out of the recess of the wardrobe what do you feel when you see that light too excited to be nervous i answer briefly out of the circle of light the horrible eye look at I what do you do then do you faint no i go noiselessly across the carpet up to the door of the wardrobe and look in heaven you be daring i wonder you be alive to tell this tale i see a shadowy form i reply -- dark and tall -- the one brilliant eye keep on look past I straight into the room i make a very slight noise it immediately disappear i wait for some time -- nothing more happen i get into you bed sir henry and sleep i can not say that i have a comfortable night but i sleep and be not disturb by anything extraordinary for the remain hour of the night now what do you mean to do you say you can trace this thing to its foundation it seem to I that all you have see only support my firm belief that a horrible apparition visit that room a material one i respond the shadowy form have substance of that i be convinced sir henry i intend to sleep in that room again to-night lady studley will find out she will not i sleep in the haunt room again to-night and during the day you must so contrive matter that i have plenty of time to examine the wardrobe i do not do so yesterday because i have not a opportunity you must contrive to get lady studley out of the way either this morning or afternoon and so manage matter for I that i can be some little time alone in you room henry henry how awestruck you look say a gay voice at the window lady studley have come out have come round to the

and he wife drive away they drive in a large open landau and two girl who be stay in the house accompany they my hour have come and i go up at once to sir henry 's bedroom lady studley 's room open directly into that of she husband but both room have separate entrance i lock the two outer door now and then begin my investigation i have the key of the wardrobe in my pocket -lrb- illustration : good heaven what have happen -rrb- it be troublesome to unlock because the key be a little rusty and it be more than evident that the heavy door have not be open for some time both these door be make of glass when shut they resemble in shape and appearance a ordinary old-fashioned window the glass be set in deep mullion it be thick be of a peculiar shade of light blue and be evidently of great antiquity i open the door and go inside the wardrobe be so roomy that i could stand upright with perfect comfort it be empty and be line through and through with solid oak i strike a light and begin to examine the interior with care after a great deal of patient investigation i come across a notch in the wood i press my finger on this and immediately a little panel slide back which reveal underneath a small button i turn the button and a door at the back of the wardrobe fly open a flood of sunlight pour in and step out i find myself in another room i look around I in astonishment this be a lady 's chamber good heaven what have happen i be in lady studley 's room shut the mysterious door of the wardrobe very carefully i find that all trace of its existence immediately vanish there be no furniture against this part of the wall it look absolutely bare and smooth no picture ornament it the light paper which cover it give the appearance of a perfectly unbroken pattern of course there must be a conceal spring somewhere and i lose no time in feeling for it i press my hand and the tip of my finger in every direction along the wall try as i would however i could not find the spring and i have at last to leave lady studley 's room and go back to the one occupy by she husband by the ordinary door once more i re-enter the wardrobe and deliberately break off the button which open the secret door from within anyone who now enter the wardrobe by this door and shut it behind he would find it impossible to retreat the apparition if it have material foundation would thus find itself trap in its own net what could this thing portend i have already convinced myself that if sir henry be the subject of a hallucination i also share it as this be impossible i feel certain that the apparition have a material foundation who be the person who glide night after night into lady studley 's room who know the trick of the secret spring in the wall who enter the old wardrobe and perform this ghastly this appalling trick on sir henry studley i resolve that i would say nothing to sir henry of my fresh discovery until after i have spend another night in the haunt room accordingly i slip the key of the wardrobe once more into my pocket and go downstairs i have my way again that night once more i find myself the sole occupant of the haunt room i put out the light sit on the edge of the bed and wait the issue of event at first there be silence and complete darkness but soon after one o'clock i hear the very slight but unmistakable tick-tick which tell I that the apparition be about to appear the tick noise resemble the quaint sound make by the death spider there be no other noise of any sort but a quicken of my pulse a sensation which i could not call fear but which be exciting to the point of pain brace I up for a unusual and horrible sight the light appear in the dim recess of the wardrobe it grow clear and steady and quickly resolve itself into one intensely bright circle out of this circle the eye look at I the eye be unnaturally large -- it be clear almost transparent its expression be full of menace and warn into the circle of light presently a shadowy and ethereal hand intrude itself the finger beckon I to approach while the eye look fixedly at I i sit motionless on the side of the bed i be stoical by nature and my nerve be well seasoned but i be not ashamed to say that i should be very sorry to be often subject to that menace and that invitation the look in that eye the beckon power in those long shadowy finger would soon work havoc even in the stoutest nerve my heart beat uncomfortably fast and i have to say over and over to myself this be nothing more than a ghastly trick i have also to remind myself that i in my turn have prepare a trap for the apparition the time while the eye look and the hand beckon might in reality have be count by seconds to I it seem like eternity i feel the cold dew on my forehead before the rapidly wane light assure I that the apparition be about to vanish make a effort i now leave the bed and approach the wardrobe i listen intently for a moment there be perfect silence then a fumble noise be distinctly audible it be follow by a muffle cry a crash and a heavy fall i strike a light instantly and take the key of the wardrobe from my pocket open it never shall i forget the sight that meet my gaze there huddle up on the floor lay the prostrate and unconscious form of lady studley a black cloak in which she have wrap herself partly cover she face but i know she by she long fair hair i pull back the cloak and see that the unhappy girl have break a blood-vessel and even as i lift she up i know that she be in a die condition i carry she at once into she own room and lay she on the bed i then return and shut the wardrobe door and slip the key into my pocket my next deed be to summon sir henry what be it he ask spring upright in bed come at once i say you wife be very ill die he ask in a agonize whisper i nod my head i could not speak my one effort now be to keep the knowledge of the ghastly discovery i have make from the unhappy husband he follow I to he wife 's room he forget even to question I about the apparition so horrify be he at the sight which meet he view i administer restorative to the die woman and do what i could to check the hemorrhage after a time lady studley open she dim eye oh henry she say stretch out a feeble hand to he come with I come with I i be afraid to go alone my poor lucillum he say he smooth she cold forehead and try to comfort she by every means in he power after a time he leave the room when he do so she beckon I to approach i have fail she say in the most thrilling voice of horror i have ever listen to i must go alone he will not come with I what do you mean i ask she could scarcely speak but at interval the following word drop slowly from she lip : -- i be the apparition i do not want my husband to live after I perhaps i be a little insane i can not quite say when i be tell by sir joseph dunbar that there be no hope of my life a most appalling and frightful jealousy take possession of I i picture my husband with another wife stoop down she voice be very faint i could scarcely hear she muttered word she eye be glaze fast death be claim she and yet hatred against some unknown person thrill in she feeble voice before my husband marry I he love another woman she continue that woman be now a widow i feel certain that immediately after my death he would seek she out and marry she i could not bear the thought -- it possess I day and night that and the terror of die alone work such a havoc within I that i believe i be scarcely responsible for my own action a mad desire take possession of I to take my husband with I and so to keep he from she and also to have he company when i pass the barrier of life i tell you that my brother be a doctor in he medical-student day the sort of trick i have be play on sir henry be enact by some of he fellow-student for he benefit and almost scare he into fever one day my brother describe the trick to I and i ask he to show I how it be do i use a small electric lamp and a very strong reflector how do you find out the secret door of the wardrobe i ask quite by chance i be put some dress into the wardrobe one day and accidentally touch the secret panel i see at once that here be my opportunity you must have be alarm at you success i say after a pause and now i have one more question to ask : why do you summon I to the grange she make a faint impatient movement i want to be certain that my husband be really very ill she say i want you to talk to he -- i guess he would confide in you i think it most probable that you would tell he that he be a victim of brain hallucination this would frighten he and would suit my purpose exactly i also send for you as a blind i feel sure that under these circumstance neither you nor my husband could possibly suspect I she be silent again pant from exhaustion i have fail she say after a long pause you have discover the truth it never occur to I for a moment that you would go into the room he will recover now she pause a fresh attack of hemorrhage come on she breath come quickly she end be very near she dim eye could scarcely see grope feebly with she hand she take mine dr halifax -- promise what i ask i have fail but let I keep he love what little love he have for I before he marry that other woman promise that you will never tell he rest easy i answer i will never tell he sir henry enter the room i make way for he to kneel by he wife 's side as the gray morning break lady studley die before my departure from the grange i avoid sir henry as much as possible once he speak of the apparition and ask if i have see it yes i reply before i could say anything further he continue : -- i know now why it come it be to warn I of my unhappy wife 's death he say no more i could not enlighten he and he be unlikely now ever to learn the truth the follow day i leave studley grange i take with I without ask leave of any-one a certain long black cloak a small electric lamp and a magnifying glass of considerable power it may be of interest to explain how lady studley in she unhealthy condition of mind and body perform the extraordinary trick by which she hope to undermine she husband 's health and ultimately cause he death i experiment with the material which i carry away with I and succeed so my friend tell I in produce a most ghastly effect i do it in this way i attach the mirror of a laryngoscope to my forehead in such a manner as to enable it to throw a strong reflection into one of my eye in the center of the bright side of the laryngoscope a small electric lamp be fit this be connect with a battery which i carry in my hand the battery be similar to those use by the ballet girl in drury lane theater and could be bring into force by a touch and extinguish by the removal of the pressure the eye which be thus brilliantly illumine look through a lens of some power all the rest of the face and figure be completely cover by the black cloak thus the brightest possible light be throw on the magnify eye while there be correspond increase gloom around when last i hear of studley grange it be let for a term of year and sir henry have go abroad i have not hear that he have marry again but he probably will sooner or later \* \* \* \* \* _ the queen of holland _ by mary spencer-warren she majesty the queen-regent of holland have graciously accord special permission to the

first time the palace never before have be photograph -lrb- illustration : the royal palace amsterdam _ from a photo by gunn & stuart richmond _ -rrb- i know a city whose inhabitant dwell on the top of tree like rook thus speak erasmus and this literal fact make amsterdam a most curious as well as a most interesting place be i writing of any one of queen victorium 's palace i should have no need to speak of its situation : but traveller though we be we do not all see these quaint dutch city so a few introductory word may not come amiss a walk round the city remind one of pari with its boulevard plant with tree and venice with its all-present canal indeed it be actually divide up into nearly one hundred island connect by over three hundred bridge a curious thing be that its inhabitant be really live below the level of the sea which be stoutly dam out thus if necessary water could be make its protection from any invasion to go back to the commencement everything street house and bridge be all build upon wooden pile drive into the ground this be absolutely necessary as the natural soil be such that no permanent structure can be put up otherwise on how many pile this city stand it be impossible to form a accurate idea one building -- the royal palace -lrb- het palei -rrb- -- rest on some 13659 this be situate on the dam the highest point of the city it be 282ft long the height with tower be 187ft it be build from 1648-1655 for a town hall and only become a royal palace in 1808 when napoleon first abode in it as such it have a great drawback the want of a suitable entrance -lrb- illustration : the hall or reception-room _ from a photo by gunn & stuart richmond _ -rrb- i enter now at the rear of the building which -- situate in the gedempte voorburgwal -- be the entrance use by they majesty in spite of its civic association when once inside there be much of the state and grandeur inseparable from royalty and i soon determine that holland can almost equal england for its palatial contents and embellishment the staircase and corridor be severe to simplicity but when i look round the first apartment i intend inspect i be strike with the immensity and the exceed beauty of its appearance this be know as the hall or reception-room and be say to be the finest in europe its proportion be certainly magnificent 125ft by 55ft -- a special feature be a remarkably fine roof 100ft in height with entire absence of column or other support roof wall and the hall entire be line with white italian marble the floor have a inlay copper center representative of the firmament the large flag you see droop from the roof be commemorative of the siege of antwerp be the one use by general chass on that occasion the various group of smaller one be reminiscence of the eighty year ' spanish war and of indian foe some very beautiful example of the sculptor 's art be manifest the photographic work here introduce give some idea of the exquisite detail and most remarkable execution of artus quellin and he able assistant here you will observe a allegorical group denote plenty wisdom and strength typical of the city of amsterdam we have a little adventure in secure view of this hall at one end be a small gallery use as the mainstay for the temporary orchestra which be erect on festal occasion think we work could be better show from that point we proceed to it by a dark and wind staircase in the rear all go well for a time but during a period of watchful quietude we artist be suddenly and unexpectedly confront with a gathering of rat of anything but peaceable aspect it be too much for he he make a wild rush for the staircase which be narrow and treacherous result in a too rapid descent a very forcible alighting at the foot and a much bruised and shake body for a few minute we think we photographic work would be close for a season but when spirit and energy revive we begin to think of the camera and the very long exposure plate up at the top so up we go again with much clattering commotion to warn we enemy of we approach and thus you have a view that one of we party will ever regard as dearly obtain note the extremely delicate crystal chandelier for these be quite a feature in the dutch palace so graceful and handsome and so unlike the generality of heavily-constructed appendage one be accustom to behold the other end of the hall have also some choice sculptured marble but unfortunately part of it be hide by the before-mentioned gallery could you obtain a clear view you would see a figure of justice with ignorance and quarrelsomeness crouch at she foot : on one side a skeleton and on the other punishment above all be the figure of atla support the globe here i be give a full description of the appearance of this hall when lay for the state banquet on the occasion of the somewhat recent visit of the german emperor splendid indeed must have be the effect of the hundred of light gleam upon the pure marble the

comfortable to walk about under it than hitherto as the man in uncover it have move it and it be still swing backwards and forwards in anything but a reassuring manner some fine marble column and a

of the little table you will note a battledore and shuttlecock with another throw upon the floor as though the player have be suddenly interrupt in the midst of she play very ordinary make and shape be these toy such as you may see in any middle-class english home and each of they look like favorite -- judge from the sign of much use they present play-day be not yet over for the queen and doubtless she do not wish to hasten they departure for child be child all the world over whether bear in palace or cottage this particular one be not to be envy by those of lower station who have not the responsibility of position ever loom in front of they -- for she be shut away from many youthful pleasure and deny the constant companionship of those suit to she age i hear a story that on one

it ere one can be convince of its really level surface i be tell that this be the only known example of this truly wonderful work -lrb- illustration : the judgment of solomon _ from a photo by gunn & stuart richmond _ -rrb- continue my way through the aide-de-camp ' waiting-room -- stop merely to note one of jan livensz ' work -- i go on to the vierschaar here the wall be line entirely with white marble and present a fine sculptured frieze represent disgrace and punishment with relief emblematical of wisdom and justice the one here present be wisdom as show in the judgment of solomon in the large dining-room may also be see more of the matchless white marble ornamentation and i should much like to linger and admire but as she majesty the queen-regent have graciously promise I the _ entre _ of other of she royal palace i be oblige rather to curtail my work in amsterdam just now they majesty be not at this particular palace so i see nothing of state dinner reception and other function but although i do not see they i hear very much and it would seem that when they _ be _ here the palace be a sort of open house and festivity be the order of the day to all appearance the etiquette be not quite so rigid as at _ we _ court the sovereign be more accessible to the people person wish to pay they respects call at the palace about five day previous write they name in a book keep for the purpose then they be admit on the specify day provide no good reason exist for they exclusion the people be eminently loyal and speak of the little queen in tone of warmest affection a affection which be also extend to the queen-regent who have evidently make herself a firm position in the country the palace at den haag be before I now but first perhaps you would like to know something of the palace at the loo a place i have the privilege of see though as they majesty be actually in residence there photographic work be not possible the loo be near apeldoorn and some considerable distance from amsterdam i have only the one day to spare so be off early in the morning steam out of the central station i soon find myself speed along in such comfortable well-warmed carriage as would rejoice the unfortunate winter traveller in this country who be all but dependent on he ability to pay for the not very useful foot-warmer the country be pretty but flat dyke instead of hedge windmill without number hundred of cow in the field very fine cattle but they _ do _ look comical for the majority of they be wear coat at frequent interval along the line be road crossing each with they little gatehouse and each keep by a woman who turn out as we pass dress in she long blue coat with scarlet facing quaint tall shiny hat and in she hand the signal-flag at length i reach apeldoorn and there a difficulty present itself that the palace be some distance away i be aware but _ how _ far i do not know or in which direction and while i be parley and gesticulate in a mixture of french english and a _ few _ word of dutch the only conveyance obtainable take itself off and i be leave to tramp through the wood with a jargon of dutch direction ring in my ear and a very faint idea of longitude or latitude in my mind the first part lay through a long straggling village lead right into a beautiful forest give a fine day and a certainty of route it would have be simply grand but as it soon pour in torrent my situation be anything but enviable -- in fact i be almost in despair when a huge cart laden with trunk of tree come slowly from a turn near make the man in charge understand that i want the palei i find he be bind in the same direction by this time the rutty road be almost ankle deep in mud so when i be invite to ride i gladly scramble to the top of the pile and so jog along my good-natured guide trudge at the side pipe in mouth regardless of the weather in such stately style then i at length sight the palace but be careful to make a descent before get _ too _ near as the strand magazine must make a more dignified appearance at a royal residence than a wood-cart and a smock-frocked driver can impart four or five man in state livery bow profoundly as i enter one of whom conduct I to a ante-room and after a short interval through some long corridor up some stair and into the presence of one of she majesty 's gentleman of the household a courteous interview with he and i be ask to wait for she majesty 's private secretary who out at present will see I on he return -lrb- illustration : the royal palace at den haag _ from a photo by gunn & stuart richmond _ -rrb- of

literally on the edge of the wood and no more secluded spot can be imagine than this -- the favorite residence of they majesty he majesty the late king also prefer this residence to those more immediately near or in town and it be here he breathe he last what i see of the interior be superbly grand but it be more to the purpose that i have the honor of see they majesty during the day and the opportunity of some observation the youthful queen seem a most pleasing and intelligent-looking child and be eminently child-like and unaffected in she manner and movement reader may be interested in know that in addition to master provide for she majesty 's training she have a english governess under whose charge she be more immediately place the queen-regent as i have already say much resemble she sister not so tall rather stouter but with much the same gentle and rather sad expression of countenance strange that these two sister should both become widow at a early age one comfort they have there be no very great distance between they and though of course the queen-regent can not leave she country much there be nothing to prevent the duchess of albany go there so a suite of apartment be keep for she at each palace my interview with she majesty 's private secretary be of the most pleasant and i can not but record my grateful appreciation of this gentleman 's kindness and courtesy extend towards I throughout my stay in holland such courteous attention much facilitate my work back again to amsterdam and the next day off in quite a opposite direction to den haag one of

of injustice from a deprival of the respect and esteem that be certainly they due in the case of the frog this may be due largely to the animal 's headlong and harlequin-like character but the toad be a steady personage whose solemnity of deportment not to speak of he stoutness entitle he to high consideration in a world where grave dulness and personal circumference always attract reverence the opening line of a certain famous poem have without a doubt do much to damage the dignity of the frog the frog he would a-wooing go be not perhaps disrespectful although flippant but whether he mother would let he or no be a gross insult of course it be a matter upon which no self-respecting frog ever consult he mother but the absurd jingle be immortal and the frog 's dignity suffer by it then there be a certain pot-bellied smugness of appearance about the frog that provoke a smile in the irreverent still the frog have receive some consideration in he time the great homer himself do not disdain to sing the mighty battle of the frog and mouse and aristophane give the frog a most important chorus in one of he comedy moreover call the whole comedy the frog although he have he choice of title-name among many very notable character -- schylus euripide bacchus pluto proserpine and other leader of society still in every way the frog and the toad be underesteem -- as though such a thing as a worthy family frog or a honorable toad of business be in nature impossible it be not as though they be useless the frog 's hind leg make a excellent dish for those who like it as well as a joke for those who do not powdered toad hold in the palm be a fine thing to stop the nose bleeding -- or at any rate it be a couple of hundred year ago accord to a dear old almanac i have on the same unimpeachable authority i may fearlessly affirm a smash frog -- smash on the proper saint 's day -- in conjunction with hair take from a ram 's forehead and a nail steal from a piebald mare 's shoe to be a certain remedy for ague worn in a little leather bag if it fail it will be because the moon be in the wrong quarter or the mare be not sufficiently piebald or the nail be not steal with sufficient dishonesty or some mistake of that sort -lrb- illustration : a small lunch -rrb- personally i be rather fond of frog and toad this of course in a strictly platonic sense and entirely apart from dinner a toad i admire even more than a frog because of he gentlemanly calm he never rush at he food ravenously as do so many other creature place a worm near he and you will see he inspect the worm casually first with one eye and then with the other as who would say : luncheon certainly delighted i be sure then he sit placidly awhile as though thinking of something else altogether presently he rise slightly on he foot and look a little -- very little -- more attentively at the worm oh yes he be say -- luncheon of course whenever you like you know and he become placid again as though interested in the general conversation after a little he suddenly straighten he hind leg and bend down over the worm like a man say ah and what have we get here now oh worm -- _ ver au naturel _ -- capital capital after this there be nothing to do but to eat and this the toad do without the smallest delay for leisurely indifference follow by a business-like grab nothing can beat a toad almost before the cover be lift figuratively speak the worm 's head and tail be wriggle like a lively moustache out of the side of the toad 's mouth the head and tail he gently pat in with he hand and there be no longer any worm after which the toad smile affably and comfortably possibly meditate a liqueur i have a especial regard for the giant toad in one of the case against the inner wall of the reptile-house lobby there be a pimpliness of countenance and a comfortable capaciousness of waistcoat about he that always make I wonder what he have do with he churchwarden and pewter he have a

from he cogitative demeanor he be think i be convince of the new goliath beetle the goliath beetle he be think would make rather a fit supper for the giant toad this because he have never see the beetle he mind might be set at rest by a introduction to goliath but the acquaintanceship would do no good to the beetle 's moral at present goliath be a most exemplary vegetarian and tea-drinker but evil communication with that pimply dissipate toad would wreck he principle -lrb- illustration : think i could manage that beetle tyrrell -rrb- -lrb- illustration : evil communication -rrb- why one should speak of the adorn ceratophry when the thing might just as well be call the bark frog i do not know let we compromise and call he the adorn c in the manner of mr wemmick i respect the adorn c almost as much as if he be a toad instead of a frog but chiefly i admire he mouth a crocodile have a very respectable mouth -- when it separate its jaw it open its head but when the adorn c smile he open out he entire anatomical bag of trick -- come as near bisect himself indeed as may be open in short like a gladstone bag from a fat person of course you expect a broad genial smile but you be doubly gratify when you find it extend all round he that you feel be indeed no end of a smile -- and that be the smile of the adorn c -lrb- illustration -rrb- -lrb- illustration : do not squeeze so

adorn c be short of temper indeed you may only make he bark by practise upon this fact tyrrell 's private performance with the adorn c be one that irresistibly remind the spectator of lieutenant cole 's with he figure and would scarcely be improve by ventriloquism itself the adorn c prefer bite to bark and he bite be worse than he bark -- bite always be except in the proverb this be why tyrrell hold the adorn c pretty tight whenever he touch he the one aspiration of the adorn c be for a quiet life and he defend he aspiration with bite and bark tyrrell touch he gently cautiously and repeatedly on the back until the annoyance be no longer to be tolerate and then the adorn c duly bark like a terrier now the most interesting thing about the adorn c after he mouth be he bark and why he should be reluctant to exhibit it except under pressure of irritation -- why he should hide he light under a bushel of ill-temper -- i can not conceive it be as though pattus would not sing till she manager throw a egg at she or as though sir frederick leighton would only paint a picture after mr whistler have break he studio window with a brick even the whistle oyster of london tradition would perform without require a preliminary insult or personal assault but let we account everything good if possible perhaps the adorn c only suffer from a modest dislike for vain display although

such a pretty girl even in the midst of she grief one be a old pedlar with he well-filled pack on the floor beside he he have a pleasant homely face and thin bent figure the other be a middle-sized powerful fellow clean shaven and beetle-browed and dress in shabby ill-fitting garment it be hard to tell what he rank in life might be he stare once again at babette and then hand he glass to the host to be re-filled the pedlar be the first to break the silence -lrb- illustration : ` cheer up my lass ' he say kindly -rrb- cheer up my lass he say kindly i too have miss the coach and i too must

he have come in cold and tired and the landlord 's good ale have make he slightly loquacious yes i shall try and walk the road be better walking than drive it be not so very many mile and most likely i shall be overtake by some cart go the same way and he rise as he speak babette rise also and catch he eagerly by the hand i will walk with you she cry i be strong well shod and the fastest walker in

she could not persuade she help she to wrap the baby up afresh and finally make she place in she pocket a tiny flask of brandy in case she say the snow should overtake they so they start babette have speak the truth when she call herself a good walker she be but twenty and be both slight and active the pedlar too in spite of he bent form get over the ground quickly they have put four or five good mile between themselves and les trois frres when the snow begin to fall it come down steadily in thick heavy flake babette draw she cloak yet closer round she boy and they plod on but walk become more and more difficult and they grow both weary and cold suddenly by the roadside several yard ahead they see a man 's figure he be come to meet they and draw near rapidly and then they recognize they friend in the shabby brown clothes who have leave the inn so shortly before they i see you come he explain so come to meet you madame -- with a bow to babette polite for one so uncouth look -- can go no further to-night the storm will not pass off yet i live not far from here with my mother and brother and if madame like we can all take shelter under my humble roof it be but a poor place but you will be welcome and doubtless we can find two spare bed they could do nothing but thank he and accept he offer even babette acknowledge that all hope of reach brussels be now over the new year would have dawn before she and she husband meet the wind have rise and the snow half turn to sleet be now beat furiously into they face it be all they could do to keep they foot they struggle on after they guide as best they could till he turn out of the high road into a lane and thankful be they when he stop and push open a gate that creak on rusty hinge lead they up a narrow gravelled pathway to a small bare house flank on either side by some dreary bush of evergreen in answer to he peremptory knock the door be open by a man slighter and shorter than himself but sufficiently like he to be know as he brother and the traveller stagger in -- the door with a heavy crash blow to behind they perhaps now for the first time it really strike babette that she have be headstrong in persist in she journey and in trust herself and child to the mercy of utter stranger so far from home the same thought pass through the old pedlar 's mind but it be too late to retreat so they silently follow they new host and he brother they go down a passage and into a room half kitchen half parlor snugly and even comfortably furnish -lrb- illustration : a man and a woman sit over the fire -rrb- heavy wooden shutter dull the noise of the boisterous gale outside a thick red curtain hang over the door and a cheery log fire burn in the stove a man and woman sit over it the man a tall repulsive-looking creature with unkempt hair and mat beard he age apparently about fifty the woman look seventy or more she too have once be tall but now old age give she a withered witch-like appearance in spite of she great height she be dress in limp fade garment with a tattered shawl cross over she chest and have a scared miserable look in she bleared old eye there be a few word of explanation from the man who have come home and then in gruff but not unkindly tone he bid babette be seat and tell he mother to get some supper speedily she spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table and when all be ready lift a large black saucepan from the stove and turn out a smoking savoury-looking stew the youngest son produce a bottle contain the thin acid wine of the country and another of spirit as he set they on the table babette notice that across one of he hand which be much smaller and whiter than those of he brother there run a dull red scar that look as if he have have a bad cut there then they all sit down except the old mother who busy herself in wait on they it be the last good meal you 'll get for some time i be think she croak as she watch they devour they supper unless you turn to and find more work than you have do lately the landlord call for he rent again to-day and swear he would wait no longer but turn we out if we do not pay in three day ' time curse he mutter the man who have bring the stranger in half under he breath then aloud he add shut up good mother : remember we have visitor and one a man of property who will hardly sympathize with we poverty babette look up as he speak and intercept a glance so strange and savage that pass between the brother and then rest on she friend the pedlar that involuntarily she shudder and turn pale the old man however do not appear to notice anything unsatisfactory in the appearance or manners of he host he have eat to he liking and have allow the grim-looking eldest brother to fill he glass again and again with genievre till he face begin to flush and he eye grow dazed and heavy babette feel more and more uneasy oh to be back at les trois frres again or even out in the snowy road anything would be better than sit in this lonely house with those three forbid face glare on she she rise hastily and catch up she sleep child i be very tired good people she say timidly and i must start betime in the morning if i might go to bed now i should be so thankful in answer to she request the old woman light a candle and babette follow she upstairs into a small low chamber there be no superfluous furniture in it but the little bed look clean and invite and the curtain that hang in front of the tiny window be make of light fresh-looking chintz face the bed be a door lead apparently into another room babette wonder if it be the one she friend the pedlar be to occupy but she be not long leave in doubt the old woman wish she good-night and leave she and babette after hush she boy to sleep again have just sink wearily into the one chair the room boast when she hear a slow heavy step ascend and know the pedlar be come to bed he shut the outer door behind he and begin arrange he pack babette could hear the pedlar move backwards and forwards with uncertain tired footstep there be no sound below even the wind be hushed she draw aside the curtain and look out and see that the snow have cease to fall and lay thick and white on the ground then there come a sudden presentiment upon she a sense of danger vague and undefined seem to surround she it be all the more terrible on account of its vagueness she do not know what she fear yet the terror of something horrible be strong upon she she slip off she boot and steal gently up to the door that divide she room from the pedlar 's sir she whisper you be very very tired and will sleep heavily i be so anxious i do not know why but forgive I and do trust I push you pocket-book that contain you money under the door see -- it do not fit tight we do not know who the people of the house be : they may try to rob you i will tie it up inside my baby 's shawl and will give it back to you as soon as we be out of this place oh would to god that we have never enter it you money will be safe with I and they will never think of look for it here will you give it I in answer to she pleading a shabby little leather book be push into she room as she pick it up and proceed to hide it securely away beneath the baby 's many wrapping the pedlar say in a voice render hoarse and indistinct by the spirit he have partake of in such unaccustomed quantity : here my dear take it it will i know be safe with you i feel so tired that i do not think a cannon would wake I to-night once i get to sleep he grope he way to he bed and fling himself down on it dress as he be soon babette hear he snore loudly and regularly and then she take off she clothes and roll she cloak around she lay down by the side of she child in after year when she look on that awful time she often wonder how feeling as she do that she be surround by so many unknown peril she have ever close she eye perhaps the long walk and the excitement she have undergo account for the profound sleep into which she fall almost immediately and from which she be arouse in the dead of night by a noise in the next room it be neither snore nor cry it be more like a long shudder gurgle and then -- silence frightful terrible silence break at last by the sound of stealthy footstep and hushed voice babette sink down on she pillow again she baby clutch in she arm a voiceless prayer go up to heaven for the child 's safety and she own for already she hear they approach she door and make sure she last hour be come through nearly close eyelid she watch two of the man enter the one who have bring they to the house and he elder brother they be mutter curse low but deep to have risk so much for nothing whisper one can she have it or be the old fool jest with we it be a jest that have cost he dear answer the other as he watch he brother search the girl 's clothes and then slip he murderous hand beneath she pillow he withdraw they empty shall we settle she he ask or let she go be it not best to be on the safe side but the smooth-shaven one say decisively : let she alone we have enough to answer for see she be sound asleep and if not it will be easy to find out before she reach brussels how much she know let she be babette lay like a log stir neither hand nor foot in that awful moment when she life or death be tremble in the balance she mother love that divine instinct implant in every woman 's breast come to she and save she she know that if she move she baby 's life be go -- she own she hardly care about just then but those little limb that be nestle so soft and warm against she own and that little flaxen head that be cuddle against she arm for they sake she be brave -lrb- illustration : she lay motionless -rrb- so she lay motionless and listen fear that the man would hear even the quick heavy throb of she heart but they do not they search quickly and systematically amongst all she clothing they feel under she pillow again but never think of look at the shawl of the baby who lay so peacefully by she side and then at last they creep away and close the door gently behind they the room be in utter darkness for age as it seem babette lay there afraid to stir and listen vainly for some sound then she sit up all white and tremble my god she think what awful thing have happen oh give I strength and courage for my baby 's sake as a inspiration there come to she the thought of the little bottle that the good-natured landlady of les trois frres have give she she feel in the pocket of she dress and draw it out take a long deep draught of the fiery spirit she have be on the verge of faint though she know it not and the brandy put new life into she she listen for a long time and then gently -- very gently -- she creep out of bed and draw aside the little curtain from the window perhaps a wild idea of escape into the cold dark night outside aid by a sheet or blanket flash through she brain if so she soon realize that it would not be practicable the window be not high but it be small and divide by thick old-fashioned bar of iron to get out be impossible -lrb- illustration : she stand consider -rrb- as she stand consider a thin flicker moonbeam creep in and partially light up the room it fall on to the door that lead into the pedlar 's chamber and show she something dark and slimy that be flow slowly -- slowly from under it into she room she do not cry out or fall senseless she bent down and put she hand into it and see that it be blood -- she poor old friend 's life-blood -- for she know now beyond all doubt that he have be murder for the sake of he suppose wealth she know she be helpless till morning to get out of the house be impossible for to do so she must pass down the stair and through the room below where probably they be either sleep or watch if she have courage and could only let they think she know and suspect nothing she might still escape surely they would not dare to murder she also for they know she husband would be expect she next day and would be look for she if she do not come with another prayer this time utter shiveringly for the soul of the pedlar she nerve herself to get into bed again and lay there till morning with she child against she heart gaze with stare sleepless eye at the door which divide she from that awful room keep surely the most terrible vigil that ever woman keep at last the morning dawn clear and bright a frost have set in and the road be clean and hard the sky be blue if it have not be for that ghastly stain that have creep across the far end of she room she might almost have think that the event of the night have be but a fearful dream she child awake fresh and smile and she could hear they stir in the living room below she feel that now indeed the hardest part of she task be still before she on a little table by the side of she bed there be a small crack looking-glass when she be dress she look into it and see that it reflect a face death-like in its pallor with burn lip and feverish eye she take the bottle from she pocket again and gulp down the rest of its contents it send a flush into she cheek and steady the sick tremble that be shake she through and through without stop to think or look round again she take up she boy and descend the stair and enter the room where they have sup on the previous night the old woman be its sole occupant now she be bend over the fire frying something for breakfast and the table in the center of the room be prepare for the meal she look if possible more untidy and slovenly than when babette have last see she and greet the girl with a feeble smile then she pour she out a cup of coffee and babette have sit down and begin to sip it -lrb- for she know she must make a pretence of breakfast -rrb- when the eldest son come in there be a very uneasy look upon he evil-looking face how be you he ask sullenly as he sit down opposite she i hope rest do you sleep well never afterwards do she know how she find courage to answer he as she do quietly and firmly : -- yes very well thank you but my friend -- he must have over-slept himself -- why be he not down the old woman drop a plate with a clatter and turn round the man look babette straight in the face as he reply and she meet he glance with one just as steady the pedlar be go he say as he sugar he coffee carefully he pay he bill and be off before seven you will probably see he in brussels for he be go there yes repeat babette i shall very likely meet he in brussels but i do not even know he name and i too good people ought to be start the morning be fine and walk will be easy she drink down she coffee as she speak and rise i can not eat she exclaim see that they both look suspiciously at the thick slice of currant-bread that lay untouched on she plate i think i be excite at the thought of see my husband again it seem so long since we part and now we shall meet so soon in she own ear she voice sound far away and unnatural but they do not seem to notice anything strange in she the old woman with a meek thank you take the humble payment she tender and they let she go only the big burly eldest son stand at the door and watch she as she go slowly down the little pathway and out through the creaking gate into the snowy road she only look back once and then she see that a dingy signboard hang in front of the house the picture of what be mean for a cow and have once be white be depict on it and the word a la vache blanche be clumsily paint underneath so the house be a inn evidently and as babette read the word she dimly remember have hear long ago that there be a inn of that name not far from brussels it be keep by some people name marac whose character be anything but good and who have be implicate in several robbery that have take place some year before although the utmost effort of the police have fail to trace any crime directly home to they oh heaven why do i not see that sign last night the girl think despairingly as she trudge along the hard frosty road it would have save he life and perhaps my reason she speed along faster and faster for the house be now quite out of sight in the distance the way begin to wind up-hill and a stunt leafless wood straggle along one side of the highway babette be just consider whether go through it would shorten she journey when a woman dress in the ordinary peasant costume of the country emerge from it and come towards she with quick firm step she be tall and rather masculine look the black flemish cloak she wear hung round she in straight thick fold she carry a market basket on one arm a neat white cloth conceal the egg and butter that probably lay underneath good-day she say in thick guttural tone as she reach babette be you on the way to brussels babette make way for she to pass somewhat shyly yes she say and i be in haste but the road be heavy and i have my baby to carry as she answer she eye happen to fall on the stranger 's right hand which be ungloved and clasp the basket and as she look she heart seem suddenly to quiver and stand still for across that strong right hand there run a deep red scar precisely similar to the one she have notice on the previous night on the hand of the youngest brother at the vache blanche it do not take long for the whole horrible truth to flash across she doubtless they have feel insecure after they terrible deed and the youngest marac have be dispatch after she disguise as a woman with instruction to way-lay she by some shorter cut in order to find out if she be really ignorant of the frightful way in which the pedlar have meet he untimely end as these thought chase each other through she mind she feel as if she great terror be slowly blanch she face and she limb begin to tremble till she could hardly drag herself over the ground but she baby 's warm little heart beat so closely against she own once more give she strength she drop she eye so that she might no longer see that awful hand and totter on by the new-comer 's side strive to imagine that it be indeed only a harmless peasant woman who be walk by she and try to remember that every step be bring she nearer to brussels and protection she companion glance at she curiously and babette shiver for she fancy she see suspicion in the look you seem tired she or rather he say always speak in the same low thick tone brussels be barely two mile off and it be yet early but perhaps you have not rest well where do you sleep too well do the girl know why that question be ask she and now that she first sickening horror be over she brave spirit nerve itself once more i be journey with a friend yesterday she reply when the snow-storm overtake we luckily we meet a man whose home lay in we road he be very good and take we there and give we supper and bed the stranger laugh a good samaritan indeed and you friend where be he now do he find he host so hospitable that he be unable to tear himself away no say babette gently he start early before i come down he be far on he road they be very good to I and give I coffee before i leave i be a poor woman and could do but little to repay they the two franc i give they be almost my last this speech utter in such a soft even voice -- for babette have school herself well by now -- seem to satisfy she companion and they walk on side by side in silence for what seem to the poor girl

the english nation show they respect for the president of the college of physician and in he the profession he so dearly love be honor what be the reason of this demonstration of respect because individual seem to have feel a sense of irreparable _ loss _ very many have the idea that there be few other with he gift who would respond in the same way to they demand for sympathy and help for sir andrew 's interest in each patient be real there be a attractive force about he difficult to describe and which only those who know he could understand for he be nothing if not original it be impossible in this brief sketch to give a adequate portrait of a great personality and to tell the story of he life 's work i shall but try to mention some of he distinctive quality and characteristic illustrate by a few fact two or three real incident sometimes give a better idea of a man 's character than page of generality -lrb- illustration : the grave in essendon churchyard _ from a photo by

and be appoint to the hospital at haslar he subsequent medical career be pretty generally know he obtain almost every possible honor culminate in the presidency of the college of physician for the lengthy term of six year sir andrew be devote to the college he make a excellent president and a dignified courteous and just chairman he successor will find it no easy task to fill he place he take a intense interest in all that concern the welfare of the college and give many proof of he affection one of the last be a donation of # 500 last year towards its redecoration not a great many layman know the college by sight it be a corner building in trafalgar square the entrance face whitcomb street the meeting of the fellow be hold in the magnificent library line with 60000 volume chiefly

library that sir andrew preside at the harveian oration the day before he be take ill sir andrew could not be judge of by the surface as sir joseph phayre truly say : i have know he intimately and the more i know he the more i respect and admire he those who know he best love he best one have only to read how one lead man after another write of he with enthusiastic appreciation -lrb- in the _ medical journal _ -rrb- to learn what he colleague think of he medical skill and personal character a bishop recently speak of he as the truthful doctor : and a young girl who from a small child have stay with he tell I he would always correct himself if he have tell a anecdote the least inaccurately and one day this summer when walk round they garden with he she say the caterpillar have eat all they gooseberry tree i mean the gooseberry _ leave _ she add sir andrew immediately say i be glad you be particular to say what be exactly true but she add there be always _ something _ to remember in everything he say with regard to another point a clergyman who know sir andrew very intimately once tell I that no man of this century have a more keenly religious mind he be so saturated with thought of god and so convinced that god have speak to man he be intensely religious with a profound sense of the supernatural he certainly be a great example to very busy man in the way he always manage to find time for church and even when call away to a distance he would if possible go to a church near where he happen to be in addition to these quality he be very just sympathetic and generous -lrb- illustration : camfield house essendon _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- i have come across many friend who know he well and it be interesting to note that the same cardinal point seem to have strike everyone as the key-note of he life in almost identical word each one speak of he strong faith he strict veracity and he intense devotion to duty one of he old friend say to I the other day : _ nothing _ would tempt clark away from what he think right he conscientiousness be unbounded he love of metaphysics combine with a very high motive make he naturally interested in the _ whole _ man -- body mind and spirit to quote the word of a well-known bishop : it be he intrepid honesty which be so valuable a quality in sir andrew clark man feel that he wish to do they good and to do they the best good by make man of they -lrb- illustration : sir andrew clark 's house in cavendish square _ from a photograph by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- the bishop tell I a characteristic anecdote illustrate this : a clergyman complain to he of feel low and depressed unable to face he work and tempt to rely on stimulant sir andrew see that the position be a perilous one and that it be a crisis in the man 's life he deal with the case and forbid resort to stimulant when the patient declare that he would be unequal to he work and ready to sink ` then ' say sir andrew ` sink like a man ' this be but one of many incident show he marvellous power in restrain he patient and raise they to a higher moral level the writer could tell a far more wonderful story of the saving of a drunkard body and soul but it be too touching and sacred for publication at the top of the wall of that well-known consulting-room -lrb- in which sir andrew be say to have see 10000 patient annually -rrb- immediately face the chair where he always sit be the word : glory to god -lrb- illustration : censor ' room -- college of physician _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- with regard to he profession he be a enthusiast he term medicine the metropolis of the kingdom of knowledge and in one of he address to student say : you have choose one of the noblest the most important and the most interesting of profession but also the most arduous and the most self-denying involve the largest sacrifice and the fewest reward he who be not prepare to find in its cultivation and exercise he chief recompense have mistake he call and should retrace he step he have a ideal and he do he utmost to live up to it he word in many instance do as much good as he medicine to explain what i mean i can not do better than quote part of a letter receive since sir andrew 's death from a delicate hardworking clergyman whom i have know some year after speaking of sir andrew 's painstaking kindness never seem the least hurry he say : he have a wonderful way of inspiring one with confidence and readiness to face one 's trouble i remember he say once ` it be wonderful how we get _ accustomed _ to we trouble ' and at another time while encourage I to go on with work -- read for order : ` if one be to die it be better to die do something than do nothing ' i have often find that a help when feel done-up and useless in the old day when people use to go and see he without a appointment i have often sit for hour in he dining-room feeling so ill that i feel as if i should die before i see he but after have see he i feel as if i have get a new lease of life i be not at all hypochondriacal or fanciful i think but that be the moral effect of a interview with he i believe he revolutionize the treatment of case like mine and that he to a certain extent experiment on I at any rate he treat I on philosophical principle and tell I often -lrb- he go to he for twenty year -rrb- that i have become much stronger than he have expect he say to I several time : ` you be a wonderful man you have save many life ' -lrb- illustration : entrance hall -- college of physician _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- this my correspondent understand to mean the experiment have be successful he once say that if i have die at that time there be not a doctor in london would have approve of he treatment he give a description of my case some year ago in a lecture i think at brighton -- but of course without the name the particular weakness be valvular disease of the heart the consequence of rheumatic fever and this treatment be found on the principle that nature always work towards compensation he tell I many year ago that that particular mischief be fully compensate for -lrb- illustration : the reading room -- college of physician _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- he love he work and never tire of it he often tell the story how he first serious case and encouraging cure be himself with severe hemorrhage of the lung he be tell it would be at the risk of he life if he go on with he study a doctor however he make up he mind he would be and that he would begin by make every effort to cure himself with characteristic determination he persist in a strict regimen of diet and fresh air i determine say sir andrew as far as my study would allow I -- for i never intend to give they up -- to live in the fresh air often study out of door and in a short time i be so much better that i be able to take gentle exercise i get well and i may almost say i get over the trouble which threaten I the lung be heal and a result which seem inevitable avoid he would often say he obtain he first appointment at the london hospital chiefly out of pity the authority think he would not live six month but he outlive almost every one of they -lrb- illustration : the caducen mace book and seal -- college of physician _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- no man could have keep on for fourteen and sixteen hour a day as sir andrew do without unbounded enthusiasm and a absorb interest he enormous correspondence must have be the great tax most people be disincline to write a dozen letter at the end of a hard day 's work but sir andrew often come home at eight o'clock with the knowledge that letter would occupy he until after midnight he letter average sixty per day these would be answer by return except where minute direction be inclose only the other day a friend of he tell I sir andrew come in the morning a short time before he be take ill look very tired and worried on be ask the reason he say he have not sleep all night for he go to see a patient three day before and because he have not send the table of direction the patient write say he would not try he treatment i never sleep say sir andrew thinking of the state of mind to which i have unavoidably reduce that poor patient in order to get through he work he have a light breakfast at 730 when he read he letter which be open for he from eight until two or three he see patient he simple luncheon be take in the consulting-room he would then go to the hospital college of physician or some consultation he have often after that to go to see someone at a distance but he never worry a patient by seem in a hurry however much press for time he have a very strong sense of responsibility and would never rest himself by stay the night if it be unnecessary a rich patient in devonshire once offer he a large sum to stay until the next morning i could do you no good say sir andrew and my patient will want I to-morrow among he patient be almost all the great author philosopher and intellectual man of the day longfellow tennyson huxley cardinal manning and numerous other be he warm friend he always declare he catch many a cold in the ascetic cardinal 's cold house a old pupil truly say sir andrew have the rare faculty of survey the condition and circumstance of each one gather they up and clearly see what be best to do professor sheridan delapine say : he be specially fond of quote sydenham 's word : ` tota ars medici est in observationibus ' after ask what be amiss and question they on what they tell he he would say : give I a plan of you day what be you work when do you take you meal of what do they consist what time do you get up and when do you go to bed notwithstanding the keenness of he eye and natural intuition which find out instantly far more than be tell he not only eagerly and attentively listen but _ remembered _ what he patient say sir henry roscoe give I a striking instance of this and i can not do better than quote he exact word : -- i first make sir andrew 's acquaintance about twenty year ago at braemar where he be spend the autumn and as be he kindly wont have with he a young manchester man far go in consumption to whom he act as friend counsellor and physician in we frequent walk and talk i confide in the eminent doctor that i have suffer from that frequent plague of sedentary man the gout ` come and see I any morning in cavendish square before eight ' say he ` and i will do what i can for you ' many year slip by live then in manchester i never take advantage of the kind offer and i never see sir andrew until some eight year afterwards i be call on my old friend sir joseph whitworth who at that time have room in great george street as i come quickly out of the front door clark 's carriage drive up and almost before it stop the doctor ` bounce ' out and we nearly run against each other in one ` instant-minute ' as we american friend say he accost I : ` well how 's the gout ' he have no more idea of meeting I at that moment than of meet the man in the moon and yet no sooner have he see my face -- which he have not look upon for eight year -- than the whole ` case ' flash upon he since that time i have often see he and i shall always retain not only a high opinion of he great gift but also a affectionate remembrance of he great-heartedness literary people and brain-worker particularly interested he and they find in the kind doctor a friend who understand they he would advise all write that involve thought to be do in the morning before luncheon the evening might be spend in take in or read up the subject of a book or paper but there must be no give out for brain-worker who be not strong he insist on meat in the middle of the day he declare that for this class it be physiologically wicked even to have luncheon without to one who speak of fatigue after a comparatively short walk he reply : walk little then many who work they brain be not up to much exercise i hardly ever walk a mile myself but that need not prevent man have plenty of fresh air -lrb- illustration : the london hospital _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- some people laugh at he rule for diet etc forget that these simple direction be base on deep knowledge of the human frame let they laugh many who have try they know they have be different people in consequence he incisive word -- my friend you eat too much my friend you drink too much would not he appreciate by all but sir andrew think nearly all disease be the outcome of the constant and apparently unimportant violation of the law of health those who be hopelessly ill would always hear the truth from he but he would leave no stone unturn to lessen they suffer many a incurable patient have he send to a home from the london hospital and visit they afterwards only the other day i hear of patient he have send to st elizabeth 's great ormond street where incurable patient be nurse and care for until they die and never leave the hospital without leave a guinea with one of the nun sir andrew have no stereotyped plan it be not merely the disease but the individual he treat a friend tell I he save she aunt 's life she could not sleep and sir andrew order they to give she breakfast at five for after toss about all night she might sleep after have some food and so it prove -lrb- illustration : the harrison ward -- london hospital _ from a photo by mavor & meredith _ -rrb- to other who might get well he would say : fight for you life twelve year ago a lady -lrb- whom i meet lately -rrb- have hemorrhage of the lung three time she be tell by seven doctor in the country that she have not a week to live she have young child and determine to make a great effort to see sir andrew clark he prophesy she would get well provide she at once leave the damp climate where she be then live and make she permanent home at malvern a week after she have take he remedy she walk up the wrekin from that day she see sir andrew once every year and look upon herself as a monument of he skill die to live be a favorite saying of sir andrew 's in congenial work you will find life strength and happiness this certainly be he own experience only in July last he say to the writer of this notice : i never know what it be to feel well now but work be the joy of my life he could however place strict limit as to how much a _ patient _ might work it be well know how docile and obedient a patient he have in mr gladstone one evening come downstairs muffle up to avoid a worse cold he be meet by sir andrew with the greet where be you go to the house say mr gladstone no you be not reply he friend you be go straight to bed and to bed he go sir andrew also limit the time mr gladstone should speak on one occasion however notwithstanding the fact that the peremptory adviser be present watch in hand mr gladstone after throw down the write speech as the clock strike go on for another half-hour -lrb- a -rrb- this disobedience be the exception which prove the rule -lrb- a -rrb- the substance of this anecdote which i quote from memory appear in the _ daily news _ and happen at newcastle mr gladstone be a friend for whom sir andrew have the highest respect and veneration and hardly ever pass a day without go to see he shortly before he be take ill he say : for twenty year i have never hear gladstone say a unkind or vituperative word of anyone -lrb- illustration : nurse harrison -- london hospital -lrb- the nurse who tend sir andrew clark in he last illness

doubt but one of many similar experience after a hard day 's work he be urgently summon to a place 120 mile from london it be a very wet night there be no carriage to meet he no fly to be have after walk a mile or two he arrive at a small farm and find the daughter suffering from a attack of hysteria sir andrew with he usual kindness do what he could and evidently give satisfaction for when he leave the mother say : well sir andrew you have be so kind we must make it double and hand he two guinea he thank they and say : good-bye sir andrew would never hear of charge more than he usual fee because a person happen to be very rich in a word he be honest on one occasion when go to see a patient in the south the doctor who be to meet he in consultation meet sir andrew at the station tell he they be rich and quite prepared to pay a very high fee but sir andrew reply : i do not come from london and name the place where he be stay say my fee be only a third of the sum you name sir andrew be not indifferent to fee on the contrary he rather take a pride in tell how much he earn he be say to have once receive # 5000 for go to canne the largest _ medical _ fee know some however have wonder who do pay he -- so numerous be he non-paying patient from anglican and roman catholic clergy sister nun and all engage in any charitable work -lrb- unless rich man -rrb- he would never consent to receive a fee at the same time make it feel that unwillingness to accept he advice would deprive he of a pleasure and it be feel that this be literally true and if anything the patient whom he see as a friend be show more consideration than other come and see I next week he say to one who demur to the necessity for go again know he would not accept a fee and i will arrange that you shall not be

canada sir andrew be most warmly receive and universally like by everyone amongst other he make the acquaintance of sir john macdonald the princess tell I without doubt there be one predominate interest in he mind and that the supernatural -- whether at a british association meet the college of physician or speak privately to he own friend he realize the impossibility of explain by scientific method the supernatural he would often say : there be more in heaven and earth than this world dream of give the most _ perfect _ scientific method you will find beyond abyss which you be powerless to explore he have the greatest charm of mind and needless to say be a delightful companion he topic of conversation be extremely varied : he like dialectic for talk and argument 's sake and enjoy talk to those who have somewhat the same taste possibly for this reason he do not fully appreciate child although they amuse he and he like to understand they idea a friend of sir andrew 's stay with he at the time tell I the follow characteristic anecdote : one afternoon during he autumn holiday in scotland the footman come in to put coal on the fire and a child -lrb- a relation -rrb- cough

he consider morally and ethically inferior to a man 's in he opinion very many woman be want in the two great quality -- justice and truth -- consider they own they child 's or they husband 's interest first rather than what be absolutely right one subject that interest he very much be heredity and he have of course countless opportunity of study it temperance and morality he would say be most distinctly transmit especially by the mother but say sir andrew in spite of heredity i be what i be by my own choice sir andrew be a great reader metaphysics philosophy and theology be he favorite subject especially the latter -- he also occasionally read a good novel reading be he only relaxation for it be one he could enjoy while drive or in the train dr russell who be with he when go to attend the tercentenary of dublin college tell the story how sir andrew not only read but write hour after hour in the railway carriage and in addition listen to the conversation dr russell reynold sir jame paget sir dyce duckworth and sir r quain be of the party and the two latter join dr russell in remark with he that it would ruin he eyesight i be use my eye not abuse they reply sir

regret that lack of space prevent my describe the london hospital as i should like of most hospital sir andrew be a governor but he great interest be the london of which he and lady clark be both life

nurse one nurse in the charlotte ward -lrb- sir andrew clark 's -rrb- say he use literally to shovel out half-crown at christmas when he ask what the patient be go to do everyone speak of the pecuniary sacrifice and strain he connection with the hospital involve he endow a medical tutorship also scholarship for student student nurse etc would eagerly listen to he informal exposition in the ward as he invariably show a grasp of the subject that be equally minute and comprehensive he would start from some particular point and work he way point by point down to the minutest detail not bewildering by a multiplicity of fact but keep they all in order with perfect handling until the framing of the whole thing stand out luminously clear to the dullest comprehension a old pupil say he

condition which diminish bodily vigor or mental _ lan _ -lrb- illustration : no 4 -- write in 1831 -rrb- the writing of no 4 be very like that of no 3 the easy curve below the signature be cleverly make and while they indicate much energy they also point to a useful confidence in self owe to the deliberate way of accentuate the most personal part of a letter -- its signature -lrb- illustration : no 5 -- write in 1832 -rrb- no 5 be the facsimile of a signature to a letter which be write in the library of the british museum to my dear knolle the letter end : believe I -lrb- in haste -rrb- yours most truly at this time -- 1832 -- dickens be a newspaper reporter and it be curious to notice that in spite of haste he yet manage to execute this complex movement underneath the signature its force and energy be great but we shall see even more pronounced development of this flourish before it take the moderate and graceful form of confident and assure power -lrb- illustration : no 6 -- write in 1833 or 1834 -rrb- there be still more force and go about no 6 : it be write on Wednesday night past 12 and also in haste dickens be report for the _ morning chronicle _ and be just start on a journey but yet there be here two separate flourish one begin under the _ s _ of _ charle _ and end under the _ c _ of that name the other start under the capital _ d _ and finish below the _ n _ of _ dickens

next facsimile no 7 be a ugly but a very active piece of movement this group of curve be equal to about a two-feet length of pen-stroke a fact which indicate a extraordinary amount of personal energy dickens be then write he sketch by boz and this ungraceful elaboration of he signature be probably accompany by a grow sense of he own capacity and power during the time-interval between the signature show in no 7 and 8 the first number of the pickwick papers be publish -- march 1836 -- and charle dickens marry catherine hogarth on the 2nd of April in that year the original of a very different facsimile -lrb- no 9 -rrb- be write as a receipt in the account-book of messr chapman and hall for a advance of # 5 -lrb- illustration : no 9 -- write in 1837 -rrb- the six facsimile number 9 to 15 deserve special notice the original be all write in the year 1837 and i have purposely show they because they extraordinary variation entirely negative the popular idea about the uniformity of dickens 's handwriting and because these mobile hand-gesture be a striking illustration of the mobility and great sensibility to impression which be prominent feature in charle dickens 's nature -lrb- illustration : no 10 -- write in 1837 -rrb- common observation show we that a man whose mind be specially receptive of impression from person and thing around he and whose sensibility be very quick can scarcely fail to show much variation in he own form of outward expression -- such for example as facial play voice-inflection hand-gesture and so on notice the originality in the position of the flourish show in no 9 and compare the ungraceful movement of it with the much more dignified and please flourish in some of the later signature a whimsical originality of mind come out also in the

the pickwick papers ' and which after a preamble contain the word : whereas the say charle dickens be the author of a book or work intitule ` the posthumous papers of the pickwick club ' which have be recently print and publish in twenty part or number etc it be probable that the fact of the seal be place between _ charle _ and _ dickens _ prevent the flourish which almost invariably accompany he signature on business document the marked enlargement of this signature take the place of the flourish and show a unconscious emphasis of the _ ego _ it would be almost unreasonable for we to expect that so impressionable a man who be also feel he power and fame could abstain from show outward sign of he own consciousness of abnormal success yet in the private letter of dickens the simple c d be very frequent a few example of it be give in this article and they present number in no way represent the numerical relation of these simple signature to the more showy one it may at once be say that this point of difference be alike interesting to the student of gesture and to the student of dickens 's character he be certainly a very able man of business and the wording of he business letter fully bear out the idea convey by he business signature -- so to speak -- that dickens be fully aware of he own power and that quite fairly he do not omit to impress the fact upon other people when he think fit both the wording and the signature of many of he private letter be simple and unostentatious to a high degree this curious fact which be now illustrate by charle dickens 's own hand-gesture

man 's written-gesture \* \* \* \* \* note : -- consideration of space and of the avoidance of technicality have prevent a really full account of the write gesture of charle dickens scanty as the foregoing account be the illustration it contain could not have be supply by any one collector of charle dickens 's letter i express my sincere gratitude to the many person who have enable I to give these illustration and only regret that one collector refuse my request for the loan of some very early and interesting letter jh \* \* \* \* \* _ the mirror _ by george japy -lrb- illustration -rrb- it have always be say that the japanese be the french of the orient be that as it may it be very clear that in certain trait which characterize the french there be no resemblance whatever between the people of those two nation almost as soon as a french baby -lrb- a girl be it understand -rrb- be bear its first instinct be to stretch out its tiny hand for a mirror in which to admire its beautiful little face and its graceful movement this natural and we may say inborn taste grow with the child 's growth and ere the fair girl have reach she seventeenth year she ideal of perfect bliss be to find herself in a room with mirror on every side there be indeed a room in the palace of versaille which be the elysium of the frenchwoman it be a long room with looking-glass from ceiling to floor and the say floor be polish so that it reflect at any rate the shadow of the foot now in the little japanese village of yowcuskus a looking-glass be a unheard-of thing and girl do not even know what they look like except on hear the description which they lover give they of they personal beauty -lrb- which description by-the-bye be sometimes slightly bias accord as the lover be more or less devoted -rrb- -lrb- illustration : he pick up one day in the street a small pocket hand-mirror -rrb- now it happen that a young japanese whose daily work be to pull along those light carriage such as be see at the last paris exhibition pick up one day in the street a small pocket hand-mirror probably drop by some english lady-tourist on she travels in that part of the world it be of course the first time in he life that kiki-tsum have ever gaze on such a thing he look carefully at it and to he intense astonishment see the image of a brown face with dark intelligent eye and a look of awestruck wonderment express on its feature kiki-tsum drop on he knee and gaze earnestly at the object he hold in he hand he whisper it be my sainted father how could he portrait have come here be it perhaps a warning of some kind for I he carefully fold the precious treasure up in he handkerchief and put it in the large pocket of he loose blouse when he go home that night he hide it away carefully in a vase which be scarcely ever touch as he do not know of any safer place in which to deposit it he say nothing of the adventure to he young wife for as he say to himself woman be curious and then too _ sometimes _ they be give to talk and kiki-tsum feel that it be too reverent a matter to be discuss by neighbor this finding of he dead father 's portrait in the street for some day kiki-tsum be in a great state of excitement he be think of the portrait all the time and at interval he would leave he work and suddenly appear at home to take a furtive look at he treasure -lrb- illustration : always with the same solemn expression -rrb- now in japan as in other country mysterious action and irregular proceedings of all kind have to be explain to a wife lili-tsee do not understand why she husband keep appear at all hour of the day certainly he kiss she every time he come in like this at first she be satisfy with he explanation when he tell she that he only run in for a minute to see she pretty face she think it be really quite natural on he part but when day after day he appear and always with the same solemn expression on he face she begin to wonder in she heart of heart whether he be tell she the whole truth and so lili-tsee fall to watch she husband 's movement and she notice that he never go away until he have be alone in the little room at the back of the house -lrb- illustration : what be it she see -rrb- now the japanese woman be as persevere as any other when there be a mystery to be discover and so lili-tsee set herself to discover this mystery she hunt day after day to see if she could find some trace of anything in that little room which be at all unusual but she find nothing one day however she happen to come in suddenly and see she husband replace the long blue vase in which she keep she rose leave in order to dry they he make some excuse about its not look very steady and appear to be just set it right and lili-tsee pretend there be nothing out of the common in he put the vase straight the moment he have go out of the house though she be up on a stool like lightning and in a moment she have fish the looking-glass out of the vase she take it carefully in she hand wonder whatever it could be but when she look in it the terrible truth be clear what be it she see why the portrait of a woman and she have believe that kiki-tsum be so good and so fond and so true she grief be at first too deep for any word she just sit down on the floor with the terrible portrait in she lap and rock herself backwards and forwards this then be why she husband come home so many time in the day it be to look at the portrait of the woman she have just see suddenly a fit of anger seize she and she gaze at the glass again the same face look at she but she wonder how she husband could admire such a face so wicked do the dark eye look : there be a expression in they that she certainly have not see the first time she have look at it and it terrify she so much that she make up she mind not to look at it again she have no heart however for anything and do not even make any attempt to prepare a meal for she husband she just go on sit there on the floor nurse the portrait and at the same time she wrath when later on kiki-tsum arrive he be surprise to find nothing ready for they evening meal and no wife he walk through to the other room and be not long leave in ignorance of the cause of the unusual state of thing so this be the love you profess for I this be the way in which you treat I before we have even be marry a year what do you mean lili-tsee ask she husband in consternation thinking that he poor wife have take leave of she sens what do i mean what do you mean i should think the idea of you keep portrait in my rose-leaf vase here take it and treasure it for i do not want it the wicked wicked woman and here poor lili-tsee burst out cry i can not understand say she bewildered husband oh you can not she say laugh hysterically i can though well enough you like that hideous villainous-looking woman better than you own true wife i would say nothing if she be at any rate beautiful but she have a vile face a hideous face and look wicked and murderous and everything that be bad lili-tsee what do you mean ask she husband get exasperated in he turn that portrait be the living image of my poor dead father i find it in the street the other day and put it in you vase for safety lili-tsee 's eye flash with indignation at this apparently barefaced lie hear he she almost scream he want to tell I now that i do not know a woman 's face from a man 's kiki-tsum be wild with indignation and a quarrel begin in good earnest the street-door be a little way open and the loud angry word attract the notice of a _ bonze _ -lrb- one of the japanese priest -rrb- who happen to be pass my child he say put he head in at the door why this unseemly anger why this dispute father say kiki-tsum my wife be mad all woman be so my son more or less interrupted the holy _ bonze _ you be wrong to expect perfection and must abide by you bargain now it be no use get angry all wife be trial but what she say be a lie it be not father exclaim lili-tsee my husband have the portrait of a woman and i find it hidden in my rose-leaf vase i swear that i have no portrait but that of my poor dead father explain the aggrieved husband my child my child say the holy _ bonze _ majestically show I the portrait here it be there be only one but it be one too many say lili-tsee sarcastically the _ bonze _ take the glass and look at it earnestly he then bow low before it and in a altered tone say : my child settle you quarrel and live peaceably together you be both in the wrong this portrait be that of a saintly and venerable _ bonze _ i know not how you could mistake so holy a face i must take it from you and place it amongst the precious relic of we church so say the _ bonze _ lift he hand to bless the husband and wife and then go slowly away carry with he the glass which have work such mischief end -lrb- illustration -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* _ handcuffs _ write and illustrate by inspector maurice moser _ late of the criminal investigation department great scotland yard _ the ordinary connection of idea between handcuffs and policeman do not need very acute mental power to grasp but there be a further connection a philological one which be only evident at first sight to those who have make a small acquaintance with the science of word the word handcuff be a popular corruption of the anglo-saxon handcop _ ie _ that which cop or catch the hand now one of the most common of the many slang expression use by they special enemy towards the police be copper -- _ ie _ he who cop the offend member strange as it may seem handcuffs be by no mean the invention of these time which insist on make the life of a prisoner so devoid of the picturesque and romantic we must go back past the dark age past the stir time of greek and roman antiquity till we come to those blissful mythological age when every tree and every stream be the home of some kindly god in those olden day there dwell in the carpathian sea a wily old deity know by the name of proteus possess the gift of prophecy the fruit of which he selfishly deny to mankind even if those who wish to consult he be so fortunate as to find he all they effort to force he to exert he gift of prophecy be useless for he be endowed with the power of change himself into all thing and he elude they grasp by become a flame of fire or a drop of water there be one thing however against which all the miracle of proteus be of no avail and of this aristus be aware so aristus come as virgil tell we from a distant land to consult the famous prophet he find he on the sea-shore among he seal bask in the afternoon sun quick as think he fit handcuffs on he and all struggle and device be now of no avail such be then the efficacy of handcuffs even on the person of the immortal god have establish this remote and honorable antiquity we be not surprise at the appearance of handcuffs in the fourth century bc when the soldier of a conquering greek army find among the baggage of the route carthaginian several chariot full of handcuffs which have be hold ready in confident anticipation of a great victory and a multitude of prisoner the nearest approach to a mention that we find after that be in the book of psalm : to bind they king in chain and they noble in fetter of iron but in the greek the latin wickliffe 's and anglo-saxon bible we invariably find a word of which handcuffs be the only real translation it be also interesting to note that in the anglo-saxon version the king be bind in footcop and the noble in handcop in the early saxon time therefore we find we instrument be familiar to all and in general use as it have continue to be to this day but during the fifteenth and sixteenth century there be no instance of the use of the word handcop its place be take by swivel manacle and shackbolt the latter word be often use by elizabethan author handcuffs like other thing have improve with time up to 1850 there be two kind in general use in england one of the form most common in the earlier part of this century go under the name of the figure 8 this instrument do not allow the prisoner even that small amount of liberty which be grant by its modern counterpart it be chiefly use for refractory prisoner who resort to violence for it have the advantage of keep the hand in a fix position either before or on the back of the body the pain it inflict make it partake of the nature of a punishment rather than merely a preventive against resistance or attack it be a punishment too which be universally dread by prisoner of all kind for there be no more unbearable pain than that of have a limb immovably confine -lrb- illustration : no 1 -- the flexible -rrb- the other kind of form know as the flexible -lrb- no 1 -rrb- resemble in general outline the handcuffs use every day by detective contrivance chiefly the result of american ingenuity for the rapid and effectual secure of prisoner have not be want and among they the snap the nipper -lrb- no 3 -rrb- and the twister must be mention -lrb- illustration : no 2 -- the snap -rrb- -lrb- illustration : no 3 -- nipper -rrb- -lrb- illustration : no 4 -- the twister -rrb- the snap -lrb- no 2 -rrb- be the one which use to be the most approve of it consist of two loop of which the smaller be slip on the wrist of the person to be arrest the bar be then close with a snap and the larger loop be hold by the officer the manner in which the twister -lrb- no 4 -rrb- be use savor very much of the brutal and indeed the injury it inflict on those who be misguided enough to struggle when in its grasp cause its abolition in great britain its simplicity and its efficacy together with the cruelty have recommend it for use in those wild part of south america where the upholder of the law literally travel with he life in he hand it consist of a chain with handle at each end the chain be put round the wrist the handle bring together and twist round until the chain grip firmly the torture inflict by inhuman or inconsiderate officer can easily be imagine when we see the comparative facility with which the detective slip the handcuffs on the villain in the last act of adelphi drama we be apt to be mislead as to the difficulty which police officer meet with in the execution of one of the most arduous part of they duty the english hand-cuff -lrb- no 1 -rrb- be heavy unwieldy awkward machine which at the best of time and under the most favourable circumstance be extremely difficult of application they weigh over a pound and have to be unlock with a key in a manner not greatly differ from the operation of wind up the average eight-day clock and fasten on to the prisoner 's wrist how the fate and good luck only know this lengthy difficult and particularly disagreeable operation with a prisoner struggle and fight be to a degree almost incredible the prisoner practically have to be overpower or to submit before he can be finally and certainly secure even when handcuff we present to a clever and muscular ruffian one of the most formidable weapon of offence he could possibly possess as he can and frequently do inflict the deadliest blow upon he captor another great drawback be the fact that these handcuffs do not fit all wrist and often the officer be nonplussed by have a pair of handcuffs which be too small or too large and when the latter be the case and the prisoner get the bracelet in he hand instead of on he wrist he be then in possession of a knuckle-duster from which the bravest would not care to receive a blow on the occasion of my arrest one of the russian rouble note forger a ruffian who would not hesitate to stick at anything i have provide myself with several size pair of handcuffs and it be not until i have obtain the very much need assistance that i be able to find the suitable darby for he wrist we manage to force he into a four-wheeler to take he to the police-station when he again renew he effort and savagely attack I lift he ironed wrist and

-lrb- no 5 and 6 -rrb- and be lighter less clumsy and more easily conceal find general favor among the officer at scotland yard in fact such be its advantage that we must presume that it differ considerably from the anglo-saxon hand-cop and the somewhat primitive article use upon the unwilling prophet of the carpathian sea this and the older kind to which some of the more conservative of we detective still adhere be the only handcuffs use in england -lrb- illustration : no 7 -- la ligote -rrb- the ingenious detective of france where crime and all its appurtenance have reach such a state

whip-cords twine together and they be use much in the same way as the twister any attempt to escape be quickly end by the pain to which the officer who hold the instrument can inflict by a mere turn of he hand one wrist only be under control but as the slightest sign of a struggle be meet by a infliction of torture the french system be more effective than the english -lrb- illustration : no 8 --

origin -lrb- illustration : no 10 -- la corde -rrb- no 10 show a effective method of handcuff in emergency the officer take a piece of whipcord and make a double run knot : he tie one noose round the wrist of the prisoner whose hand be then place in he trousers pocket the cord be lash round the body like a belt and bring back and slip through the noose again the prisoner when thus secure suffer no inconvenience as long as he leave he hand in he pocket but any attempt to remove it would cause a deal of suffering -lrb- illustration : no 11 -- menotte double -rrb- no 11 be another handcuff of foreign make and be merely use when a raid be about to be make as it allow to a certain extent the use of the hand it be useful for prisoner who be be convey by sea -lrb- illustration : no 12 -- eastern handcuff -rrb- no 12 be mostly use in eastern europe my personal experience of handcuffs be small because i dislike they for in addition to they clumsiness i know that when i have lay my hand upon my man it will be difficult for he to escape my intimate knowledge of all kind of criminal in all kind of plight justify I in say that when they see the game be up they do not attempt resistance the only trouble i have have have be with desperado and old offender man who have once taste prison-life and have a horror of return to captivity expert thief have be know to open handcuffs without a key by means of knock the part contain the spring on a stone or hard substance it will be remember that when the notorious criminal charle peace be be take to london by train he contrived although handcuff to make he escape through the carriage window when he be capture it be notice that he have free one of he hand i be once bring from leith a austrian sailor who be charge with rip open he mate and as i consider that i have a disagreeable character to deal with i handcuff he naturally he find the confinement irksome and on we journey he repeatedly implore I to take they off promise that he would make no attempt to escape the sincerity of he manner touch I and i release he very fortunately for myself for i be take ill before reach london and strange as it may appear be nurse most tenderly by the man who have rip a fellow mate in belgium the use of handcuffs by police officer be entirely forbid prisoner be handcuff only on be bring before the _ juge d'instruction _ or _ procureur du roi _ and when cross from court to court woman be never handcuff in england but on the continent it be not a uncommon occurrence regard handcuffs generally in my opinion not one of the invention i have mention now in use be sufficiently easy of application what every officer in the detective force feel he want be a light portable instrument by means of which he can unaided secure he man however cunning and however powerful he may be i myself suggest a application which would grip the criminal tightly across the back imprison the arm just above the elbow joint such a instrument would cause he no unnecessary pain while relieve officer from that part of they duty which be particularly obnoxious to they viz have a prolonged struggle with low and savage ruffian i can not refrain

profound sympathy all who know he pity he order flow in and soon a quite exceptional activity pervade the establishment from basement to roof inspiring mon sauvallier with a little hope but one persistent fear disturb he sleep and trouble he waking hour it be that some day he might hear that camille have be gamble again and be once more in debt he have forbid all mention of he err son but the thought of he be ever present and lay like a incubus upon he heart one year pass then another the foundry still flourish work positively rage therein it have no rest it also as though endowed with a conscience do its duty nobly its furnace glow like ardent eye its mighty puffing and snort shake the ground : the molten metal red and fume flow from its crucible like blood from its body at a early hour of the morning be hear its piercing summons to the work-people and all the night long its glare illuminate the sky iii the campaign of tonquin be in full swing in the midst of a unknown country harass by innumerable difficulty the french soldier be contend painfully with a irrepressible ever-rallying foe the smallest success serve to excite the popular patriotism and all await impatiently the tiding of a decisive victory one morning auguste look very pale enter he father 's office and hand he a newspaper there amongst latest intelligence mon sauvallier read the following : -- -lrb-

gallant officer bear by two man succeed in rally he company and lead they on to the assault he conduct be admirable but he condition be hopeless i have attach the cross to he breast this brilliant feat of arm will enable I to enter lang-son tomorrow -- general briere de l'isle upon read these word mon sauvallier feel a strange emotion in which anguish mingle with joy for a moment he be silent then he say to he son you think that it be he he be then a captain he read the despatch again then murmur softly : the cross condition hopeless and a tear roll down he cheek two hour later the family receive a formal intimation of camille 's deed and state from the minister of war and on the follow day all the journal be praise captain sauvallier son of the respect founder of grenelle and now they give detail camille it appear have be nominate captain a few month back throughout the campaign he have distinguish himself by he imperturbable coolness under fire and reckless scorn of the death which he seem to seek he act of heroic energy stir the enthusiasm of press and populace and the name of sauvallier be on every lip camille 's portrait appear in the shop-window the illustrated journal depict he before the redoubt carry upon the shoulder of two man he sword point towards the enemy encourage he soldier by he voice gesture and look he forehead bind with a handkerchief and he face bleed mon sauvallier could not go out of door without see he son 's presentment from the news-stall of the boulevard the corner of the street the publisher ' shop-front a ubiquitous camille watch he pass and seem to follow he with he eye almost at each step the father receive congratulation while complimentary letter and card cover he table to overflow but alas the telegram which he receive daily from tonquin leave he little hope that he should ever again behold in the flesh this dear son of whom now he be so proud -lrb- illustration : here he be -rrb- one morning three month later mon sauvallier be at work in he office when the door open softly and disclose andre 's curly head the little one seem in high spirit she eye sparkle with glee see grandfather here he be she say and lead into the room captain sauvallier auguste and he wife follow the pair mon sauvallier take completely by surprise rise quickly from he chair then stand motionless overcome by he emotion he see before he camille with the scar upon he forehead and the cross upon he breast -- camille the hero of the hour who have shed such lustre upon the family name timid and embarrassed like a child who have be guilty of a fault camille stand with bow head and when he see how much he father have age he know that it be he conduct which have work the sad change and he contrition be deepen tenfold but as he be about to throw himself at he father 's foot mon sauvallier with a sudden movement clasp he to he breast exclaim in a voice full of tear no camille in my arm in my arm father and son lock together in closest embrace mingled they sob while auguste and he wife look on weep in sympathy the silence be break by andre the child have vanish for a moment but speedily reappear fondle she precious doll which it be needless to say have not be sell hold it out to the captain she say in she liveliest manner : here be jeanne uncle you remember she give she a kiss directly do not you think that she have grow \* \* \* \* \* _ the queer side of thing -- among the freak _ major microbe -lrb- illustration -rrb- i have be in the show business now go on for forty-three year say the doorkeeper and i have not yet find a dwarf with human feeling i can not understand why it be but there be not the least manner of doubt that a dwarf be the meanest object in creation take general bacillus the dwarf i have with I now he be well make for a dwarf and when he do he pose plastic such as ` ajax defy the lightning ' or ` samson carry off delilah by the hair ' and all the rest of those scripture tablow he be as pretty as a picture provide of course you do not get too near he he be healthy and have a good appetite and he draw a good salary and have no one except himself to look after and yet that dwarf be not happy on the contrary he be the most discontented cantankerous malicious little wretch that be ever admit into a moral family show and he be not much worse than a ordinary dwarf now the other freak as a rule be contented so long as they draw well and do not fall in love the living skeleton know that he can not expect to live long -- most of they die at about thirty-five -- but for all that he be happy and contented ' a short life and a merry one be what i go in for ' he often say to I and he seem to think that he life be a merry one though i can not myself see where the merriment come in so with all the rest of my people they all seem to enjoy themselves except the dwarf my own belief be that the organ of happiness have get to be pretty big to get its work in and that there be not room in a dwarf head for it to work i have a dwarf with I once -- major microbe be what we call he on the bill where he be advertise as the ` smallest man in the world ' which of course he be not but then every dwarf be always advertise that way it be a custom of the profession and we do not consider it to be lie any more than a president consider the tough statement lie that he make in he annual message a showman and a politician must be allow a little liberty of statement or they could not carry on they business well as i be say thishyer major microbe be in my show a matter of ten year ago when we be in cincinnatus and he be about as vicious as they make they the giant who be a good seven-footer work up to seven and a half foot as a engineer might say with the help of he boot and helmet be the exact opposite of the dwarf in disposition he be altogether too good-tempered for he be always try to play practical joke on the other freak he do this without any notion of annoy they but it be injudicious he be like all other giant weak and brittle what do i mean by brittle why i mean brittle and nothing else it be a good united state word i reckon thishyer giant 's bone be not make of the proper material and they be always liable to break he have to take the greatest care of himself and to avoid argue on politics or religion or anything like that for a kick on the shin would be sure to break one of he leg which would lay he on the shelf for a couple of month as for he arm he be for ever break one or two of they but that do not so much matter for he could go on the stage with he arm in splint and a sling and the public always suppose that he be represent a heroic soldier who have just return from the battle-field -lrb- illustration : he find the dwarf asleep on a bench -rrb- one day the giant put up a job on the dwarf that afterwards get they both into serious trouble the giant be loaf around the place after dinner and he find the dwarf asleep on a bench what do he do but cover he up with a rug and then go off in search of the fat woman who be a sure enough fat woman and weigh in private life four hundred and nineteen pound the giant be popular with the sex and the fat woman be glad to accept he invitation to come with he and listen to a scheme that he pretend to have for increase the attraction of fat woman he lead she up to where the dwarf be asleep on the bench and invite she to sit down say that he have arrange a cushion for she to make she comfortable of course she sit down and sit down pretty solid too directly on the dwarf the dwarf yell as if he have room for the voice of two full-grown man and the fat woman as soon as she feel something squirm under she thought that one of the boa constrictor have get loose and that she have sit down on it so naturally she faint away i come run in with one of my man as soon as i hear the outcry and after a while we manage to pry up the fat woman with a couple of cart-rung and get the dwarf out from under she after which she come to in due time and get over she fright but the dwarf be a good deal flatten out by the pressure and i be afraid at first that he rib have be stove in it turn out in the end that he be not seriously injured but he be in the worst rage against the giant that you can imagine and would have kill he then and there if he have be able to do it i know well enough that in course of time the dwarf would get square with the giant no matter how long it might take and how much it might cost he be as revengeful as a red indian i warn the giant that he must keep a sharp look-out or the dwarf would do he a mischief but he say ` he calculate he be big enough to take care of himself and that he be not afraid of no two-foot dwarf that ever breathe ' of course this sound brave but my own belief be that the giant be pretty badly frightened i notice that he never allow himself to be alone with the dwarf and be always careful to mind where he step so as not to get trip up by string stretch across the path or anything of that sort the dwarf pretend that he have forget the whole business and be as friendly with the giant as he have ever be but i know he well enough to know that he never forget anything and be only wait for a chance -lrb- illustration : he helmet have fall into a tub of water -rrb- pretty soon little accident begin to happen to the giant one day he would find that he helmet which be make of pasteboard have fall into a tub of water and go to everlasting jelly this would oblige he to show himself bare-headed which take off several inch from he professional height another day he boot would be in the tub and he would not be able to get they on i have see he go on the stage in a general 's uniform with carpet slipper and no hat which everyone know must be contrary to the regulation of the arabian army in which he be suppose to hold he commission one night he bedstead break down under he and he come very near break a leg or so in the morning he find out that someone have saw a leg of the bedstead nearly all the way through and of course he know that the dwarf have do it but you could not prove anything against the dwarf he would always swear that he never have any hand in the accident and there be never any evidence against he that anybody could get hold of i do not mind what game he play on the giant as long as the giant be not make to break anything that would lay he on the shelf and i tell the dwarf that i be the last man to interfere with any man 's innocent amusement but that in case the giant happen to break a leg i should go out of the giant and dwarf business at once but that do not scare he a particle he know that he be worth he salary in any dime museum in america and more than that he have money enough lay up in the bank to live on assume of course that he could draw it out before the cashier should bolt to canada with it so he be as independent as you please and tell I that if i choose to hold he responsible for other people 's leg he could not help it and have nothing to say about it at that time i have a female samson she be not the combined female contortionist and strongest woman in the world that be in my show at present but she be in about the same line of business these strong woman be all genuine you understand you can embellish they a little on the handbill and you can announce that the cannon that the strong woman fire from she shoulder weigh a hundred or two pound more than it actually weigh but unless a strong woman be really strong and no mistake she might as well try to pass herself off as a living skeleton or a two-headed girl at once the fact be the great majority of freak be genuine and the business be a thoroughly honest one at bottom why if you tell the exact truth in the handbill about every freak in my show bar the tattooed girl and the wild man they would still constitute a good drawing attraction in any intelligent community this female samson be a good sort of woman in she way though she be a little rough and a bit what you might call masculine in she way she do not like the dwarf and he do not like she -lrb- illustration : she pull he over to she by he collar -rrb- the freak be all at supper one night when the dwarf say something insulting to the female samson he sit right opposite to she and she just reach across the table and pull he over to she by he collar then she stretch he across she lap and lay into he with she slipper till he howl as if he be a small boy who have go in swimming on Sunday and he mother have just find it out it be not so much the slipper that hurt he though the female samson put all she muscle into the operation but it be the disgrace of the thing and when you remember that the dwarf be forty-two year old you can understand that he feel that the woman have take a liberty with he however the next day he seem to have forget all about it and when the giant remind he of the circumstance which he do every little while the dwarf would grin and say that we must let the woman do what they like for they be a superior sort of be one of the female samson 's best feat be do in company with the dwarf and the giant she have a horizontal bar fix on the stage about ten foot above the floor on this bar she use to swing head downward just hook she knee around it as all the trapeze artist do it look sort of uncomfortable but it be nothing when you be use to it i have a trapeze chap once who would often go to sleep that way in hot weather he say that all the blood in he body go into he head and that make he feel sleepy while it cool off he body and leg there be no accounting for taste but as for I give I a good bed where i can stretch out and i 'll never ask to sleep on a trapeze bar as i be say the female samson would swing on this bar and then she would take the dwarf 's belt in she tooth and hold he in that way for five minute there be a swivel in the belt so that the dwarf would spin round while she be hold he which he do not like much but which please the public after she have swing the dwarf she would do the same act with the giant she have to be very careful not to drop the giant for he be terribly afraid of break a leg be as i have say particularly brittle but she always say that he be as safe in she tooth as he would be if he be lie in he bed it must have be about a fortnight after the dwarf be sit on by the fat woman and a week or more after he have be correct in public by the female samson that we have a unusually large evening audience and everybody be in excellent spirit the female samson have swing the dwarf in she tooth and after she have let go of he he have climb up on a chair just behind she and stand with he arm stretch out over she and the giant as if he be say ` bless you my child ' which be a regular part of the act and never fail to bring he a round of applause and induce people to say ` what a jolly little chap that dwarf be ' when the female samson have get a good grip of the giant 's belt and have raise he about five foot from the floor the dwarf lean a little bit forward and run a pin into the female samson 's ankle or thereabout nobody see he do it but it be easy to prove it on he afterwards for he drop the pin on the floor when he have finally get through with it and everybody recognize it as one of he scarf-pin the woman would naturally have shriek when she feel the pin but she have she mouth full of the giant and she could not do more than mumble a little in a half-smothered sort of way the dwarf pay no attention to that but give she another eye-opener with the pin it go in about a inch judge from what the female samson say when she describe she suffering and it must have hurt she pretty bad but she be full of pluck and bind to carry out she performance to the end she stand three or four more prod and then not be able to stand it any longer without express she feeling in some way she unhook one leg and fetch the dwarf a kick on the side of the head that remind he that it be about time for he to get into he own room and lock the door and convinced he that there be not a bit of exaggeration in the tough story that they tell about the kick power of a army mule the kick send the dwarf clean across the platform and the people not understand the situation begin to cry ` shame ' whether this flurry the female samson or not or whether she lose she balance entirely on account of have unhook one leg i do not know what i do know be that she slip off the bar and she and the giant strike the floor with a crash that would have break plank if it have not be that the platform be build expressly to stand the strain of the fat woman it would not have be so bad if she have just drop the giant and hang on to the bar herself in that case he would probably have break he left leg and arm and collar bone just as he do break they but he rib would have be all right as it be the female samson 's head come down just in the center of he and stove in about three-fourth of he rib she be not hurt at all for be a woman and fall on she head there be nothing for she to break and the giant be so soft that fall on he do not even give she a headache when some volunteer from the audience have pick up the giant and put he on a stretcher and carry he to the hospital where the doctor do they best to mend he the female samson have a chance to explain and the finding of a long scarf-pin on the platform just under the bar be evidence that she have tell the truth and corroborate the red stain on she stock -lrb- illustration : it take four man and a policeman to hold she -rrb- it take four man and a policeman to hold she and get she lock up in she room she be that set on tear the dwarf into small piece and she would have do it too if she could have get at he he have sense enough to see the situation and to discharge himself without wait for I to discharge he he run away in the course of the night and i never see he again i do not think he ever go into another dime museum and i have hear that he get a situation as inspector of gas meter which be very probable consider what a malicious little rascal he be well we have to deal with all sort of people in we business and i suppose it be the same with you though you have not mention what you business be but you take my advice and steer clear of dwarf there be not a man living that can do anything with they except with a club and no man like to take a club to anything as small as a dwarf w l alden \* \* \* \* \* _ lamp of all kind and time _ -lrb- illustration -rrb- -lrb-
