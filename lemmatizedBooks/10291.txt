the future what be come the war that will end war the world set free in the day of the comet and a modern utopia 1918 preface in the latter half of 1914 a few of we be write that this war be a war of idea a phrase the war to end war get into circulation amidst much sceptical comment it be a phrase powerful enough to sway many man essentially pacifist towards take a active part in the war against german imperialism but it be a phrase whose chief content be its aspiration people be already write in those early day of disarmament and of the abolition of the armament industry throughout the world they realize fully the element of industrial belligerency behind the shine armor of imperialism and they denounce the krupp-kaiser alliance but against such writing and such thought we have to count in those day great and powerful reality even to those who express these idea there lay visibly upon they the shadow of impracticability they be very advanced idea in 1914 very utopian against they be a unbroken mass of mental habit and public tradition while we talk of this war to end war the diplomatist of the power ally against germany be busily spin a disastrous web of greedy secret treaty be answer aggression by scheme of aggression be see in the treacherous violence of germany only the justification for countervail evil act to they it be only another war for ascendancy that be three year and a half ago and since then this war of idea have go on to a phase few of we have dare hope for in those open day the russian revolution put a match to that pile of secret treaty and indeed to all the imperialist plan of the ally in the end it will burn they all the greatest of the western ally be now the united state of america and the american have come into this war simply for a idea three year and a half ago a few of we be say this be a war against the idea of imperialism not german imperialism merely but british and french and russian imperialism and we be say this not because it be so but because we hope to see it become so to-day we can say so because now it be so in those day moreover we say this be the war to end war and we still do not know clearly how we think in term of treaty and alliance it be largely the detachment and practical genius of the great english-speaking nation across the atlantic that have carry the world on beyond and replace that phrase by the phrase the league of nation a phrase suggest plainly the organization of a sufficient instrument by which war may be end for ever in 1913 talk of a world league of nation would have seem to the extremest pitch utopian to-day the project have a air not only of be so practicable but of be so urgent and necessary and so manifestly the sane thing before mankind that not to be busy upon it not to be make it more widely known and better understand not to be work out its problem and bring it about be to be live outside of the contemporary life of the world for a book upon any other subject at the present time some apology may be necessary but a book upon this subject be as natural a thing to produce now as a pair of skate in winter when the ice begin to bear all we writer find ourselves engage perforce in some part or other of a world-wide propaganda of this the most creative and hopeful of political idea that have ever dawn upon the consciousness of mankind with no concerted plan we feel call upon to serve it and in no connection would one so like to think oneself un-original as in this connection it would be a dismaying thing to realize that one be write anything here which be not the possible thought of great multitude of other people and capable of become the common thought of mankind one write in such a book as this not to express oneself but to swell a chorus the idea of the league of nation be so great a one that it may well override the pretension and command the allegiance of king much more do it claim the self-subjugation of the journalistic writer we innumerable book upon this great edifice of a world peace do not constitute a scramble for attention but a attempt to express in every variety of phrase and aspect this one system of idea which now possess we all in the same way the elementary fact and idea of the science of chemistry might conceivably be put completely and fully into one text-book but as a matter of fact it be far more convenient to tell that same story over in a thousand different form in a text-book for boy here for a different sort or class of boy there for adult student for reference for people expert in mathematics for people unused to the scientific method and so on for the last year the writer have be do what he can -- and a number of other writer have be do what they can -- to bring about a unite declaration of all the atlantic ally in favor of a league of nation and to define the necessary nature of that league he have in the course of this work write a series of article upon the league and upon _ the necessary sacrifice of preconception _ that the idea involve in the london press he have also be try to clear he own mind upon the real meaning of that ambiguous word democracy for which the league be to make the world safe the bulk of this book be make up of these discussion for a very considerable number of reader it may be well to admit here it can have no possible interest they will have come at these question themselves from different angle and they will have long since get to they own conclusion but there may be other whose angle of approach may be similar to the writer 's who may have ask some or most of the question he have have to ask and who may be actively interested in the answer and the work out of the answer he have make to these question for they this book be print h g well _ may _ 1918 it be a dangerous thing to recommend specific book out of so large and various a literature as the league of nation idea have already produce but the reader who wish to reach beyond the range of this book or who do not like its tone and method will probably find something to meet he need and taste better in marburg 's league of nation a straightforward account of the american side of the movement by the former united state minister in belgium on the one hand or in the conclude part of mr fayle 's great settlement -lrb- 1915 -rrb- a frankly sceptical treatment from the british imperialist point of view on the other a illuminating discussion advocate peace treaty rather than a league be sir walter phillimore 's three century of treaty two excellent book from america that chance to be on my table be mr goldsmith 's league to enforce peace and a world in ferment by president nichola murray butler mater 's société des nation -lrb- didier -rrb- be a able presentation of a french point of view brailsford 's a league of nation be already a classic of the movement in england and a very full and thorough book and hobson 's towards international government be a very sympathetic contribution from the english liberal left but the reader must understand that these two writer seem disposed to welcome a peace with a unrevolutionized germany a idea to which in common with most british people i be bitterly oppose walsh 's world rebuilt be a good exhortation and mugge 's parliament of man be fresh and sane and able the omnivorous reader will find good sense and quaint english in judge mejdell 's _ jus gentium _ publish in english by olsen 's of christianium there be a active league of nation society in dublin as well as the london and washington one publish pamphlet and conduct propaganda all these book and pamphlet i have name happen to lie upon my study table as i write but i have make no systematic effort to get together literature upon the subject and probably there be just as many book as good of which i have never even hear there must i be sure be statement of the league of nation idea forthcoming from various religious standpoint but i do not know any sufficiently well to recommend they it be incredible that neither the roman catholic church the english episcopal church nor any nonconformist body have make any effort as a organization to forward this essentially religious end of peace on earth and also there must be german writings upon this same topic i mention these diverse source not in order to present a bibliography but because i should be sorry to have the reader think that this little book pretend to state _ the _ case rather than _ a _ case for the league of nation contents i the way to concrete realization ii the league must be representative iii the necessary power of the league iv the labor view of middle africa v get the league idea clear in relation to imperialism vi the war aim of the western ally compactly state vii the future of monarchy viii the plain necessity for a league ix democracy x the recent struggle for proportional representation in great britain xi the study and propaganda of democracy in the fourth year the league of free nation i the way to concrete realization more and more frequently do one hear this phrase the league of nation use to express the outline idea of the new world that will come out of the war there can be no doubt that the phrase have take hold of the imagination of great multitude of people : it be one of those creative phrase that may alter the whole destiny of mankind but as yet it be still a very vague phrase a cloudy promise of peace i make no apology therefore for cast my discussion of it in the most general term the idea be the idea of unite human effort to put a end to war the first practical question that must precede all other be how far can we hope to get to a concrete realization of that but first let I note the fourth word in the second title of this book the common talk be of a league of nation merely i follow the man who be more than any other man the leader of english political thought throughout the world to-day president wilson in insert that significant adjective free we western ally know to-day what be involve in make bargain with government that do not stand for they people we have have all we russian deal for example repudiate and thrust back upon we hand and it be clearly in he mind as it must be in the mind of all reasonable man that no mere scrap of paper with just a monarch 's or a chancellor 's endorsement be a good enough earnest of fellowship in the league it can not be a diplomatist 's league the league of nation if it be to have any such effect as people seem to hope from it must be in the first place understand of the people it must be support by sustained deliberate explanation and by teaching in school and church and press of the whole mass of all the people concerned i underline the adjective free here to set aside once for all any possible misconception that this modern idea of a league of nation have any affinity to that holy alliance of the diplomatist which set out to keep the peace of europe so disastrously a century ago later i will discuss the power of the league but before i come to that i would like to say a little about the more general question of its nature and authority what sort of gathering will embody it the suggestion make range from a mere advisory body rather like the hague convention which will merely pronounce on the rights and wrong of any international conflict to the idea of a sort of super-state a parliament of mankind a super national authority practically take over the sovereignty of the exist state and empire of the world most people 's idea of the league fall between these extreme they want the league to be something more than a ethical court they want a league that will act but on the other hand they shrink from any loss of we independence there seem to be a conflict here there be a real need for many people to tidy up they idea at this point we can not have we cake and eat it if association be worth while there must be some sacrifice of freedom to association as a very distinguished colonial representative say to I the other day : here we be talk of the freedom of small nation and the ` self-determination ' of people and at the same time of the council of the league of nation and all sort of international control which do we want the answer i think be both it be a matter of more or less of get the best thing at the cost of the second-best we may want to relax a old association in order to make a newer and wider one it be quite understandable that people aware of a distinctive national character and involve in some big exist political complex should wish to disentangle themselves from one group of association in order to enter more effectively into another a greater and more satisfactory one the finn or the pole who have hitherto be a rather reluctant member of the synthesis of the russian empire may well wish to end that attachment in order to become a free member of a worldwide brotherhood the desire for free arrangement be not a desire for chaos there be such a thing as untie you parcel in order to pack they better and i do not see myself how we can possibly contemplate a great league of freedom and reason in the world without a considerable amount of such preliminary dissolution it happen very fortunately for the world that a century and a quarter ago thirteen various and very jealous state work out the problem of a union and become -- after a enormous exhausting wrangle -- the united state of america now the way they solve they riddle be by delegate and give over jealously specify sovereign power and do all that be possible to retain the residuum they remain essentially sovereign state new york virginium massachusett for example remain legally independent the practical fusion of these people into one people outrun the legal bargain it be only after long year of discussion that the point be concede it be indeed only after the civil war that the implication be fully establish that there reside a sovereignty in the american people as a whole as distinguish from the people of the several state this be a precedent that every one who talk about the league of nation should bear in mind these state set up a congress and president in washington with strictly delegate power that congress and president they delegate to look after certain common interest to deal with interstate trade to deal with foreign power to maintain a supreme court of law everything else -- education militia power of life and death -- the state retain for themselves to this day for instance the federal court and the federal official have no power to interfere to protect the life or property of alien in any part of the union outside the district of columbium the state government still see to that the federal government have the legal right perhaps to intervene but it be still chary of such intervention and these state of the american union be at the outset so independent-spirited that they would not even adopt a common name to this day they have no common name we have to call they american which be a ridiculous name when we consider that canada mexico peru brazil be all of they also in america or else we have to call they virginian californian new englander and so forth they legal and nominal separateness weigh nothing against the real fusion that they great league have now make possible now that clearly be a precedent of the utmost value in we scheme for this council of the league of nation we must begin by delegate as the state begin by delegate it be a far cry to the time when we shall talk and think of the sovereign people of the earth that council of the league of nation will be a tie as strong we hope but certainly not so close and multiplex as the early tie of the state at washington it will begin by have certain delegated power and no other it will be a _ ad hoc _ body later its power may grow as mankind become accustomed to it but at first it will have directly or mediately all the power that seem necessary to restrain the world from war -- and unless i know nothing of patriotic jealousy it will have not a scrap of power more the danger be much more that its power will be insufficient than that they will be excessive of that later what i want to discuss here now be the constitution of this delegated body i want to discuss that first in order to set aside out of the discussion certain fantastic notion that will otherwise get very seriously in we way fantastic as they be they have play a large part in reduce the hague tribunal to a ineffective squeak amidst the thunder of this war a number of gentleman scheming out world unity in study have begin they proposal with the simple suggestion that each sovereign power should send one member to the project parliament of mankind this have a pleasant democratic air one sovereign state one vote now let we run over a list of sovereign state and see to what this lead we we find we list include the british empire with a population of four hundred million of which probably half can read and write some language or other bogota with a population of a million mostly poet hayti with a population of a million and a third almost entirely illiterate and liable at any time to further political disruption andorra with a population of four or five thousand soul the mere suggestion of equal representation between such power be enough to make the british empire burst into a thousand -lrb- voting -rrb- fragment a certain concession to population one must admit be make by the theorist a state of over three million get if i remember rightly two delegate and if over twenty three and some of the small state be give a kind of intermittent appearance they only come every other time or something of that sort but at the hague thing still remain in such a posture that three or four minute and backward state could outvote the british empire or the united state therein lie the clue to the insignificance of the hague such project as these be idle project and we must put they out of we head they be against nature the great nation will not suffer they for a moment but when we dismiss this idea of representation by state we be leave with the problem of the proportion of representation and of relative weight in the council of the league on we hand it be the sort of problem that appeal terribly to the ingenious we can not solve it by make population a basis because that will give a monstrous importance to the illiterate million of indium and china ingenious statistical scheme have be frame in which the number of university graduate and the steel output come in as multiplier but for my own part i be not greatly impress by statistical scheme at the risk of seem something of a prussian i would like to insist upon certain brute fact the business of the league of nation be to keep the peace of the world and nothing else no power will ever dare to break the peace of the world if the power that be capable of make war under modern condition say _ no _ and there be only four power certainly capable at the present time of produce the man and material need for a modern war in sufficient abundance to go on fighting : britain france germany and the united state there be three other which be very doubtfully capable : italy japan and austrium russium i will mark -- it be all that one can do with russium just now -- with a note of interrogation some day china may be war capable -- i hope never but it be a possibility personally i do not think that any other power on earth would have a ghost of a chance to resist the will -- if it could be a honestly unite will -- of the first-named four all the rest fight by the sanction of and by association with these leader they can only fight because of the split will of the war-complete power some be force to fight by that very division no one can vie with I in my appreciation of the civilization of switzerland sweden or holland but the plain fact of the case be that such power be absolutely incapable of utter a effective protest against war far less so be you hayti and liberia the preservation of the world-peace rest with the great power and with the great power alone if they have the will for peace it be peace if they have not it be conflict the four power i have name can now if they see fit dictate the peace of the world for ever let we keep we grip on that peace be the business of the great power primarily steel output university graduate and so forth may be convenient secondary criterion may be useful way of measure war efficiency but the meat and substance of the council of the league of nation must embody the will of those lead people they can give a enduring peace to the little nation and the whole of mankind it can arrive in no other way so i take it that the council of a ideal league of nation must consist chiefly of the representative of the great belligerent power and that the representative of the minor ally and of the neutral -- essential though they presence will be -- must not be allow to swamp the voice of these larger mass of mankind and this state of affair may come about more easily than logical statistical-minded people may be dispose to think we first impulse when we discuss the league of nation idea be to think of some very elaborate and definite scheme of member on the model of exist legislative body call together one hardly know how and sit in a specially build league of nation congress house all scheme be more methodical than reality we think of somebody learn and expert in spectacles with a thin clear voice reading over the project constitution of a league of nation to a attentive and respectful peace congress but there be a more natural way to a league than that instead of be make like a machine the league of nation may come about like a marriage the peace congress that must sooner or later meet may itself become after a time the council of a league of nation the league of nation may come upon we by degree almost imperceptibly i be strongly obsess by the idea that that peace congress will necessarily become -- and that it be highly desirable that it should become -- a most prolonged and persistent gathering why should it not become at length a permanent gathering invite representative to aid its deliberation from the neutral state and gradually adjust itself to condition of permanency i can conceive no such peace congress as those that have settle up after other war settle up after this war not only have the war be enormously bigger than any other war but it have strike deeper at the foundation of social and economic life i doubt if we begin to realize how much of the old system be dead to-day how much have to be remake since the beginning of history there have be a credible promise of gold payment underneath we financial arrangement it be now a incredible promise the value of a pound note wave about while you look at it what will happen to it when peace come no man can tell nor what will happen to the mark the rouble have go into the abyss we giddy money specialist clutch they handful of paper and watch it fly down the steep much as we may hate the german some of we will have to sit down with some of the enemy to arrange a common scheme for the preservation of credit in money and i presume that it be not propose to end this war in a wild scramble of buyer for such food as remains in the world there be a shortage now a greater shortage ahead of the world and there will be shortage of supply at the source and transport in food and all raw material for some year to come the peace congress will have to sit and organize a share-out and distribution and reorganization of these shatter supplies it will have to rhondda the nation probably too we shall have to deal collectively with a pestilence before we be out of the mess then there be such little job as the reconstruction of belgium and serbium there be considerable rectification of boundary to be make there be fresh state to be create in poland and armenia for example about all these smaller state new and old that the peace must call into be there must be a system of guarantee of the most difficult and complicated sort i do not see the press congress get through such matter as these in a session of week or month the idea the german betray at brest that thing be go to be do in the versaille fashion by great moustached hero frown and draw line with a large black soldierly thumbnail across map be -- old-fashioned they have make they eastern treaty it be true in this mode but they be still look for some really responsible government to keep they now that they be make from first to last clearly the main peace negotiation be go to follow unprecedented course this preliminary discussion of war aim by means of great public speech that have be get more and more explicit now for many month be quite unprecedented apparently all the broad preliminary be to be state and accept in the sight of all mankind before even a armistice occur on the main the western front the german diplomatist hate this process so do a lot of ours so do some of the diplomatic frenchman the german junker be dodge and lie they be fight desperately to keep back everything they possibly can for the bargaining and bullying and table-banging of the council chamber but that way there be no peace and when at last germany say snip sufficiently to the ally ' snap and the peace congress begin it will almost certainly be as unprecedented as its prelude before it meet the broad line of the settlement will have be draw plainly with the approval of the mass of mankind ii the league must be representative a peace congress grow permanent then may prove to be the most practical and convenient embodiment of this idea of a league of nation that have take possession of the imagination of the world a most necessary preliminary to a peace congress with such possibility inherent in it must obviously be the meeting and organization of a preliminary league of the ally nation that point i would now enlarge half a world peace be better than none there seem no reason whatever why the world should wait for the central power before it begin this necessary work mr mccurdy have be ask lately why not the league of nation _ now _ that be a question a great number of people would like to echo very heartily the nearer the ally can come to a league of free nation before the peace congress the more prospect there be that that body will approximate in nature to a league of nation for the whole world in one most unexpected quarter the same idea have be endorse the king 's speech on the prorogation of parliament this February be one of the most remarkable royal utterance that have ever be make from the british throne there be less of the old-fashioned king and more of the modern president about it than the most republican-minded of we could have anticipate for the first time in a king 's speech we hear of the democracy of the world and there be a clear claim that the ally at present fight the central power do themselves constitute a league of nation but we must admit that at present they do so only in a very rhetorical sense there be no real council of empower representative and nothing in the nature of a unite front have be prepare unless we provide beforehand for something more effective italy france the united state japan and this country will send separate group of representative with separate instruction unequal status and very probably conflict view upon many subject to the ultimate peace discussion it be quite conceivable -- it be a very serious danger -- that at this discussion skilful diplomacy on the part of the central power may open a cleft among the ally that have never appear during the actual war have the british settle for example with italy and france for the supply of metallurgical coal after the war those country must have it somehow across the board germany can make some tempting bid in that respect or take another question : have the british arrive at common view with france belgium portugal and south africa about the administration of central africa suppose germany make sudden proposal affect native labor that win over the portuguese and the boer there be a score of such point upon which we shall find the ally representative haggle with each other in the presence of the enemy if they have not be settle beforehand it be the plainest common sense that we should be fix up all such matter with we ally now and knit together a common front for the final deal with german imperialism and these thing be not to be do effectively and bindingly nowadays by official gentleman in discreet undertone they need to be do with the full knowledge and authority of the participate people the russian example have teach the world the instability of diplomatic bargain in a time of such fundamental issue as the present there be little hope and little strength in hole-and-corner bargaining between the official or politician who happen to be at the head of this or that nation for the time be we labor people will not stand this sort of thing and they will not be bind by it there will be the plain danger of repudiation for all arrangement make in that fashion a gathering of somebody or other approve by the british foreign office and of somebody or other approve by the french foreign office of somebody with vague power from america and so on and so on will be a entirely ineffective gathering but that be the sort of gathering of the ally we have be have hitherto and that be the sort of gathering that be likely to continue unless there be a considerable expression of opinion in favor of something more representative and responsible even we foreign office must be aware that in every country in the world there be now bitter suspicion of and keen hostility towards merely diplomatic representative one of the most significant feature of the time be the evident desire of the labor movement in every european country to take part in a collateral conference of labor that shall meet when and where the peace congress do and deliberate and comment on its proceedings for a year now the demand of the mass for such a labor conference have be grow it mark a distrust of officialdom whose intensity officialdom would do well to ponder but it be the natural consequence of it be the popular attempt at a corrective to the aloofness and obscurity that have hitherto be so evil a characteristic of international negotiation i do not think labor and intelligent people anywhere be go to be fob off with a old-fashioned diplomatic gathering as be that league of free nation they demand on the other hand i do not contemplate this bi-cameral conference with the diplomatist try to best and humbug the labor people as well as each other and the labor people get more and more irritated suspicious and extremist with anything but dread the ally country must go into the conference _ solid _ and they can only hope to do that by heed and incorporate labor idea before they come to the conference the only alternative that i can see to this unsatisfactory prospect of a peace congress sit side by side with a dissentient and probably revolutionary labor and socialist convention -- both gathering with unsatisfactory credentials contradict one another and drift to opposite extreme -- be that the delegate the ally power send to the peace conference -lrb- the same delegate which if they be wise they will have previously send to a preliminary league of ally nation to discuss they common action at the peace congress -rrb- should be elect _ ad hoc _ upon democratic line i know that this will be a very shocking proposal to all we able specialist in foreign policy they will talk at once about the ignorance of people like the labor leader and myself about such matter and so on what do we know of the treaty of so-and-so that be sign in the year seventeen something -- and so on to which the answer be that we ought not to have be keep ignorant of these thing a day will come when the foreign office of all country will have to recognize that what the people do not know of international agreement be not fact a secret treaty be only bind upon the person in the secret but what i as a sample common person be not ignorant of be this : that the business that go on at the peace congress will either make or mar the life of everyone i care for in the world and that somehow by representative or what not _ i have to be there _ the peace congress deal with the blood and happiness of my child and the future of my world speak as one of the hundred of million of rank outsider in public affair i do not mean to respect any peace treaty that may end this war unless i be honestly represent at its make i think everywhere there be a tendency in people to follow the russian example to this extent and to repudiate bargain in which they have have no voice i do not see that any genuine realization of the hope with which all this talk about the league of nation be charge can be possible unless the two body which should naturally lead up to the league of nation -- that be to say firstly the conference of the ally and then the peace congress -- be elect body speak confidently for the whole mass of the people behind they it may be a troublesome thing to elect they but it will involve much more troublesome consequence if they be not elect this i think be one of the consideration for which many people 's mind be still unprepared but unless we be to have over again after all this bloodshed and effort some such peace with honor foolery as we have perform by dizzy and salisbury at that fatal berlin conference in which this present war be beget we must sit up to this novel proposal of electoral representation in the peace negotiation something more than common sense bind we statesman to this idea they be morally pledge to it president wilson and we british and french spokesman alike have say over and over again that they want to deal not with the hohenzollern but with the german people in other word we have demand elect representative from the german people with whom we may deal and how can we make a demand of that sort unless we on we part be already prepare to send we own elect representative to meet they it be up to we to indicate by we own practice how we on we side profess as we do to act for democracy to make democracy safe on the earth and so on intend to meet this new occasion yet it have to be remark that so far not one of the league of nation project i have see have include any practicable proposal for the appointment of delegate either to that ultimate body or to its two necessary predecessor the council of the ally and the peace congress it be evident that here again we be neglect to get on with something of very urgent importance i will venture therefore to say a word or two here about the possible way in which a modern community may appoint its international representative and here again i turn from any european precedent to that political outcome of the british mind the constitution of the united state -lrb- because we must always remember that while we political institution in britain be a patch-up of feudalism tudor stuart and hanoverian monarchist tradition and urgent merely european necessity a patch-up that have be make quasi-democratic in a series of after-thought the american constitution be a real deliberate creation of the english-speaking intelligence -rrb- the president of the united state then we have to note be elect in a most extraordinary way and in a way that have now the justification of very great success indeed on several occasion the united state have achieve indisputable greatness in its president and very rarely have it fail to set up very leaderly and distinguished man it be worth while therefore to inquire how this president be elect he be neither elect directly by the people nor appoint by any legislative body he be choose by a special college elect by the people this college exist to elect he it meet elect he and disperse -lrb- i will not here go into the preliminary complication that make the election of a president follow upon a preliminary election of two presidential candidate the point i be make here be that he be a specially select man choose _ ad hoc _ -rrb- be there any reason why we should not adopt this method in this new necessity we be under of send representative first to the long overdue and necessary ally council then to the peace congress and then to the hoped-for council of the league of nation i be anxious here only to start for discussion the idea of a electoral representation of the nation upon these three body that must in succession set themselves to define organize and maintain the peace of the world i do not wish to complicate the question by any too explicit advocacy of method of election or the like in the united state this college which elect the president be elect on the same register of voter as that which elect the senate and congress and at the same time but i suppose if we be to give a popular mandate to the three or five or twelve or twenty -lrb- or whatever number it be -rrb- man to whom we be go to entrust we empire 's share in this great task of the peace negotiation it will be more decisive of the will of the whole nation if the college that have to appoint they be elect at a special election i suppose that the great british common-weal over-sea at present not represent in parliament would also and separately at the same time elect college to appoint they representative i suppose there would be at least one indian representative elect perhaps by some special electoral conference of indian prince and lead man the chief defect of the american presidential election be that as the old single vote method of election be employ it have to be fight on purely party line he be the select man of the democratic half or of the republican half of the nation he be not the select man of the whole nation it would give a far more representative character to the electoral college if it could be elect by fair modern method if for this particular purpose parliamentary constituency could be group and the clean scientific method of proportional representation could be use but i suppose the party politician in this as in most of we affair must still have he pound of we flesh -- and we must reckon with he later for the bloodsh these be all however secondary consideration the above paragraph be so to speak in the nature of a footnote the fundamental matter if we be to get towards any realization of this ideal of a world peace sustain by a league of nation be to get straight away to the conception of direct special electoral mandate in this matter at present all the political luncheon and dinner party in london be busy with smirk discussion of who be to go the title lady be particularly busy they be talk about it as if we poor ignorant tax-paying blood-paying common people do not exist l g they say will of course _ insist _ on go but there be much talk of the old man people be get quite nice again about the old man 's feeling it would be such a pretty thing to send he but if l g go we want he to go with something more than a backing of intrigue and snatch authority and i do not think the mass of people have any enthusiasm for the old man it be difficult again -- by the dinner-party standard -- to know how lord curzon can be restrain but we common people do not care if he be restrain to the point of extinction probably there will be nobody who talk or understand russian among the british representative but of course the british govern class have wash its hand of the russian they be always very difficult and now they be impossible my dear perfectly impossible no that sort of thing will not do now this peace congress be too big a job for party politician and society and county family the bulk of british opinion can not go on be represent for ever by president wilson we can not always look to the american to express we idea and do we work for democracy the foolery of the berlin treaty must not be repeat we can not have another popular prime minister come triumph back to england with a gross of pink spectacles -- through which we may survey the prospect of the next great war the league of free nation mean something very big and solid it be not a rhetorical phrase to be use to pacify a restless distressed and anxious public and to be sneer out of existence when that use be past when the popular mind now demand a league of free nation it demand a reality the only way to that reality be through the direct participation of the nation as a whole in the settlement and that be possible only through the direct election for this particular issue of representative and responsible man iii the necessary power of the league if this phrase the league of free nation be to signify anything more than a rhetorical flourish then certain consequence follow that have to be face now no man can join a partnership and remain a absolutely free man you can not bind yourself to do this and not to do that and to consult and act with you associate in certain eventuality without a loss of you sovereign freedom people in this country and in france do not seem to be sit up manfully to these necessary proposition if this league of free nation be really to be a effectual thing for the preservation of the peace of the world it must possess power and exercise power power must be delegate to it otherwise it will only help with all other half-hearted good resolution to pave the road of mankind to hell nothing in all the world so strengthen evil as the half-hearted attempt of good to make good it scarcely need repeat here -- it have be so generally say -- that no league of free nation can hope to keep the peace unless every member of it be indeed a free member represent by duly elect person nobody of course ask to dictate the internal government of any country to that country if german for instance like to wallow in absolutism after the war they can do so but if they or any other people wish to take part in a permanent league of free nation it be only reasonable to insist that so far as they representative on the council go they must be duly elect under condition that be by the standard of the general league satisfactorily democratic that seem to be only the common sense of the matter every court be a potential conspiracy against freedom and the league can not tolerate merely court appointment if court be to exist anywhere in the new world of the future they will be wise to stand aloof from international meddling of course if a people after due provision for electoral representation choose to elect dynastic candidate that be a altogether different matter and now let we consider what be the power that must be delegate to this propose council of a league of free nation if that be really effectually to prevent war and to organize and establish and make peace permanent in the world firstly then it must be able to adjudicate upon all international dispute whatever its first function must clearly be that before a war can break out there must be the possibility of a world decision upon its rights and wrong the league therefore will have as its primary function to maintain a supreme court whose decision will be final before which every sovereign power may appear as plaintiff against any other sovereign power or group of power the plea i take it will always be in the form that the defendant power or power be engage in proceedings calculate to lead to a breach of the peace and call upon the league for a injunction against such proceedings i suppose the proceedings that can be bring into court in this way fall under such heading as these that follow restraint of trade by injurious tariff or suchlike differentiation or by interference with through traffic improper treatment of the subject _ or they property _ -lrb- here i put a query -rrb- of the plaintiff nation in the defendant state aggressive military or naval preparation disorder spread over the frontier trespass -lrb- as for instance by airship -rrb- propaganda of disorder espionage permit the organization of injurious activity such as raid or piracy clearly all such action must come within the purview of any world-supreme court organize to prevent war but in addition there be a more doubtful and delicate class of case arise out of the discontent of patch of one race or religion in the dominion of another how far may the supreme court of the world attend to grievance between subject and sovereign such case be highly probable and no large vague proposition about the self-determination of people can meet all the case in macedonium for instance there be a jumble of albanian serbian bulgarian greek and rumanian village always jostle one another and maintain a intense irritation between the kindred nation close at hand and quite a large number of area and city in the world it have to be remember be not homogeneous at all will the great nation of the world have the self-abnegation to permit a scatter subject population to appeal against the treatment of its ruling power to the supreme court this be a much more serious interference with sovereignty than intervention in a external quarrel could a greek village in bulgarian macedonium plead in the supreme court could the armenian in constantinople or the jew in roumanium or the pole in west prussium or the negro in georgium or the indian in the transvaal make such a appeal could any indian population in indium appeal personally i should like to see the power of the supreme court extend as far as this i do not see how we can possibly prevent a kindred nation plead for the scattered people of its own race and culture or any nation present a case on behalf of some otherwise unrepresented people -- the united state for example present a case on behalf of the armenian but i doubt if many people have make up they mind yet to see the power of the supreme court of the league of nation go so far as this i doubt if to begin with it will be possible to provide for these case i would like to see it do but i doubt if the majority of the sovereign people concern will reconcile they national pride with the idea at least so far as they own subject population go here you see i do no more than ask a question it be a difficult one and it have to be answer before we can clear the way to the league of free nation but the supreme court whether it be to have the wider or the narrower scope here suggest would be merely the central function of the league of free nation behind the decision of the supreme court must lie power and here come fresh difficulty for patriotic digestion the army and navy of the world must be at the disposal of the league of free nation and that open up a new large area of delegated authority the first impulse of any power dispose to challenge the decision of the supreme court will be of course to arm and it be difficult to imagine how the league of free nation can exercise any practical authority unless it have power to restrain such armament the league of free nation must in fact if it be to be a work reality have power to define and limit the military and naval and aerial equipment of every country in the world this mean something more than a restriction of state force it must have power and freedom to investigate the military and naval and aerial establishment of all its constituent power it must also have effective control over every armament industry and armament industry be not always easy to define be aeroplane for example armament its power i suggest must extend even to a restraint upon the belligerent propaganda which be the natural advertisement campaign of every armament industry it must have the right for example to raise the question of the proprietorship of newspaper by armament interest disarmament be in fact a necessary factor of any league of free nation and you can not have disarmament unless you be prepare to see the power of the council of the league extend thus far the very existence of the league presuppose that it and it alone be to have and to exercise military force any other belligerency or preparation or incitement to belligerency become rebellion and any other arm a threat of rebellion in a world league of free nation but here again have the general mind yet think out all that be involve in this proposition in all the great belligerent country the armament industry be now huge interest with enormous power krupp 's business alone be as powerful a thing in germany as the crown in every country a heavily subsidized patriotic press will fight desperately against give power so extensive and thorough as those here suggest to a international body so long of course as the league of free nation remain a project in the air without body or part such a press will sneer at it gently as utopian and even patronize it kindly but so soon as the league take on the shape its general proposition make logically necessary the armament interest will take fright then it be we shall hear the drum patriotic loud in defense of the human blood trade be we to hand over these most intimate affair of ours to a lot of foreigner among these foreigner who will be appeal to to terrify the patriotic soul of the british will be the american be we man of english blood and tradition to see we affair control by such foreigner as wilson lincoln webster and washington perish the think when they might be control by disraeli wettin mount-batten and what not and so on and so on krupp 's agent and the agent of the kindred firm in great britain and france will also be very busy with the national pride of france in germany they have already create a colossal suspicion of england here be a giant in the path but let we remember that it be only necessary to defeat the propaganda of this vile and dangerous industry in four great country and for the common citizen touch on the tenderest part of he patriotic susceptibility there be certain irrefutable argument whether the way of the world in the year to come be to be the path of peace or the path of war be not go to alter this essential fact that the great educate world community with a social and industrial organization on a war-capable scale be go to dominate human affair whether they spend they power in kill or in educate and create france germany however much we may resent it the two great english-speaking community italy japan china and presently perhaps a renascent russium be jointly go to control the destiny of mankind whether that joint control come through arm or through the law be a secondary consideration to refuse to bring we affair into a common council do not make we independent of foreigner it make we more dependent upon they as a very little consideration will show i be suggest here that the league of free nation shall practically control the army navy air force and armament industry of every nation in the world what be the alternative to that to do as we please no the alternative be that any malignant country will be free to force upon all the rest just the maximum amount of armament it choose to adopt since 1871 france we say have be free in military matter what have be the value of that freedom the truth be she have be the bond-slave of germany bind to watch germany as a slave watch a master bind to launch submarine for submarine and cast gun for gun to sweep all she youth into she army to subdue she trade she literature she education she whole life to the necessity of preparation impose upon she by she drill-master over the rhine and michael too have be a slave to he imperial master for the self-same reason for the reason that germany and france be both so proudly sovereign and independent both country have be slave to kruppism and zabernism -- _ because they be sovereign and free _ so it will always be so long as patriotic cant can keep the common man jealous of international control over he belligerent possibility so long will he be the helpless slave of the foreign threat and peace remain a mere name for the rest phase between war but power over the military resource of the world be by no mean the limit of the necessary power of a effective league of free nation there be still more indigestible implication in the idea and since they have get to be digest sooner or later if civilization be not to collapse there be no reason why we should not begin to bite upon they now i be much interested to read the british press upon the alleged proposal of the german chancellor that we should give up -lrb- presumably to germany -rrb- gibraltar malta egypt and suchlike key possession it seem to excite several of we politician extremely i read over the german chancellor 's speech very carefully so far as it be available and it be clear that he do not propose anything of the sort wilfully or blindly we press and we demagogue scream over a false issue the chancellor be defend the idea of the german remain in belgium and lorraine because of the strategic and economic importance of those region to germany and he be argue that before we english get into such a feverish state of indignation about that we should first ask ourselves what we be do in gibraltar etc etc that be a different thing altogether and it be a argument that be not to be dispose of by misrepresentation the british have to think hard over this quite legitimate german _ tu quoque _ it be no good get into a patriotic bad temper and refuse to answer that question we british people be so persuade of the purity and unselfishness with which we discharge we imperial responsibility we have be so train in imperial self-satisfaction we know so certainly that all we subject nation call we bless that it be a little difficult for we to see just how the fact that we be for example so deeply root in egypt look to a outside intelligence of course the german imperialist idea be a wicked and aggressive idea as lord robert cecil have explain they want to set up all over the earth coaling station and strategic point _ on the pattern of ours _ well they argue we be only try to do what you british have do if we be not to do so -- because it be aggression and so on and so on -- be not the time ripe for you to make some concession to the public opinion of the world that be the german argument either they say tolerate this idea of a germany with advantageous post and possession round and about the earth or reconsider you own position well at the risk of rousing much patriotic wrath i must admit that i think we _ have _ to reconsider we position we argument be that in indium egypt africa and elsewhere we stand for order and civilization we be the trustee of freedom the agent of knowledge and efficiency on the whole the record of british rule be a pretty respectable one i be not ashamed of we record nevertheless _ the case be alter _ it be quite justifiable for we british no doubt if we do really play the part of honest trustee to remain in egypt and in indium under exist condition it be even possible for we to glance at the helplessness of arabia palestine and mesopotamium as yet incapable of self-government helpless as new-born infant but we case we only justifiable case be that we be trustee because there be no better trustee possible and the creation of a council of a league of free nation would be like the creation of a public trustee for the world the creation of a league of free nation must necessarily be the creation of a authority that may legitimately call exist empire to give a account of they stewardship for a unchecked fragmentary control of tropical and chaotic region it substitute the possibility of a general authority and this must necessarily alter the problem not only of the politically immature nation and the control of the tropics but also of the regulation of the sea way the regulation of the come air route and the distribution of staple product in the world i will not go in detail over the item of this list because the reader can fill in the essential of the argument from what have go before i want simply to suggest how widely this project of a league of free nation swing when once you have let it swing freely in you mind and if you do not let it swing freely in you mind it remain nothing -- a sentimental gesture the plain truth be that the league of free nation if it be to be a reality if it be to effect a real pacification of the world must do no less than supersede empire it must end not only this new german imperialism which be struggle so savagely and powerfully to possess the earth but it must also wind up british imperialism and french imperialism which do now so largely and inaggressively possess it and moreover this idea query the adjective of belgian portuguese french and british central africa alike just as emphatically as it query german still more effectually do the league forbid those creation of the futurist imagination the imperialism of italy and greece which make such threatening gesture at the world of we child be these incompatibility understand until people have face the clear antagonism that exist between imperialism and internationalism they have not begin to suspect the real significance of this project of the league of free nation they have not begin to realize that peace also have its price iv the labor view of middle africa i be recently privileged to hear the view of one of those title and influential lady -- with a general education at about the fifth standard level plus a little french german italian and music -- who do so much to make we england what it be at the present time upon the labor idea of a international control of tropical africa she be loud and derisive about the ignorance of labor what can _ they _ know about foreign politics she say with gesture to indicate she conception of _ they _ i be move to ask she what she would do about africa leave it to lord robert she say lean forward impressively _ leave it to the people who know _ unhappily i share the evident opinion of labor that we be not bless with any profoundly wise class of people who have definite knowledge and clear intention about africa that these _ people who know _ be mostly a pretentious bluff and so in spite of a very earnest desire to take refuge in my ignorance from the burthen of think about african problem i find myself oblige like most other people to do so in the interest of we country we child and the world we common person _ have _ to have opinion about these matter a muddle-up in africa this year may kill you son and mine in the course of the next decade i know this be not a claim to be interested in thing african such as the promoter of a tropical railway or a oil speculator have still it be a claim and for the life of I i can not see what be wrong about the labor proposal or what alternative exist that can give even a hope of peace in and about africa the gist of the labor proposal be a international control of africa between the zambesus and the sahara this have be receive with loud protest by man whose work one be oblige to respect by sir harry johnston for example and sir alfr sharpe and with something approach a shriek of hostility by mr cunninghame graham but i think these gentleman have not perhaps give the labor proposal quite as much attention as they have spend upon the detail of african condition i think they have jump to conclusion at the mere sound of the word international there have be some gross failure in the past to set up international administration in africa and the near east and these gentleman think at once of some new congo administration and of nondescript police force command by cosmopolitan adventurer -lrb- see joseph conrad 's out-post of civilization -rrb- they think of internationalism with greedy great power in the background outside the internationalize area intriguing to create disorder and mischief with idea of a ultimate annexation but i doubt if such nightmare do any sort of justice to the labor intention and the essential thing i would like to point out to these authority upon african question be that not one of they even hint at any other formulum which cover the broad essential of the african riddle what be these broad essential what be the end that _ must _ be achieve if africa be not to continue a festering sore in the body of mankind the first most obvious danger of africa be the militarization of the black general smut have point this out plainly the negro make a good soldier he be hardy he stand the sea and he stand cold -lrb- there be a negro in the little party which reach the north pole -rrb- it be absolutely essential to the peace of the world that there should be no arming of the negro beyond the minimum necessary for the police of africa but how be this to be watch and prevent if there be no overriding body represent civilization to say stop to the beginning of any such militarization i do not see how sir harry johnston sir alfr sharpe and the other authority can object to at least a international african disarmament commission to watch warn and protest at least they must concede that but in practice this involve something else a practical consequence of this disarmament idea must be a effective control of the importation of arm into the tutelage area of africa that rat at the dyke of civilization that ultimate expression of political scoundrelism the gun-runner have to be keep under and stamp out in africa as everywhere a disarmament commission that have no force available to prevent the arm trade will be just another hague convention just another vague well-intentioned futile gesture and closely connect with this function of control the arm trade be another great necessity of africa under tutelage and that be the necessity of a common collective agreement not to demoralize the native population that demoralization physical and moral have already go far the whole negro population of africa be now rotten with disease introduce by arab and european during the last century and such african statesman as sir harry johnston be eloquent upon the necessity of save the black -- and the baser whites -- from the effect of trade gin and similar alluring article of commerce moreover from africa there be always something new in the way of tropical disease and presently africa if we let it continue to fester as it fester now may produce a epidemic that will stand exportation to a temperate climate a bacterium that may kill you or I in some novel and disgusting way may even now be develop in some congo muck-heap so here be the need for another commission to look after the health of africa that too should be of authority over all the area of tutelage africa it be no good stamp out infectious disease in nyasaland while it be be breed in portuguese east africa and if there be a disarmament commission already control the importation of arm why should not that body also control at the same time the importation of trade gin and similar delicacy and direct quarantine and such-like health regulation but there be another question in africa upon which we ignorant labor class be far better inform than we dear old eighteenth-century upper class which still squat so firmly in we foreign and colonial office and that be the question of force labor we can not tolerate any possibility of the enslavement of black africa long ago the united state find out the impossibility of have slave labor work in the same system with white to cure that anomaly cost the united state a long and bloody war the slave-owner the exploiter of the black become a threat and a nuisance to any white democracy he bring back he loot to corrupt press and life at home what happen in america in the midst of the last century between federal and confederate must not happen again on a larger scale between white europe and middle africa slavery in africa open or disguised whether enforce by the lash or bring about by iniquitous land-stealing strike at the home and freedom of every european worker -- _ and labor know this _ but how be we to prevent the enslavement and economic exploitation of the black if we have no general watcher of african condition we want a common law for africa a general declaration of rights of certain elementary rights and we want a common authority to which the black man and the native tribe may appeal for justice what be the good of try to elevate the population of uganda and to give it a free and hopeful life if some other population close at hand be compete against the baganda worker under lash and tax so here be a third aspect of we international commission as a native protectorate and court of appeal there be still a fourth aspect of the african question in which every mother 's son in europe be closely interested and that be the trade question africa be the great source of many of the most necessary raw material upon which we modern comfort and convenience depend more particularly be it the source of cheap fat in the form of palm oil one of the most powerful lever in the hand of the ally democracy at the present time in they struggle against the imperial brigand of potsdam be the complete control we have now obtain over these essential supplies we can if we choose cut off germany altogether from these vital economic necessity if she do not consent to abandon militant imperialism for some more civilized form of government we hope that this war will end in that renunciation and that germany will re-enter the community of nation but whether that be so or not whether germany be or be not to be one of the interested party in the african solution the fact remain that it be impossible to contemplate a continue struggle for the african raw material supply between the interested power sooner or later that mean a renewal of war international trade rivalry be indeed only war -- _ smoulder _ we need and labor demand a fair frank treatment of african trade and that can only be do by some overriding regulative power a commission which so far as i can see might also be the same commission as that we have already hypothesize as be necessary to control the custom in order to prevent gun-running and the gin trade that commission might very conveniently have a voice in the administration of the great waterway of africa -lrb- which often run through the possession of several power -rrb- and in the regulation of the big railway line and air route that will speedily follow the conclusion of peace now this i take it be the gist of the labor proposal this -- and no more than this -- be what be intend by the international control of tropical africa _ i do not read that phrase as abrogate exist sovereignty in africa _ what be contemplate be a delegation of authority every one should know though unhappily the badness of we history teaching make it doubtful if every one do know that the federal government of the united state of america do not begin as a sovereign government and have now only a very questionable sovereignty each state be sovereign and each state delegate certain power to washington that be the initial idea of the union only later do the idea of a people of the state as a whole emerge in the same way i understand the labor proposal as mean that we should delegate to a african commission the middle african custom the regulation of inter-state trade inter-state railway and waterway quarantine and health generally and the establishment of a supreme court for middle african affair one or two minor matter such as the preservation of rare animal might very well fall under the same authority upon that commission the interested nation that be to say -- put they in alphabetical order -- the africander the briton the belgian the egyptian the frenchman the italian the indian the portuguese -- might all be represent in proportion to they interest whether the german would come in be really a question for the german to consider he can come in as a good european he can not come in as a imperialist brigand whether too any other nation can claim to have a interest in african affair whether the commission would not be better appoint by a league of free nation than directly by the interested government and a number of other such question need not be consider here here we be discuss only the main idea of the labor proposal now beneath the supervision and restraint of such a delegate commission i do not see why the exist administration of tutelage africa should not continue i do not believe that the labor proposal contemplate any humiliating cession of european sovereignty under that international commission the french flag may still wave in senegal and the british over the protected state of uganda give a new spirit in germany i do not see why the german flag should not presently be restore in german east africa but over all stand for righteousness patience fair play for the black and the common welfare of mankind would wave a new flag the sun of africa represent the central african commission of the league of free nation that be my vision of the labor project it be something very different i know from the nightmare of a international police of cosmopolitan scoundrel in nondescript uniform hasten to loot and ravish he dear uganda and he beloved nigerium which distress the crumpled pillow of sir harry johnston but if it be not the solution then it be up to he and he fellow authority to tell we what be the solution of the african riddle v get the league idea clear in relation to imperialism § 1 it be idle to pretend that even at the present time the idea of the league of free nation have secure possession of the british mind there be quite naturally a sustained opposition to it in all the fastness of aggressive imperialism such papers as the _ time _ and the _ morning post _ remain hostile and obstructive to the expression of international idea most of we elder statesman seem to have learn nothing and forget nothing during the year of wildest change the world have ever know but in the general mind of the british people the movement of opinion from a narrow imperialism towards internationalism have be wide and swift and it continue steadily one can trace week by week and almost day by day the americanization of the british conception of the ally war aim it may be interesting to reproduce here three communication upon this question make at different time by the present writer to the press the circumstance of they publication be significant the first be in substance identical with a letter which be send to the _ time _ late in may 1917 and reject as be altogether too revolutionary for nowadays the correspondence in the _ time _ have cease to be a impartial expression of public opinion the correspondence of the _ time _ be now apparently select and edit in accordance with the view upon public policy hold by the act editor for the day more and more have that paper become the organ of a sort of oxford imperialism three or four year behind the time and very ripe and expert the letter be here give as it be finally print in the issue of the _ daily chronicle _ for June 4th 1917 under the head want a statement of imperial policy sir -- the time seem to have come for much clearer statement of outlook and intention from this country than it have hitherto be possible to make the entry of america into the war and the banishment of autocracy and aggressive diplomacy from russium have enormously clear the air and the recent great speech of general smut at the savoy hotel be probably only the first of a series of experiment in statement it be desirable alike to clear we own head to unify we effort and to give the nation of the world some assurance and standard for we national conduct in the future that we should now define the idea of we empire and its relation to the world outlook much more clearly than have ever hitherto be do never before in the history of mankind have opinion count for so much and person and organization for so little as in this war never before have the need for clear idea widely understand and consistently sustained be so commandingly vital what do we mean by we empire and what be its relation to that universal desire of mankind the permanent rule of peace and justice in the world the whole world will be the better for a very plain answer to that question be it not time for we british not merely to admit to ourselves but to assure the world that we empire as it exist to-day be a provisional thing that in scarcely any part of the world do we regard it as more than a emergency arrangement as a necessary association that must give place ultimately to the higher synthesis of a world league that here we hold as trustee and there on account of strategic consideration that may presently disappear and that though we will not contemplate the replacement of we flag anywhere by the flag of any other compete nation though we do hope to hold together with we kin and with those who increasingly share we tradition and we language nevertheless we be prepare to welcome great renunciation of we present ascendency and privilege in the interest of mankind as a whole we need to make the world understand that we do not put we nation nor we empire before the commonwealth of man unless presently we be to follow germany along the tragic path she national vanity and she world ambition have make for she that be what we have to make clear now it be not only we duty to mankind it be also the sane course for we own preservation be it not the plain lesson of this stupendous and disastrous war that there be no way to secure civilization from destruction except by a impartial control and protection in the interest of the whole human race a control represent the best intelligence of mankind of these main cause of war -lrb- 1 -rrb- the politically undeveloped tropics -lrb- 2 -rrb- shipping and international trade and -lrb- 3 -rrb- small nationality and all region in a state of political impotence or confusion it be we case against the german that in all these three case they have subordinate every consideration of justice and the general human welfare to a monstrous national egotism that argument have a double edge at present there be a vigorous campaign in america russium the neutral country generally to represent british patriotism as equally egotistic and we purpose in this war as a mere parallel to the german purpose in the same manner though perhaps with less persistency france and italy be also caricature we be suppose to be grab at mesopotamium and palestine france at syrium italy be represent as pursue a machiavellian policy towards the unfortunate greek republican with she eye on the greek island and greece in asia be it not time that these base imputation be repudiate clearly and conclusively by we alliance and be it not time that we begin to discuss in much more frank and definite term than have hitherto be do the nature of the international arrangement that will be need to secure the safety of such liberated population as those of palestine of the arab region of the old turkish empire of armenia of reunited poland and the like i do not mean here mere diplomatic discussion and understanding i mean such full and plain statement as will be spread through the whole world and grasp and assimilate by ordinary people everywhere statement by which we as a people will be prepare to stand or fall almost as urgent be the need for some definite statement about africa general smut have warn not only the empire but the whole world of the gigantic threat to civilization that lie in the present division of africa between various keenly competitive european power any one of which will be free to misuse the great natural resource at its disposal and to arm million of black soldier for aggression a mere elimination of germany from africa will not solve that difficulty what we have to eliminate be not this nation or that but the system of national shove and elbow the treatment of africa as the board for a game of beggar-my-neighbour-and-damn-the-nigger in which a few syndicate masquerade as national interest snatch a profit to the infinite loss of all mankind we want a lowering of barrier and a unification of interest we want a international control of these dispute region to override nationalist exploitation the whole world want it it be a chastened and reasonable world we live in to-day and the time for white reason and the wide treatment of these problem be now finally the time be draw near when the egyptian and the nation of indium will ask we be thing go on for ever here as they go on now or be we to look for the time when we too like the africander the canadian and the australian will be you confess and equal partner would it not be wise to answer that question in the affirmative before the voice in which it be ask grow thick with anger in egypt for example we be either robber very like -- except for a certain difference in touch -- the german in belgium or we be honorable trustee it be we claim and pride to be honorable trustee nothing so become a trustee as a cheerful openness of disposition great britain have to table she world policy it be a thing overdue no doubt we have already a literature of liberal imperialism and a considerable accumulation of declaration by this statesman or that but what be need be a formulation much more representative official and permanent than that something that can be put beside president wilson 's clear rendering of the american idea we want all we people to understand and we want all mankind to understand that we empire be not a net about the world in which the progress of mankind be entangled but a self-conscious political system work side by side with the other democracy of the earth prepare the way for and prepare at last to sacrifice and merge itself in the world confederation of free and equal people § 2 this letter be presently follow up by a article in the _ daily news _ entitle a reasonable man 's peace this article provoke a considerable controversy in the imperialist press and it be reprint as a pamphlet by a free trade organization which distribute over 200000 copy it be particularly interesting to note in view of what follow it that it be attack with great virulence in the _ evening news _ the little fierce mud-throwing brother of the _ daily mail _ the international situation at the present time be beyond question the most wonderful that the world have ever see there be not a country in the world in which the great majority of sensible people be not passionately desirous of peace of a enduring peace and -- the war go on the condition of peace can now be state in general term that be as acceptable to a reasonable man in berlin as they be to a reasonable man in pari or london or petrograd or constantinople there be to be no conquest no domination of recalcitrant population no bitter insistence upon vindictive penalty and there must be something in the nature of a world-wide league of nation to keep the peace securely in future to make the world safe for democracy and maintain international justice to that the general mind of the world have come to-day why then do the waste and kill go on why be not the peace conference sit now manifestly because a small minority of people in position of peculiar advantage in position of trust and authority and particularly the german reactionary prevent or delay its assemble the answer which seem to suffice in all the ally country be that the german imperial government -- that the german imperial government alone -- stand in the way that its tradition be incurably a tradition of conquest and aggression that until german militarism be overthrow etc few people in the ally country will dispute that that be broadly true but be it the whole and complete truth be there nothing more to be do on we side let we put a question that go to the very heart of the problem why do the great mass of the german people still cling to its incurably belligerent government the answer to that question be not overwhelmingly difficult the german people stick to its militarist imperialism as mazeppa stick to he horse because it be bind to it and the wolf pursue the attentive student of the home and foreign propaganda literature of the german government will realize that the case make by german imperialism the main argument by which it stick to power be this that the ally government be also imperialist that they also aim at conquest and aggression that for germany the choice be world empire or downfall and utter ruin this be the argument that hold the german people stiffly unite for most man in most country it would be a convincing argument strong enough to override consideration of right and wrong i find that i myself be of this way of think that whether england have do right or wrong in the past -- and i have sometimes criticize my country very bitterly -- i will not endure the prospect of see she at the foot of some victorious foreign nation neither will any german who matter very few people would respect a german who do but the case for the ally be that this great argument by which and by which alone the german imperial government keep its grip upon the german people at the present time and keep they face they enemy be untrue the ally declare that they do not want to destroy the german people they do not want to cripple the german people they want merely to see certain gaping wound inflict by germany repair and beyond that reasonable requirement they want nothing but to be assure completely assure absolutely assure against any further aggression on the part of germany be that true we leader say so and we believe they we would not support they if we do not and if it be true have the statesman of the ally make it as transparently and convincingly clear to the german people as possible that be one of the supreme question of the present time we can not too earnestly examine it because in the answer to it lie the reason why so many man be kill yesterday on the eastern and western front so many ship sink so much property destroy so much human energy waste for ever upon mere destruction and why to-morrow and the next day and the day after -- through many month yet perhaps -- the same killing and destroy must still go on in many respects this war have be a amazing display of human inadaptability the military history of the war have still to be write the grim story of machinery misunderstand improvement resist antiquated method persist in but the broad fact be already before the public mind after three year of war the air offensive the only possible decisive blow be still merely talk of not once nor twice only have the western ally have victory within they grasp -- and fail to grip it the british cavalry general waste the great invention of the tank as a careless child break a toy at least equally remarkable be the drag inadaptability of european statecraft everywhere the failure of minister and statesman to rise to the urgent definite necessity of the present time be glaringly conspicuous they seem to be incapable even of think how the war may be bring to a end they seem incapable of that plain speaking to the world audience which alone can bring about a peace they keep on with the trick and feint of a depart age both on the side of the ally and on the side of the german the declaration of public policy remain childishly vague and disingenuous childishly diplomatic they chaffer like happy imbecile while civilization bleed to death it be perhaps to be expect few if any man of over five-and-forty completely readjust themselves to changed condition however novel and challenge the change may be and nearly all the lead figure in these affair be elderly man train in a tradition of diplomatic ineffectiveness and now overworked and overstrained to a pitch of complete inelasticity they go on as if it be still 1913 could anything be more palpably shifty and unsatisfactory more senile more feebly artful than the recent utterance of the german chancellor and on we own side -- let we examine the three lead point about this peace business in which this jaded statecraft be most apparent let the reader ask himself the follow question : -- do he know what the ally mean to do with the problem of central africa it be the clear common sense of the african situation that while these precious region of raw material remain divide up between a number of competitive european imperialism each resolutely set upon the exploitation of its possession to its own advantage and the disadvantage of the other there can be no permanent peace in the world there can be permanent peace in the world only when tropical and sub-tropical africa constitute a field free to the commercial enterprise of every one irrespective of nationality when this be no longer a area of competition between nation this be possible only under some supreme international control it require no special knowledge nor wisdom to see that a schoolboy can see it any one but a statesman absolutely flaccid with overstrain can see that however difficult it may prove to work out in detail such a international control _ must _ therefore be work out the manifest solution of the problem of the german colony in africa be neither to return they to she nor deprive she of they but to give she a share in the pooled general control of mid-africa in that way she can be deprive of all power for political mischief in africa without humiliation or economic injury in that way too we can head off -- and in no other way can we head off -- the power for evil the power of develop quarrel inherent in imperialism other than german but have the reader any assurance that this sane solution of the african problem have the support of the ally government at best he have only a vague persuasion and consider how the matter look over there the german government assure the german people that the ally intend to cut off germany from the african supply of raw material that would mean the practical destruction of german economic life it be something far more vital to the mass of german than any question of belgium or alsace-lorraine it be therefore one of the idea most potent in nerve the overstrained german people to continue they fight why be we and why be the german people not give some definite assurance in this matter give reparation in europe be germany to be allow a fair share in the control and trade of a pooled and neutralize central africa sooner or later we must come to some such arrangement why not state it plainly now a second question be equally essential to any really permanent settlement and it be one upon which these eloquent but unsatisfactory mouthpiece of ours turn they back with a equal resolution and that be the fate of the ottoman empire what in plain english be we up to there whatever happen that humpty dumpty can not be put back as it be before the war the idea of the german imperialist the idea of we own little band of noisy but influential imperialist vulgarian be evidently a game of grab a perilous cut up of these area into jostle protectorate and sphere of influence from which either the german or the ally -lrb- accord to the side you be on -rrb- be to be viciously shut out on such a basis this war be a war to the death neither germany france britain italy nor russium can live prosperously if its trade and enterprise be shut out from this cardinally important area there be therefore no alternative if we be to have a satisfactory permanent pacification of the world but local self-development in these region under honestly conceive international control of police and transit and trade let it be grant that that will be a difficult control to organize none the less it have to be attempt it have to be attempt because _ there be no other way of peace _ but once that conception have be clearly formulate a second great motive why germany should continue fight will have go the third great issue about which there be nothing but fog and uncertainty be the so-called war after the war the idea of a permanent economic alliance to prevent the economic recuperation of germany upon that idea german imperialism in its frantic effort to keep its tormented people fight naturally put the utmost stress the threat of war after the war rob the reasonable german of he last inducement to turn on he government and insist upon peace shut out from all trade unable to buy food deprive of raw material peace would be as bad for germany as war he will argue naturally enough and reasonably enough that he may as well die fight as starve this be a far more vital issue to he than the belgian issue or poland or alsace-lorraine we statesman waste they breath and slight we intelligence when these foreground question be thrust in front of the really fundamental matter but as the mass of sensible people in every country concern in germany just as much as in france or great britain know perfectly well unimpeded trade be good for every one except a few rich adventurer and restricted trade destroy limitless wealth and welfare for mankind to make a few private fortune or secure a advantage for some imperialist clique we want a end to this economic strategy we want a end to this plot of governmental clique against the general welfare in such offence germany have be the chief of sinner but which among the belligerent nation can throw the first stone here again the way to the world 's peace the only way to endure peace lie through internationalism through a international survey of commercial treaty through a international control of inter-state shipping and transport rate unless the ally statesman fail to understand the implication of they own general profession they mean that but why do they not say it plainly why do they not shout it so compactly and loudly that all germany will hear and understand why do they justify imperialism to germany why do they maintain a threatening ambiguity towards germany on all these matter by do so they leave germany no choice but a war of desperation they underline and endorse the claim of german imperialism that this be a war for bare existence they unify the german people they prolong the war § 3 some week later i be able at the invitation of the editor to carry the controversy against imperialism into the _ daily mail _ which have hitherto count as a strictly imperialist paper the article that follow be publish in the _ daily mail _ under the head be we stick to the point a discussion of war aim have this war-aims controversy really get down to essential be the purpose of this world conflict from first to last too complicate for brevity or can we boil it down into a statement compact enough for a newspaper article and if we can why be there all this voluminous uneasy unquenchable disputation about war aim as to the first question i would say that the gist of the dispute between the central power and the world can be write easily without undue cramping in a ordinary handwriting upon a postcard it be the second question that need answering and the reason why the second question have to be ask and answer be this that several of the ally and particularly we british be not be perfectly plain and simple-minded in we answer to the first that there be a division among we and in we mind and that we division be make we ambiguous in we behavior that it be weaken and divide we action and strengthening and consolidate the enemy and that unless we can drag this slurred-over division of aim and spirit into the light of day and _ settle it now _ we be likely to remain double-minded to the end of the war to split we strength while the war continue and to come out of the settlement at the end with nothing nearly worth the strain and sacrifice it have cost we and first let we deal with that postcard and say what be the essential aim of the war the aim to which all other aim be subsidiary it be we have hear repeat again and again by every statesman of importance in every ally country to defeat and destroy military imperialism to make the world safe for ever against any such deliberate aggression as germany prepare for forty year and bring to a climax when she cross the belgian frontier in 1914 we want to make anything of that kind on the part of germany or of any other power henceforth impossible in this world that be we great aim whatever other object may be seek in this war no responsible statesman dare claim they as anything but subsidiary to that one can say in fact this be we sole aim we other aim be but part of it better that million should die now we declare than that hundred of million still unborn should go on living generation after generation under the black tyranny of this imperialist threat there be we common agreement so far at any rate we be unite the question i would put to the reader be this : be we all logically sincerely and fully carry out the plain implication of this war aim or be we to any extent muddle about with it in such a way as to confuse and disorganize we ally weaken we internal will and strengthen the enemy now the plain meaning of this supreme declare war aim be that we be ask germany to alter she way we be ask germany to become a different germany either germany have to be utterly smash up and destroy or else germany have to cease to be a aggressive military imperialism the former alternative be dismiss by most responsible statesman they declare that they do not wish to destroy the german people or the german nationality or the civilized life of germany i will not enlarge here upon the tedium and difficulty such a undertaking would present i will dismiss it as be not only impossible but also as a insanely wicked project the second alternative therefore remain as we war aim i do not see how the sloppiest reasoner can evade that as we do not want to kill germany we must want to change germany if we do not want to wipe germany off the face of the earth then we want germany to become the prospective and trust-worthy friend of she fellow nation and if word have any meaning at all that be say that we be fight to bring about a revolution in germany we want germany to become a democratically controlled state such as be the united state to-day with open method and pacific intention instead of remain a clenched fist if we can bring that about we have achieve we war aim if we can not then this struggle have be for we only such loss and failure as humanity have never know before but do we as a nation stick closely to this clear and necessary this only possible meaning of we declare war aim that great clear-minded leader among the ally that englishman who more than any other single man speak for the whole english-speaking and western-thinking community president wilson have say definitely that this be he meaning america with he as she spokesman be under no delusion she be fight consciously for a german revolution as the essential war aim we in europe do not seem to be so lucid i think myself we have be and be still fatally and disastrously not lucid it be high time and over that we clear we mind and get down to the essential of the war we have muddle about in blood and dirt and secondary issue long enough we in britain be not clear-minded i would point out because we be double-minded no good end be serve by try to ignore in the fancied interest of unity a division of spirit and intention that trip we up at every step we be we declare fight for a complete change in international method and we be bind to stick to the logical consequence of that we have place ourselves on the side of democratic revolution against autocratic monarchy and we can not afford to go on shilly-shallying with that choice we can not in these day of black or white play the part of lukewarm friend to freedom i will not remind the reader here of the horrible vacillation and inconsistency of policy in greece that have prolong the war and cost we wealth and live beyond measure but president wilson himself have remind we pungently enough and sufficiently enough of the folly and disingenuousness of we early treatment of the russian revolution what i want to point out here be the supreme importance of a clear lead in this matter _ now _ in order that we should state we war aim effectively in every war there must be two set of war aim keep in mind we ought to know what we mean to do in the event of victory so complete that we can dictate what term we choose and we ought to know what in the event of a not altogether conclusive tussle be the minimum term that we should consider justified we in a discontinuance of the tussle now unless we lead statesman be humbug and unless we be prepare to quarrel with america in the interest of the monarchist institution of europe we should in the event of a overwhelming victory destroy both the hohenzollern and hapsburg imperialism and that mean if it mean anything at all and be not mere lie rhetoric that we should insist upon germany become free and democratic that be to say in effect if not in form republican and upon a series of national republic polish hungarian serbo-croatian bulgarian and the like in eastern europe group together if possible into congenial group -- crown republic it might be in some case in the case of the serb for example but in no case too much crown -- that we should join with this renascent germany and with these thus liberalize power and with we ally and with the neutral in one great league of free nation trade freely with one another guaranteeing each other freedom and maintain a world-wide peace and disarmament and a new reign of law for mankind if that be not what we be out for then i do not understand what we be out for there be dishonesty and trickery and diplomacy and foolery in the struggle and i be no longer whole-hearted for such a half-hearted war if after a complete victory we be to bolster up the hohenzollern hapsburg and they relation set up a constellation of more cheating little subordinate king and reinstate that system of diplomacy and secret treaty and secret understanding that endless drama of international threatening and plot that never-ending arm that have lead we after a hundred year of waste and muddle to the supreme tragedy of this war then the world be not good enough for I and i shall be glad to close my eye upon it i be not alone in these sentiment i believe that in write thus i be write the opinion of the great mass of reasonable british french italian russian and american man i believe too that this be the desire also of great number of german and that they would if they could believe we gladly set aside they present ruler to achieve this plain common good for mankind but the reader will say what evidence be there of any republican feeling in germany that be always the objection make to any reasonable discussion of the war -- and as most of we be deny access to german papers it be difficult to produce quotation and even when one do there be plenty of fool to suggest and believe that the entire german press be a elaborate camouflage yet in the german press there be far more criticism of militant imperialism than those who have no access to it can imagine there be far franker criticism of militarism in germany than there be of reactionary toryism in this country and it be more free to speak its mind that however be a question by the way it be not the main thing that i have to say here what i have to say here be that in great britain -- i will not discuss the affair of any of we ally -- there be group and class of people not numerous not representative but place in high and influential position and capable of free and public utterance who be secretly and bitterly hostile to this great war aim which inspire all the ally people these people be permit to deny -- we peculiar censorship do not hamper they -- loudly and publicly that we be fight for democracy and world freedom tosh they say to we dead in the trench you die for a mistake they jeer at this idea of a league of nation make a end to war a idea that have inspire countless brave lad to face death and such pain and hardship as outdo even death itself they perplex and irritate we ally by propound scheme for some precious economic league of the british empire -- that be to treat all foreigner with a common base selfishness and stupid hatred -- and they intrigue with the most reactionary force in russium these british reactionary openly and with perfect impunity represent we war as a thing as mean and shameful as germany 's attack on belgium and they do it because generosity and justice in the world be as terrible to they as dawn be to the creature of the night we tory blunder into this great war not see whither it would take they in particular it be manifest now by a hundred sign that they dread the fall of monarchy in germany and austrium far rather would they make the most abject surrender to the kaiser than deal with a renascent republican germany the recent letter of lord lansdowne urge a peace with german imperialism be but a feeler from the pacifist side of this most un-english and unhappily most influential section of we public life lord lansdowne 's letter be the letter of a peer who fear revolution more than national dishonor but it be the truculent wing of this same anti-democratic movement that be far more active while we son suffer and die for they comfort and conceit these people scheme to prevent any communication between the republican and socialist class in germany and the ally population at any cost this class of pampered and privileged traitor intend to have peace while the kaiser be still on he throne if not they face a new world -- in which they part will be small indeed and with the utmost ingenuity they maintain a dangerous vagueness about the ally peace term _ with the sole object of prevent a revolutionary movement in germany _ let I put it to the reader exactly why we failure to say plainly and exactly and conclusively what we mean to do about a score of point and particularly about german economic life after the war paralyse the penitent and friend and helper that we could now find in germany let I ask the reader to suppose himself a german in germany at the present time of course if he be he be sure that he would hate the kaiser as the source of this atrocious war he would be bitterly ashamed of the belgian iniquity of the submarine murder and a score of such stain upon he national honor and he would want to alter he national system and make peace hundred of thousand of german be in that mood now but as most of we have have to learn a man may be bitterly ashamed of this or that incident in he country 's history -- what englishman for instance can be proud of glencoe -- he may disbelieve in half its institution and still love he country far too much to suffer the thought of its destruction i prefer to see my country right but if it come to the pinch and my country sin i will fight to save she from the destruction she sin may have bring upon she that be the natural way of a man but suppose a german wish to try to start a revolutionary movement in germany at the present time have we give he any reason at all for suppose that a germany liberate and democratize but of course divide and weaken as she would be bind to be in the process would get better term from the ally than a germany still face they militant imperialist and wicked he would have no reason for believe anything of the sort if we ally be honest then if a revolution start in germany to-day we should if anything lower the price of peace to germany but these people who pretend to lead we will state nothing of the sort for they a revolution in germany would be the signal for put up the price of peace at any risk they be resolve that that german revolution shall not happen you sane good german let I assert be up against that as hard as if he be a wicked one and so poor devil he have to put he revolutionary idea away they be hopeless idea for he because of the power of the british reactionary they be hopeless because of the line we as a nation take in this matter and he have to go on fight for he master a plain statement of we war aim that do no more than set out honestly and convincingly the term the ally would make with a democratic republican germany -- republican i say because where a scrap of hohenzollern be leave to-day there will be a fresh militarism to-morrow -- would absolutely revolutionize the internal psychology of germany we should no longer face a solid people we should have replace the false issue of germany and britain fighting for the hegemony of europe the lie upon which the german government have always trade and in which we extreme tory press have always support the german government by the true issue which be freedom versus imperialism the league of nation versus that net of diplomatic roguery and of aristocratic plutocratic and autocratic greed and conceit which drag we all into this vast welter of bloodshed and loss vi the war aim of the western ally here quite compactly be the plain statement of the essential cause and process of the war to which i would like to see the ally foreign office subscribe and which i would like to have place plainly before the german mind it embody much that have be learn and think out since this war begin and i think it be much truer and more fundamental than that mere rage against german militarism upon which we politician and press still so largely subsist the enormous development of war method and war material within the last fifty year have make war so horrible and destructive that it be impossible to contemplate a future for mankind from which it have not be eliminate the increase facility of railway steamship automobile travel and air navigation have bring mankind so close together that ordinary human life be no longer safe anywhere in the boundary of the little state in which it be once secure in some fashion it be now necessary to achieve sufficient human unity to establish a world peace and save the future of mankind in one or other of two way only be that unification possible either man may set up a common league to keep the peace of the earth or one state must ultimately become so great and powerful as to repeat for all the world what rome do for europe two thousand year ago either we must have human unity by a league of exist state or by a imperial conquest the former be now the declare aim of we country and its ally the latter be manifestly the ambition of the present ruler of germany whatever the complication may have be in the earlier stage of the war due to treaty that be now dead letter and agreement that be extinct the essential issue now before every man in the world be this : be the unity of mankind to be the unity of a common freedom in which every race and nationality may participate with complete self-respect play its part accord to its character in one great world community or be it to be reach -- and it can only be so reach through many generation of bloodshed and struggle still even if it can be ever reach in this way at all -- through conquest and a german hegemony while the ruler of germany to-day be more openly aggressive and imperialist than they be in August 1914 the ally array against they have make great progress in clear up and realize the instinct and ideal which bring they originally into the struggle the german government offer the world to-day a war future in which germany alone be to be secure and powerful and proud _ mankind will not endure that _ the ally offer the world more and more definitely the scheme of a organize league of free nation a rule of law and justice about the earth to fight for that and for no other conceivable end the united state of america with the full sympathy and co-operation of every state in the western hemisphere have enter the war the british empire in the midst of the stress of the great war have set up in dublin a convention of irishman of all opinion with the fullest power of decide upon the future of they country if ireland be not divide against herself she could be free and equal with england to-morrow it be the open intention of great britain to develop representative government where it have not hitherto exist in indium and egypt to go on steadfastly increase the share of the native of these country in the government of they own land until they too become free and equal member of the world league neither france nor italy nor britain nor america have ever tamper with the shipping of other country except in time of war and the trade of the british empire have be impartially open to all the world the extra-national possession the so-called subject nation in the empire of britain france italy and japan be in fact possession hold in trust against the day when the league of free nation will inherit for mankind be it to be union by conquest or be it to be union by league for any sort of man except the german the question be will you be a free citizen or will you be a underling to the german imperialism for the german now the question be a far graver and more tragic one for he it be this : you belong to a people not now increase very rapidly a numerous people but not so numerous as some of the great people of the world a people very highly train very well drill and well armed perhaps as well train and drill and equip as ever it will be the collapse of russian imperialism have make you safe if now you can get peace and you _ can _ get a peace now that will neither destroy you nor humiliate you nor open up the prospect of fresh war the ally offer you such a peace to accept it we must warn you plainly mean refuse to go on with the manifest intention of you present ruler which be to launch you and you child and you child 's child upon a career of struggle for war predominance which may no doubt inflict untold deprivation and misery upon the rest of mankind but whose end in the long run for germany and thing german can be only judgment and death in such term as these the oceanic ally could now state they war-will and carry the world straightway into a new phase of human history they could but they do not for alas not one of they be free from the entanglement of past thing when we look for the wisdom of statesman we find the cunning of politician when open speech and plain reason might save the world court bureaucrat financier and profiteer conspire vii the future of monarchy from the very outset of this war it be manifest to the clear-headed observer that only the complete victory of german imperialism could save the dynastic system in europe from the fate that it have challenge that curious system have be the natural and unplanned development of the political complication of the seventeenth and eighteenth century two system of monarchy the bourbon system and the german then rule europe between they with the latter be associate the tradition of the european unity under the roman empire all the germanic monarch have a itch to be call caesar the kaiser of the austro-hungarian empire and the czar have so to speak the prior claim to the title the prussian king set up as a caesar in 1871 queen victorium become the caesar of indium -lrb- kaisir-i-hind -rrb- under the auspices of lord beaconsfield and last and least that most detestable of all coburger ferdinand of bulgarium give kaiserism a touch of quaint absurdity by set up as czar of bulgarium the weakening of the bourbon system by the french revolution and the napoleonic adventure clear the way for the complete ascendancy of the germanic monarchy in spite of the break away of the united state from that system after 1871 a constellation of quasi-divine teutonic monarch of which the german emperor the german queen victorium the german czar be the greatest star form a caste apart intermarry only among themselves dominate the world and be regard with a mystical awe by the ignorant and foolish in most european country the marriage the funeral the coronation the obstetrics of this amazing breed of idol be matter of almost universal worship the czar and queen victorium profess also to be the head of religion upon earth the court-centered diplomacy of the more firmly root monarchy steer all the great liberating movement of the nineteenth century into monarchical channel italy be make a monarchy greece the motherland of republic be hand over to a needy scion of the danish royal family the sturdy peasant of bulgarium suffer from a kindred imposition even norway be saddle with as much of a king as it would stand as a condition of its independence at the dawn of the twentieth century republican freedom seem a remote dream beyond the confines of switzerland and france -- and it have no very secure air in france reactionary scheming have be a intermittent fever in the french republic for six and forty year the french foreign office be still undemocratic in tradition and temper but for the restless disloyalty of the hohenzollern this german kingly caste might be dominate the world to this day of course the stability of this teutonic dynastic system in europe -- which will presently seem to the student of history so curious a halting-place upon the way to human unity -- rest very largely upon the maintenance of peace it be the failure to understand this on the part of the german and bulgarian ruler in particular that have now bring all monarchy to the question the implicit theory that support the intermarry german royal family in europe be that they inter-relationship and they aloofness from they subject be a mitigation of national and racial animosity in the day when queen victorium be the grandmother of europe this be a plausible argument king czar and emperor or emperor and emperor would meet and it be understand that these meeting be the lubrication of european affair the monarch marry largely conspicuously and very expensively for we good royal funeral marriage christening coronation and jubilee interrupted traffic and stimulate trade everywhere they seem to give a _ raison d'être _ for mankind it be the emperor william and the czar ferdinand who have betray not only humanity but they own strange caste by shatter all these pleasant illusion the wisdom of kant be justified and we know now that king cause war it need the shock of the great war to bring home the wisdom of that old scotchman of königsberg to the mind of the ordinary man moreover in support of the dynastic system be the fact that it do exist as the system in possession and all prosperous and intelligent people be chary of disturbing exist thing life be full of vestigial structure and it be a long way to logical perfection let we keep on they would argue with what we have and another idea which rightly or wrongly make man patient with the emperor and king be a exaggerated idea of the insecurity of republican institution you can still hear very old dull man say gravely that king be better than pronunciamento there be a article upon greece to this effect quite recently in that uncertain paper _ the new statesman _ then a kind of illustrative gesture would be make to the south american republic although the internal disturbance of the south american republic have diminish to very small dimension in the last three decade and although pronunciamento rarely disturb the traffic in switzerland the united state or france but there can be no doubt that the influence of the germanic monarchy up to the death of queen victorium upon british thought be in the direction of estrangement from the two great modern republic and in the direction of assistance and propitiation to germany we surrender heligoland we make great concession to german colonial ambition we allow ourselves to be jockey into a phase of dangerous hostility to france a practice of sneer at thing american have die only very recently out of english journalism and literature as any one who care to consult the bind magazine of the ` seventy and ` eighty may soon see for himself it be well too in these day not to forget colonel marchand if only to remember that such a clash must never recur but in justice to we monarchy we must remember that after the death of queen victorium the spirit if not the form of british kingship be greatly modify by the exceptional character and ability of king edward vii he be curiously anti-german in spirit he have essentially democratic instinct in a few precious year he restore good will between france and great britain it be no slight upon he successor to doubt whether any one could have handle the present opportunity and risk of monarchy in great britain as edward could have handle they because no doubt if monarchy be to survive in the british empire it must speedily undergo the profoundest modification the old state of affair can not continue the european dynastic system base upon the intermarriage of a group of mainly german royal family be dead to-day it be freshly dead but it be as dead as the rule of the inca it be idle to close we eye to this fact the revolution in russium the set up of a republic in china demonstrate the ripeness of the east for free institution the entry of the american republic into world politics -- these thing slam the door on any idea of work back to the old nineteenth-century system people call to people no peace with the hohenzollern be a cry that carry with it the final repudiation of emperor and king the man in the street will assure you he want no diplomatic peace beyond the unstable shape of the present the political form of the future rise now so clearly that they be the common talk of man kant 's lucid thought tell we long ago that the peace of the world demand a world union of republic that be a commonplace remark now in every civilized community the star in they course the logic of circumstance the everyday need and everyday intelligence of man all these thing march irresistibly towards a permanent world peace base on democratic republicanism the question of the future of monarchy be not whether it will be able to resist and overcome that trend it have as little chance of do that as the lama of thibet have of become emperor of the earth it be whether it will resist openly become the center and symbol of a reactionary resistance and have to be abolish and sweep away altogether everywhere as the romanoff have already be sweep away in russium or whether it will be able in this country and that to adapt itself to the necessity of the great age that dawn upon mankind to take a generous and helpful attitude towards its own modification and so survive for a time at any rate in that larger air it be the fashion for the apologist of monarchy in the british empire to speak of the british system as a crown republic that be a attractive phrase to people of republican sentiment it be quite conceivable that the british empire may be able to make that phrase a reality and that the royal line may continue a line of hereditary president with some of the ancient trappings and something of the picturesque prestige that as the oldest monarchy in europe it have to-day two king in europe have already go far towards realize this conception of a life president both the king of italy and the king of norway live as simply as if they be in the white house and be far more accessible along that line the british monarchy must go if it be not to go altogether will it go along those line there be many reason for hope that it will do so the _ time _ have style the crown the golden link of the empire australian and canadian it be argue have little love for the motherland but the greatest devotion to the sovereign and still truer be this of indian egyptian and the like it might be easy to press this theory of devotion too far but there can be little doubt that the british crown do at present stand as a symbol of unity over diversity such as no other crown unless it be that of austria-hungary can be say to do the british crown be not like other crown it may conceivably take a line of its own and emerge -- possibly a little more like a hat and a little less like a crown -- from trial that may destroy every other monarchial system in the world now many thing be go on behind the scene many little indication peep out upon the speculative watcher and vanish again but there be very little that be definite to go upon at the present time to determine how far the monarchy will rise to the need of this great occasion certain act and change the initiative to which would come most gracefully from royalty itself could be do at this present time they may be do quite soon upon the do of they wait great mass of public opinion the first of these thing be for the british monarchy to sever itself definitely from the german dynastic system with which it be so fatally entangled by marriage and descent and to make its intention of become henceforth more and more british in blood as well as spirit unmistakably plain this idea have be put forth quite prominently in the _ time _ the king have be ask to give he countenance to the sweeping away of all those restriction first set up by george the third upon the marriage of the royal prince with british french and american subject the british empire be very near the limit of its endurance of a kingly caste of german the choice of british royalty between its people and its cousin can not be indefinitely delay be it make now publicly and boldly there can be no doubt that the decision would mean a renascence of monarchy a considerable outbreak of royalist enthusiasm in the empire there be time when a king or queen must need be dramatic and must a little anticipate occasion it be not seemly to make concession perforce king may not make obviously unwilling surrender it be the indecisive king who lose they crown no doubt the anglicization of the royal family by national marriage would gradually merge that family into the general body of the british peerage its consequent loss of distinction might be accompany by a associate fading out of function until the king become at last hardly more functional than be the late duke of norfolk as premier peer possibly that be the most desirable course from many point of view it must be admit that the abandonment of marriage within the royal caste and a bold attempt to introduce a strain of british blood in the royal family do not in itself fulfil all that be need if the british king be indeed to become the crown president of he people and the nominal and accept leader of the movement towards republican institution a thing that be productive of a enormous amount of republican talk in great britain be the suspicion -- i believe a ill-founded suspicion -- that there be influence at work at court antagonistic to republican institution in friendly state and that there be a disposition even to sacrifice the interest of the liberal ally to dynastic sympathy these thing be not to be believe but it would be a feat of vast impressiveness if there be something like a royal and public repudiation of the weakness of cousinship the behavior of the ally towards that great balkan statesman venizelo the sacrifice of the friendly greek republican in favor of the manifestly treacherous king of greece have produce the deepest shame and disgust in many quarter that be altogether friendly that be even warmly loyal to the british monarchy and in a phase of totter throne it be very undesirable that the british habit of asylum should be abuse we have already in england the dethrone monarch of a friendly republic he be no doubt duly look after in the future there may be a shake of the autumnal bough and a shower of emperor and king we do not want great britain to become a hotbed of reactionary plot and the starting-point of restoration raid into the territory of emancipated people this be particularly desirable if presently after the kaiser 's death -- which by all the statistics of hohenzollern mortality can not be delay now for many year -- the present crown prince go a-wandering we do not want any german ex-monarch sweden be always open to they and friendly and to sweden they ought to go and particularly do british people dread a irruption of hohenzollern or coburger almost as undesirable would be the arrival of the czar and czarina it be supremely important that no wind of suspicion should blow between we and the freedom of russium after the war even more than during the war will the enemy be anxious to sow discord between the great russian-speaking and english-speaking democracy quite apart from the scandal of they inelegant domesticity the establishment of the czar and czarina in england with frequent and easy access to we royal family may be extraordinarily unfortunate for the british monarchy i will confess a certain sympathy for the czar myself he be not a evil figure he be not a strong figure but he have that sort of weakness that failure in decision which trail revolution in its wake he have end one dynasty already the british royal family owe it to itself that he bring not the infection of he misfortune to windsor the security of the british monarchy lie in such a courageous severance of its destiny from the teutonic dynastic system will it make that severance there i share a almost universal ignorance the loyalty of the british be not to what king be too prone to call my person not to a choose and admire family but to a renascent mankind we have fight in this war for belgium for france for general freedom for civilization and the whole future of mankind far more than for ourselves we have not fight for a king we be discover in that spirit of human unity that lie below the idea of a league of free nation the real invisible king of we heart and race but we will very gladly go on with we task under a nominal king unless he hamper we in the task that grow ever more plainly before we that i think be a fair statement of british public opinion on this question but every day when i be in london i walk past buckingham palace to lunch at my club and i look at that not very expressive façade and wonder -- and we all wonder -- what thought be go on behind it and what act be be conceive there out of it there might yet come some gesture of acceptance magnificent enough to set beside president wilson 's magnificent declaration of war these be thing in the scale of fate i will not pretend to be able to guess even which way the scale will swing viii the plain necessity for a league great as the sacrifice of prejudice and preconception which any effective realization of this idea of a league of free nation will demand difficult as the necessary delegation of sovereignty must be none the less be such sacrifice and difficulty unavoidable people in france and italy and great britain and germany alike have to subdue they mind to the realization that some such league be now a necessity for they if they peace and national life be to continue there be no prospect before they but either some such league or else great humiliation and disastrous warfare drive they down towards social dissolution and for the united state it be only a question of a little longer time before the same alternative have to be face whether this war end in the complete defeat of germany and german imperialism or in a revolutionary modernization of germany or in a practical triumph for the hohenzollern be consideration that affect the nature and scope of the league but do not affect its essential necessity in the first two case the league of free nation will be a world league include germany as a principal partner in the latter case the league of free nation will be a defensive league standing steadfast against the threat of a world imperialism and watch and restrain with one common will the homicidal maniac in its midst but in all these case there can be no great alleviation of the evil that now blacken and threaten to ruin human life altogether unless all the civilized and peace-seeking people of the world be pledge and lock together under a common law and a common world policy there must rather be a intensification of these evil there must be war more evil than this war continue this war and more destructive of civilized life there can be no peace and hope for we race but a organize peace and hope arm against disturbance as a state be arm against mad ferocious and criminal man now there be two chief argument run one into the other for the necessity of merge we exist sovereignty into a greater and if possible a world-wide league the first be the present geographical impossibility of nearly all the exist european state and empire and the second be the steadily increase disproportion between the torture and destruction inflict by modern warfare and any possible advantage that may arise from it underlie both argument be the fact that modern development of mechanical science have bring the nation of europe together into too close a proximity this present war more than anything else be a violent struggle between old political idea and new antagonistic condition it be the unhappy usage of we school and university to study the history of mankind only during period of mechanical unprogressiveness the historical idea of europe range between the time when the greek be go about the world on foot or horseback or in galley or sailing ship to the day when napoleon wellington and nelson be go about at very much the same pace in much the same vehicle and vessel at the advent of steam and electricity the muse of history hold she nose and shut she eye science will study and get the better of a modern disease as for example sleep sickness in spite of the fact that it have no classical standing but we history school would be shock at the bare idea of study the effect of modern means of communication upon administrative area large or small this defect in we historical training have make we mind politically sluggish we fail to adapt readily enough in small thing and great alike we be try to run the world in area mark out in or before the eighteenth century regardless of the fact that a man or a army or a aeroplane can get in a few minute or a few hour to point that it would have take day or week to reach under the old foot-and-horse condition that matter nothing to the learn man who instruct we statesman and politician it matter everything from the point of view of social and economic and political life and the grave fact to consider be that all the great state of europe except for the unification of italy and germany be still much of the size and in much the same boundary that make they strong and safe in the eighteenth century that be to say in the closing year of the foot-horse period the british empire grow and be organize under those condition and have to modify itself only a little to meet the need of steam shipping all over the world be its link possession and its port and coal station and fastness on the trade route and british people still look at the red-splashed map of the world with the profoundest self-satisfaction blind to the swift change that be make that scatter empire -- if it be to remain a isolate system -- almost the most dangerous conceivable let I ask the british reader who be dispose to sneer at the league of nation and say he be very well content with the empire thank you to get he atla and consider one or two proposition and first let he think of aviation i can assure he because upon this matter i have some special knowledge that long-distance air travel for man for letter and light goods and for bomb be continually become more practicable but the air route that air transport will follow must go over a certain amount of land for this reason that every few hundred mile at the longest the machine must come down for petrol a fly machine with a safe non-stop range of 1500 mile be still a long way off it may indeed be permanently impracticable because there seem to be a upward limit to the size of a aeroplane engine and now will the reader take the map of the world and study the air route from london to the rest of the empire he will find they perplexing -- if he want they to be all-red happily this be not a british difficulty only will he next study the air route from pari to the rest of the french possession and finally will he study the air route out of germany to anywhere the german be as badly off as any people but we be all badly off so far as world air transit go any country can if it choose choke any adjacent country directly any trade difficulty break out any country can begin a vexatious campaign against its neighbor 's air traffic it can oblige it to alight at the frontier to follow prescribed route to land at specify place on those route and undergo examination that will waste precious hour but so far as i can see no european statesman german or ally have begin to give they attention to this amazing difficulty without a great pool of air control either a world-wide pool or a pool at least of the atlantic-mediterranean ally in one air league the splendid peace possibility of air transport -- and they be indeed splendid -- must remain very largely a forbid possibility to mankind and as a second illustration of the way in which change condition be alter political question let the reader take he atla and consider the case of that impregnable fastness that great naval station that key to the mediterranean gibraltar british boy be bring up on gibraltar and the gibraltar idea to the british imagination gibraltar be almost as sacred a national symbol as the lion in trafalgar square now in he atla the reader will almost certainly find a inset map of this valuable possession color bright red the inset map will have attach to it a small scale of mile from that he will be able to satisfy himself that there be not a inch of the rock anywhere that be not within five mile or less of spanish land and that there be rather more than a semicircle of hill round the rock within a range of seven or eight mile that be much less than the range of a sixteen-inch gun in other word the spaniard be in a position to knock gibraltar to bit whenever they want to do so or to smash and sink any ship in its harbor they can hit it on every side consider moreover that there be long sweep of coast north south and west of the rock from which torpedo could be discharge at any ship that approach inquire further where on the rock a aeroplane can land and have ascertain these thing ask yourself what be the present value of gibraltar i will not multiply disagreeable instance of this sort though it would be easy enough to do so in the case both of france and italy as well as of great britain i give they as illustration of the way in which everywhere old security and old arrangement must be upset by the greater range of modern thing let we get on to more general condition there be not a capital city in europe that twenty year from now will not be liable to a bombing raid do by hundred or even thousand of big aeroplane upon or even before a declaration of war and there be not a line of sea communication that will not be as promptly interrupt by the hostile submarine i point these thing out here only to carry home the fact that the idea of sovereign isolation and detachment that be perfectly valid in 1900 the self-sufficient empire imperial zollverein and all that stuff and damn the foreigner be now because of the enormous change in range of action and facility of locomotion that have be go on almost as wild -- or would be if we be not so fatally accustom to they -- and quite as dangerous as the idea of set up a free and sovereign state in the isle of dog all the european empire be become vulnerable at every point surely the moral be obvious the only wise course before the ally european power now be to put they national conceit in they pocket and to combine to lock up they foreign policy they trade interest and all they imperial and international interest into a league so big as to be able to withstand the most sudden and treacherous of blow and surely the only completely safe course for they and mankind -- hard and nearly impossible though it may seem at the present juncture -- be for they to lock up into one unity with a democratize germany and with all the other state of the earth into one peace-maintaining league if the reader will revert again to he atla he will see very clearly that a strongly consolidated league of free nation even if it consist only of we present ally would in itself form a combination with so close a system of communication about the world and so great a economic advantage that in the long run it could oblige germany and the rest of the world to come in to its council divide the oceanic ally be to speak plainly geographical rag and nakedness unite they be a world to set about organize that league now with its necessary repudiation on the part of britain france and italy of a selfish and it must be remember in the light of these thing i have but hint at here a _ now hopelessly unpracticable imperialism _ would i be convinced lead quite rapidly to a great change of heart in germany and to a satisfactory peace but even if i be wrong in that then all the stronger be the reason for bind lock and unite the ally power together it be the most dangerous of delusion for each and all of they to suppose that either britain france or italy can ever stand alone again and be secure and turn now to the other aspect of these consequence of the development of material science it be too often assume that this war be be as horrible and destructive as war can be there never be so great a delusion this war have only begin to be horrible no doubt it be much more horrible and destructive than any former war but even in comparison with the full possibility of know and exist means of destruction it be still a mild war perhaps it will never rise to its full possibility at the present stage there be not a combatant except perhaps america which be not now practise a pinch economy of steel and other mechanical material the german be run short of first-class fly man and if we and we ally continue to press the air attack and seek out and train we own vastly greater resource of first quality young airman the german may come as near to be drive out of the air as be possible i be a firmer believer than ever i be in the possibility of a complete victory over germany -- through and by the air but the occasional drop of a big bomb or so in london be not to be take as anything but a minimum display of what air war can do in a little while now we alliance should be in a position to commence day and night continuous attack upon the rhine town not hour-long raid such as london know but week-long raid then and then only shall we be able to gauge the really horrible possibility of the air war they be in we hand and not in the hand of the german in addition the german be at a huge disadvantage in they submarine campaign they submarine campaign be only the feeble shadow of what a submarine campaign might be turn again to the atla the reader can see for himself that the german and austrian submarine be oblige to come out across very narrow front a fence of mine less than three hundred mile long and two hundred foot deep would for example completely bar they exit through the north sea the u-boat run the gauntlet of that long narrow sea and pay a heavy toll to it if only we admiralty would tell the german public what that toll be now there would come a time when german seaman would no longer consent to go down in they consider however what a submarine campaign would be for great britain if instead of struggle through this bottle-neck it be conduct from the coast of norway where these pest might harbor in a hundred fiord consider too what this weapon may be in twenty year ' time in the hand of a country in the position of the united state great britain if she be not altogether mad will cease to be a island as soon as possible after the war by pierce the channel tunnel -- how different we transport problem would be if we have that now -- but such country as australium new zealand and japan directly they be involve in the future in a war against any efficient naval power with a unimpeded sea access will be isolate forthwith i can not conceive that any of the great ocean power will rest content until such a tremendous possibility of blockade as the submarine have create be securely vest in the hand of a common league beyond any power of sudden abuse it must always be remember that this war be a mechanical war conduct by man whose discipline render they uninventive who know little or nothing of mechanism who be for the most part struggle blindly to get thing back to the condition for which they be train to napoleonic condition with infantry and cavalry and comparatively light gun the so-called war of maneuver it be like a man engage in a desperate duel who keep on try to make it a game of cricket most of these soldier detest every sort of mechanical device the tank for example which use with imagination might have give the british and french overwhelming victory on the western front be subordinate to the usual cavalry break through idea i be not make any particular complaint against the british and french general in say this it be what must happen to any country which entrust its welfare to soldier a soldier have to be a severely disciplined man and a severely disciplined man can not be a versatile man and on the whole the british army have be as receptive to novelty as any the german general have do no better indeed they have not do so well as the general of the ally in this respect but after the war if the world do not organize rapidly for peace then as resource accumulate a little the mechanical genius will get to work on the possibility of these idea that have merely be sketch out in this war we shall get big land ironclad which will smash town we shall get air offensive -- let the experienced london reader think of a air raid go on hour after hour day after day -- that will really burn out and wreck town that will drive people mad by the thousand we shall get a very complete cessation of sea transit even land transit may be enormously hamper by aerial attack i doubt if any sort of social order will really be able to stand the strain of a fully work out modern war we have still of course to feel the full shock effect even of this war most of the combatant be go on as sometimes man who have incur grave wound will still go on for a time -- without feel they the educational biological social economic punishment that have already be take by each of the european country be i feel very much greater than we yet realize russium the heaviest and worst-trained combatant have indeed show the effect and be down and sick but in three year ' time all europe will know far better than it do now the full price of this war and the shock effect of the next war will have much the same relation to the shock effect of this as the shock of break a finger-nail have to the shock of crush in a body in russium to-day we have see not indeed social revolution not the replacement of one social order by another but disintegration let not national conceit blind we germany france italy britain be all slip about on that same slope down which russium have slide which go first it be hard to guess or whether we shall all hold out to some kind of peace at present the social discipline of france and britain seem to be at least as good as that of germany and the _ morale _ of the rhineland and bavarium have probably to undergo very severe testing by systematize and steadily increase air punishment as this year go on the next war -- if a next war come -- will see all germany from end to end vulnerable to aircraft such be the two set of consideration that will i think ultimately prevail over every prejudice and every difficulty in the way of the league of free nation exist state have become impossible as absolutely independent sovereignty the new condition bring they so close together and give they such extravagant power of mutual injury that they must either sink national pride and dynastic ambition in subordination to the common welfare of mankind or else utterly shatter one another it become more and more plainly a choice between the league of free nation and a famished race of man looting in search of non-existent food amidst the smoulder ruin of civilization in the end i believe that the common sense of mankind will prefer a revision of its idea of nationality and imperialism to the latter alternative it may take obstinate man a few more year yet of blood and horror to learn this lesson but for my own part i cherish a obstinate belief in the potential reasonableness of mankind ix democracy all the talk all the aspiration and work that be make now towards this conception of a world securely at peace under the direction of a league of free nation have interweave with it a idea that be often rather feel than understand the idea of democracy not only be justice to prevail between race and race and nation and nation but also between man and man there be to be a universal respect for human life throughout the earth the world in the word of president wilson be to be make safe for democracy i would like to subject that word to a certain scrutiny to see whether the thing we be apt to think and assume about it correspond exactly with the feeling of the word i would like to ask what under modern condition do democracy mean and whether we have get it now anywhere in the world in its fulness and completion and to begin with i must have a quarrel with the word itself the eccentricity of modern education make we dependent for a number of we primary political term upon those use by the thinker of the small greek republic of ancient time before those petty state collapse through sheer political ineptitude before the macedonian they think in term of state so small that it be possible to gather all the citizen together for the purpose of legislation these state be scarcely more than what we english might call sovereign urban district fast communication be make by runner even the policeman with a bicycle of the modern urban district be beyond the scope of the greek imagination there be no railway telegraph telephone book or newspaper there be no need for the state to maintain a system of education and the affair of the state be so simple that they could be discuss and decide by the human voice and open voting in a assembly of all the citizen that be what democracy mean in andorra or perhaps in canton urus such democracy may still be possible in any other modern state it can not exist the opposite term to it be oligarchy in which a small council of man control the affair of the state oligarchy narrow down to one man become monarchy if you wish to be polite to a oligarchy you call it a aristocracy if you wish to point out that a monarch be rather by way of be self-appointed you call he a tyrant a oligarchy with a property qualification be a plutocracy now the modern intelligence be under a sort of magic slavery to the ancient greek have to adapt all these term to the problem of state so vast and complex that they have the same relation to the greek state that the anatomy of a man have to the anatomy of a jellyfish they be not only greater in extent and denser in population but they be increasingly innervate by more and more rapid means of communication and excitement in the classical past -- except for such special case as the feeding of rome with egyptian corn -- trade be a traffic in luxury or slave war a small specialized affair of infantry and horseman in search of slave and loot and empire the exaction of tribute the modern state must conduct its enormous business through a system of ministry its vital interest go all round the earth nothing that any ancient greek would have recognize as democracy be conceivable in a great modern state it be absolutely necessary if we be to get thing clear in we mind about what democracy really mean in relation to modern politics first to make a quite fresh classification in order to find what item there really be to consider and then to inquire which seem to correspond more or less closely in spirit with we idea about ancient democracy now there be two primary class of idea about government in the modern world depend upon we conception of the political capacity of the common man we may suppose he be a microcosm with complete idea and wish about the state and the world or we may suppose that he be not we may believe that the common man can govern or we may believe that he can not we may think further along the first line that he be so wise and good and right that we only have to get out of he way for he to act rightly and for the good of all mankind or we may doubt it and if we doubt that we may still believe that though perhaps you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time the common man express himself by a majority vote still remain the secure source of human wisdom but next while we may deny this universal distribution of political wisdom we may if we be sufficiently under the sway of modern idea about collective psychology believe that it be necessary to poke up the political indifference and inability of the common man as much as possible to thrust political idea and fact upon he to incite he to a watchful and critical attitude towards they and above all to secure he assent to the proceedings of the able people who be manage public affair or finally we may treat he as a thing to be rule and not consult let I at this stage make out a classificatory diagram of these elementary idea of government in a modern country class i it be suppose that the common man _ can _ govern : -lrb- 1 -rrb- without further organization -lrb- anarchy -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- through a majority vote by delegate class ii it be suppose that the common man _ can not _ govern and that government therefore must be through the agency of able person who may be classify under one of the follow sub-head either as -lrb- 1 -rrb- person elect by the common man because he believe they to be person able to govern -- just as he choose he doctor as person able to secure health and he electrical engineer as person able to attend to he tramway light etc etc -lrb- 2 -rrb- person of a special class as for example person bear and educate to rule -lrb- eg _ aristocracy _ -rrb- or rich business adventurer _ -lrb- plutocracy -rrb- _ who rule without consult the common man at all to which two sub-class we may perhaps add a sort of intermediate stage between they namely : -lrb- 3 -rrb- person elect by a special class of voter monarchy may be either a special case of class ii -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- or -lrb- 3 -rrb- in which the person who rule have narrow down in number to one person and the duration of monarchy may be either for life or a term of year these two class and the five sub-class cover i believe all the elementary political type in we world now in the constitution of a modern state because of the conflict and confusion of idea all or most of these five sub-class may usually be find intertwine the british constitution for instance be a complicated tangle of arrangement due to a struggle between the idea of class i -lrb- 2 -rrb- class ii -lrb- 3 -rrb- tend to become class ii -lrb- 1 -rrb- and class ii -lrb- 2 -rrb- in both its aristocratic and monarchist form the american constitution be largely dominate by class i -lrb- 2 -rrb- from which it break away in the case of the president to a short-term monarchist aspect of class ii -lrb- 1 -rrb- i will not elaborate this classification further i have make it here in order to render clear first that what we modern mean by democracy be not what the greek mean at all that be to say direct government by the assembly of all the citizen and secondly and more important that the word democracy be be use very largely in current discussion so that it be impossible to say in any particular case whether the intention be class i -lrb- 2 -rrb- or class ii -lrb- 1 -rrb- and that we have to make up we mind whether we mean if i may coin two phrase delegate democracy or selective democracy or some definite combination of these two when we talk about democracy before we can get on much beyond a generous gesture of equality and enfranchisement towards we brother man the word be be use in fact confusingly for these two quite widely different thing now it seem to I that though there have be no very clear discussion of the issue between those two very opposite conception of democracy largely because of the want of proper distinctive term there have nevertheless be a wide movement of public opinion away from delegate democracy and towards selective democracy people have go on say democracy while gradually change its meaning from the former to the latter it be notable in great britain for example that while there have be no perceptible diminution in we faith in democracy there have be a grow criticism of party and politician and a great weakening in the power and influence of representative and representative institution there have be a grow demand for personality and initiative in elect person the press which be once entirely subordinate politically to parliamentary politics adopt a attitude towards parliament and party leader nowadays which would have seem inconceivable insolence in the day of lord palmerston and there have be a vigorous agitation in support of electoral method which be manifestly calculate to subordinate delegate to select man the movement for electoral reform in great britain at the present time be one of quite fundamental importance in the development of modern democracy the case of the reformer be that heretofore modern democracy have not have a fair opportunity of show its best possibility to the world because the method of election have persistently set aside the better type of public man or rather of would-be public man in favor of mere party hack that be a story common to britain and the american democracy but in america it be express in rather different term and deal with in a less analytical fashion than it have be in great britain it be not at first clearly understand that the failure of democracy to produce good government come through the preference of delegate over select man the idea of delegation do in fact dominate the mind of both electoral reformer and electoral conservative alike and the earlier stage of the reform movement in great britain be inspire not so much by the idea of get a better type of representative as by the idea of get a fairer representation of minority it be only slowly that the idea that sensible man do not usually belong to any political party take hold it be only now be realize that what sensible man desire in a member of parliament be honor and capacity rather than a mechanical loyalty to a platform they do not want to dictate to they representative they want a man they can trust as they representative in the fifty and sixty of the last century in which this electoral reform movement begin and the method of proportional representation be think out it be possible for the reformer to work untroubled upon the assumption that if a man be not necessarily bear a little liber-al or else a little conservative he must at least be a liberal-unionist or a conservative free-trader but seek a fair representation for party minority these reformer produce a system of voting at once simple and incapable of manipulation that lead straight not to the representation of small party but to a type of democratic government by select best man before give the essential feature of that system it may be well to state in its simplest form the evil at which the reform aim a election the reformer point out be not the simple matter it appear to be at the first blush method of voting can be manipulate in various way and nearly every method have its own liability to falsification we may take for illustration the commonest simplest case -- the case that be the perplexity of every clear-thinking voter under british or american condition -- the case of a constituency in which every elector have one vote and which return one representative to parliament the naive theory on which people go be that all the possible candidate be put up that each voter vote for the one he like best and that the best man win the bitter experience be that hardly ever be there more than two candidate and still more rarely be either of these the best man possible suppose for example the constituency be mainly conservative a little group of pothouse politician wire-pullers busybody local journalist and small lawyer work for various monetary interest have capture the local conservative organization they have time and energy to capture it because they have no other interest in life except that it be they business and honest man be busy with other duty for reason that do not appear these local worker put up a unknown mr goldbug as the official conservative candidate he profess a generally conservative view of thing but few people be sure of he and few people trust he against he the weaker -lrb- and therefore still more venal -rrb- liberal organization now put up a mr kentshire -lrb- formerly wurstberg -rrb- to represent the broader thought and finer generosity of the english mind a number of conservative gentleman generally too busy about they honest business to attend the party smoker and the party cave realize suddenly that they want goldbug hardly more than they want wurstberg they put up they long-admired trust and able friend mr sanity as a independent conservative every one know the trouble that follow mr sanity be go to split the party vote the hesitate voter be tell with considerable truth that a vote give for mr sanity be a vote give for wurstberg at any price the constituency do not want wurstberg so at the eleventh hour mr sanity be induce to withdraw and mr goldbug go into parliament to misrepresent this constituency and so with most constituency and the result be a legislative body consist largely of man of unknown character and obscure aim whose only credential be the wear of a party label they come into parliament not to forward the great interest they ostensibly support but with a eye to the railway jobbery corporation business concession and financial operation that necessarily go on in and about the national legislature that in its simplest form be the dilemma of democracy the problem that have confront modern democracy since its beginning have not really be the representation of organize minority -- they be very well able to look after themselves -- but _ the protection of the unorganized mass of busily occupy fairly intelligent man from the trick of the specialist who work the party machine _ we know mr sanity we want mr sanity but we be too busy to watch the incessant intrigue to oust he in favor of the obscurely influential people politically docile who be favor by the organization we want a organizer-proof method of vote it be in answer to this demand as the outcome of a most careful examination of the way in which voting may be protect from the exploitation of those who _ work _ election that the method of proportional representation with a single transferable vote have be evolve it be organizer-proof it defy the caucus if you do not like mr goldbug you can put up and vote for mr sanity give mr goldbug you second choice in the most perfect confidence that in any case you vote can not help to return mr wurstberg with proportional representation with a single transferable vote -lrb- this specification be necessary because there be also the inferior imitation of various election-rigger figure as proportional representation -rrb- it be _ impossible to prevent the effective candidature of independent man of repute beside the official candidate _ the method of vote under the proportional representation system have be ignorantly represent as complex it be really almost ideally simple you mark the list of candidate with number in the order of you preference for example you believe a to be absolutely the best man for parliament you mark he 1 but b you think be the next best man you mark he 2 that mean that if a get a enormous amount of support ever so many more vote than he require for he return you vote will not be waste only so much of you vote as be need will go to a the rest will go to b or on the other hand if a have so little support that he chance be hopeless you will not have throw you vote away upon he it will go to b similarly you may indicate a third a fourth and a fifth choice if you like you may mark every name on you paper with a number to indicate the order of you preference and that be all the voter have to do the reckoning and counting of the vote present not the slightest difficulty to any one use to the business of computation silly and dishonest man appeal to still sillier audience have get themselves and they audience into humorous muddle over this business but the principle be perfectly plain and simple let I state they here they can be fully and exactly state with various ornament comment argument sarcastic remark and digression in seventy line of this type it will be evident that in any election under this system any one who have get a certain proportion of no 1 vote will be elect if for instance five people have to be elect and 20000 voter vote then any one who have get 4001 first vote or more _ must _ be elect 4001 vote be in that case enough to elect a candidate this sufficient number of vote be call the _ quota _ and any one who have more than that number of vote have obviously get more vote than be needful for election so to begin with the voting papers be classify accord to they first vote and any candidate who have get more than a quota of first vote be forthwith declare elect but most of these elect man would under the old system waste vote because they would have too many for manifestly a candidate who get more than the quota of vote _ need only a fraction of each of these vote to return he _ if for instance he get double the quota he need only half each vote he take that fraction therefore under this new and better system and the rest of each vote be enter on to no 2 upon that vote paper and so on now this be a extremely easy job for a accountant or skilled computer and it be quite easily check by any other accountant and skilled computer a reader with a bad arithmetical education ignorant of the very existence of such a thing as a slide rule know nothing of account keep who think of himself work out the resultant fraction with a stumpy pencil on a bit of greasy paper in a bad light may easily think of this transfer of fraction as a dangerous and terrifying process it be for a properly train man the easiest exactest job conceivable the cash register people will invent machine to do it for you while you wait what happen then be that every candidate with more than a quota begin with the top candidate shed a traction of each vote he have receive down the list and the next one shed he surplus fraction in the same way and so on until candidate lower in the list who be at first below the quota fill up to it when all the surplus vote of the candidate at the head of the list have be dispose of then the hopeless candidate at the bottom of the list be deal with the second vote on they voting papers be treat as whole vote and distribute up the list and so on it will be plain to the quick-minded that towards the end there will be a certain chasing about of little fraction of vote and a slight modification of the quota due to vote papers have no second or third preference mark upon they a chase about that it will be difficult for a untrained intelligence to follow _ but untrained intelligence be not require to follow it _ for the skilled computer these thing offer no difficulty at all and they be not difficulty of principle but of manipulation one might as well refuse to travel in a taxicab until the driver have explain the magneto as refuse to accept the principle of proportional representation by the single transferable vote until one have remedy all the deficiency of one 's arithmetical education the fundamental principle of the thing that a candidate who get more vote than he want be make to hand on a fraction of each vote to the voter 's second choice and that a candidate whose chance be hopeless be make to hand on the whole vote to the voter 's second choice so that practically only a small number of vote be ineffective be within the compass of the mind of a boy of ten but simple as this method be it completely kill the organization and manipulation of vote it completely solve the goldbug-wurstberg - sanity problem it be knave-proof -- short of forge steal or destroy voting papers a man of repute a leaderly man may defy all the party organization in existence and stand beside and be return over the head of a worthless man though the latter be smother with party label that be the gist of this business the difference in effect between proportional representation and the old method of voting must ultimately be to change the moral and intellectual quality of elect person profoundly people be only begin to realize the huge possibility of advance inherent in this change of political method it mean no less than a revolution from delegate democracy to selective democracy now i will not pretend to be anything but a strong partizan in this matter when i speak of democracy i mean selective democracy i believe that delegate democracy be already provably a failure in the world and that the reason why to-day after three and a half year of struggle we be still fight german autocracy and fight with no certainty of absolute victory be because the affair of the three great atlantic democracy have be largely in the hand not of select man but of delegate man man of intrigue and the party machine of dodge rather than initiative second-rate man when lord haldane defend he party for certain insufficiency in they preparation for the eventuality of the great war plead that they have no mandate from the country to do anything of the sort he do more than commit political suicide he bear conclusive witness against the whole system which have make he what he be neither britain nor france in this struggle have produce better statesman nor better general than the german autocracy the british and french foreign office be old monarchist organization still to this day the british and french politician haggle and argue with the german minister upon petty point and debate society advantage smart and cunning while the people perish the one man who have rise to the greatness of this great occasion the man who be in default of any rival rapidly become the leader of the world towards peace be neither a delegate politician nor the choice of a monarch and he councillor he be the one authoritative figure in these transaction whose mind have not be subdue either by long discipline in the party machine or by court intrigue who have continue he education beyond those early twenty when the mind of the bud politician cease to expand who have think and think thing out who be a educate man among dexterous under-educated specialist by something very like a belated accident in the framing of the american constitution the president of the united state be more in the nature of a select man than any other conspicuous figure at the present time he be specially elect by a special electoral college after a elaborate preliminary selection of candidate by the two great party machine and be it remember that mr wilson be not the first great president the united state have have he be one of a series of figure who tower over they european contemporary the united state have have many advantageous circumstance to thank for they present ascendancy in the world 's affair : isolation from militarist pressure for a century and a quarter a vast virgin continent plenty of land freedom from centralization freedom from title and social vulgarity common school a real democratic spirit in its people and a great enthusiasm for university but no single advantage have be so great as this happy accident which have give it a specially select man as its voice and figurehead in the world 's affair in the average congressman in the average senator as ostrogorskus 's great book so industriously demonstrate the united state have no great occasion for pride neither the senate nor the house of representative seem to rise above the level of the british house of parliament with a government unable to control the rebel force of ulster unable to promote or dismiss general without a outcry weakly amenable to the press and terrifyingly incapable of great design it be to the united state of america we must look now if the world be to be make safe for democracy it be to the method of selection as distinguish from delegation that we must look if democracy be to be save from itself x the recent struggle for proportional representation in great britain british political life resist cleanse with all the vigor of a dirty little boy it be nothing to you politician that the economic and social organization of all the world be strain almost to the pitch of collapse and that it be vitally important to mankind that everywhere the whole will and intelligence of the race should be enlist in the great task of make a permanent peace and reconstruct the shatter framework of society these be remote unreal consideration to the politician what be the world to he he have scarcely hear of it he have be far too busy as a politician he have be think of smart little trick in the lobby and brilliant exploit at question time he have be think of job and appointment of whether mr asquith be likely to come back and how far it be safe to bank upon l g he one supreme purpose be to keep affair in the hand of he own specialized set to keep the old obscure party game go to rig he little trick behind a vast silly camouflage of sham issue to keep out able man and disinterested man the public mind and the general intelligence from any effective interference with he disastrous manipulation of the common weal i do not see how any intelligent and informed man can have follow the recent debate in the house of common upon proportional representation without some gust of angry contempt they be the most pitiful and alarming demonstration of the intellectual and moral quality of british public life at the present time from the wire-puller of the fabian society and from the party organizer of both liberal and tory party alike and from the know card the pothouse shepherd and job lawyer who work the constituency come the chief opposition to this straighten out of we electoral system so urgently necessary and so long overdue they have fight it with a zeal and efficiency that be rarely display in the nation 's interest from nearly every outstanding man outside that little inner world of political sham and dodge who have give any attention to the question come on the other hand support for this reform even the great party leader mr balfor and mr asquith be in its favor one might safely judge this question by consider who be the advocate on either side but the best argument for proportional representation arise out of its opponent ' speech and to these i will confine my attention now consider lord harcourt -- heir to the most sacred tradition of the party game -- hurl scorn at a project that would introduce faddist mugwump and so on and so on -- in fact independent think man -- into the legislature consider the value of lord curzon 's statement that london rise in revolt against the project do you remember that day dear reader when the street of london boil with passionate man shout no proportional representation down with proportional representation you do not nor do i but what happen be that the guinea-pig and solicitor and nobody the party hack who form the bulk of london 's misrepresentation in the house of common stampede in terror against a proposal that threaten to wipe they out and replace they by know and responsible man london alas do not seem to care how its member be elect what londoner know anything about he member hundred of thousand of londoner do not even know which of the ridiculous constituency into which the politician have dismember we london they be in only as i be write this in my flat in st jame 's court westminster do it occur to I to inquire who be represent I in the council of the nation while i write after some slight difficulty i ascertain that my representative be a mr burdett coutt who be in the romantic eighty mr ashmead-bartlett and by a convenient accident i find that the other day he move to reject the proportional representation amendment make by the house of lord to the representation of the people bill so that i be able to look up the debate in hansard and study my opinion as he represent they and this question at one and the same time and take little thing first i be proud and happy to discover that the member for I be the only participator in the debate who in the vulgar and reprehensible phrase throw a dead cat or in polite term display classical learning my member say _ timeo danao et dona ferente _ with a rather graceful compliment to the labor conference at nottingham i could not help think to myself say my member that at that conference there must have be many man of sufficient classical reading to say to themselves ' _ timeo danaos et dona ferentes _ ' in which surmise he be quite right except perhaps for _ tempus fugit _ _ verbum sap _ _ arma virumque _ and _ quis custodiet _ there be no better know relic of antiquity but my member go a little beyond my idea when he say : we be ask to enter upon a method of legislation which can bear no other description than that of law-making in the dark because i think it can bear quite a lot of other description this be however the artistic prelude to a large vague gloomy dissertation about nothing very definite a muddle up of the main question with the minor issue of a schedule of constituency involve in the proposal the other part of my member 's speech do not i confess fill I with the easy confidence i would like to feel in my proxy let I extract a few gem of eloquence from the speech of this voice which speak for I and give also the only argument he advance that need consideration history repeat itself he say very often in curious way as to fact but generally with very different result that honestly i like it be a sentence one can read over several time but he go on to talk of the entirely different scheme for minority representation which be introduce into the reform bill of 1867 and there i be oblige to part company with he that be a silly scheme for give two vote to each voter in a three-member constituency it have about as much resemblance to the method of scientific voting under discussion as a bath-chair have to a aeroplane but that measure of minority representation lead to a baneful invention my representative go on to say and leave behind it a hateful memory in the birmingham caucus i well remember that when i stand for parliament thirty-two year ago _ we have no better platform weapon than repeat over and over again in a sentence the name of mr schnadhorst _ and i be not sure that it would not serve the same purpose now under that system the work of the caucus be of course far simpler than it will be if this system ever come into operation all the caucus have to do under that measure be to divide the elector into three group and with three candidate a b and c to order one group to vote for a and b another for b and c and the third for a and c and they carry the whole of they candidate and keep they for many year but the multiplicity of ordinal preference second third fourth fifth up to tenth which the single transferable vote system would involve will require a more scientific handling in party interest and neither party will be able to face a election with any hope of success without the assistance of the most drastic form of caucus and _ without its order be carry out by the elector _ now i swear by heaven that lowly creature as i be a lose vote a nothing voiceless and helpless in public affair i be not go to stand the imputation that that sort of reasoning represent the average mental quality of westminster -- outside parliament that be most of my neighbor in st jame 's court for example have quite large piece of head above they eyebrow read these above sentence over and ponder they significance -- so far as they have any significance never mind my keen personal humiliation at this display of the mental calibre of my representative but consider what the mental calibre of a house must be that do not break out into loud guffaw at such a passage the line of argument be about as lucid as if one reason that because one can break a window with a stone it be no use buy a telescope and it remain entirely a matter for speculation whether my member be argue that a caucus _ can _ rig a election carry on under the proportional representation system or that it can not at the first blush it seem to read as if he intend the former but be careful do he let I suggest that in that last sentence he really express the opinion that it can not it can be read either way elector under modern condition be not go to obey the order of even the most drastic caucus -- whatever a drastic caucus may be why should they in the birmingham instance it be only a section of the majority voting by ward in a election on purely party line which obey in order to keep out the minority party candidate i think myself that my member 's mind waggle perhaps he real thought shine out through a argument not intend to betray they what he do say as much as he say anything be that under proportional representation election be go to be very troublesome and difficult for party candidate if that be he intention then after all i forgive he much i think that and more than that i think that they be go to make party candidate who be merely party candidate impossible that be exactly what we reformer be after then i shall get a representative more to my taste than mr burdett coutt but let I turn now to the view of other people 's representative perhaps the most damning thing ever say against the present system damn because of its empty absurdity be utter by sir thoma whittaker he be make the usual exaggeration of the suppose difficulty of the method he say english people do not like such complication they like a straight fight between two man think of it a straight fight for more than a quarter-century i have be a voter usually with vote in two or three constituency and never in all that long political life have i see a single straight fight in a election but only the dismallest sham fight it be possible to conceive thrice only in all that time have i cast a vote for a man whom i respect on all other occasion the election that mock my citizenship be either a arrange walk-over for one party or the other or i have a choice between two unknown person mysteriously select as candidate by obscure busy people with local interest in the constituency every intelligent person know that this be the usual experience of a free and independent voter in england the fight of a ordinary parliamentary election in england be about as straight as the business of a thimble rigger and consider just what these complication be of which the opponent of proportional representation chant so loudly in the sham election of to-day which the politician claim give they a mandate to muddle up we affair the voter put a x against the name of the least detestable of the two candidate that be thrust upon he under the proportional representation method there will be a larger constituency a larger list of candidate and a larger number of people to be elect and he will put i against the name of the man he most want to be elect 2 against he second choice and if he like he may indulge in mark a third or even a further choice he may if he think fit number off the whole list of candidate that be all he will have to do that be the stupendous intricacy of the method that flatten out the mind of lord harcourt and sir thoma whittaker and as for the working of it if you must go into that all that happen be that if you first choice get more vote than he need for he return he take only the fraction of you vote that he require and the rest of the vote go on to you number 2 if 2 be not in need of all of it the rest go on to 3 and so on that be the profound mathematical mystery that be the riddle beyond the wit of westminster which overpower these fine intelligence and set they babble of senior wrangler each time there be a debate on this question in the house member after member hostile to the proposal will play the ignorant fool and pretend to be confuse himself and will try to confuse other by deliberately clumsy statement of these most elementary idea surely if there be no other argument for a change of type in the house these poor knit brow these public perspiration of the gentry who can not understand pr should suffice but let we be just it be not all pretence the inability of mr austen chamberlain to grasp the simple fact before he be undoubtedly genuine he follow mr burdett coutt in support of mr burdett coutt with the most christian disregard of the nasty thing mr burdett coutt have seem to be say about the birmingham caucus from which he spring he have a childish story to tell of how voter would not give they first vote to they real preference because they would assume he would get in in any case -- god know why of course on the assumption that the voter behave like a idiot anything be possible and never apparently have hear of fraction this great birmingham leader be unable to understand that a voter who put 1 against a candidate 's name vote for that candidate anyhow he could not imagine any feeling on the part of the voter that no 1 be he man a vote be a vote to this simple rather than lucid mind a thing one and indivisible read this -- birmingham he say refer to a schedule under consideration be to be cut into three constituency of four member each i be to have a constituency of 100000 elector i suppose how many thousand inhabitant i do not know _ every effort will be make to prevent any of those elector know -- in fact it would be impossible for any of they to know -- whether they vote for I or not or at any rate whether they effectively vote for I or not or whether the vote which they wish to give to I be really divert to somebody else _ only in a house of habitually inattentive man could any one talk such nonsense without reproof but i look in vain through hansard 's record of this debate for a single contemptuous reference to mr chamberlain 's obtuseness and the rest of he speech be a lamentable account of the time and trouble he would have to spend upon he constituent if the new method come in he be the perfect figure of the parochially important person in a state of defensive excitement no doubt he speech appeal to many in the house of course lord harcourt be quite right in say that the character of the average house of common member will be change by proportional representation it will it will make the election of obscure and unknown man of carpet-bag candidate who work a constituency as a hawker work a village of local pomposity and village-pump leader almost impossible it will replace such candidate by better know and more widely known man it will make the house of common so much the more a real gathering of the nation so much the more a house of representative man -lrb- lord harcourt 's faddist and mugwump -rrb- and it be perfectly true as mr ramsay macdonald -lrb- also a opponent -rrb- declare that proportional representation mean constituency so big that it will be impossible for a poor man to cultivate and work they that be unquestionable but mark another point it will also make it useless as mr chamberlain have testify for rich man to cultivate and work they all this cultivate and work all this go about and make thing right with this little jobber here that contractor there all the square of small political club and organization all the subscription blackmail and charity bribery that now make a parliamentary candidature so utterly rotten a influence upon public life will be kill dead by proportional representation you can not job man into parliament by proportional representation proportional representation let in the outsider it let in the common unassigned voter who be not in the local clique that be the clue to nearly all this opposition of the politician it make democracy possible for the first time in modern history and that poor man of mr ramsay macdonald 's imagination instead of cadge about a constituency in order to start politician will have to make good in some more useful way -- as a leader of the worker in they practical affair for example -- before people will hear of he and begin to believe in he the opposition to proportional representation of mr sidney webb and he little circle be a trifle more scientific in tone than these naive objection of the common run of antagonist but underlie it be the same passionate desire to keep politics a close game for the politician and to bar out the politically unspecialized man there be more conceit and less jobbery behind the criticism of this type of mind it be a opposition base on the idea that the common man be a fool who do not know what be good for he so he have to be stampede politics accord to this school be a sort of cattle-driving the webbite do not deny the broad fact of the case we present electoral system with we big modern constituency of thousand of voter lead to huge turnover of political power with a relatively small shift of public opinion it make a mock of public opinion by caricature and parliament become the distort mirror of the nation under some loud false issue a few score of thousand of vote turn over and in go this party or that with a big sham majority this the webbite admit but they applaud it it give we they say a strong government public opinion the intelligent man outside the house be rule out of the game he have no power of intervention at all the artful little fabian politician rub they hand and say _ now _ we can get to work with the wire no one can stop we and when the public complain of the result there be always the repartee _ you _ elect they but the fabian psychology be the psychology of a very small group of pedant who believe that fair end may be reach by foul means it be much easier and more natural to serve foul end by foul means in practice it be not tricky benevolence but tricky bargaining among the interest that will secure control of the political wire that be a bad enough state of affair in ordinary time but in time of tragic necessity like the present man will not be mock in this way life be go to be very intense in the year ahead of we if we go right on to another caricature parliament with perhaps half a hundred lead man in it and the rest hack and nobody the baffled and discontented outsider in the street may presently be drive to rioting and the throwing of bomb unless indeed the insurrection of the outsider take a still graver form and the press which have cease entirely to be a party press in great britain help some adventurous prime minister to flout and set aside the lower house altogether there be neither much moral nor much physical force behind the house of common at the present time the argument of the fabian opponent to proportional representation be frankly that the strongest government be get in a house of half a hundred or fewer lead man with the rest of the parliament drive sheep but the whole mischief of the present system be that the obscure member of parliament be not sheep they be a crowd of little-minded second-rate man just as greedy and eager and self-seeking as any of we they vote straight indeed on all the main party question they obey they whip like sheep then but there be a great bulk of business in parliament outside the main party question and obedience be not without its price these be matter vitally affect we railway and ship and communication generally the food and health of the people armament every sort of employment the appointment of public servant the everyday texture of all we life then the nobody become somebody the party hack get busy the rat be in the granary in these recent debate in the house of common one can see every stock trick of the wire-puller in operation particularly we have the old dodge of the man who be in theory quite in sympathy with proportional representation but it be he declare regretfully too late it will cause delay difficult to make arrangement later on perhaps and so on it be never too late for a vital issue upon the speedy adoption of proportional representation depend as mr balfor make plain in a admirable speech whether the great occasion of the peace and after the peace be to be handle by a grand council of all that be best and most leaderlike in the nation or whether they be to be leave to a few leader apparently lead but really profoundly sway by the obscure crowd of politician and jobber behind they be the politician to hamper and stifle we in this supreme crisis of we national destiny or be we british people to have a real control of we own affair in this momentous time be man of light and purpose to have a voice in public affair or not proportional representation be supremely a test question it be a question that no adverse decision in the house of common can stifle there be too many people now who grasp its importance and significance every one who set a proper value upon purity in public life and the vitality of democratic institution will i be convinced vote and continue to vote across every other question against the antiquated foul and fraudulent electoral method that have hitherto rob democracy of three-quarter of its efficiency xi the study and propaganda of democracy in the precede chapter i have deal with the discussion of proportional representation in the british house of common in order to illustrate the intellectual squalor amidst which public affair have to be handle at the present time even in a country professedly democratic i have take this one discussion as a sample to illustrate the present imperfection of we democratic instrument all over the world in every country great multitude of intelligent and serious people be now inspire by the idea of a new order of thing in the world of a world-wide establishment of peace and mutual aid between nation and nation and man and man but chiefly because of the elementary crudity of exist electoral method hardly anywhere at present except at washington do these great idea and this world-wide will find expression amidst the other politician and statesman of the world president wilson tower up with a effect almost divine but it be no ingratitude to he to say that he be not nearly so exceptional a be among educate man as he be among the official leader of mankind everywhere now one may find something of the wilson purpose and intelligence but nearly everywhere it be silence or muffle or make ineffective by the political advantage of privileged or of violent and adventurous inferior man he be one of we but it be he good fortune to have get he head out of the sack that be about the head of most of we in the official world in the world of ruler and representative and statesman he almost alone speak for the modern intelligence this general stifle of the better intelligence of the world and its possible release to expression and power seem to I to be the fundamental issue underlie all the present trouble of mankind we can not get on while everywhere fool and vulgarian hold the lever that can kill imprison silence and starve man we can not get on with false government and we can not get on with mob government we must have right government the intellectual people of the world have a duty of co-operation they have too long neglect the modernization of political institution the study of these institution until we have work out and achieve the very best and most efficient method whereby the whole community of mankind may work together under the direction of its choose intelligence be the common duty of every one who have a brain for the service and before everything else we have to realize this crudity and imperfection in what we call democracy at the present time democracy be still chiefly a aspiration it be a spirit it be a idea for the most part its method be still to seek and still more be this league of free nation as yet but a aspiration let we not underrate the task before we only the disinterested devotion of hundred of thousand of active brain in school in pulpit in book and press and assembly can ever bring these redeeming conception down to the solid earth to rule all round the world there be this same obscuration of the real intelligence of man in germany human good will and every fine mind be subordinate to political form that have for a mouthpiece a chancellor with he brain manifestly addled by the theory of _ welt-politik _ and the bismarckian tradition and for a figurehead a mad kaiser nevertheless there come even from germany muffle cry for a new age a grin figure like a bloodstained punch be all that speak for the best brain in bulgarium yes we western ally know all that by heart but after all the immediate question for each one of we be _ what speak for I _ so far as official political form go i myself be as ineffective as any right-thinking german or bulgarian could possibly be i be more ineffective than a galician pole or a bohemian who vote for he nationalist representative politically i be a negligible item in the constituency of this mr burdett coutt into whose brain we have be peep politically i be less than a waistcoat button on that quaint figure and that be all i be -- except that i revolt i have write of it so far as if it be just a joke but indeed bad and foolish political institution can not be a joke sooner or later they prove themselves to be tragedy this war be that it be yesterday 's lazy tolerant sense of humor wade out now into the lake of blood it refuse to foresee it be absurd to suppose that anywhere to-day the nationalism the suspicion and hatred the cant and policy and dead phrase that sway man represent the current intelligence of mankind they be merely the evidence of its disorganization even now we _ know _ we could do far better give mankind but a generation or so of peace and right education and this world could mock at the poor imagination that conceive a millennium but we have to get intelligence together we have to canalize think before it can work and produce its due effect to that end i suppose there have be a vast amount of mental activity among we political negligible for my own part i have think of the idea of god as the banner of human unity and justice and i have make some tentative in that direction but man i perceive have argue themselves mean and petty about religion at the word god passion bristle the word god do not unite man it anger they but i doubt if god care greatly whether we call he god or no he service be the service of man this double idea of the league of free nation link with the idea of democracy as universal justice be free from the jealousy of the theologian and great enough for man to unite upon everywhere i know how warily one must reckon with the spite of the priest but surely these idea may call upon the teacher of all the great world religion for they support the world be full now of confused propaganda propaganda of national idea of tradition of hate of sentimental and degrading loyalty of every sort of error that divide and torture and slay mankind all human institution be make of propaganda be sustain by propaganda and perish when it cease they must be continually explain and re-explain to the young and the negligent and for this new world of democracy and the league of free nation to which all reasonable man be look there must need be the greatest of all propaganda for that cause every one must become a teacher and a missionary persuade to it and make the idea of it and the necessity for it plain that be the duty of every school teacher every tutor every religious teacher every writer every lecturer every parent every trust friend throughout the world for it too every one must become a student must go on with the task of make vague intention into definite intention of analyze and destroy obstacle of master the ten thousand difficulty of detail i be a man who look now towards the end of life fifty-one year have i scratch off from my calendar another slip by and i can not tell how many more of the sparse remainder of possible year be really mine i live in day of hardship and privation when it seem more natural to feel ill than well without holiday or rest or peace friend and the son of my friend have be kill death seem to be feel always now for those i most love the newspaper that come in to my house tell mostly of blood and disaster of drowning and slaughtering of cruelty and base intrigue yet never have i be so sure that there be a divinity in man and that a great order of human life a reign of justice and world-wide happiness of
