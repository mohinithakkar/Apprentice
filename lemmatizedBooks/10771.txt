child just as some little boy and girl fear the bogy man the tale be a favorite one among the child and they believe firmly in the fate of quicoy little quicoy 's name be francisco but every one call he quicoy which in visayan be the pet name for francisco he be a good little boy and help he mother grind the corn and pound the rice in the big wooden bowl but one night he be very careless while play in the corner with the cat he upset the jar of lubus lana and all the oil run down between the bamboo strip in the floor and be lose there be none leave to put in the glass and light so the whole family have to go to bed in the dark quicoy 's mother be angry she whip he with she chinelum and then open the window and cry : ongloc of the mountain fly in through the door catch quicoy and eat he he be mine no more quicoy be badly frighten when he hear this for the ongloc be a big black man with terrible long tooth who all night go search for the bad boy and girl that he may change they into little cocoanut and put they on a shelf in he rock house in the mountain to eat when he be hungry so when quicoy go to he bed in the corner he pull the matting over he head and be so afraid that he do not go to sleep for a long time the next morning he rise very early and go down to the spring where the boy get the water to put in the bamboo pole and carry home some boy be already there and he tell they what have take place the night before they be all sorry that he mother have call the ongloc but they tell he not to be afraid for they would tell he how he could be forever safe from that terrible man it be very easy all he have to do be to go at dusk to the cocoanut grove by the river and dig hole under two tree then he be to climb a tree get the cocoanut that grow the highest and after take off the husk and punching in one of the little eye whisper inside : ongloc of the mountain ongloc ugly man i be a little cocoanut catch I if you can then he be to cut the cocoanut in half quickly bury one piece in one of the hole and run to the other tree bury the remain half in the other hole after that he might walk home safely be sure not to run for the ongloc have always to obey the call of the cocoanut and must hunt through the grove to find the one that call he should he cross the line between the hole the bury piece would fly out of the hole snap together on he and fly up the tree from which they come would keep he prisoner for a hundred year quicoy be happy to think that he could capture the ongloc and resolve to go that very night he want some of the boy to go with he but they say he must go alone or the charm would be break they also tell he to be careful himself and not cross the line between the hole or he would be catch as easily as the ongloc so quicoy go home and keep very quiet all day he mother be sorry she have frighten he the night before and be go to tell he not to be afraid but when she think of the lubus lana spill on the ground she resolve to punish he more by say nothing to he just at dark when no one be look quicoy take he father 's bolo and quietly slip away to the grove down by the river he be not afraid of ladrone but he need the bolo because it be not easy to open a cocoanut and it take some time even with a bolo to get the husk chop from the fruit quicoy feel a little frightened when he see all the big tree around he the wind make strange noise in the branch high above he and all the tree seem to be lean over and try to speak to he he feel somewhat sorry that he have come but when he think of the ongloc he muster up courage and go on until he find a open space between two high tree he stop here and dig a hole under each of the tree then he put he foot in the notch and climb one of the tree it be hard work for the notch be far apart but at last he reach the branch and climb to the top the wind rock the tree and make he dizzy but he reach the highest cocoanut throw it to the ground and then ` start down the tree it be easy to come down though he go too fast and slip and slide some distance skin he arm and leg he do not mind that however for he know he have the cocoanut that would capture the ongloc he pick it up chop off the husk punch in one of the little eye and whisper inside : ongloc of the mountain ongloc ugly man i be a little cocoanut catch I if you can he then chop it in half and bury one piece and run to the other tree bury the remain piece just as he finish he think he hear a noise in the grove and instead of walk he start to run as fast as he could it be very dark now and the noise grow louder and make he run faster and faster until suddenly a dreadful scream sound directly in front of he and a terrible black thing with fiery eye come fly at he he turn in terror and run back toward the tree he know it be the ongloc answer the call of the cocoanut and he run like mad but the monster have see he and fly after he scream with rage faster and faster he run but nearer and nearer sound the frightful scream until just as he feel two huge claw close on he neck there be a bump a loud snap and he feel himself be carry high in the air when the shock be over he find that he be squeeze tightly between two hard wall and he could hear the ongloc scream and tear at the outside with he claw then he know what have happen he have cross the line between the bury piece and they have snap on he and carry he up the tree from which they come he be badly squeeze but he feel safe from the ongloc who finally go away in disappointment for although he like cocoanut he can not take one from a tree but must change a boy or girl into the fruit if he wish to eat of it quicoy wait a long long time and then knock on the shell in the hope that some one would hear he all that night and the next day and the next he knock and cry and knock but though people pass under the tree and find the bolo he be so high up they do not hear he day and week go by and the people wonder what have become of quicoy many think he have run away and be sorry for he poor mother who grieve very much to think she have terrify he by call the ongloc of course the boy who have send he to the grove could have tell something of he whereabouts but they be frightened and say nothing so no one ever hear of poor little quicoy again if you pass a cocoanut grove at night you can hear a noise like some one knock the older people say that the cocoanut grow so closely together high up in the branch that the wind when it shake the tree bump they together but the child know better they say quicoy be knock to get out but he must stay there a hundred year the passing of loku the tale of loku be apply to a large ugly lizard which climb to the rafter of house and give the peculiar cry that suggest its name this

world be make this be the ancient filipino account of the creation thousand of year ago there be no land nor sun nor moon nor star and the world be only a great sea of water above which stretch the sky the water be the kingdom of the god maguayan and the sky be rule by the great god captan maguayan have a daughter call lidagat the sea and captan have a son know as lihangin the wind the god agree to the marriage of they child so the sea become the bride of the wind three son and a daughter be bear to they the son be call licalibutan liadlao and libulan and the daughter receive the name of lisuga licalibutan have a body of rock and be strong and brave liadlao be form of gold and be always happy libulan be make of copper and be weak and timid and the beautiful lisuga have a body of pure silver and be sweet and gentle they parent be very fond of they and nothing be want to make they happy after a time lihangin die and leave the control of the wind to he eldest son licalibutan the faithful wife lidagat soon follow she husband and the child now grow up be leave without father or mother however they grandfather captan and maguayan take care of they and guard they from all evil after a time licalibutan proud of he power over the wind resolve to gain more power and ask he brother to join he in a attack on captan in the sky above at first they refuse but when licalibutan become angry with they the amiable liadlao not wish to offend he brother agree to help then together they induce the timid libulan to join in the plan when all be ready the three brother rush at the sky but they could not beat down the gate of steel that guard the entrance then licalibutan let loose the strongest wind and blow the bar in every direction the brother rush into the opening but be meet by the angry god captan so terrible do he look that they turn and run in terror but captan furious at the destruction of he gate send three bolt of lightning after they the first strike the copper libulan and melt he into a ball the second strike the golden liadlao and he too be melt the third bolt strike licalibutan and he rocky body break into many piece and fall into the sea so huge be he that part of he body stick out above the water and become what be know as land in the meantime the gentle lisuga have miss she brother and start to look for they she go toward the sky but as she approach the broken gate captan blind with anger strike she too with lightning and she silver body break into thousand of piece captan then come down from the sky and tear the sea apart call on maguayan to come to he and accuse he of order the attack on the sky soon maguayan appear and answer that he know nothing of the plot as he have be asleep far down in the sea after a time he succeed in calming the angry captan together they weep at the loss of they grandchild especially the gentle and beautiful lisuga but with all they power they could not restore the dead to life however they give to each body a beautiful light that will shine forever and so it be that golden liadlao become the sun and copper libulan the moon while the thousand of piece of silver lisuga shine as the star of heaven to wicked licalibutan the god give no light but resolve to make he body support a new race of people so captan give maguayan a seed and he plant it on the land which as you will remember be part of licalibutan 's huge body soon a bamboo tree grow up and from the hollow of one of its branch a man and a woman come out the man 's name be sicalac and the woman be call sicabay they be the parent of the human race they first child be a son whom they call libo afterwards they have a daughter who be know as saman pandaguan be a younger son and he have a son call arion pandaguan be very

people to worship it soon all gather around and begin to sing and pray to the shark suddenly the sky and sea open and the god come out and order pandaguan to throw the shark back into the sea and to worship none but they all be afraid except pandaguan he grow very bold and answer that the shark be as big as the god and that since he have be able to overpower it he would also be able to conquer the god then captan hearing this strike pandaguan with a small thunderbolt for he do not wish to kill he but merely to teach he a lesson then he and maguayan decide to punish these people by scatter they over the earth so they carry some to one land and some to another many child be afterwards bear and thus the earth become inhabit in all part pandaguan do not die after lie on the ground for thirty day he regain he strength but he body be blacken from the lightning and all he descendant ever since that day have be black he first son arion be take north but as he have be bear before he

a son of saman and a daughter of sicalac be carry east where the land at first be so lack in food that they be compel to eat clay on this account they child and they child 's child have always be

astonished that they do not try to stop she and she reach the land safely many people who have hide in the forest run out to meet she but she speak to no one with she eye still fix above she walk through the burning town and along the road to dalugdug the thunder mountain that lie behind dumaguete on dalugdug there live a terrible sigbin its body be like that of a monstrous crow but just under its neck be two long leg like those of a grasshopper which enable it to leap great distance without use its wing it eat any one who come near its home so when the people see catalina start to climb the mountain they beg she to come back she pay no heed to they cry however but go up higher and higher till she white dress seem merely a speck on the mountain side all at once she seem to stop and

she follow the road that back to town lead she sing as she walk and so happy be she that alas she bow not to the balete tree all at once then she hear a most terrible roar and the tic-balan fierce

anting-anting of manuelito the anting-anting be a stone or other small object cover with cabalistic inscription it be wear around the neck and be suppose to render its owner impervious to knife or bullet many be wear these charm especially the tulisane or outlaw the anting-anting must not be confuse however with the scapular a purely religious symbol worn by a great number of the christian filipino many of the older filipino remember manuelito the great tulisane who more than fifty year ago keep all the laguna de bai district in a state of fear he robber band be well organize and obey he slightest wish he have many boat on the lake and many hide place in the mountain and throughout the country there be no villager who do not fear to oppose he or who would refuse to help he in any way when require to do so in vain the guardium civil hunt he many time they surround the band but manuelito always escape many shot be fire at he but he be never hit and once when he be cut off from he man and surround he break through the line and though fifty bullet whistle around he he do not receive a scratch the officer of the guardium civil blame they man for the bad marksmanship that allow manuelito to escape they tell all the people that it should never occur again and promise that the next fight should end in the death of the outlaw the people however do not believe that manuelito could be kill for he wear on he breast a famous anting-anting that he have receive from mangagauay the giver of life and death this charm be a stone cover with mysterious sign it be wrap in silk and hang by a string from the robber 's neck and even if a gun be fire within a few foot of he the anting-anting be sure to turn the bullet in another direction it be this charm that always save he from the guardium civil manuelito be very proud of he anting-anting and many time when a fiesta be be hold in some town he and he band would come down from the mountain and take part in the game manuelito would stand in the town plaza and allow he man to shoot at he and each time the anting-anting would turn aside the bullet the people be very much impressed and though a few of the wiser one secretly think that the gun be only load with powder they be afraid to say anything so the greater number think it very wonderful and believe that there be no charm so powerful as the anting-anting of manuelito for year the tulisane protect by he charm continue to rob and plunder the guardium civil hunt he everywhere but could never kill he he grow bolder and bolder and even come close to manila to rob the little town just outside the city at last the government grow tired of send out the guardium civil and order a regiment of macabebe to hunt and kill the tulisane and he man manuelito be at pasay when news be bring to he that the macabebe be come instead of run from these fierce little fighter he decide to meet they and many people offer to help he believe that the anting-anting would turn away all bullet and give they victory so manuelito and many man leave the town build trench in the hill near san pedro macatus and wait for the macabebe to appear they have not long to wait the macabebe hurry from manila reach san pedro macatus and soon find that manuelito be wait to fight they they leave the town at once and advance on the tulisane trench it be a great fight from the other

ground prove that the great tulisane be indeed dead what of the anting-anting have it lose its power one man timidly unbutton the shirt of the dead robber and pull out the charm the mystery be explain fix firmly in the center of the anting-anting be a silver bullet there be but one explanation the macabebe have melt a statue of the virgin and use it to make bullet to fire at manuelito against such bullet the charm be useless but against ordinary lead it never would have fail have not the people see manuelito 's own man fire at he the charm be take from the neck of the dead tulisane and many copy be make of it even to this day hundred of people be wear they they will tell you about manuelito 's great fight and also about he famous anting-anting but you say the anting-anting be useless manuelito be kill they answer yes señor it be true but the macabebe use bullet of silver have they use lead the story would have be different poor manuelito when the lily return a legend of the
