out a spell on namin ' she say reuben as in the twilight of the third day he sit by he wife 's bedside if i hold out a spell on namin ' she i shall get all the folk in the district into the store and sell out clean and he laugh quizzically and stroke the little mottled face which lay on the pillow there be squire william and mis ' conkey both be in this afternoon and mis ' conkey take ten pound of

hesitate half laugh oh reuben jane say again it be the strongest remonstrance on which she ever venture she do not like the name but she adore reuben so when the baby be three month old she be carry into the meeting-house in a fade blue cashmere cloak and baptize in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost darachsa lawton miller jane miller 's baby always thrive the passive acquiescence of she nature be a blessing to they the current of they blood be never render unhealthful by overwrought nerve or disturbed temper in they mother they infancy be as placid and quiet as if they have be kitten not until they be old enough to understand word and to comprehend deprivation do they suffer because of they poverty then a serious look begin to settle upon they face they learn to watch they father and mother wistfully and to wonder what be wrong they childhood be very short before draxy be ten year old she have become she father 's inseparable companion confidant and helper he wonder sometimes almost in terror what it mean that he could say to this little child what he could not say to she mother that he often detect himself in a desire to ask of this babe advice or suggestion which he never dream of ask from he wife but draxy be wise she have the sagacity which come from great tenderness and loyalty combine with a passionate nature in such a woman 's soul there be sometimes a almost supernatural instinct she will detect danger and devise safety with a rapidity and ingenuity which be incredible but to such a nature will also come the subtlest and deepest despair of which the human heart be capable the same instinct which foresee and devise for the loved one will also recognize they most hidden trait they utmost possibility they inevitable limitation with a completeness and infallibility akin to that of god himself jane miller all she life long believe in the possibility of reuben 's success charge he failure to outside occasion and hope always in a better day to come draxy early in she childhood instinctively feel what she be far too young consciously to know that she father would never be a happier man that thing would always go against he she have a deeper reverence for the uprightness and sweet simplicity of he nature than she mother ever could have have she comprehend jane believe draxy feel jane saw without ever have hear of such a thing as fate little draxy recognize that she father be fight with it and that fate be the stronger she little arm clasp closer and closer round he neck and she serene blue eye so like he and yet so wondrously unlike by reason of they latent fire and strength look this unseen enemy steadfastly in the face day by day she be a wonderful child she physical health be perfect the first ten year of she life be spend either out of door or in she father 's lap he would not allow she to attend the district school all she know she learn from he reuben miller have never look into a english grammar or a history but he know shakespeare by heart and much of homer a few odd volume of walter scott 's novel some old voyage a big family bible and a copy of byron be the only other book in he house as draxy grow older reuben now and then borrow from the minister book which he think would do she good but the child and he both love homer and the bible so much better than any later book that they soon drift back to they it be a little sad except that it be so beautiful to see the isolate life these two lead in the family the boy be good sturdy noisy boy they go to school in the winter and work on the farm in the summer like all farmer ' boy reuben the oldest be eighteen when draxy be ten he be hire by a sort of indenture for three year on a neighbor farm and come home only on alternate sunday jamie and sam and lawton be at home young as they be they do man 's service in many way jamie have a rare gift for break horse and for several year the only ready money which the little farm have yield be the price of the colt which jamie raise and train so admirably that they sell well the other two boy be strong and willing but they have none of they father 's spirituality or they mother 's gentleness thus in spite of reuben miller 's deep love for he child he be never at ease in he boy ' presence and as they grow older nothing but the influence of they mother 's respect for they father prevent they have a impatient contempt for he unlikeness to the busy active thrifty farmer of the neighborhood it be a strange picture that the little kitchen present on a winter evening reuben sit always on the left hand of the big fire-place with a book on he knee draxy be curl up on a old-fashioned cherry-wood stand close to he chair but so high that she rest she little dimpled chin on he head a tallow candle stand on a high bracket make from a fungus which reuben have find in the wood when the candle flare and drip draxy spring up on the stand and poise on one foot reach over she father 's head to snuff it she look like a dainty fairy half-floating in the air but nobody know it jane sit in a high-backed wooden rocking-chair which have a flag bottom and a ruffle calico cushion and could only rock a very few inch back and forth owe to the loss of half of one of the rocker for the first part of the evening jane always knit but by eight o'clock the hand relax the needle drop the tired head fall back against the chair and she be fast asleep the boy be by themselves in the farther corner of the room play checkers or do sum or read the village newspaper reuben and draxy be as alone as if the house have be empty sometimes he read to she in a whisper sometimes he point slowly along the line in silence and the wise little eye from above follow intently all question and explanation be save till the next morning when draxy still curl up like a kitten would sit mount on the top of the buckwheat barrel in the store while she father lay stretch on the counter smoking they never talk to each other except when no one could hear that be they never speak in word there be mysterious and incessant communication between they whenever they be together as there be between all true lover at nine o'clock reuben always shut the book and say kiss I little daughter draxy kiss he and say good-night father dear and that be all the other child call he pa as be the universal custom in the village but draxy even in she babyhood have never once use the word until she be seven or eight year old she call he farver after that always father dear then reuben would wake jane up sigh usually poor mother how tired she be sometimes jane say when she kiss draxy at the door of she little room why do not you kiss you pa for good-night i kissed father before you wake up ma be always draxy 's quiet answer and so the year go on there be much discomfort much deprivation in reuben miller 's house food be not scarce the farm yield enough such as it be very coarse and without variety but money be hard to get the store seem to be absolutely unremunerative though customer be not want and the store and the farm be all that reuben miller have in the world but in spite of the poor food in spite of the lack of most which money buy in spite of the loyal tender passionate despair of she devotion to she father draxy grow fairer and fairer stronger and stronger at fourteen she physique be that of superb womanhood she have inherit she body wholly from she father for generation back the miller have be mark for they fine frame the man be all over six foot tall and magnificently make and the woman be much above the average size and strength on draxy 's fourteenth birthday she weigh one hundred and fifty pound and measure five foot six inch in height she coloring be that of a english girl and she bright brown hair fall below she waist in thick mass to see the face of a simple-hearted child eager but serene determine but lovingly gentle surround and glorify by such splendid physical womanhood be a rare sight reuben miller 's eye fill with tear often as he secretly watch he daughter and say to himself oh what be to be she fate what man be worthy of the wife she will be but the village people see only a healthy handsome girl overgrown they think and as queer as she father before she they say for draxy very early in life have withdraw herself somewhat from the companionship of the young people of the town as for jane she love and reverence draxy very much as she do reuben with touch devotion but without any real comprehension of she nature if she sometimes feel a pang in see how much more reuben talk with draxy than with she how much more he seek to be with draxy than with she she stifle it and reproach herself for disloyalty to each set herself to work for they harder than before in draxy 's sixteenth year the final blow of misfortune fall upon reuben miller 's head a brother of jane 's for whom in a hour of foolish generosity reuben have indorse a note of a considerable amount fail reuben 's farm be already heavily mortgage there be nothing to be do but to sell it purchaser be not plenty nor eager everybody know that the farm must be sell for whatever it would bring and each man who think of buy hope to profit somewhat in a legitimate and christian way by reuben 's extremity reuben 's courage would have utterly forsake he now except for draxy 's calmness jane be utterly unnerved weep silently from morning till night and implored reuben to see she brother 's creditor and beg they to release he from he obligation but draxy usually so gentle grow almost stern when such suggestion be make you do not understand ma she say with flushing cheek it be a promise father must pay it he can not ask to have it give back to he but with all draxy 's inflexibility of resolve she could not help be dishearten she could not see how they be to live the three room over the store could easily be fit up into a endurable dwelling-place but what be to supply the food which the farm have hitherto give they there be literally no way open for a man or a woman to earn money in that little farming village each family take care of itself and hire no service except in the short season of haying draxy be a excellent seamstress but she know very well that the price of all the sewing hire in the village in a year would not keep they from starve the store must be give up because she father would have no money with which to buy goods in fact for a long time most of he purchase have be make by exchange the spare produce of he farm at large store in the neighbor town still draxy never waver and because she do not waver reuben do not die the farm be sell at auction with the stock the utensil and all of the house-furniture which be not need to make the store chamber habitable the buyer boast in the village that he have not give more than two third of the real value of the place after reuben 's debt be all pay there remain just one thousand dollar to be put into the bank why father that be a fortune say draxy when he tell she i do not suppose we should have anything and it be glorious not to owe any man a cent it be early in April when the miller move into the store chamber the buyer of they farm be a hard-hearted penurious man a deacon of the church in which draxy have be baptize he have never be know to give a penny to any charity except foreign mission he wife and child have never receive at he hand the smallest gift but even he heart be touch by draxy 's cheerful acquiescence in the hard change and she pathetic attempt to make the new home pleasant the next morning after deacon white take possession he call out over the fence to poor reuben who stand listlessly on the store step try not to look across at the house which have be he i say miller that gal o ' you 'n be what i call the right sort o ' woman up a ' down i hai not say much to she but i have notice that she set a heap by this gard a ' i expect she 'll miss the flower more 'n anything now my womenfolk they will not have anythin ' to do with such truck a ' if she be a mind to take care o not jest 's she use ter i be willin ' i guess we shall be the gainer o not thank you deacon white draxy 'll be very glad be all reuben could reply something in he tone touch the man 's flinty heart still more and before he half know what he be go to say he have add -- a ' there be the vegetable part o not too miller i never be no hand to putter with garden sass if you 'll jest keep that up and go half fair and reg ` lar you be welcome this be tangible help reuben 's face light up i thank you with all my heart he reply that 'll be a great help to I and i reckon you 'll like we vegetable too he say half smile for he know very well that nothing but potato and turnip have be see on deacon white 's table for year then reuben go to find draxy when he tell she the color come into she face and she shut both she hand with a quick nervous motion which be habitual to she under excitement oh father we can almost live off the garden say she i tell you we should not starve but still new sorrow and still greater change be in store for the poor disheartened family in June a malignant fever break out in the village and in one short month reuben and jane have lay they two youngest boy in the grave-yard there be a dogged look which be not all sorrow on reuben 's face as he watch the sexton fill up the last grave sam and jamie at any rate would not know any more of the discouragement and hardship of life jane too mourn she boy not as mother mourn whose son have a birthright of gladness jane be very tired of the world draxy be sadden by the strange solemn presence of death but she brother have not be she companion she begin suddenly to feel a sense of new and greater relationship to they now that she think of they as angel she be half terrify and bewilder at the feeling that now for the first time they be near to she on the evening after sam 's funeral as reuben be sit on the store step with he head bury in he hand a neighbor drive up and throw he a letter it be be lyin ' in the office a week or more merrill say and he reckon i would better bring it up to you he call out as he drive on it might lie there forever for all my goin ' after it think reuben to himself as he pick it up from the dust it be no good news i

so far as she have power just as naturally and just as unconsciously there be very little discussion about the plan draxy 's instinct overbore all she father 's misgiving and all she mother 's

forward with interest to the new home and reuben smile when draxy sing lawton and reuben be to be leave behind that be the only regret but it be merely anticipate by a very little the separation which be inevitable as the boy have both become engage to daughter of the farmer for whom they have be work and would very soon take they position as son-in-law on these farm the store be sell the furniture pack and reuben miller with he wife and child set he face eastward to begin life anew the change from the rich wheat field and glorious forest of western new york to the bare stony stretch of the atlantic sea-board be a severe one no adult heart can make it without a struggle when reuben look out of the car window upon the low gray barren through which he be near he journey end he soul sink within he it be sunset the sea glisten like glass and be as red as the sky draxy could not speak for delight tear stand in she eye and she take hold of she father 's hand but reuben and jane see only the desolate rock and treeless shrubless almost -- it seem to they -- grassless field and a unutterable sense of gloom come over they it be a hot and stifle day a long drought have parch and shrivel every living thing and the white August dust lay everywhere captain melville live in the older part of the town near the water the house be all wooden weather-beaten and gray and have great patch of yellow lichen on they wall and roof thin rim of starved-looking grass edge the street and stray blade stand up here and there among the old sunken cobble-stone which make the pavement the street seem desert the silence and the sombre color and the strange low plashing of the water against the wharf oppress even draxy 's enthusiastic heart she face fall and she exclaim involuntarily oh what a lonesome place check herself she add but it be only the twilight make it look so i expect they have some difficulty in find the house the lane and street seem inextricably tangle the little party be shy of ask direction and they be all disappointed and grieve more than they own to themselves that they have not be meet at the station at last they find the house timidly draxy lift the great brass knocker it look to she like splendor and make she afraid it fall more heavily than she suppose it would and the clang sound to she over-wrought nerve as if it fill the whole street no one come they look at the window the curtain be all down there be no sign of life about the place tear come into jane 's eye she be wear out with the fatigue of the journey oh dear oh dear she say i wish we have not come pshaw mother say reuben with a voice cheerier than he heart very likely they never get we last letter and do not know we be to be here to-day and he knock again instantly a window open in the opposite house and a jolly voice say my gracious and in the twinkling of a eye the jolly owner of the jolly voice have open she front door and run barehead across the street and be shake hand with

delight who exclaim oh father we read about such door as this in that knickerbocker book do not you remember but good mr carr be draw they into the house give they neighborly welcome all the while run on in such voluble ejaculatory talk that the quiet saddened recluse-like people be overwhelm with embarrassment and hardly know which way to turn presently she see they confusion and interrupted

reuben and jane and draxy sit down with as bewilder a feeling as if they have be transport to another world the house be utterly unlike anything they have ever see high ceiling wainscote wall wooden cornice and beam and wooden mantel with head carve on the corner it seem to they at first appallingly grand presently they observe the bare wooden floor the flag-bottomed chair and fade chintz cushion the row of old tin utensil and plain cheap crockery in the glass-doored cupboard and feel more at home you know aunt emma say they be poor too say draxy answer she own unspoken thought as well as she father 's and mother 's reuben push he hair off he warm forehead and sigh i suppose we might go up-stairs mother he say that be to be we house as i understand it draxy bound at the word with fly step she ascend the stair and open the first door she stand still on the threshold unable to move from astonishment it be still light enough to see the room draxy begin to speak but break down utterly and

she go to the railway station and ascertain exactly how much the journey would cost she be dishearten at the amount it would be difficult for she to save so much out of a whole year 's earnings that day draxy 's face be sad she be sew at the house of one of she warmest friend all she employer be she friend but this one be a woman of rare intelligence and culture who have love draxy ever since the day she have find she reading a little volume of wordsworth one of the free library book while she be eat she dinner in the sewing-room draxy look she gratitude but say nothing not the least of she charm to the well-bred people who employ she be she exquisite reticence she gentle and unconscious withdrawal into herself in spite of all familiarity with which she might be treat a few day later mr

go to-morrow she preparation have already be make she know beforehand that she cause be win that she father 's sense of justice would not let he interfere with she use of the gift for the purpose for which it be make it be on a clear cold morning in January that draxy set out it be the second journey of she life and she be alone for the first time but she feel no more fear than if she have be a sparrow wing its way through a new field the morning twilight be just fading away both the east and the west be clear and glorious the east be red and the west pale blue high in the west stand the full moon golden yellow below it a long narrow bar of faint rose-color below that another bar of fainter purple then the low brown line of a long island then a arm of the sea the water be gray and still the ice rim stretch far out from the coast and sway up and down at the edge as the wave pulsed in and out flock of gull be wheeling soar in the air or lighting and float among the ice fragment as cold and snowy as they draxy lean she head against the side of the car and look out on the marvelous beauty of the scene with eye as fill with calm delight as if she have all she life journey for pleasure and have have nothing to do but feed and develop she artistic sense a company of travel actor sit near she a dozen tawdry woman and coarse man whose loud voice and vulgar jest make draxy shudder she do not know what they could be she have never see such behavior the man take out card and begin to play the woman lean over look on and clap the man on they shoulder draxy grow afraid and the expression of distress on she face attract the conductor 's notice he touch she on the shoulder i 'll take you into the next car miss if you do not like to be near these people they be only actor there be no harm in they but they be a rough set actor say draxy as the kind conductor lift she from one platform to another i never think they be like that do they play shakespeare i do not know i be sure say the conductor puzzle enough : but i dare say they do then i be glad i never go to the theater think draxy as she settle herself in she new seat for a few moment she could not banish she disturbed and unhappy feeling she could not stop fancy some of the grand word which she most love in shakespeare repeat by those repulsive voice but soon she turn she eye to the kindling sky and forget all else the moon be slowly turn from gold to silver then it would turn from silver to white cloud then to film then vanish away draxy know that day and the sun would conquer oh if i only understand it sigh draxy then she fall to think about the first chapter in genesis and while she look upon that paling moon she dream of other moon which no human eye ever see draxy be a poet but as yet she have never dare to show even to she father the little verse she have not be able to help write oh how dare i do this how dare i she say to herself as alone in she little room she write line after line but if nobody ever know it can do no harm it be strange i love it though when i be so ashamed this morning draxy have that mysterious feeling as if all thing be new which so often come to poetic soul it be at once the beauty and the burden the exhaustion and the redemption of they life no wonder that even common man can sometimes see the transfiguration which often come to he before whose eye death and resurrection be always follow each other instant perpetual glorious draxy take out she little diary fold very small and hide in the pocket of it be a short poem that she have write the year before on a tiarellum plant which have blossom in she window mr white have bring it to she with some fern and moss from the mountain and all winter long it have flower as if in summer draxy wonder why this golden moon remind she of the tiarellum she do not know the subtle underlying bond in nature these be the tiarellum verse : -- my little tiarellum if thou art my own tell I how thus in winter thy shine flower have blow art thou a fairy smuggler defy law didst take of last year 's summer more than summer saw or hast thou steal frost-flake secretly at night thy stamen tip with silver thy petal spotless white be so like those which cover my window-pane wilt thou like they turn back at noon to drop again oh little tiarella thy silence speak no more my foolish question thy secret seek the sunshine on my window lie all the day how shouldst thou know that summer have pass away the frost-flake 's icy silver be dew at noon for thee o winter sun o winter frost make summer dew for I after read these over several time draxy take out she pencil and very shyly screening herself from all observation write on the other side of the paper these line : the morning moon the gold moon turn to white the white moon fade to cloud it look so like the gold moon 's shroud it make I think about the dead and hear the word i have hear read by grave for burial rite i wonder now how many moon in just such white have die i wonder how the star divide among themselves they share of light and if there be great year of night before the earth see noon i wonder why each moon each sun which ever have be or shall be in this day 's sun and moon i see i think perhaps all of the old be hide in each new day 's hold so the first day be not yet do and then i think -- we dust be spend before the balance be swing shall we be loneliest among god 's living creature shall we dare to speak in this eternal air the only discontent then she shut the book resolutely and sit up straight with a little laugh say to herself this be a pretty begin for a business journey far better than you know sweet draxy the great success of life be never make by the man and woman who have no poetic comprehension in they soul draxy 's first night be spend at the house of a brother of captain melville 's to whom she uncle have give she a letter all go smoothly and she courage rise the next day at noon she be to change car in one of the great railroad centre as she draw near the city she begin to feel uneasy but she direction be explicit and she step bravely out into the dismal dark underground station buy she ticket and walk up and down on the platform with she little valise in she hand wait for the train in a few moment it thunder in envelop in a blind stifle smoke the crowd of passenger pour out twenty minute for refreshment be shout at each car and in a moment more there be a clearing up of the smoke and a lull in the trampling of the crowd draxy touch the conductor on the arm be this the train i be to take sir she say show he she ticket he glance carelessly at it no no say he this be the express do not stop there you must wait till the afternoon accommodation but what time will that train get there

have hold many a man before he step near she and take the ticket from she hand turn it over and over irresolutely i wish i could stop there miss he say be it any one who be sick -- for draxy 's evident distress suggest but one explanation oh no reply draxy try in vain to make she voice steady but i be all alone and i know no one there and i be afraid -- it be so late at night my friend think

conductor have never hear of una but the tone of the sentence i be reuben miller 's daughter smote upon he heart and make he as reverent to the young girl as if she have be a saint i beg you pardon miss he say involuntarily draxy look at he with a bewildered expression but make no reply she be too childlike to know that for the rough manner which have hurt she he ought to ask such pardon the conductor proceed still finger the ticket : -- i do not see how i can stop there it be a great risk for I to take if there be only one of the director on board now draxy look still more puzzle no he say give she back the ticket : i can not do it no how and he walk away draxy stand still in despair in a few minute he come back he could not account for its seem to he such a utter impossibility to leave that girl to go on she journey at night what shall you do say he i think my father would prefer that i should find some proper place to spend the night here and go on in the morning reply draxy do you not think that would be better sir she add with a appealing confide tone which make the conductor feel more like she knight than ever yes i think so and i will give you my card to take to the hotel where i stay say he and he plunge into the crowd again draxy turn to a brakeman who have draw near have the conductor the right to stop the train if he choose say she why yes miss he be right enough if that be all of course he be get to have power to stop the train any minute but stoppin ' jest to let off a passenger that be different draxy close she lip a little more firmly and become less pale when the conductor come back and give she he card with the name of the hotel on it she thank he take the card but do not stir he look at she earnestly say good day miss lift he hat and disappear draxy smile it yet want ten minute of the time for the train to go she stand still patiently bide she last chance the first bell ring -- the steam be up -- the crowd of passenger pour in at the last minute but one come the conductor as he catch sight of draxy 's erect dignified figure he start before he could speak draxy say i wait sir for i think at the last minute a director might come or you might change you mind the conductor laugh out and seize draxy 's valise exclaim by george i will stop the train for you miss miller hang I if i do not jump in and in one minute more draxy be whirling out of the dark station into the broad sunlight which dazzle she when the conductor first -- come through the car he see that draxy have be cry do she good he think to himself it always do do woman good but i 'll be bind she would not ha ' cry if i would leave she half a hour later he find she sound asleep with she head slip uneasily about on the back of the seat half ashamed of himself he bring a heavy coat and put it under she head for a pillow see a supercilious and disagreeable smile on the face of a fashionable young man in the seat before draxy he say sharply : she be come a long journey and be put under my care i guess that be true enough to pass muster he chuckle to himself as he walk away if ever i would ha ' believe a woman could make I stop this train for she a ' by george without askin ' I to either draxy sleep on for hour the winter twilight come earlier than usual for the sky be overcast when she wake the lamp be light and the conductor be bend over she saying : we be most there miss and i think you would better get steady on you foot a little before you get off for i do not calculate to make a full stop draxy laugh like a little child and put up both hand to she head as if to make sure where she be then she follow the conductor to the door and stand look out into the dim light the sharp signal for down brake make experienced passenger spring to they foot window open head be thrust out what have happen to this express train the unaccustomed sound startle the village also it be a aristocratic little place settle by wealthy man whose business be in a neighboring city at many a dinner-table surprised voice say : why what on earth be the down express stop here for something must have break some director or other to be put off say other they have it all they own way on the road in the mean time draxy miller be walk slowly up the first street she see wonder what she should do next the conductor have almost lift she off the train have shake she hand say god bless you miss and the train be go before she could be sure he hear she thank he oh why do i not thank he more before we stop think draxy i hope she 'll get she money think the conductor i would like to see the man that would not give she what she ask for so the benediction and protection of good wish from stranger as well as from friend float on the very air through which draxy walk all unconscious of the invisible blessing she walk a long way before she meet any one of whom she like to ask direction at last she see a elderly man standing under a lamp-post read a letter draxy study he face and then stop quietly by he side without speak he look up i think as soon as you have finish you letter sir i would ask you to tell I where stephen potter live it be marvelous what a ineffable charm there be in the subtle mixture of courtesy and simplicity in draxy 's manner i be go directly by he house myself and will show you reply the old gentleman pray let I take you bag miss

curiosity be strongly rouse but he forbore ask any further question until he leave draxy on the step of the house when he say : be they expect you oh no sir say draxy quietly i do not know they most extraordinary thing mutter the old gentleman as he walk on he be a lawyer and could not escape from the professional habit of look upon all uncommon incident as clew draxy miller 's heart beat faster than usual as she be show into stephen potter 's library she have say to the servant simply tell mr potter that miss miller would like to see he alone the grandeur of the house the richness of the furniture would have embarrass she except that it make she stern as she think of she father 's poverty how little a sum it must be to this man she think the name rouse no association in stephen potter for year the thought of reuben miller have not cross he mind and as he look in the face of the tall beautiful girl who rise as he enter the room he be utterly confound to hear she say -- i be reuben miller 's daughter i have come to see if you will pay I the money you owe he we be very poor and need it more than you probably can conceive stephen potter be a bad man but not a hard-hearted bad man he have be dishonest always but it be the dishonesty of a weak and unscrupulous nature not without generosity at that moment a sharp pang seize he he remember the simple upright kindly face of reuben miller he see the same look of simple uprightness kindle by strength in the beautiful face of reuben miller 's daughter he do not know what to say draxy wait in perfect composure and silence it seem to he hour before he speak then he say in a miserable shuffling way -- i suppose you think I a rich man i think you must be very rich say draxy gently then move by some strange impulse in the presence of this pure unworldly girl stephen potter suddenly speak out for the first time since he boyhood with absolute sincerity miss miller you be you father over again i reverenced you father i have wrong many man without care but it trouble I to wrong he i would give you that money to-night if i have it or could raise it i be not a rich man i have not a dollar in the world this house be not mine it may be sell over my head any day i be deep in trouble but not so deep as i deserve to be and he bury he face in he hand draxy believe he and it be true at that moment stephen potter be really a ruin man and many other be involve in the ruin which be impend draxy rise say gravely i be very sorry for you mr potter we hear that you be rich or i should not have come we be very poor but we be not unhappy as you be stay miss miller sit down i have a thing which might be of value to you father and mr potter open he safe and take out a bundle of old yellow papers here be the title to a lot of land in the northern part of new hampshire i take it on a debt year ago and never think it be worth anything very likely it have run out or the town have take possession of the land for the tax but i do think the other day that if worst come to worst i might take my wife up there and try to farm it but i would rather you father should have it if it be good for anything i take it for three thousand dollar and it ought to be worth something i will have the legal transfer make in the morning and give it to you before you leave this be not very intelligible to draxy the thin and tattered old paper look singularly worthless to she but rise again she say simply as before i be very sorry for you mr potter and i thank you for try to pay we will you let some one go and show I to the hotel where i ought to sleep stephen potter be embarrassed it cut he to the heart to send this daughter of reuben miller 's out of he house to pass the night but he fear mr potter very much he hesitate only a moment no miss miller you must sleep here i will have you show to you room at once i do not ask you to see my wife it would not be pleasant for you to do so and he ring the bell when the servant come he say -- william have a fire kindle in the blue room at once as soon as it be do come and let I know then he sit down near draxy and ask many question about she family all of which she answer with childlike candor she feel a strange sympathy for this miserable stricken wicked man when she bid he good-night she say again i be very sorry for you mr potter my father would be glad if he could help you in any way stephen potter go into the parlor where he wife sit read a novel she be a very silly frivolous woman and she care nothing for she husband but when she see he face she exclaim in terror what be it stephen only reuben miller 's daughter come two day ' journey after some money i owe she father and can not pay say stephen bitterly miller miller say mr potter one of those old canal debt yes say stephen well of course all those be outlaw long ago say she i do not see why you need worry about that she can not touch you stephen look scornfully at she she have a worse heart than he at that moment draxy 's face and voice i be very sorry for you mr potter stand out in the very air before he i suppose not say he moodily i wish she could but i shall give she a deed of a piece of new hampshire land which they may get some good of god know i hope she may and he leave the room turn back however to add she be to sleep here to-night i could not have she go to the hotel but you need take no trouble about she i should think not stephen potter exclaim mr potter sit bolt upright in she angry astonishment i never hear of such impudence as she expect -- she expect nothing i oblige she to stay interrupted stephen and be go mr potter 's first impulse be to go and order the girl out of she house but she think better of it she be often afraid of she husband at this time she dimly suspect that he be on the verge of ruin so she sink back into she chair bury herself in she novel and soon forget the interruption draxy 's breakfast and dinner be carry to she room and every provision make for she comfort stephen potter 's servant obey he always no friend of the family could have be more scrupulously serve than be draxy miller the man-servant carry she bag to the station touch he hat to she as she step on board the train and return to the house to say in the kitchen : well i do not care what she come for she be a real lady fust to last a ' that be more than mr potter 's get for a wife i tell you when stephen potter go into he library after bidding draxy good-by he find on the table a small envelope address to he it hold this note : -- mr potter : -- i would not take the paper -lrb- the word ` money ' have be scratch out and the word ` paper ' substitute -rrb- for myself but i think i ought to for my father because it be a true debt and he be a old man now and not strong i be very sorry for you mr potter and i hope you will become happy again draxy miller draxy have intend to write i hope you will be ` good ' again but she heart fail she perhaps he will understand that ` happy ' mean good she say and so write the gentler phrase stephen potter do understand and the feeble outreaching which during the few miserable year more of he life he make towards uprightness be partly the fruit of draxy miller 's word draxy 's journey home be uneventful she be sad and weary the first person she see on enter the house be she father he divine in a instant that she have be unsuccessful never mind little daughter he say gleefully i be not disappointed i know you would not get it but i think the journey would be a good thing for you may be but i have get something father dear say draxy only i be afraid it be not worth much ` taint likely to be if steve potter give it say reuben as draxy hand he the paper he laugh scornfully as soon as he look at it ` taint worth the paper it be writ on say he and he know it if he hai not look the land up all these year of course 'twa sell at vendue long ago draxy turn hastily away up to this moment she have cling to a little hope when the family be all gather together in the evening and draxy have tell the story of she adventure reuben and captain melville examine the deed together it be apparently a good clear title it be of three hundred acre of land reuben groan oh how i should like to see land by the acre once more draxy 's face turn scarlet and she lock and unlock she hand but say nothing but it be no use think about it he go on this paper be not worth a straw most likely there be more than one man well under way on the land by this time they look the place up on a atlas it be in the extreme northeast corner of new hampshire a large part of the county be still marked ungranted and the township in which this land lay be bound on the north by this uninhabited district the name of the town be clairvend what could it have be name for say draxy how pleasantly it sound most likely some frenchman say captain melville they always give name that be kind o ' musical we might as well burn the deed up it be nothing but a torment to think of it a lyin ' round with it be three hundred acre of land say reuben in a impulsive tone very rare for he and prolong the three hundred with a scornful emphasis and he spring up to throw the paper into the fire no no man say captain melville do not be so hasty no need of burn thing up in such a roomy house 's this something may come of that deed yet give it to draxy i be sure she be earn it if there be anything to it put it away for you dowry dear and he snatch the paper from reuben 's hand and toss it into draxy 's lap he do not believe what he say and the attempt at a joke bring but a faint smile to any face the paper fall on the floor and draxy let it lie there till she think she father be look another way when she pick it up and put it in she pocket for several day there be unusual silence and depression in the household they have really set far more hope than they know on this venture it be not easy to take up the old routine and forget the air castle draxy 's friend mr white be almost as disappointed as draxy herself she have not think of the chance of mr potter 's be really unable to pay she tell she husband who be a lawyer the story of the deed and he say at once : of course it be not worth a straw if potter do not pay the tax somebody else do and the land 's be sell long ago mr white try to comfort herself by engage draxy for one month 's steady sewing and present she with a set of george eliot 's novel and draxy try steadily and bravely to forget she journey and the name of clairvend about this time she write a hymn and show it to she father it be the first thing of the kind she have ever let he see and he surprise and delight show she that here be one way more in which she could brighten he life she have not think in she extreme humility that by hide she verse she be deprive he of pleasure after this she show he all she write but the secret be keep religiously between they draxy 's hymn i can not think but god must know about the thing i long for so i know he be so good so kind i can not think but he will find some way to help some way to show I to the thing i long for so i stretch my hand -- it lie so near : it look so sweet it look so dear dear lord i pray oh let I know if it be wrong to want it so he only smile -- he do not speak : my heart grow weaker and more weak with look at the thing so dear which lie so far and yet so near now lord i leave at thy love foot this thing which look so near so sweet i will not seek i will not long -- almost fear i have be wrong i 'll go and work the harder lord and wait till by some loud clear word thou callest I to thy loved foot to take this thing so dear so sweet part ii as the spring draw near a new anxiety begin to press upon draxy reuben droop the sea-shore have never suit he he pine at heart for the inland air the green field the fragrant wood this yearning always be strongest in the spring when he see the earth wake up around he but now the yearning become more than yearning it be the home-sickness of which man have die reuben say little but draxy divine all she have know it from the first but have try to hope that he could conquer it draxy spend many wakeful hour at night now the deed of the new hampshire land lay in she upper bureau drawer wrap in a old handkerchief she read it over and over and over she look again and again at the fade pink township on the old atla who know thought she but that land be overlook and forget it be so near the ` ungranted land ' which must be wilderness i suppose slowly a dim purpose struggle in draxy 's brain it would do no harm to find out but how no more journey must be take on uncertainty at last late one night the inspiration come who shall say that it be not a unseen power which sometimes suggest to sorely try human heart the one possible escape draxy be in bed she rise light she candle and write two letter then she go back to bed and sleep peacefully in the morning when she kiss she father good-by she look wistfully in he face she have never keep any secret from he before except the secret of she verse but he must not be disappoint again say draxy and there be no real hope she drop she letter into the post-office and go to she work the letter be address -- to the postmaster of clairvend new hampshire it be a very short letter dear sir : -- i wish

sentence i be reuben miller 's daughter go to he heart as it have go to every man 's heart who have hear it before from draxy 's unconscious lip but it sink deeper in he heart than in any other if baby have live she would have love I like this perhaps think the elder as he read the pathetic word over and over then he study the paragraph copy from the deed suddenly a thought flash into he mind he know something about this land it must be -- yes it must be on a part of this land that the sugar-camp lay from which he have be send for five year before to see a frenchman who be lie very ill in the little log sugar-house the elder rack he brain slowly it all come back to he he remember that at the time some ill-will have be show in the town toward this frenchman that doubt have be express about he right to the land and that no one would go out into the clearing to help take care of he occasionally since that time the elder have see the man hang about the town he have a evil look this be all the elder could remember at breakfast he say to old nancy he housekeeper : nancy do you ever know anything about that frenchman who have a sugar-camp out back of the swamp road i go to see he when he have the fever a few year ago nancy be a indian woman with a little white blood in she vein she never forget a injury this frenchman have once jeer at she from the step of the village store and the village man have laugh know anythin ' about he yes sir he be a son o ' satan a ' i reckon he stay to hum the great part o ' the year for he be never see round here except jest sugarin ' time the elder laugh in spite of himself nancy 's tongue be a member of which he strongly disapprove but he effort to enforce charity and propriety of speech upon she be sometimes render null and void by he lack of control of he feature nancy love she master but she have no reverence in she composition and nothing give she such delight as to make he laugh out against he will she go on to say that the frenchman come every spring bring with he a gang of man some twelve or more all son o ' the same father sir you would know 'em 's far 's you see 'em they take a large stock of provision go out into the maple clearing and live there during the whole sugar season in rough log hut they do say he be jest carry off a good thousand dollar 's worth o ' sugar this very week say nancy the elder bring he hand down hard on the table and say whew this be elder kinney 's one ejaculation nancy seldom hear it and she know it mean tremendous excitement she grow eager and linger hope for further question but the elder want he next information from a more accurate and trustworthy source than old nancy immediately after breakfast he set out for the village soon he slacken he pace and begin to reflect it be necessary to act cautiously he feel instinctively sure that the frenchman have not purchase the land he occupation of it have evidently be acquiesce in by the town for many year but the elder be too well aware of the slack and unbusinesslike way in which much of the town business be manage to attach much weight to this fact he be perplexed -- a rare thing for elder kinney he stop and sit down on the top of a stone wall to think in a few minute he see the steam head of a pair of ox come up the hill slowly the cart come in sight : it be load with sugar-bucket and there walk by its side be -- yes it be -- the very frenchman himself elder kinney be too much astonished even to say whew this begin to look like the lord 's own business be the first impulsive thought of he devout heart there be plainly something to be do that little draxy 's father shall get some o ' the next year 's sugar out o ' that camp or my name be not seth kinney and the elder spring from the wall and walk briskly towards the frenchman as he draw near he and see the forbid look on the fellow 's face he suddenly abandon he first intention which be to speak to he and merely bow pass on down the hill he be a villain if i know the look of one say honest elder i 'll think a little longer i wonder where he store he bucket now there be a chance and elder kinney turn about and follow the plodding cart up the hill again it be a long pull and a tedious one and for elder kinney to keep behind ox be a torture like be in a straight waistcoat one mile two mile three mile the elder half repent of he undertaking but like all wise and magnetic nature he have great faith in he first impulse and he keep on at last the cart turn into a lane on the right-hand side of the road why he be goin ' to old ike 's exclaim the elder well i can get at all old ike know and it be pretty apt to be all there be worth knowin ' and elder kinney begin in he satisfaction to whistle life be the time to serve the lord in note as clear and loud as a bob-o ' - link 's he walk on rapidly and be very near overtake the frenchman when a new thought strike he now if he be uneasy about himself -- and if he know he be not honest of course he be uneasy -- he 'll may be think i be on he track and be off to he ` hum ' as nancy call it and the elder chuckle at the memory a ' i should not have any chance of ketchin ' he here for another year the elder stand still again presently he jump a fence and walk off to the left climb a hill from the top of which he could see old ike 's house here in the edge of a spruce grove he walk back and forth watch the proceedings below seem little too much like bein ' a spy think the good man but i never feel a clearer call in a thing in my life than i do in this little girl 's letter and he fall to singing rise my soul and stretch thy wing till the crow in the wood be frighten by the strange sound and come fly out and flap they great wing above he head the frenchman drive into old ike 's yard ike come out of the house and help he unload the bucket and carry they into a old corn-house which stand behind the barn : as soon as the frenchman have turn he ox 's head down the lane the elder set out for the house across the field old ike be stand in the barn-door when he see the tall figure stride through the pasture he run to let down the bar and hurry up to the elder and grasp both he hand not in all elder kinney 's parish be there a single heart which beat so warmly for he as do the heart of this poor lonely old man who have live by himself in this solitary valley ever since the elder come to clairvend oh elder elder say he it do I reel good to see you face be ye well sir look closely at he yes ike thank you i be always well reply the elder absently he be too absorb

dishonest people prosper very long we shall see what become of ganew where do he live i would like to see he well he do not live nowhere 's near 's anybody can find out he be in the camp with the gang

unhappy he be get somethin' on he mind thet 's plain enough think the loving old soul i wonder now ef it be a woman i have allus think the elder war ` nt no sort of man to live alone all he day dear good little draxy think the elder as he walk down the road how shall i ever tell the child of this good luck and how shall i manage it all for the best for she draxy 's interest be in good hand before night elder kinney have ascertain that there have never be any sale of this land since it be sell to the new york chap and that ganew 's occupation of it be illegal after tea the elder sit down and write two letter the first one be to draxy and run as follow : -- my dear child : -- i receive you letter last night and by the lord 's help i have find out all about you father 's land today but i shall write to you father about it for you could not understand i wish the lord have see fit to give I just such a daughter as you be you friend seth kinney the letter to reuben be very long give in substance the fact which have be tell above and conclude thus : -- i feel a great call from the lord to do all i can in this business and i hope you will not take it amiss if i make bold to decide what be best to be do without consult you this fellow 's get to be deal with pretty sharp and i be on the ground can look after he better than you can but i 'll guarantee that you 'll have possession of that land before many week he then ask reuben to have a exact copy of the deed make out and forward to he also any other papers which might throw light on the transfer of the property sixteen year back not that i calculate there 'll be any trouble he add we do not deal much in lawyer 's trick up here but it be just as well to be provide the elder go to the post-office before breakfast to post this letter the address do not escape the eye of the postmaster before noon eben hill know that the elder have write right off by the first mail to a miss draxy miller meantime the elder be sit in the doorway of old ike 's barn wait for the frenchman ten o'clock come eleven twelve -- he do not appear the elder 's uneasiness grow great but he talk on and on till poor ike be beside himself with delight at last the distant creak of the wheel be hear there he be exclaim ike i be think sir that it be a kind o ' providential dispensation thet 's hendered he all this time it be do I such a sight o ' good to hear you talk the elder smile tenderly on poor old ike everything be a dispensation ike accordin ' to my way o ' thinkin ' and again he think involuntarily of little draxy ganew assent with a half-surly civility to elder kinney 's proposition to ride down with he i have get a matter of business to talk over with you mr ganew -- say the elder and i come up here on purpose to find you the man turn he stolid black eye full on the elder but make no reply it be indeed a evil face the elder be conscious that impulse which he fear be unchristian be rise rapidly in he breast he have wish a few time before in he life that he be not a minister he wish it now he would have like to open he conversation with ganew after the manner of the world 's people when they deal with thief and again he think involuntarily of little draxy and she touching we be very poor but when he speak he speak gently and slowly i have some news for you which will be very disagreeable mr ganew here the frenchman start with such a terrify guilty malignant look on he face that the elder say to himself : good god i believe the man know he be in danger of he life stealin 's the least of he crime i 'll venture he proceed still more gently the owner of the land which you have be use as you own in this town have write to inquire about it and have put the business in my hand ganew be silent for a moment then try to speak in a indignant tone he say -- use as my own i do not know what you mean mr parson i have pay my tax all regular and i have get the title-deed of the land every acre of it i can not help whoever be be write to you about it it be all my land but he face twitch with nervous excitement and the fright and anger in he serpent-like black eye be ugly to see no mr ganew it be not say the elder and you know it now you jest listen to I i know the whole truth about the matter a ' all the time you spend fightin ' off the truth 'll be waste besides addin ' lyin ' to havin ' be a thief the owner of the land 'll be here i expect before long but they have put it all in my hand a ' i can let you off if i choose let I off what the devil do you mean say ganew why you do not suppose there be goin ' to be nothin ' say about all the thousand o ' dollar ' wuth of sugar you have carry off here do -- the next thing elder kinney know he be struggle up to he foot in the middle of the road he be nearly blind by blood trickle from a cut on he forehead and only see dimly that ganew be aim another blow at he with he heavy-handled ox-goad but the frenchman have reckon without he host elder kinney even half stunned be more than a match for he in a very few minute ganew be lie in the bottom of he own ox-cart with he hand securely tie behind he with a bit of he own rope and the elder be sit calmly down on a big boulder wipe he forehead and recover he breath it have be a ugly tussle and the elder be out of practice presently he rise walk up to the cart and lean both he arm on the wheel look down on he enemy the frenchman 's murderous little black eye roll wildly but he do not struggle he have feel in the first instant that he be but a infant in the elder 's hand ye poor miserable cowardly french -- sinner ye say the elder struggle for a epithet not unbecome he cloth do you think you be goin ' to get I out o ' yer way 's easy 's that be i dare say ye have better folk than I before now ganew mutter something in a tongue the elder do not understand but the sound of it kindle he wrath anew well call on you master if that be what you be doin ' 's much 's you like he do not generally look out for anybody much who be so big a fool 's you must be to think you be goin ' to leave the minister o ' this parish dead in a ditch within stone 's throw o ' house and nobody find you out and the elder sit down again on the boulder he feel very dizzy and faint and the blood still trickle steadily from he forehead ganew 's face at this moment be horrible rage at he own folly hate of the elder and terror which be uncontrollable all contend on he livid feature at last he speak he beg abjectly to be set free he offer to leave the town at once and never return if the elder would only let he go what a ' give up all you land ye have get such a fine clear title to say the elder sarcastically no we 'll give ye a title there will not be no disputin ' about to a good berth in mill creek jail for a spell at this the terror master every other emotion in the frenchman 's face what secret reason he have for it all no one could know but himself what iniquitous scheme already wait he in other place what complication of danger attendant on he identification and detention he beg he beseech in word so wildly implore so full of utter unconditional surrender that there could be no question as to they sincerity the elder begin in spite of himself to pity the wretch he begin also to ask whether after all it would not be the part of policy to let he go after some minute he say i can not say i put much confidence in ye yet mr ganew but i be inclined to think it be the lord 's way o ' smoothin ' thing for some o ' he child to let you kind o ' slink off and somehow elder kinney fancy he hear little draxy say oh sir let the poor man go there be something marvelous in he under-current of consciousness of little draxy he rise to he foot pick up the heavy ox-goad strike the near ox sharply on the side and walk on a little ahead of the team say : i 'll just take ye down a piece mr ganew till we be in sight of jim blair 's before i undo ye i reckon the presence o ' a few folk 'll strengthen you good resolution a ' i mistrust i be not quite equal to another handlin ' think the elder to himself as he note how the sunny road seem to go up and down under he foot he be really far more hurt than he know when they be in sight of the house he stop the ox and lean again on the wheel and look down on ganew have one more talk with he at the end of which he begin cautiously to untie the rope he hold the ox-goad however firmly grasp in he right hand and it be not without a little tremor that he loose the last knot suppose the desperate critter sh would have a knife think the elder he need not have fear a more crestfallen subdue wretched be than paul ganew as he crawl out of that cart be never see he have he own secret terror and it have conquer he it be more 'n I he be afraid of say the elder to himself this be the lord 's doin ' i reckon now mr ganew if you 'll jest walk to the head o ' they oxen i 'll thank ye say he : a ' 's i feel some tired i 'll jump into the cart a ' i 'll save ye carryin ' the ox-goad he add as he climb slowly in still hold the murderous weapon in he hand nothing could extinguish seth kinney 's sense of humor if we meet any folk he proceed we have only to say that i have have a bad hurt and that you be very kindly takin ' I home ganew walk on like a man in a dream he be nearly paralyze with terror they meet no human being and very few word pass between they when the cart stop at the elder 's door ganew stand still without turn he head the elder go up to he and say with real kindness of tone mr ganew i expect you can not believe it but i do not bear ye the least ill-will a faint flicker of something like grateful surprise pass over the hard face but no word come i hope the lord 'll bring ye to himself yet persist the good man and forgive I for havin ' have anything but pity for ye from the first o not ye will not forget to send I a write for bill sim that the rest of the bucket in the camp belong to I ganew nod sullenly and go on and the elder walk slowly into the house after dark a package be leave at the elder 's door it contain the order on bill sim and a letter some of the information in the letter prove useful in clear up the mystery of ganew 's have know of this tract of land he have be in potter 's employ it seem and have have access to he papers what else the letter tell no one ever know but the elder 's face always have a horror-stricken look when the frenchman 's name be mention and when people sometimes wonder if he would ever be see again in clairvend the emphasis of the elder 's never ye may rely on that never have something solemn in it in less than forty-eight hour the whole village know the story the sooner they know the whole o not the better and the sooner they 'll be through talkin ' say the elder and nobody could have accuse he of be close-mouthed now he even show the little gal 's letter as the townspeople call it to anybody who ask to see it it hurt he to do this more than he could see reason for but he feel a strong desire to have the village heart all ready to welcome little draxy and she father when they should come and the village heart be ready hardly a man woman or child but know she name and rejoice in she good fortune do not yer remember my tellin ' yer that night say josiah bailey to eben hill that she would come to the right place for help when she come to elder kinney when draxy take elder kinney 's letter out of the post-office she hand tremble she walk rapidly away and open the letter as soon as she reach a quiet street the elder have not make it so clear as he think he have in he letter to the child which way matter have go draxy fear presently she think he say ` you father 's land ' that must mean that we shall have it but still she have sad misgiving she almost decide to read the inclosed letter which be unsealed she could not have she father disappoint again but she keen sense of honor restrain she reuben have grow really feeble there be many day now when he could not work but sit listlessly on a ledge of rock near the house and watch the restless wave with a sense of misery as restless as they when draxy reach home this night and find that she father be not in the house she run over to the black ledge there she find he she sit down by he side not know how to begin presently he say : i wish i love this water daughter -- it be very beautiful to look at but i be thinkin ' it be somethin' like human being they may be ever so handsome to look on but if you do not love 'em you do not and that be the end o not a ' it do not do ye no sort o ' good to be where they be the wood and field use to do you good father say draxy reuben be astonished draxy be not wont to allude to the lose and irrecoverable joy but he only sigh read this letter father dear say draxy hurriedly push it into he hand i write up to a good old minister to find out and here be he answer reuben look bewildered draxy 's word do not make themselves clear but the first word of elder kinney 's letter do the paper fall from he hand oh daughter daughter it can not be true it can not and reuben miller cover he eye and cry draxy do not cry one of the finest trait in she nature be she instantaneous calmness of exterior under sudden and intense excitement yes father it be true it must be i have believe it from the first oh do do read the letter say draxy and she force the letter into he hand again no no daughter read it to I i can not see the word reply reuben still weep he be utterly unmanned then draxy read the letter aloud slowly distinctly calmly she voice do not tremble she accept it all absolutely unconditionally as she have accept everything which have ever happen to she in draxy 's soul the past never confuse the present she life go on from moment to moment from step to step as naturally as clearly as irrevocably as plant grow and flower without hinderance without delay this it be which have keep she serene strong : this be true health of nature after a time reuben grow calmer draxy 's presence always help he they sit on the rock until twilight fall and the great red lamp in the light-house be light father dear say draxy i think there be light-house all along we life and god know when it be time to light the lamp reuben clasped draxy 's hand tighter and turn he eye upon she with a look whose love be almost reverent light shine until morning from the window of captain melville 's house the little family have sit together until long after midnight discuss this new and wonderful turn in they affair jane and reuben be bewilder and hardly happy yet draxy be alert enthusiastic ready as usual poor captain melville and he wife be in sore strait between they joy in the miller ' good fortune and they pain at the prospect of the break up of the family they life together have be so beautiful so harmonious oh draxy say the captain how shall we ever live without you oh but you will come up there uncle say draxy and we shall keep you after we once get you captain melville shake he head he could never leave the sea but full well he know that the very salt of it would have lose its best savor to he when this sweet fair girl have go out from he house the good-night be sadly and solemnly say oh think draxy do joy always bring pain in this world and she fall asleep with tear on she cheek reuben sit up until near dawn write to elder kinney he feel strangely strong he be half cure already by the upland air of the field he have never see the next morning draxy say do you not think father i ought to write a note too to thank the kind minister or will you tell he how grateful i be put a postscript to my letter daughter that will be better say reuben so draxy write at the bottom of the last page : -- dear mr kinney : -- i do not know any word to thank you in and i think you will like it better if i do not try my father seem almost well already i be sure it be the lord that help you to find out about we land i hope we can come very soon you grateful friend draxy miller when the elder read this second note of draxy 's he say aloud god bless she she be one o ' he chosen one that child be and he fall to wonder how she look he find himself picture she as slight and fair with blue eye and hair of a pale yellow i do not believe she be more than fourteen at most think he she speak so simple jest like a child a ' yet she go right to the pint 's straight 's any woman though i do not know come to think o not 's ever i know a woman that could go straight to a pint reflect the elder whose patience be often sorely try by the wander and garrulous female tongue in he parish the picture of little draxy grow strangely distinct in he mind and he heart yearn towards she with a yearning akin to that which year before he have feel over the little silent form of the daughter whose eye have never look into he there be no trouble with the town in regard to the land if there have be any doubt elder kinney 's vigorous championship of the new claimant would have put they down but the sympathy of the entire community be enlist on reuben 's side the whole story from first to last appeal to every man 's heart and there be not a father in town that do not rest he hand more lovingly on he little girl 's head at night when he sit in he door-way talk over they miller and tell about draxy 's writin ' to th ' elder before the first of may all be settle elder kinney have urge mr miller to come at once to he house and make it a home until he could look about and decide where he would establish himself i be a lonely man he write i bury my wife and only child many year ago and have live here ever since with only a old indian woman to take care of I i do not want to press you against you will and there be a house in the village that you can hire but it will go against I sorely not to have you in my house at the first i want to see you and to see you little daughter i can not help feeling as if the lord have lay out for we to be friend more than common reuben hesitate the shyness of he nature make he shrink from other man 's house but draxy inclined strongly to the elder 's proposition oh think father how lonely he must be suppose you have not mother nor I father dear and draxy kiss she father 's cheek and think how glad you have be that you come to live with uncle she add reuben look lovingly at captain melville but say nothing i 'll tell ye what i think reuben say the captain it be my belief that you 'n that parson 'll take to each other he letter sound like you talk somehow i have get a uncommon respect for that man considerin ' he be a parson : it be my advice to ye to take up with he offer and it seem no more than polite father persist draxy : after he have do so much for we we need not say how long we will stay in he house you know supposin ' you go up first draxy say reuben hesitatingly a ' see how ` tis i always do hate injun oh say draxy she have hardly observe the mention of that feature in the elder 's household and she laugh outright she idea of the ancestral savage be too vague to be very alarming if she have live all these year with this good old minister she must be civilized and kind say draxy i be not afraid of she but i think it would be a great deal better for I to go first she continue more and more impressed with the new idea then i can be sure beforehand about everything and get thing all in order for you and there 'll be mr kinney to take care of I i feel as if he be a kind of father to everybody and draxy in she turn begin to wonder about the elder 's appearance as he have wonder about hers she mental picture be quite as unlike the truth as be he she fancy he not unlike she father but much older with a gentle face and float white hair dim purpose of how she might make he lonely old age more cheerful float before she mind it must be awful thought she to live year and year all alone with a indian when elder kinney read reuben 's letter say that they would send they daughter up first to decide what would be best for they to do he bring he hand down hard on the table and say whew again well i do declare think he to himself i be afraid they be dreadful shiftless folk to send that girl way up here all alone by herself and how 's such a child 's that goin ' to decide anything i should like to know he read again the letter reuben have write my daughter be very young but we lean upon she as if she be older she have help we bear all we misfortune and we have more confidence in she opinion than in we own about everything the elder be displeased lean on she ' i should think you do poor little girl well i can look out for she that be one comfort and the elder write a short note to the effect that he would meet they child at the railway station which be six mile from they town that he would do all he could to help she and that he hope soon to see mr and mr miller under he roof the word of the note be most friendly but there be a indefinable difference between it and all the other which draxy feel without know that she feel it and she last word to she father as she bid he good-by from the car window be : i do not feel so sure as i do about we stay with mr kinney father you leave it all to I do you dear even if i decide to buy a house yes daughter say reuben heartily all nothing but good 's ever come yet of you way o ' doin ' thing a ' i do not in the least hanker after that injun he call out as the car begin to move draxy laugh merrily reuben be a new man already they be very gay together and feel wonderfully little fear for people to whom life have be thus far so hard there be not a misgiving in draxy 's heart as she set out again on a two day ' journey to a unknown place oh how different from the day when i start before she think as she look out on the water sparkling under the bright may sun she spend the first night as before at the house of captain melville 's brother and set out at eight the follow morning to ride for ten hour steadily northward the day be like a day of June the spring be open early already fruit-tree be white and pink bank be green and bird be noisy by noon mountain come in sight draxy be spellbound they be grander than the sea think she and i never dream it and they be loving too i should like to rest my cheek on they as she draw nearer and nearer and see some top still white with snow she heart beat faster and with a sudden pang almost of conscience-stricken remorse she exclaim oh i shall never never once miss the sea elder kinney have borrow eben hill 's horse and wagon to drive over for draxy he be at the station half a hour before the train be due it have be year since the steady current of he life have be so disturbed and hurry as they be by this little girl look like rain elder i ` spect she 'll have to go over with I arter all say george thayer the handsomest best-natured stage-driver in the whole state of new hampshire the elder glance anxiously at the sky no i guess not george he reply ` two not be anything more 'n a shower a ' i have get a umbrella and a buffalo-robe i can keep she dry everybody at the station know draxy 's story and know that the elder have come to meet she when the train stop all eye eagerly scan the passenger who step out on the platform two man a boy and three woman one after the other it be but a moment and the train be off again she hai not come exclaimed voice after voice the elder say nothing he have stand a little apart from the crowd watch for he ideal draxy as soon as he see that she be not there he have fall into a perplexed reverie as to the possible cause of she detention he be sorely anxious about the child jest 's like 's not she never change car down at the junction think he a ' 's half way to montreal by this time and the elder feel hot with resentment against reuben miller meantime beautiful dignified and unconscious draxy stand on the platform quietly look at face after face seek for the white hair and gentle eye of she trust friend the old minister george thayer with the quick instinct

feel draxy 's simplicity and child-like truthfulness more and more with each word she speak but she quiet dignity of manner be something to which he be unused to he inexperience she seem almost a fine lady in spite of she sweet and guileless speech draxy on the other hand be a little repel by the elder 's whole appearance he be a rougher man than she have know he pronunciation grate on she ear and he look so strong and dark she feel a sort of fear of he but the next morning when draxy come down in she neat calico gown and white apron the elder 's face brighten good morning my child he say you

be more himself this morning all be well draxy sit down to breakfast with a lighter heart when draxy be sit she look very young she face be as childlike as it be beautiful : and she attitude be all singularly unconscious and free it be when she rise that she womanhood reveal itself to the perpetual surprise of every one as breakfast go on the elder gradually regain he old feeling about she he nature be as simple as spontaneous as hers he call she child again several time in the course of the meal but when at the end of it draxy rise tall erect almost majestic in she fullness of stature he feel again singularly remove from she ` ud puzzle any man to say whether she be a child or a woman say the elder to himself but he face shone with pleasure as he walk by she side out into the little front yard draxy be speechless with delight in the golden east stretch a long range of mountain purple to the top down in the valley a mile below the elder 's house lay the village a little shine river run side by side with its main street to the north be high hill some dark green and wood some of brown pasture land oh sir say draxy be there any other spot in you mountain land so beautiful as this no not one say the elder not one and he too look out silently on the scene presently draxy exclaim with a sigh oh it make I feel like cry to think of my father 's see this shall i tell you now about my father sir she continue you ought to know all about we you have be so good then sit on the low step of the door while the elder sit in a arm-chair in the porch draxy tell the story of she father 's life and unconsciously of she own more than once the elder wipe he eye more than once he rise and walk up and down before the door gaze with undefined but intense emotion at this woman tell she pathetic story with the simple-hearted humility of a child draxy look younger than ever curl up in the doorway with she hand lie idle on she white apron the elder be on the point of stroke she hair suddenly she rise and say but i be take too much of you time sir will you take I now to see the house you speak of which we could hire she be again the majestic young woman the elder be again throw back and puzzle he try to persuade she to give up all idea of hire the house : to make he house they home for the present but she reply steadfastly i must look at the house sir before i decide they walk down into the village together draxy be utterly unconscious of observation but the elder know only too well that every eye of clairvend be at some window-pane study he companion 's face and figure all whom they meet stare so undisguisedly that fear draxy would be annoyed he say -- you must not mind the folk stare so at you you see they have be talkin ' the matter all over about the land a ' you comin ' for a month a ' it be no more than natural they should want to know how you look and he too look admiringly at draxy 's face oh say draxy -lrb- it be a new idea to she mind -rrb- i never think of that i hope they be all glad we be come sir add she a moment after oh yes yes they be glad enough ` taint often anything happen up here you know and they have all think everything of you since you first letter come draxy color she have not dream of take a whole village into she confidence but she be glad of the friendliness and she meet every inquisitive gaze after this with a open responsive look of such beam good-will that she make friend of all whom she see one or two stop and speak most be afraid to do so unconsciously repel as the elder have be at first by something in draxy 's dress and bearing which to they extreme inexperience suggest the fine lady nothing could have be plainer than draxy 's cheap gray gown but she dress always have character : the tiniest knot of ribbon at she throat assume the look of a decoration and many a lady for whom she work have envy she the expression of she simple clothes the house would not answer draxy shake she head as soon as she see it and when the elder tell she that in the spring freshet the river wash into the lower story she turn instantly away and say let we go home sir i must think of something else at dinner draxy be preoccupy and anxious the expression of perplexity make she look older but no less beautiful elder kinney gaze at she more steadily than he know and he do not call she child again after dinner he take she over the house explain to she at every turn how useless most of the room be to he in truth the house be admirably adapt for two family with the exception that there be but one kitchen but that could be build on in a very few day and would cost very little say the elder eagerly already all the energy of he strong nature be kindle by the resolve to keep draxy under he roof i suppose it might be so build that it could be easily move off and add to we own house when we build for ourselves say draxy reflectively oh yes say the elder no sort o ' trouble about that and he glow with delight he feel sure that he cause be gain but he find draxy very inflexible there be but one arrangement of which she would think for a moment it be that the elder should let to they one half of he house and that the two family should be entirely distinct until the new kitchen and out-building be finish if the elder would consent to take they as boarder they would live with he otherwise sir i must find some one in the village who will take we say draxy in a quiet tone which elder kinney know instinctively be not to be argue with it be a novel experience for the elder in more way than one he be use to have he parishioner especially the woman yield implicitly to he advice this gentle-voiced girl who say to he do not you think sir in a appealing tone which make he blood quicken but who afterward when she disagree with he stand she ground immovably even against entreaty be a phenomenon in he life he begin to stand in awe of she when some one say to he on the third day after draxy 's arrival : well elder i do not know what she have ha ' do without you he reply emphatically do without I you 'll find out that all reuben miller 's daughter want of anybody be jest to let she know exactly how thing lay she be not beholden to anybody for opinion she be as trustin ' as a baby while you be tellin ' she fact but i would like to see anybody make she change she mind about what be best to be do and i reckon she be generally right what be more she be one of the lord 's favorite a ' he be not above guidin ' in small thing no mor 'n in great no wonder elder kinney be astonish in forty-eight hour draxy have rent one half of he house make a contract with a carpenter for the building of a kitchen and out-building on the north side of it engage board at the elder 's table for she parent and herself for a month and hire bill sim to be she father 's head man for one year all the while she seem as modestly grateful to the elder as if he have do it all for she on the afternoon of the second day she say to he : -- now sir what be the nearest place for I to buy we furniture why be not you goin ' to use mine -- at least 's far be it go say the poor elder i think that be in the bargain draxy look disturbed oh how careless of I she say i be afraid nothing be say about it but we can not do that my father would dislike it and as we must have furniture for we new house we might as well have it now i have seven hundred dollar with I sir father think i might decide to buy a house and have to pay something down please do not be angry with I she add pleadingly for the elder look vex you know if i be sure my father would prefer a thing i must do it the elder be disarm well if you be set on buyin ' furniture he say i should not wonder if you would have a chance to buy all you would want cheap down at squire william 's sale in mill creek he wife die the night you first letter come a ' i hear somebody say he be goin ' to sell all out a ' they have always be well-to-do the williams a ' i reckon you would fancy some o ' they thing better 'n anything you would get at the store already the elder begin to divine draxy 's taste to feel that she have finer need than the woman he have know in less than a hour he be at the door with eben hill 's horse and wagon to take draxy to squire william 's house jest more o ' the same providence that follow that girl think he when he see draxy 's eye fairly dilate with pleasure as he lead she into the old-fashioned parlor where the furniture be pile and crowd ready for the auction oh will they not cost too much for I dear mr kinney whisper draxy no i guess not he say there be not much biddin ' at these sort of sale up here and he mentally resolve that nothing draxy want should cost too much for she the sale be to be the next day draxy make a careful list of the thing she would like to buy the elder be to come over and bid they off for she now you just go over 'em again say the elder and mark off what you would like to have if they do not cost anything because sometimes thing go for 's good 's nothing if nobody happen to want 'em so draxy make a second list and laugh a little girlish laugh as she hand the papers to the elder pointed to the word must haves at the head of the first list and would-like-to-haves at the head of the second the elder put they both in he breast-pocket and he and draxy drive home the next night two great load of squire william 's furniture be carry into elder kinney 's house as article after article be take in draxy clap she hand and almost scream with delight all she would-like-to-haves be there oh the clock the clock have i really get that too she exclaim and she turn to the elder half cry and say how shall i ever thank you sir the elder be uncomfortable he be in a dilemma he have not be able to resist buy the clock for draxy he dare not tell she what he have pay for it she would never let I give she a cent 's worth i know that well enough it would be just like she to make I take it back think he luckily draxy be too absorb in she new riches all the next day to ask for she account and by the next night the elder have deliberately resolve to make false return on he papers as to the price of several article i 'll tell she all about it one o ' these day when she know I better he comfort himself by think i never do think anania be a out a ' out liar it could not be deny that all he do say be true and the elder resolutely and successfully try to banish the subject from he mind by think about draxy the furniture be much of it valuable old mahogany dark in color and quaint in shape draxy could hardly contain herself with delight as she see the expression it give to the room it have cost so little that she venture to spend a small sum for muslin curtain new papers bright chintz and shelf here and there when all be do she herself be astonish at the result the little home be truly lovely oh sir my father have never have a pretty home like this in all he life say she to the elder who stand in the doorway of the sitting-room look with half-pained wonder at the transformation he feel rather than see how lovely the room look he could not help be glad to see draxy so glad but he feel farther remove from she by this power of hers to create what he could but dimly comprehend already he unconsciously weigh all thing in new balance already he begin to have a strange sense of humility in the presence of this woman ten day from the day that draxy arrive in clairvend she drive over with the elder to meet she father and mother at the station she have arrange that the elder should carry she father back in the wagon she and she mother would go in the stage she count much on the long pleasant drive through the wood as a open to the acquaintance between she father and the elder she have be too busy to write any but the briefest letter home and have say very little about he to she last note she have add a post-script -- i be sure you will like mr kinney father he be very kind and very good but he be not old as we think to the elder she say as they drive over i think you will love my father sir and i know you will do he good but he will not say much at first you will have to talk and draxy smile the elder and she understand each other very well i do not think there be much danger o ' my not lovin ' he reply the elder by all you tell he must be uncommon lovable draxy turn on he such a beam smile that he could not help add a ' i should think he bein ' you father be enough draxy look seriously in he face and say oh mr kinney i be not anything by the side of father the elder 's eye twinkle it be a silent though joyful group which gather around the elder 's tea-table that night reuben and jane be tired bewildered but they eye rest on draxy with perpetual smile draxy also smile more than she speak the elder feel himself half out of place and wish to go away but draxy look grieve at he proposal to do so and he stay but nobody could eat and old nancy who have spend she utmost resource on the supper be cruelly disappointed she bustle in and out on various pretens but at last could keep silence no longer seem to I ye have dreadful slim appetite for folk that be be travellin ' all day perhaps ye do not like yer victuals she say glance sharply at reuben oh yes madame yes say poor reuben nervously everything be very nice much nicer than i be use to draxy laugh aloud my father never eat when he be tired nancy you 'll see how he 'll eat to-morrow after nancy have leave the room reuben wipe he forehead and draxy laugh again in spite of herself old nancy have be so kind and willing in help she she have grow fond of she and have quite forget she father 's dread when reuben bid draxy good-night he say under he breath i like you elder very much daughter but i do not know how i be ever goin ' to stand livin ' with that injun my elder say draxy to herself as she go up-stair he be everybody 's elder -- and the lord 's most of all i think and she go to sleep thinking of the solemn word which she have hear he speak on the last Sunday it be strange how soon the life of the new household adjust itself how full the day be and how swift the summer be close upon they reuben 's old farmer instinct and habit revive in full force bill sim prove a most efficient helper he have be draxy 's swear knight from the moment of she first interview with he there would be work on reuben 's farm for many hand but reuben be in no haste the sugar camp assure he of a income which be wealth to they simple need and he wish to act advisedly and cautiously in undertake new enterprise all the land be wild land -- much of it deep swamp the maple orchard be the only part immediately profitable the village people come at once to see they everybody be touch by jane 's worn face and gentle way she silence do not repel they everybody like draxy too and admire she but many be a little afraid of she the village man have say that she be the smartest woman that have ever set foot in clairvend village and human nature be human nature it would take a great deal of draxy 's kindly good-will to make she sister woman forgive she for be cleverer than they draxy and reuben be inseparable they drive they walk even into the swamp courageous draxy penetrate with she father and bill sim as they go about survey the land and it be draxy 's keen instinct which in many case suggest where improvement could be make in the mean time elder kinney 's existence have become transform he dare not to admit himself how much it mean this new delight in simply be alive for back of he delight lurk a desperate fear he dare not move day after day he spend more and more time in the company of draxy and she father reuben and he be fast become close friend reuben 's gentle trustful nature find repose in the elder 's firm sturdy downrightness much as it have in captain melville 's and the elder would have love reuben if he have not be draxy 's father but to draxy he seem to draw no nearer she be the same frank affectionate merry puzzling woman-child that she have be at first yet as he see more and more how much she know of book which he do not know of people and of affair of which he have never hear -- how fluently graciously and even wisely she could talk he feel himself cut off from she she sweet low tone and distinct articulation tortured he while they fascinate he they seem to set she so apart in fact each separate charm she have produce in the poor elder 's humble heart a mixture of delight and pain which could not be analyze and could not long be bear he exaggerate all he own defect of manner and speech and education he feel uncomfortable in draxy 's presence in spite of all the affectionate reverence with which she treat he he say to himself fifty time a day it be only my bein ' a minister that make she think anythin ' o ' I the elder be fast grow wretched but draxy be happy she be still in some way more child than woman she peculiar training have leave she imagination singularly free from fancy concern love and marriage the elder be a central interest in she life she would have say instantly and cordially that she love he dearly she see he many time every day she know all he outgoing and incoming she know the first step of he foot on the threshold she feel that he belong to they and they to he yet as a woman think of the man whose wife she long to be draxy have never once think of elder kinney but when the new kitchen be finish and the miller enter on they separate housekeeping a change come as reuben and jane and draxy sit down for the first time alone together at they tea-table reuben say cheerily : -- now this seem like old time this be nice yes reply jane draxy do not speak reuben look at she she color suddenly deeply and say with desperate honesty -- yes father but i can not help think how lonely mr kinney must be well i declare say reuben conscience-stricken i suppose he must be i hate to think o not but we 'll have he in here 's often 's he 'll come just the other side of the narrow entry sit the elder lean both he elbow on the table and look over at the vacant place where the night before and for thirty night before draxy have sit it be more than he could bear he spring up and leave he supper untasted walk out of the house draxy hear he go draxy have pass in that moment into a new world she divine all he have not eat any supper think she and she listen intently to hear he come in again the clock strike ten he have not return draxy go to bed but she could not sleep the little house be still the warm white moonlight lay like summer snow all over it draxy look out of she window the elder be slowly come up the hill draxy kneel down like a little child and say god bless he and creep back to bed when she hear he shut he bedroom door she go to sleep the next day draxy 's eye do not look as they have look the day before when elder kinney first see she she be come down stair he be stand at the foot of the staircase and wait to say good morning as he look up at she he start back and exclaim : why draxy what be the matter nothing be the matter sir say draxy as she step from the last stair and standing close in front of he lift the new sweet softened eye up to he draxy be as simple and sincere in this as in all other emotion and act of she life she have no coquetry in she nature she have no distinct thought either of a new relation between herself and the elder she simply feel a new oneness with he and she could not have understand the suggestion of concealment if elder kinney have be a man of the world he would have fold draxy to he heart that instant if he have be even a shade less humble and self-disrustful he would have do it as it be but he never dream that he might he fold he empty arm very tight over he faithful ache foolish heart and try to say calmly and naturally be you sure seem to I you do not look quite well but after that morning he never feel wholly without hope he could not tell precisely why draxy do not seek he do not avoid he she be perhaps a little less merry say fewer word but she look glad and more than glad i think it be the eye he say to himself again and again as he try to analyze the new look on draxy 's face which give he hope these be sweet day there be subtle joy for lover who dwell side by side in one house together and yet apart the very air be load with significance to they -- the door the window the stairway always there be hope of meeting always there be consciousness of presence everywhere a mysterious sense that the loved one have pass by more than once seth kinney knelt and lay he cheek on the stair which draxy 's foot have just ascended often sweet guileless draxy think as she go up and down ah the dear foot that go over these stair one day the elder as he pass by the wall of the room where he know draxy be sit brush he great hand and arm against it so heavily that she start think he have stumble but as the firm step go on without pause she smile she hardly know why the next time he do it she lay down she work lock and unlock she hand and look toward the door whisper under she breath dear hand finally this become almost a habit of he he do not at first think draxy would hear it but he feel as he afterwards tell she like a great affectionate dog go by she door and that be all he could do he would have like to lie down on the rug these be very sweet day spite of he misgiving elder kinney be happy and draxy in spite of she unconsciousness seem to herself to be live in a blissful dream but a sweeter day come one Saturday evening reuben say to draxy -- daughter i have do somethin' i be afraid 'll trouble you i have tell th ' elder about you verse a ' show he the hymn you write when you be tryin ' to give it all up about the land oh father how could you gasp draxy and she look as if she would cry reuben could not tell just how it happen it seem to have come out before he know it and after it have he could not help show the hymn draxy be very seriously disturbed but she try to conceal it from she father and the subject be drop the next morning elder kinney preach -- it seem to he people -- as he never preach before he subject be self-renunciation and he speak as one who see the wave palm of the martyr and hear they shout of joy there be few dry eye in the little meeting-house tear roll down draxy 's face but she look up suddenly on hearing elder kinney say in a unsteady voice -- my bretherin i be goin ' to read to you now a hymn which come nigher to expressin ' my idea of the kind of resignation god like than any hymn that be ever be write or print in any hymn-book and then he begin : -- i can not think but god must know etc draxy 's first feeling be one of resentment but it be a very short-lived one the earnest tone the solemn stillness of the wonder people the peaceful summer air float in at the open window -- all lift she out of herself and make she glad to hear she own hymn read by the man she love for the worship of god but she surprise be still greater when the choir begin to sing the line to a quaint old methodist tune they have be provide with written copy of the hymn and have practice it so faithfully that they sing it well draxy break down and sob for a few moment so that elder kinney be on the point of forget everything and spring to she side he have not suppose that anything in the world could so overthrow draxy 's composure he do not know how much less strong she nerve be now than they have be two month before after church draxy walk home alone very rapidly she do not wish to see any one she be glad that she father and mother have not be there she could not understand the tumult of she feeling at twilight she steal out of the back door of the house and walk down to a little brook which run near by as she stand lean against a young maple tree she hear step and without look up know that the elder be come she do not move nor speak he wait some minute in silence then he say oh draxy i never once think o ' painin ' you i think you would like it hymn be make to be sing dear and that one o ' yours be so beautiful he speak as gently as she father might and in a voice she hardly know draxy make no reply the elder have never see she like this she lip quiver and he see tear in she eye oh draxy do look up at I -- just once you do not know how hard it be for a man to think he be hurt anybody -- like you stammer the poor elder end he sentence quite differently from what he have intend draxy smile through she tear and look up say : but i be not hurt mr kinney i do not know what i be cry for sir and she eye fall again the elder look down upon she in silence moment pass oh if i could make she look up at I again he think he unspoken wish stir she vein slowly she lift she eye they be calm now and unutterably loving they be more than the elder could bear oh draxy draxy exclaim he stretch out both he arm towards she my heart grow weaker and more weak with look on the thing so dear which lie so far and yet so near slowly very slowly like a little child learn to walk with she eye full of tear but she mouth smile draxy move towards the elder he do not stir partly because he could not but partly because he would not lose one instant of the deliciousness of see she feeling she come when they go back to the house reuben be sit in the porch the elder take he hand and say : mr miller i mean to have ask you first but god do not give I time reuben smile you have 's good 's ask I a good while back elder a ' i take it you haint ever have much doubt what my answer would be then as draxy kneel down by he chair and lay she head on he shoulder he add more solemnly -- but i would jest like once to say to ye elder that if ever i get to heaven i would not ask anythin ' more o ' the lord than to let I see draxy 'n' you a comin ' in together a ' lookin ' as you look jest now when ye come i not that gate the elder 's wife sequel to draxy miller 's dowry part i draxy and the elder be marry in the little village church on the first Sunday in September o draxy let it be on a communion Sunday the elder have say with a expression on he face which draxy could not quite fathom i can not tell you what it ` ud be to I to promise myself over again to the bless savior the same hour i promise to you darling i be so afraid of love he less i do not see how i can remember anything about heaven after i have get you draxy and tear stand in the elder 's eye draxy look at he wonderingly and with a little pain in she face to she serene nature heaven and earth this life and all the other which may follow it have so long seem one -- love and happiness and duty have become so blended in one sweet atmosphere of living in daily nearness to god that she could not comprehend the elder 's word why mr kinney it be all christ she say slowly and hesitatingly slip she hand into he and look up at he so lovingly that he face flush and he throw he arm around she and only feel a thousand time more that heaven have come to mean but one thing to he darling he whisper would you feel so if i be to die and leave you alone yes i think so say draxy still more slowly and turn very pale you never can really leave I and no human being can be really alone it would still be all christ and it would be live he life and god 's still but tear roll down she cheek and she begin to sob oh forgive I draxy exclaim the elder wring to the heart by the sight of she grief i be nothing but a great brute to say that to you just now but draxy you do not know much about a man 's heart yet you be such a saint yourself you can not understand how it make a man feel as if this earth be enough and he do not want any heaven when he love a woman as i love you and the elder throw himself on the ground at draxy 's foot and lay he face down reverently on the hem of she gown there be fiery depths in this man 's nature of which he have never dream until this fair sweet strong womanhood cross he path he love of draxy kindle and transform he whole consciousness of himself and of life it be no wonder that he feel terror that he ask himself many time a day what have become of the simple-minded earnest contented worker he use to be he be full of vague and restless yearning he long to do to be to become he know not what but something that should be more of kin to this beautiful nature he worship -- something that should give she great joy -- something in which she could feel great pride it be not right i know it be not right to feel so about any mortal he would say to himself that be the way i use to feel about jesus i want to do all for he and now i want to do all for draxy and the great tender perplexed heart be sorely afraid of its new bliss they be sit in the maple grove behind the house in the tree under which they sit be a yellow-hammer 's nest the two bird have be flutter back and forth in the branch for some time suddenly they both spread they wing and fly swiftly away in opposite direction draxy look up smile through she tear and point to the fast fading speck in the distant air say -- it would be like that they be both send on errand they will not see each other again till the errand be do the elder look into she illumined face and sighing say : i can not help prayin ' that the lord 'll have errand for we that we can do together as long 's we live draxy yes dear say draxy i pray for that too and then they be silent for some minute draxy speak first but mr kinney i never hear of anybody 's be marry on Sunday -- do you no say the elder i never do but i have always think it be the only day a man ought to be marry on i mean the most beautiful the sweetest day yes reply draxy a solemn and tender light spread over she whole face it certainly be i wonder why nobody have ever think so before but perhaps many people have she add with a merrier smile we do not know everybody presently she look up anxiously and say : but do you think the people would like it would not they think it very strange the elder hesitate he too have think of this well i tell you draxy it be just this way : i have try more than once to get some of they to come and be marry on a Sunday in church and they would not just because they never hear of it before and i would like to have they see that i be in true earnest about it and they like you so well draxy and you know they do all love I a great deal more 'n i deserve and i can not help believe it will do they good all they life by make they think more how solemn a thing a marriage ought to be if they take it as i think they will and i do think i know they well enough to be pretty sure so it be settle that the marriage should take place after the morning sermon immediately before the communion service when reuben be tell of this he face express such absolute amazement that draxy laugh outright in spite of the deep solemnity of she feeling in regard to it why father she say you could not look more surprised if i have tell you i be not to be marry at all but draxy draxy reuben gasp who ever hear of such a thing what will folk say i do not know that anybody ever hear of such a thing father dear answer draxy but i be not afraid of what the people will say they love mr kinney and he have always tell they that Sunday be the day to be marry on i should not wonder if every young man and young woman in the parish look on it in a new and much holier light after this i know i begin to as soon as the elder talk about it and it would not seem right to I now to be marry on any other day and draxy stoop and kiss she father 's forehead very tenderly there be a tenderness in draxy 's manner now towards every one which can hardly be describe in word it have a mixture of humility and of gracious bestowal in it of entreaty and of benediction which be ineffably beautiful and win it be ever so when a woman who be as strong as she be sweet come into the fullness of she womanhood 's estate of love she joy overflow on all current of infinite compassion set towards those who must miss that by which she be thrill she incredulity of she own bliss be forever question humbly she feel herself forever in presence of she lover at once rich and free and a queen and poor and chained and a vassal so she largess be perpetual involuntary unconscious and she appeal be tender wistful beseech in draxy 's large nature -- she pure steadfast loving soul quicken and exalt by the swift current of a exquisitely attuned and absolutely healthful body -- this new life of love and passion work a change which be vivid and palpable to the commonest eye man and woman upon whom she smile in pass feel themselves lift and draw they know not how a sentiment of love which have almost reverence in it grow up towards she in the heart of the people a certain touch of sadness of misgive mingle with it i be afraid she be not long for this world she be get such a look o ' heaven in she face be say more than once in grieve tone when the elder 's approach marriage be talk of but old ike be farther sight in he simplicity than the rest ` tai not that he say that woman 's get in she face it be the kind o ' heaven that god send down to stay 'n this world to help make we fit for the next should not wonder ef she outlive th ' elder a long day and ike wipe he old eye slyly with the back of he hand the day of the marriage be one of those shine September day which only mountain region know the sky be cloudless and of a transcendent blue the air be soft as the air of June draxy 's young friend have decorate the church with evergreen and clemati vine and on each side of the communion-table be tall sheaf of purple aster and golden-rod two child be to be baptize at noon and on a little table at the right of the pulpit stand the small silver baptismal font wreathe with white aster and the pale feathery green of the clemati seed when draxy walk up the aisle lean on she father 's arm wear the same white dress she have wear on sunday all summer it can not be deny that there be sigh of disappointment in some of the pew the people have hope for something more draxy have keep she own counsel on this point closely reply to all inquiry as to what she would wear white of course but reply in such a tone that no one have quite dare to ask more and there have even be those in the parish who reckon that she would not be satisfy with anythin ' less than white satin she head be bare she beautiful brown hair wound tightly round and round in the same massive knot as usual she only ornament be the creamy white blossom of the low cornel one cluster in the braid of she hair and one on she bosom as she enter the pew and sit down by the side of she mother slant sunbeam from the southern window fall upon she head light up the bright hair till it look like a saintly halo elder kinney sit in the pulpit with he best loved friend elder william who be to preach that day and perform the marriage ceremony when draxy and she father enter the door elder kinney rise and remain standing until they reach they pew as draxy sit down and the golden sunbeam flicker around she the elder sink back into he seat and cover he eye with he hand he do not change he posture until the prayer and the hymn and the sermon be over and elder william say in a low voice -- the ceremony of marriage will now be perform then he rise he countenance glowing like that of one who have come from some mount of transfiguration with a dignity and grace of bear such as royal ambassador might envy he walk slowly down to reuben miller 's pew and with he head reverently bent receive draxy from she father 's hand passionate love and close contact with draxy 's exquisite nature be develop in this comparatively untrained man a peculiar courteousness and grace which add a subtle charm to the simplicity of he manners as he walk up the aisle with draxy cling to he arm he tall figure look majestic in its strength but he face be still bent forward turn toward she with a look of reverence of love unspeakable the whole congregation rise move by one impulse and the silence be almost too solemn when the short and simple ceremony be over the elder lead draxy to he own pew and sit down by she side after the little child have be baptize the usual announcement of the lord 's supper be make and the usual invitation give absolute silence follow it break only by the step of the singer leave they seat in the gallery to take place below not a person move to leave the body of the house elder william glance at elder kinney in perplexity and wait for some moment longer the silence still remain unbroken there be not a man woman or child there but feel conscious of a tender and awed impulse to remain and look on at this ceremony so newly significant and solemn to they beloved elder tear come into many eye as he take the cup of wine from deacon plummer 's tremble hand and pass it to draxy and many heart which have never before long for the right to partake of the sacred emblem long for it then after the service be end just as elder william be about to pronounce the benediction elder kinney rise from he seat and walk rapidly to the communion table say -- my dear friend i know you do not look for any word from I to-day but there be some of you i never before saw at this bless feast of we lord and i must say one word to you from he then pause he look round upon they all and with a unutterable yearning in the gesture stretch out both he arm and say : o my people my people like as a hen gathereth she chicken under she wing he would have gather you long ago but ye would not then still hold out he arm towards they he pronounce the benediction silently and solemnly the little congregation disperse a few linger and look longingly at draxy as if they would go back and speak to she but she stand with she eye fix on the elder 's face utterly unconscious of the presence of any other human be even she father dare not break the spell of holy beatitude which rest on she countenance no no ma he say to jane who propose that they should go back to the pew and walk home with she this be not like any other wedding that be ever see on this earth unless maybe that one in cana and i do not believe the lord be any nearer to that bridegroom than he be to this one so jane and reuben walk home from church alone for the first time since they come to clairvend and draxy and she husband follow slowly behind the village people who watch they be bewilder by they manner and interpret it variously accord to they own temperament you would ha ' think now they would be marry year a ' year to look at 'em say eben hill they do not speak a word nor look at each other any more 'n old deacon plummer 'n he wife who be joggin ' along jest afore 'em old ike -- poor ignorant loving old ike whose tender instinct be like the wistful sagacity of a faithful dog -- read they face better he have hurry out of church and hide himself in the edge of a little pine grove which the elder and draxy must pass i would jest like to see 'em a little longer he say to himself half apologetically as they walk silently by old ike 's face saddened and at last become convulse with grief creep out from beneath the pine he slowly follow they up the hill mutter to himself in the fashion which have grow upon he in he solitary life : -- o lord o lord no such look as they be long for this earth o lord which be it ye be goin ' to take i reckon it be the elder i reckon ` tis that woman 's goin ' to have she heart break o lord o lordy I i can not bear the sight o not and he leap a fence and strike off across the field towards he house he do not shut he eye that night but toss and groan aloud towards morning he form a resolution which calm he somewhat ef i kin only be right close to 'em till it come p ` rap i can be of a little use leastway it ` ud be some comfort to try he say as the elder and draxy be sit at breakfast the next day they catch sight of the old man 's bent figure walk up and down outside the gate and stop now and then irresolutely as if he would come in but dare not why there be old ike exclaim the elder what on earth can he want at this time of day draxy look up with a very tender smile and say : i should not wonder if he want just to see how happy you look mr kinney nobody in this world love you so well as old ike do oh draxy say the elder reproachfully no dear not even i old ike never dream of receive any love in return i have see he eye follow you with just such a look as dog ' eye have i wish we could do something for he we will dear we will go and see he often i own it smite I to the soul sometimes to think how humble he be and so glad to see I when i have not be near he for six month maybe at this moment hannah put she head into the door and say in no pleasant voice : -- here be that ike sanborn wantin ' to speak to ye sir but i telled he -- let he come right in here hannah say draxy mr kinney and i will be very glad to see he this morning hannah 's face relax in spite of herself in answer to draxy 's smile but she could not forgive ike for what seem to she a most unwarrantable intrusion and she be grimmer than ever when she return to he say -- they 'll see ye but i must say i sh would ha ' think ye would know better 'n to be comin ' round here this mornin ' of all mornin 's be not they to have a minute 's peace to theirselve ike look up appealingly at the hard indian face i wa 'n' t goin ' to keep 'em a minute he say : i will not go in now i 'll come agin ef you say so hannah no no -- go in now ye be here ye have interrupted 'em and ye may 's well take the good o not now reply the vengeful hannah push ike along towards the sitting-room door ef there be anythin ' i do hate it be shiftless white folk grumble hannah as she go back to she work if poor ike have know the angry contempt for he which fill hannah 's heart he would have feel still less courage for the proposition he have come to make as it be he stand in the doorway the very picture of irresolution and embarrassment come in come in ike say the elder you be the first one of the parish to pay you respects to mr kinney draxy rise from she seat smile and go towards he and say : and mr kinney be very glad to see you ike this be too much for the loving old heart he drop he hat on the floor and begin to speak so rapidly and incoherently that both draxy and the elder be almost frightened o elder o miss kinney -- i have be a thinkin ' that p ` rap you would let I come a ' live with you a ' do all yer chore i would bring my two cow a ' my keepin ' would not be very much a ' -- oh sir ef ye 'll only let I i 'll bless ye all the day o ' my life and ike begin to cry so do draxy for that matter and the elder be not very far from it draxy speak first why ike do you really want so much to live with we ike 's first answer be a look then he say very simply -- i have lay awake all night ma'am tryin ' to get bold enough to come and ask ye draxy look at she husband and say in a low voice you know what i tell you just now mr kinney the elder saw that draxy be on ike 's side well well ike he say you shall certainly come and try it perhaps you will not like it as well as you think but do not say anything about it to any one else till you hear from we you shall come very soon ike turn to go but linger and finally stammer : i hope sir ye do not take it that i be askin ' a charity i make bold to believe i could be worth to ye 's much 's my keepin ' i be considerable handy ` bout a good many thing a ' i can do a day 's mowin ' yet with any man in the parish i do not care who he be it be only because -- because -- ike 's voice break and it be very nearly with a sob that he add because i love ye sir and he hurry away draxy spring after he i know that very well ike and so do mr kinney and you will be a great help to we you be make we the most valuable wedding present we have have yet ike and draxy hold out she hand ike look at the hand but he do not touch it maybe god 'll let I thank ye yet ma'am he say and be go as he go through the kitchen a sudden misgiving seize he of terror of hannah supposin ' she sh would take into she head to be agin I think he they say the elder himself be ` fraid on she i do not s ` pose she would dare to try to pizen I outright a ' anyhow there be aller egg a ' potato but i 'll bring she round fust or last and make wary by love ike begin on the spot to conciliate she by offer to bring a pail of water from the well this small attention go farther than he could have dream when draxy first tell hannah that ike be to come and live with they she say judiciously -- it will make you work much easier in many way hannah hannah answer : -- yes missus he 'll bring all the water i spose a that alone be wuth any man 's keep -- not that i have ever find any fault with the well 's bein ' so far off it be 's good water 's there be in the world but it be powerful heavy the arrival of the two cow crown hannah 's liking of the plan if she have a passion in life it be for cream and for butter-making and it have be a sore trial to she in she life as the elder 's housekeeper that she must use stinted measure of milk buy from neighbor so when poor ike come in tremble and nervous to he first night 's lodging under the elder 's roof he find in the kitchen to he utter surprise instead of a frowning and dangerous enemy a warm ally as friendly in manner and mien as indian blood would permit thus the little household settle down for the winter : draxy and the elder happy serene exalt more than they know by they perfect love for each other and they childlike love of god blending in one earnest purpose of work for soul hannah and ike anything but serene and yet happy after they own odd fashion and hold together much more closely than they know by the common bond of they devotion to the elder and he wife in the other side of the house be also two very thankful and contented heart reuben and jane be old people now : reuben 's hair be snowy white and jane be sadly bent but the comfort and peace which have come so late into they life have still come early enough to make the sunset a bright one it be a sight to do all heart good to see the two sit together on the piazza of the house in the warm afternoon and gaze in delight at the eastern mountain range turn rose-pink and then fading through shades of purple to dark gray it be a good deal like we life ma reuben say sometimes we sun 's pretty low -- most down i reckon it be all rosy-light just these day but we shall have to lie down in the shadow presently but it be all beautiful beautiful jane do not understand he she never do but she love the sound of he voice best when he say the thing which be too subtle for she the two household live separately as before the elder have propose they make one family and reuben have wistfully second it but draxy have firmly say no i shall be able to do more for you father dear if we do not it will not seem so at first but i know i be right she say and it be a rare wisdom in she sweet soul which lead to the decision at first it be very hard for reuben to bear but as the month go on he see that it be best draxy 's loving thoughtful care of they never relax the excellent woman whom she have secure for they servant go for she order quite as often to draxy as to jane very few meal be set out for they to which draxy 's hand have not give the last final touch she flit back and forth between the two home equally of both the guardian angel but the line of division and separation be just as distinctly draw as if they have be under different roof a mile apart two or three time in the week they dine and take tea together but the habit never be form of do this on a special day when reuben say could not ye arrange it so be always to eat you Sunday dinner with we draxy she reply : sometimes Sunday dinner sometimes Thursday sometimes Saturday father dear if we make it a fixed day we shall not like it half so well any of we we 'll come often enough you may be sure and of this too reuben soon see the wisdom o draxy draxy my little girl he say one day when just after breakfast she run in exclaim -- father dear we be come to take dinner with you and ma to-day it be a surprise party and the chicken have come first they be in the kitchen now o draxy draxy he exclaim it be a great deal nicer not to know it beforehand how could you be so wise child draxy put she arm round he neck and do not speak for a moment then she say i do not think it be wisdom dear real true love know by instinct just as the bee do which shape cell will hold most honey i be only a honey-maker for my darling jane look mystified but reuben 's face quiver with pleasure that you be you bless child he say and as hear the elder 's step in the hall she fly out of the room reuben cover he eye with he hand happy year leave slender record but for suffer and sin there would not be history the winter come and the spring come and the summer and the autumn and no face in the quiet little parsonage look a shade older for the year that have go no incident have take place which could make a salient point in a story and not one of the peaceful heart could believe that a twelvemonth have fly elder kinney 's pathetic fear lest he might love he savior less by reason of he new happiness have melt like frost in early sunlight in the sweet presence of draxy 's child-like religion o draxy he say again and again seem to I i never half love all these soul we be work for before i have you i do not see how i could have be so afraid about it before we be marry do i really help you mr kinney draxy would reply with a linger emphasis on the really which make she husband draw she closer to he and forget to speak : it seem very strange to I that i can i feel so ignorant about soul it frighten I to answer the smallest question the people ask I i never do in any way except to tell they if i have ever feel so myself and how god seem to help I out bless draxy that be the secret of she influence from first to last : the magnetic sympathy of a pure and upright soul to whose rare strength have be add still rarer simplicity and lovingness old and young man as well as woman come to she with unhesitate confidence before she marriage they have all feel a little reserve with she partly because she be of finer grain than they partly because she have deep down in she soul a genuine shyness which show itself only in quiet reticence but now that she be the elder 's wife they feel that she be in a measure theirs there be a very sweet side as well as a inconvenient and irritating one to the old-fashioned rural notion that the parish have almost as much right to the minister 's wife as to the minister draxy see only the sweet side with all the loyalty and directness which have make she as a little girl champion and counselor and comfort to she father she now set she hand to the work of help she husband do good to the people whom he call he child if they be yours they must be mine too mr kinney she would say with a smile half arch half solemn i hope i sha not undo on week-day what you do on sunday what i do on sunday be more 'n half you work too draxy the elder would make reply and it be very true draxy 's quicker brain and finer sense and in some way superior culture be fast mould the elder 's habit of thought and speech to a extent of which she never dream reuben 's income be now far in advance of they simple want and newspaper magazine and new book continually find they way to the parsonage draxy have only to mention anything she desire to see and reuben forthwith order it so that it insensibly come to pass that the daily life of the little household be really a intellectual one and elder kinney 's original and vigorous mind expand fast in the congenial atmosphere yet he lose none of he old quaintness and simplicity of phrase none of he fervor the people listen to he sermon with wonder interest and be not slow to ascribe some of the credit of the new unction to draxy th ' elder 's get more 'n more like mis ' kinney every day o ' he life they say : there be some o ' she sayin 's in every sermon he write and no wonder would be add by some more enthusiastic worshipper of draxy 's i guess he be get sense enough to know that she be get more real book-learnin ' in she head than he have twice over i should not wonder if she get to writin ' some of he sermon for he out 'n out before long dear draxy 's reverent wifehood would have be grieve and dismay if she have know that she effort to second she husband 's appeal to he people be sometimes so eloquent as to make the elder 's word forget but she never dream of such a thing she be too simple hearted and humble in the early day of the second winter come the angel of the annunciation bear a white lily to draxy she joy and gratitude be unspeakable and the exquisite purity and elevation of she nature shine out transcendent in the new experience now i begin to feel surer that god really trust I she say since he be go to let I have a child of my own o my dear friend she exclaim more than once to mother i never dream how happy you be i think i know but i do not draxy 's spontaneous and unreserved joy of motherhood while yet she babe be unborn be a novel and startling thing to the woman among whom she live the false notion on this point grow out of ignorant and base thought be too wide-spread too firm-rooted to be overthrow in a hour or a day even by the presence of angelic truth incarnate some of draxy 's best friend be annoyed and disquiet by she frankness and unreserve of delight but as the week go on the true instinct of complete motherhood thrill for the first time in many a mother 's heart under draxy 's glowing word and woman talk tearfully one with another in secret with lowered voice about the new revelation which have come to they through she i have come to see it all quite different since i have talk with mis ' kinney say one young married woman hold she baby close to she breast and look down with remorseful tenderness on its placid little face i sha not never feel that i have quite make it up to benjy never for the thought i have about he before he be bear i do not see why nobody ever tell we before that we be just as much mother to 'em from the very first as we ever could be and tear drop on benjy 's face a ' i jest hope the lord 'll send I 's many more 's we can manage to feed 'n clothe 'n i 'll see if lovin ' 'em right along from the beginnin ' with all my heart 'll make 'em beautiful a ' happy a ' strong a ' well 's mis ' kinney sez i b ` lieve it be much 's ef 'twa in the bible after all she tell I and read I out of a physiology a ' it stand to natur ' which be more 'n the old way o ' talkin do this new strong current of the divinest of truth stir the very vein of the village mother be more loving and father more tender and maiden be sweeter and graver -- all for the come of this one little babe into the bosom of full and inspired motherhood on the morning when draxy 's son be bear a stranger pass through the village would have suppose that some great news of war or of politics have arrive little knot of people stand at gate on corner all talk earnestly other be walk rapidly to and fro in the street excitement fill the air never be heir to royal house more welcome than be the first-born son of this simple-minded great-hearted woman by the lowly people among whom she dwell old ike 's joy be more than he could manage he have sit on the floor all night long with he head bury in he hand the instinct of grief to come which not even all these long peaceful month have be able to wholly allay in he faithful heart have spring into full life at the first symptom of danger to draxy p ` rap it be this way arter all the lord 's goin ' to do it o lord o lord it 'll kill mr kinney it 'll kill he he keep repeat over and over as he rock to and fro hannah eye he savagely she indian blood hate groan and tear and she affection for she master be anger at the very think of he be afflict i wish it have pleased yer lord to give ye the sense of a man mr sanborn she say while he be a makin ' on ye if ye would go to bed now instead o ' snivelin ' round here you might be good for somethin' in the mornin ' when there 'll be plenty to do anyhow i be not goin ' to be pester by the sight on ye any longer and hannah bang the kitchen-door violently after she when poor ike timidly peer into the sitting-room whither she have betake herself he find she too sit on the floor in a attitude not unlike the one she have so scorn in he but he be too meek to taunt she he only say -- i be goin ' now hannah so ye need not stay out o ' the kitchen for I and he climb slowly up the stair which lead to he room as the rosy day dawn in the east draxy 's infant son draw he first mortal breath he first quivering cry faint almost as a whisper yet sharp and piteous reach old ike 's ear instantly he fall on he knee and remain some minute motionless then he rise and go slowly down-stairs hannah meet he at the door she dark face flush with emotion which she vainly try to conceal by sharp word hope ye have rest well mr sanborn another time mebbe ye 'll have more sense as fine a boy 's ye ever see and mis ' kinney she be a smilin ' into its face as nobody 's never see she smile yet i tell you ike be go -- out into the field over fence over brook into wood trample down dewy fern glisten moss scarlet cornel thicket of goldenrod and aster -- he know not where mutter to himself all the while and toss he arm into the air at last he return to the house say to himself p ` rap th ' elder 'll like to have I go down into the village a ' let folk know elder kinney be stand barehead on the door-step he face look like the face of a man who have come off a battle-field where victory have be almost as terrible as defeat as soon as he see old ike run across the field towards he he divine all loving old heart he think draxy be right and he hold out both he hand to the old man as he have never do before and speak a few affectionate word which make tear run down the wrinkled cheek then he send he on the errand he know he crave you would better give the news first to eben hill ike he call after he it 'll be of more use to he than to anybody in the parish it be just two year from draxy 's wedding day when she stand again in the aisle of the little village church dress in pure white with the southern sunlight rest on she beautiful hair she husband stand by she side hold they infant son in he arm the child have clear calm blue eye like draxy 's and a expression of serenity and radiant joy on he tiny face which make the people wonder reuben miller kinney be he name and though the parish have hope that the child would be name for he father when they look at reuben miller 's sweet patient noble face and see its intense happiness as the word be speak they feel that it be better so again swift month roll on and peace and joy brood over the parsonage draxy 's life with she child be something too beautiful to be tell in word she wifehood be lovely be intense but she motherhood be greater day and night she love for she boy protect and guide he like pillar of cloud like pillar of fire she know no weariness no feebleness she grow constantly stronger and more beautiful and the child grow stronger and more beautiful with a likeness to she and a oneness with she which be marvelous he be a loving and affectionate boy to all he father he grandparent old ike and swarthy hannah -- all alike sun themselves in the delight of he beautiful childhood but wherever he be -- however amuse and delight -- even in he father 's arm -- he eye seek he mother 's eye and the mute interchange between they be subtle and constant as between lover there be but one drawback on draxy 's felicity now she be afraid of she love for she boy o seth she say -- after little reuben 's birth she for the first time call she husband by this name before that although she lavish on he all word of endearment she have never find courage to call he seth -- o seth she say i feel now as you do about I before we be marry i can not make myself think about anything but reuby o darling you do not think god would take he away from you to punish I do you the elder could not comfort she when she be in this frame of mind in fact he himself be sometimes afraid see she utter absorption in the child yet it never for one instant warped she firmness or judiciousness of control draxy could not have comprehend that type of love which can lose sight for one instant of the best good of the loved one she control however be the control of a wise and affectionate companion never that of the authoritative parent little reuben never hear the word you must not do thus and so it be always you can not because it be not safe best or proper or because if you do such and such thing will happen draxy say reuben to she one day you never tell reuby to do anything without give he a reason for it he be the best boy that ever live i do believe but ` tai not just my idea of obedience for all that draxy smile i never say a word to he about obey I in he life i never shall i can not explain it father dear but you must let I do my way i shall tell he all i know about do right and he will decide for himself more and more i be not afraid she need not have be before reuby be seven year old he gentle manliness of behavior be the marvel of the village it beat all how mis ' kinney 's bring that boy o ' hern up be say in the sewing-circle one day she tell I herself that she be never so much 's say a sharp word to he and as for whipping she think it be a deadly sin so do i speak up young mr plummet the mother of benjy i never do believe in that i do not believe in it even for hoss it only get 'em to go a few rod and then they be lazier 'n ever my father 's break more colt than any man in this county a ' he would never let 'em be strike a blow he say one blow spile 'em and i guess ye have get more to work on in a boy than ye have in a colt these discussion often run high and wax warm but draxy 's adherent be a large majority and she have so patiently and fully go over these dispute grounds with they that they be well fortify with the argument and fact which support she position indeed it be fast come to pass that she be the central force of the life of the village let I make the song of the community and i care not who make its law be well say it be song which draxy supply to these people 's life not often in verse in sound in any shape that could be measure but in spirit she vivify they every sense of beauty moral and physical she open they eye to joy she reveal to they the sacredness and delight of common thing she make they heart sing but she be to do more yet for these man and woman slowly noiselessly in the procession of these beautiful and peaceful day be draw near a day which should anoint draxy with a new baptism -- set she apart to a holier work it come as the great consecration of life be apt to come suddenly without warn while we be patiently and faithfully keep sheep in the wilderness the messenger be journey towards we with the vial of sacred oil to make we king it be on a September morning draxy sit at the eastward bay-window of she

but in its place be a clear soft tint which have no pallor in it she be dress in pure white so also be little reuby but for this the parish be prepared very well they know draxy 's deep-rooted belief that to associate gloom with the memory of the dead be disloyal alike to they and to christ and so warmly have she imbue most of the people with she sentiment that the dismal black garb of so-called mourning be rarely see in the village bareheaded draxy and she little son walk from the church to the grave they face the calmest they step the steadiest there reuben and jane walk behind they bent over and sob and half the congregation be weep uncontrollably but the widow woman and the fatherless boy walk with uplifted glance as if they see angel-form in the air by they side tai not nateral `

last see she husband walk she know just the spot where he have pause and turn and throw kiss back to reuby watch he from the window but she nature be too healthy too full of energy and she soul too full of love to remain in this frame long she reproach herself bitterly for the sin of have indulge in it even for a short time i do not believe my darling can be quite happy even in heaven while he see I live this way she say sternly to herself one morning then she put on she bonnet and go down into the village to carry out a resolution she have be meditate for some day very great be the astonishment of house after house that morning as draxy walk quietly in as have be she wont she propose to the mother to send they younger child to she to be teach half of every day i can teach reuby

never seem quite clear of brain have ask so piteously to come and sit in the room that draxy let he do so he sit in a big chair by the fire-place and carve whistle and ship and fantastic toy for the child listen all the time intently to every word which fall from draxy 's lip he have transfer to she all the pathetic love he have feel for the elder he often follow she at a distance when she go out and little reuby he rarely lose sight of from morning till night he be too feeble now to do much work but he presence be a great comfort to draxy he seem a very close link between she and she husband hannah too sometimes come into the school at recess to the great amusement of the child she be particularly fond of look at the blackboard when there be chalk-mark on it make a mark on I with you white pencil she would say offer she dark cheek to reuby who would scrawl hieroglyphic all over it from hair to chin then she would invite the whole troop out into the kitchen to a feast of doughnut or cookie very long the recess sometimes be when the school be watch hannah fry the fantastic shape of sweet dough or take each a turn at the jagged wheel with which she cut they out reuben also come often to the school-room and jane sometimes sit there with she knitting a strange content have settle on they life in spite of the sorrow they see draxy calm she smile on they as constantly as ever and they be very old people and believe too easily that she be at peace but the lord have more work still for this sweet woman 's hand this too be suddenly set before she late one Saturday afternoon as she be return surround by she escort of laughing child from the wood where they have be for may-flower old deacon plummer overtake she mis ' kinney mis ' kinney he begin several time but could get no further he be evidently in great perplexity how to say the thing he wish mis ' kinney would you hev -- mis ' kinney I and deacon swift 's be a sayin ' -- mis ' kinney be not you get -- draxy smile outright she often smile now with cordial good cheer when thing please she what be it deacon out with it i can not possibly tell unless you make it plainer thus encouraged good deacon plummer go on : well mis ' kinney it be jest this : elder william have jest send word he can not come a ' preach to-morrer and there be not nobody anywhere be round thet we can get and de 'n swift 'n I we be a thinkin ' whether you would not be willin ' some of we should read one o ' the elder 's old sermon o mis ' kinney ye do not know how we all hanker to hear some o ' he bless word agin draxy stand still she face alter so that the little child crowd round she in alarm and reuby take hold of she hand tear come into she eye and she could hardly speak but she reply -- yes indeed mr plummer i should be very glad to have you i 'll look out a sermon to-night and you can come up to the house in the morning and get it o mis ' kinney do forgive I for speakin ' you have aller seem so bear up i never mistrust that ` t would do any harm to ask yer stammer the poor deacon utterly disconcerted by draxy 's tear for she be cry hard now it have not do any harm i assure you i be very glad to do it say draxy yes sir my mamma very often cry when she be glad speak up reuby he little face get very red and he lip quiver she be very glad sir if she say so this chivalrous defense calm poor draxy but do not comfort the deacon who hurry away say to himself -- do not believe there be ever such a woman nor such a boy in this world before she never shed a tear when we bring the elder home dead nor even when she see he let down into the very grave 'n' i do not believe she be cried afore anybody till to-day 'n' that little chap a speakin ' up a ' tellin ' I he ma often cry when she be glad a ' i be to believe she spite of she cry i wish i would make job swift go arter she i 'll make he go arter that sermon anyhow i will not go near she agin ` bout this bisness that be certain and the remorse-stricken but artful deacon hasten to he brother deacon 's house to tell he that it be all settle with mis ' kinney ` bout the sermon a ' she be quite willin ' and o he add as if it be quite a second thought ye would better go up a ' git the sermon job in the mornin ' ye be so much nearer a ' then 's ye have to do the readin ' maybe she 'll have somethin' to explain to ye about the way it be to be read th ' elder 's writin ' wa not any too easy to make out 's fur 's i remember it next morning just as the first bell be ring deacon swift knock timidly at the door of the elder 's study draxy meet he with a radiant face she have be excite by read over the sermon she have after long deliberation select the text be -- peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you the sermon have be write soon after they marriage and be one of she husband 's favorite there be many eloquent passage in it which seem now to take on a new significance as come from the lip of the elder absent from he flock and present with christ o mis ' kinney i recollect that sermon 's if 'twa only yesterday say deacon swift the hull parish be talkin ' o not all the week ye could not have pick out one they would be so glad to hear but dear I how i be ever goin ' to read it in any kind o ' decent way i do not know i never be a reader anyhow 'n' now i have lose my front tooth some word do pester I to git out this open the way for draxy nearly all night she have lie awake think how terrible it would be to she to hear she husband 's beloved word indistinctly and ineffectively read by deacon swift 's crack and feeble voice almost she regret have give she consent at last the thought flash into she mind why should i not read it myself i know i could be hear in every corner of that little church the more she think of it the more she long to do it and the less she shrink from the idea of face the congregation ` it be only just like a big family of child ' seth always use to say ` and i be sure i feel as if they be mine now as much as ever they be he i wish i dare do it i do believe seth would like it ' and draxy fall asleep comfort by the think before breakfast she consult she father and he approve it warmly i believe you mission be not do yet daughter to these people of you husband 's the more you speak to 'em the better it 'll be jest like he voice speak from heaven to 'em say reuben a ' i should not wonder if keepin ' elder william away be all the lord 's doin ' as the bless saint use to say reuben 's approval be all that draxy need to strengthen she impulse and before deacon swift arrive she only perplexity be as to the best way of make the proposition to he all this difficulty he have himself smooth away by he first word yes i know deacon swift she say i have be think that perhaps it would tire you to read for so long a time in a loud voice and besides mr kinney 's handwriting be very hard to read draxy pause and look sympathizingly in the deacon 's face the mention of the illegible write distressed the poor man still more he take the sermon from she hand and glance nervously at the first page oh my mis ' kinney he exclaim i can not make out half the word can not you say draxy gently it be all as plain as print to I i know it so well but there be some abbreviation mr kinney always use i will explain they to you perhaps that will make it easier o mis ' kinney mis ' kinney i can not never do it in the world burst out the poor deacon o mis ' kinney why can not you read it to the folk they would all like it i know they would do you really think so mr swift reply draxy and then with a little twinge of conscience add immediately i have be think of that very thing myself that perhaps if it would not seem strange to the people that would be the best way because i know the handwriting so well and it really be very hard for a stranger to read yes yes that be the very thing hastily exclaim the relieved deacon -- that be it that be it why mis ' kinney as for they thinkin ' it strange there be not a man in the parish that would not vote for you for minister twice over if ye wuz only a man i have heerd 'em all say so more 'n a thousand time sence something in draxy 's face cut the deacon 's sentence short very well mr swift she say then i will try since you think it best my father think it would be a good plan too or else i should not have be willing she add gently reuben miller 's daughter be still as guileless reverent potent a think in draxy 's heart as when upon she unconscious childish lip the word have be a spell disarm and win all heart to she the news have go all through the village on Saturday night that deacon swift be to read one of elder kinney 's sermon the next day the whole parish be present not a man not a woman be miss except those who be keep at home by sickness a tender solemnity be in every face not often do it happen to a man to be so beloved by a whole community as be elder kinney by this people with some embarrassment and hesitation deacon swift read the hymn and make one of the prayer deacon plummer make the other then there come a pause draxy flush scarlet and half rise in she pew she have not think to tell the deacon that he must explain to the people beforehand why she read the sermon she have take it for grant that he would do so but he do not comprehend that he ought and only look nervously towards she wait for she to come forward this be the one moment which try draxy 's soul there be almost vexation in she look as hastily lay aside she bonnet she walk up to the table in front of the pulpit and turn towards the people say in she clear melodious voice -- dear friend i be sorry deacon swift do not explain to you that i be to read the sermon he ask I to do so because mr kinney 's handwriting be very hard for a stranger to read she pause for a second and then add : the sermon which i have choose be one which some of you will remember it be write and preach nine year ago the text be in the beautiful gospel of st john the 14th chapter and the 27th verse -- ` peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you ' after pronounce these word draxy pause again and look towards she pew make a slight sign to reuby the child understand instantly and walk swiftly to she sit in this chair here by mamma reuby darling she whisper and reuby climb up into the big chair on she right hand and lean he fair golden head against the high mahogany back draxy have become conscious in that first second that she could not read with reuby 's wistful face in sight also she feel a sudden yearning for the support of he nearer presence peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you she repeat and go on with the sermon she tone be low but clear and she articulation so perfect that no syllable be lose she could have be distinctly hear in a room twice as large as this the sight be one which thrill every heart that look on it no poor labor man there be so dull of sense and soul that he do not sit drinking in the wonderful picture : the tall queenly woman robe in simple flow white she hair a coronet of snowy silver she dark blue eye shine with a light which would have be flashingly brilliant except for its steadfast serenity she mouth almost smile as the clear tone flow out sit quiet intent by she side the beautiful boy also dress in white he face light like hers by serene and yet gleaming eye he head cover with golden curl he little hand fold devoutly in he lap one come suddenly upon the scene might well have fancy himself in another clime and age in the presence of some rite perform by a mystic priestess clothe in samite but the word which fall from the lip be the gentlest word of the gentlest religion earth have know and the heart which beat under the clinging fold of the strange white garb be no priestess ' heart but a heart full almost to breaking of wifehood of motherhood it do not need experience as a orator to give significance to the magnetic language of upturned face before draxy have read ten page of the sermon she be so thrill by the consciousness that every heart before she be thrill too that she cheek flush and she whole face glow the sermon have sound eloquent when the elder preach it but now from draxy 's lip it be transcendent as she read the closing paragraph -- he peace he leave with we : he peace he give unto we : not such peace as he know on earth : such peace as he know now in heaven on the right hand of he father even that peace he bid we share -- that peace the peace of god which passeth understanding -- she seem to dilate in stature and as she let the sermon fall on the table before she she lift eye seem arrest in mid air as by a celestial vision then in a second more she be again the humble affectionate draxy whom all the woman and all the little child know and love look round on they with a appealing expression she say -- dear friend i hope i have not do wrong in stand up here and take it upon I to read such solemn word i feel that mr kinney would like to speak to you once more through I then take little reuby by the hand she walk slowly back to she pew then deacon swift make sad work of read the hymn -- blest be the tie that bind and the choir make sad work of singing it nobody 's voice could be trust for many syllable at a time but nobody listen to the music everybody be impatient to speak to draxy they cluster round she in the aisle they crowd into pew to get near she : all the reticence and reserve of they new england habit have melt away in this wonderful hour they thank she they touch she they gaze at she they do not know what to do even draxy 's calm be visibly disturb by the atmosphere of they great excitement o mis ' kinney ef ye 'll only read we one more just one more will not ye now do say ye will right off this arternoon or read the same one right over ef that be any easier for ye we would like to hear jest that 'n' nothin ' else for a year to come o mis ' kinney 'twa jest like hearin ' the elder himself poor draxy be tremble reuben come to she rescue i hope you will not take it unkindly of I he say but my daughter 's feeling more than 's good for she she must come home now and reuben draw she hand into he arm the people fall back sorry and conscience-stricken we orter ha ' know better they say but she make we forgit she be flesh 'n' blood i will read you another sermon some time say draxy slowly i shall be very glad to but not to-day i could not do it to-day then she smile on they all with a smile which be a benediction and walk away hold reuby 's hand very tightly and lean heavily on she father 's arm the congregation do not disperse nothing since the elder 's death have so move they they gather in knot on the church step and in the aisle and talk long and earnestly there be but one sentiment one voice it be a thousand shame she be not a man say some of the young man it ` ud be a thousand time more ef she wuz retorted angy plummer i would like to see the man that ` ud do what she do a comin ' right close to the very heart o ' yer 's ef she be you mother 'n' you sister 'n' you husband and a bless angel o ' god all ter once but angy we only mean that then we could hev she for we minister they reply angy turn very red but reply energetically -- there be not any law agin a woman 's bein ' minister thet i ever heerd on howsomever mis ' kinney never would hear to anythin ' o ' that kind i don ' no ' for my part how she ever muster up courage to do what she be do so kind o ' backward 'n' shy 's she be for all she strength but for my part i would not ask for no other preachin ' all the rest o ' my life than jest to hear mis ' kinney read one o ' she husband 's sermon every Sunday why angy plummer burst from more lip than one but the bold suggestion be only the half-conscious thought of every one there and the discussion grow more and more serious slowly the people disperse to they home but the discussion still continue late into night by many a fireside the matter be talk over and late the next night and the next until a vague hope and a still vaguer purpose spring up in the parish she say she would read another some day they reiterate most likely she would 's soon do it next Sunday 'n' sooner 'cause she would be more use to ' t than ef she wait a spell between but it will not do to take it for grant she be goin ' to 'n' not git anybody say deacon swift in great perplexity i think brother plummer 'n' I would better go 'n' ask she no say angy let I go i can talk it over better 'n you can i 'll go and angy go the interview between the two woman be long angy plead as nobody else in the parish could have do and draxy 's heart be all on she side but draxy 's judgment be unconvinced if i could be sure angy that it would be best for the people i should not hesitate but you know very well if i begin i shall keep on she say she consult reuben he heart too be on the people 's side but he judgment be like hers perplex one thing 's very certain daughter : there be not anybody they can ever find to settle here or that they be likely to who can preach as the elder do he old sermon be world better than any new one they 'll get yes indeed i know that say draxy that be what make I feel as if i must do it this have be she strongest motive only too well she know what would be the probable calibre of a man who would come to this poor and lonely little village which she so love at last she consent to make the experiment i will read for you every Sunday two sermon of mr kinney 's she say until you hear of some one whom you would like to settle for you minister angy plummer clap she hand when she father repeat at tea on Thursday evening what mis ' kinney have say that be good 's settlin ' she she exclaim oh i never think she would come to it and real tear of joy stand in angy 's eye i do not know ` bout that angy reply the deacon there be a good deal to be think on fust 'n' last folk '11 talk like everythin ' i expect 'n' say we have get a woman preacher it would not never do for any great length o ' time but it will be a blessin ' to hear some th ' elder 's good rousin ' comfortin ' sermon for a spell arter the stuff we hev be a havin ' 'n' they can not say she be any more 'n' a reader anyhow that be quite different from preachin ' of course it be say angy who be wise enough to keep some of she thought and hope to herself they be 's different 's any other two thing i do not suppose anybody would say you be a settin ' up to preach if you would ha ' read the sermon 'n' i do not see why they need to any more o ' mis ' kinney and so on the next Sunday draxy 's ministry to she husband 's people begin again with soften and gladden face the little congregation look up to the fair tall priestess with she snow-white robe and snow-white hair and gleam steadfast eye stand meekly between the communion-table and the chair in which sit she golden-haired little son she voice be clearer and stronger than ever and there be a calm peacefulness in she whole atmosphere which have not be there at first again the people crowd around and thank she and clasp she hand this time she answer they with cordial good cheer and do not tremble to little reuby also they speak gratefully you help too reuby do not you say angy plummer -- do you like it very much ma'am mamma say i help but i think she be mistaken reply the little fellow archly yes you do you darling say mr plummer stoop and kiss he tenderly angy plummer love reuby she never look at he without think that but for he existence the true mother-heart would perhaps never have be bear in she bosom the reading of the sermon grow easier and easier to draxy Sunday by Sunday she become conscious of a strange sense of be lift out of herself as soon as she begin to speak she feel more and more as if it be she husband speak through she and she feel more and more closely draw into relation with the people oh father dear she say more than once i do not know how i shall ever give it up when the time come it make I so happy : i feel almost as if i could see seth standing right by I and hold my gown while i read and father dear she proceed in a lower slower voice i do not know but you 'll think it wrong i be almost afraid to tell you but sometimes i say word that be not in the sermon just a sentence or two where i think seth would put it in if he be here now and i almost believe he put the very word into my head she pause and look anxiously and inquiringly at she father no draxy reply reuben solemnly i do not think it wrong i feel more and more every Sunday i listen to you as if the lord have set you apart for this thing and i do not believe he would send any other angel except you husband on the errand of helpin ' you the summer pass and the parish give no sign of readiness for a new minister when draxy speak of it she be meet by such heartfelt grief on all side that she be silence at last she have a long serious talk with the deacon which set she mind more at rest they have it seem consult several neighbor minister elder william among the number and they have all advise that while the congregation seem so absorb in interest no change should be make elder william he sez he 'll come over regular for the communion say deacon plummer and for baptism whenever we want he and thet 's the main thing for thank the lord we haint many funeral 'n course of a year and mis ' kinney ef ye 'll excuse my makin ' so bold i 'll tell ye jest what elder william say about ye : sez he it be my opinion that ef there be ever a woman bear thet be jest cut out for a minister to a congregation it be that elder 's wife o ' you 'n and sez we to he ` thet 's jest what the hull town think sir and it be we opinion that ef we should try to settle anythin ' in the shape of a man in this parish there would not be anythin ' but empty pew for he to preach to for the people would all be go up to mis ' kinney 's ' draxy smile in spite of herself but she heart be very solemn it be a great responsibility deacon plummer she say and i feel afraid all the time but my father think i ought to do it and i be so happy in it it seem as if it could not be a mistake as month go on she misgiving grow less and less and she impulse to add word of she own to she husband 's sermon grow more and more frequent she could not but see that she hold the heart of the people in she hand to mould they like wax and she intimate knowledge of they condition and need make it impossible for she to refrain from sometimes speak the word she know they ought to hear whenever she do so at any length she lay she manuscript on the table that they might know the truth she sense of honesty would not let she do otherwise it be long before anybody but angy plummer understand the meaning of these interval the rest suppose she know part of the sermon by heart but at last come a day when she soul be so stir within she that she rise up boldly before she people and say -- i have not bring any sermon of mr kinney 's to read to you to-day i be go to speak to you myself i be so grieve so shocked at event which have take place in this village the past week that i can not help speak about they and i find among mr kinney 's sermon no one which meet this state of thing the circumstance to which draxy allude have be some disgraceful scene of excitement in connection with the presidential election party spirit have be grow higher and higher in clairvend for some year and when on the reckoning of the return on this occasion the victorious party prove to have a majority of but three sharp quarrel have at once break out accusation of cheating and lie be freely bandy and deacon plummer and george thayer have nearly come to blow on the step of the town house at high noon just as the school-child be go home later in the afternoon there have be a renewal of the contest in the village store and it have culminate in a fight part of which draxy herself have chance to see long and anxiously she ponder that night the question of she duty she dare not keep silent it would be just hypocrisy and nothing less she exclaim to herself for I to stand up there and read they one of seth 's sermon when i be burn to tell they how shamefully they have behave but i suppose it will be the last time i shall speak to they they 'll never want to hear I again she do not tell she father of she resolution till they be near the church reuben start but in a moment he say deliberately -- you be quite right daughter may the lord bless you at draxy 's first word a thrill of astonishment run over the whole congregation everybody know what be come george thayer color scarlet to the root of he hair and the color never fade till the sermon be end deacon plummer cough nervously and change he position so as to cover he mouth with he hand angy put she head down on the front of the pew and begin to cry render therefore unto csar the thing that be csar 's and unto god the thing that be god 's come in clear ringing tone from draxy 's lip then she proceed in simple and gentle word to set forth the right of every man to he own opinion and conviction the duty of have earnest conviction and act up to they in all the affair of life george thayer and the deacon look easier she word seem after all rather a justification of they vehemence of feeling but when she come to speak of the thing that be god 's she word pierce they very soul the only thing that enable george thayer to bear up under it at all be as he afterwards say in the store keep he eye fix steady on old plummer 'cause you know boy i never jine the church nor make any kind o ' profession o ' goin ' in for any thing o ' god 's nohow not but what i have often wish i could see my way to : but sez i to myself ef he kin stan ' it i kin a ' so i hold out but i tell you boy i would rather drive the wust six-hoss team i ever get hold on down breakneck hill 'n the dark than set there agin under thet woman 's eye a blazin ' one minnit 'n fillin ' with tear the next : 'n' i do not care what anybody sez i be a goin ' to see she a ' tell she that she need not be afeard o ' ever hevin to preach to I s ' good s ' by my name in the meeting ` we agin by thunder suppose the bless savior have come walk through we street look for he child last Wednesday say draxy he would say to himself ' i shall know they wherever i find they : i have give they so many badge they will be sure to be wear some of they they suffer long and be kind they envy not vaunt not be not puff up : they be not easily provoke think no evil seek not they own rejoice in the truth they do not behave unseemly ' alas would the dear jesus have turn away believe himself a stranger and friendless in we village which one of you dear man could have spring forward to take he by the hand what terrible silence would have fall upon you as he look round on you angry face tear be roll down little reuby 's face slyly he try to wipe they away first with one hand then with the other lest he mother should see they he have never in he life see such a expression of suffer on she face he have never hear such tone of pain in she voice he be sorely perplexed and the sight of he distressed little face be almost more than the people could bear when draxy stop speak deacon plummer do a manly thing he rise instantly and say let we pray pour out as humble and contrite a petition for forgiveness as ever go up on wing of faith to heaven it clear the air like sweet rain it roll a burden off everybody 's heart -- most of all perhaps off draxy 's he be not angry after all she say god have lay it to he heart and when at the end of the service the old man come up to she and hold out he hand she take it in both of hers and say thank you dear deacon plummer thank you for help I so much to-day you prayer be better for the people than my little sermon a great deal the deacon wring she hand but do not speak a word only stoop and kiss reuby after this day draxy have a new hold on the people they have really feel very little surprise at she speaking to they as she do she have slowly and insensibly to herself grow into the same place which the elder have have in they regard the same in love and confidence but higher in reverence and admiration for although she sympathize just as lovingly as he in all they feeling they never for a moment cease to feel that she nature be on a higher plane than he they could not have put this in word but they feel it donno how ` tis they say but mis ' kinney even when she be closest to ye a ' a doin ' for ye all the time do not seem just like a mortal woman it be easy enough to know how ` tis reply angy plummer once in a moment of unguarded frankness mis kinney be a kind o ' daughter o ' god somthin ' as jesus christ be he son it be just the way jesus christ use to go round among folk 's near 's i can make out 'n' i for one do not believe that god jest send he once for all 'n' haint never send anybody else near we all this time i reckon he be a sendin ' down son and daughter to we oftener 'n' we think angy plummer i call that downright blasphemy exclaim she mother well call it what you be a mind to retort the crisp angy it be what i believe ` tis blasphemy though to be sayin ' it to folk that can not understand she mutter to herself as she leave the room ef blasphemy mean what mis ' kinney sez it do to speak stupidly three year have pass the novelty of draxy 's relation to she people have wear off the neighbor people have cease to wonder and to talk and the neighbor minister have cease to doubt and question clairvend and she have a stout supporter in old elder william who be look upon as a high authority throughout the region he always stay at reuben miller 's house when he come to the town and he counsel and sympathy be invaluable to draxy sometimes he say jocosely i be the pastor of brother kinney 's old parish and mis ' kinney be my curate and i wish everybody have as good a one it finally grow to be draxy 's custom to read one of she husband 's sermon in the forenoon and to talk to the people informally in the afternoon sometimes she write out what she wish to say but usually she speak without any note she also write hymn which she read to they and which the choir sometimes sing she be now fully imbue with the feeling that everything which she could do belong to she people next to reuben they fill she heart the sentiment be after all but a expand and exalt motherhood stranger sometimes come to clairvend to hear she preach for of course the fame of the beautiful white-robed woman-preacher could not be confine to she own village this always trouble draxy very much if we be not so far out of the world i should have to give it up she say i know it be proper they should come but it seem to I just as strange as if they be to walk into the study in the evening when i be teaching reuby i can not make it seem right and when i see they write down what i say it just paralyze I it might have seem so to draxy but it do not to she hearer no one would have suppose she conscious of any disturbing presence and more than one visitor carry away with he write record of she eloquent word one of she most remarkable sermon be call the gospel of mystery the text be psalm xix 2 : -- day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge first she dwell on the sweet meaning of the word gospel dear friend she say it be a much simpler word than we realize it be only ` good news ' ` good tiding ' we get gospel every day we child send we good news of they life what gospel of joy be such letter and nation to nation send good news : a race of slave be set free a war have end shipload of grain have be send to the starve a good man have be make ruler these be good tiding -- gospel after dwelling on this first simplest idea of the word until every one of she hearer have begin to think vividly of all the good tiding journey in word back and forth between heart and heart continent and continent she speak of the good news which nature tell without word here she be eloquent subtle as the idea be they be yet clothe in the plain speech which the plain people understand : the tiding of the spring of the winter of the river of the mountain of gold of silver of electric fire of blossom and fruit of seed-time and harvest of sun and star and water -- these be the speech which day utter unto day but knowledge be greater than speech : night in she silence show what day could not tell here the face of the people grow fix and earnest in any other hand than draxy 's the thought would have be too deep for they and they would have turn from it wearily but she simplicity control they always stand on you door-step on a dark night she say -- a night so dark that you can see nothing : look out into this silent darkness you will presently feel a far greater sense of how vast the world be than you do in broad noon-day when you can see up to the very sun himself more than one young face in the congregation show that this sentence strike home and throw light on hitherto unexplained emotion this be like what i mean continued draxy by the gospel of mystery the good tiding of the thing we can not understand this gospel be everywhere not the wisest man that have ever live can fully understand the smallest create thing : a drop of water a grain of dust a beam of light can baffle he utmost research so with we own life with we own heart every day bring a mystery -- sin and grief and death : all these be mystery gospel of mystery good tiding of mystery yes good tiding these be what prove that god mean to take we into another world after this one into a world where all thing which perplex we here will be explain o my dear friend she exclaim at last clasp she hand tightly thank god for the thing which we can not understand : except for they how should we ever be sure of immortality then she read they a hymn call the gospel of mystery come after the sermon it be sweet and clear to all the people 's heart before the sermon it would have seem obscure the gospel of mystery good tiding every day god 's messenger ride fast we do not hear one half they say there be such noise on the highway where we must wait while they ride past they banner blaze and shine with jesus christ 's dear name and story how by god 's design he save we in he love divine and lift we from we sin and shame they music fill the air they song sing all of heaven they ringing trumpet peal declare what crown to soul who fight and dare and win shall presently be give they hand throw treasure round among the multitude no pause no choice no count no bind no question how man be find if they be evil or be good but all the banner bear some word we can not read and mystic echo in the air which borrow from the song no share in sweetness all the song exceed and of the multitude no man but in he hand hold some great gift misunderstand some treasure for whose use or good he ignorance see no demand these be the token lend by immortality birth-mark of we divine descent surety of ultimate intent god 's gospel of eternity good tiding every day the messenger ride fast thanks be to god for all they say there be such noise on the highway let we keep still while they ride past but the sermon which of all other she people love best be one on the love of god this one she be often ask to repeat -- so often that she say one day to angy who ask for it why angy i be ashamed to everybody must know it by heart i be sure i do yes that be jest the way we do know it mis ' kinney by heart say the affectionate angy a ' that be jest the reason we want it so often i never tell ye what george thayer say the last time you read it to we do i no angy say draxy well he be singing in the choir that day 'n place o ' he brother who be sick 'n' he jump up on one o ' the seat 'n' swing he hat jest 's you be goin ' down the aisle 'n' we all ketched hold on he to pull he down 'n' try to hush he for you can not never tell what george thayer 'll do when he blood 's up 'n' we be afraid he be agoin ' to holler right out 's ef he be in the town - ` we but sez he in a real low trembly kind o ' voice ` ye need not be afraid i be not agoin ' to whoop -- taint that way i feel -- but i have to do suthin ' or i should bust ' : 'n' there be reel tear in he eye -- george thayer 's eye mis ' kinney then he jump down 'n' sez he ` i 'll tell ye what that sermon 's like : it be jest like one great rainbow all round ye and before 'n' behind 'n' everywhere 'n' the end o not reach way to the throne it jest dazzle my eye that be what it do ' this sermon have conclude with the follow hymn which draxy have write when reuby be only a few week old : -- the love of god like a cradle rock rock silent peaceful to and fro like a mother 's sweet look drop on the little face below hang the green earth swing turn jarless noiseless safe and slow fall the light of god 's face bend down and watch we below and as feeble babe that suffer toss and cry and will not rest be the one the tender mother hold the closest love the best so when we be weak and wretched by we sin weigh down distressed then it be that god 's great patience hold we closest love we best o great heart of god whose loving can not hinder be nor cross will not weary will not even in we death itself be lose -- love divine of such great loving only mother know the cost -- cost of love which all love pass give a son to save the lose there be little more to tell of draxy 's ministry it close as suddenly as it have begin it be just five year after the elder 's death that she find herself one Sunday morning feeling singularly feeble and lifeless she be bewilder at the sensation for in she apparent health she have never feel it before she could hardly walk could hardly stand she feel also a strange apathy which prevent she be alarm it be nothing she say i dare say most woman be so all the time i do not feel in the least ill and she insist upon it that no one should remain at home with she it be a communion Sunday and elder william be to preach how fortunate it be that mr william be here she think languidly as she seat herself in the eastern bay-window to watch reuby down the hill he walk between he grandparent hold each by the hand talk merrily and look up into they face draxy watch they until they figure become dim black speck and finally fade out of sight then she listen dreamily to the note of the slow-tolling bell when it cease she close she eye and she thought run back far back to the day when she be little draxy and elder kinney be only she pastor slowly she live she life since then over again its joy and its sorrow alike soften in she tender brooding thought the soft whir sound of a bird 's wing in the air rouse she : as it fly past the window she see that it be one of the yellow-hammer which still build they nest in the maple-grove behind the house ah think she i suppose it can not be one of the same bird we see that day but it be go on errand just the same i wonder dear seth if mine be nearly do at that instant a terrible pain shoot through she left side and force a sharp cry from she lip she half rise exclaim reuby oh darling and sink back in she chair unconscious just as elder william be conclude the communion service the door of the church be burst open and old ike totter into the aisle cry out in a shrill voice : -- mis ' kinney 's dead mi ' kinney 's dead the scene that follow could not be tell with fly foot the whole congregation speed up the steep hill -- angy plummer half lifting half drag reuby and the poor grandparent support on each side by strong man as they draw near the house they see draxy apparently sit by the open window o mamma why that be mamma shriek reuby she be sit just so when we come away she be not dead elder william reach the house first hannah meet he on the threshold tearless she dead sir she be cold as ice she must ha ' be dead a long time old ike have be ramble around the house and observe from the outside that draxy 's position be strange have compel hannah to go into the room she be a smilin ' just be you see she now say hannah 'n' i could not ha ' touch she to move she more 'n i could ha ' touch a angel there be grief as well as joy to which word offer insult draxy be dead three day later they lay she by the side of she husband and the gray-haired childless old people and the golden-haired fatherless and motherless boy return together broken-hearted to the sunny parsonage on the village a terrible silence that could be feel settle down a silence in which sorrowing man and woman creep about weep as those who can not be comfort then week follow after week and soon all thing seem as they have seem before but draxy never die to she people she hymn be still sing in the little lonely church she gospel still live in the very air of those quiet hill and the people smile through they tear as they teach she name to little child whose wife be she i be on my knee before my chrysanthemum-bed look at each little round tight disk of a bud and try to believe that it would be a snowy flower in two week in two week my cousin annie ware be to be marry : if my white chrysanthemum would only understand and make haste i be childish enough to tell they so but the childishness come of love -- of my exceed my unutterable love for annie ware if flower have soul the chrysanthemum understand I a sharp quick roll of wheel startle I i lift my head the wheel stop at we gate a hurry step come down the broad garden-path and almost before i have have time to spring to my foot dr fear have take both my hand in he have say -- annie ware have the fever -- have turn have go have shut the garden gate and the same sharp quick roll of wheel tell that he be far on he way to the next sufferer i do not know how long i stand still in the garden a miserable sullenness seem to benumb my faculty i repeat -- annie ware have the fever then i say -- annie ware can not die she be too young too strong and we love she so then i say again -- annie ware have the fever and all the time i seem not to be think about she at all but about the chrysanthemum whose top i still idly study for week a malignant typhus fever have be slowly creep about in the lower part of we village in all the street which have be under water in the spring freshet these street be occupy chiefly by labor people either mill-operative or shopkeeper of the poorer class it be part of the cruel calamity of they poverty that they could not afford to have homestead on the high plateau which lift itself quite suddenly from the river meadow and make we village a by-word of beauty all through new england upon this plateau be lay out street of great regularity shaded by grand elm many of which have be plant by hand that have handle the rope of the _ mayflower _ under the shade of these elm stand large old-fashioned house in that sort of sleepy dignity peculiar to old new england we who live in these house be also sleepy and dignified we know that under the hill as it be call live many hundred of man and woman who be stifle in summer for want of the breeze which sweep across we height cold in winter because the wall of we plateau shut down upon they the icy air from the frozen river and cut off the afternoon sun we be sorry for they and we send they cold meat and flannel sometimes but they life be as remote from we life as if they never cross we path it be not necessary to go into large city to find sharp line draw between the well-to-do and the poverty-stricken there be in many small village district separate from each other by as distinct a moral distance as divide fifth avenue from the five point and so it have come to pass that while for week this malignant fever have be creep about on the river shore we in we clearer purer air have not feel even a dread of it there have not be a single case of it west of the high water mark make by the terrible freshet of the previous spring we send brandy and wine and beef-tea into the poor comfortless grief-stricken house and we say at tea-time that it be strange people would persist in live down under the bank : what could they expect and besides they be so careless about drainage and ventilation now on the highest and loveliest spot in the richest and most beautiful house the sweetest and fairest girl of all we village lay ill of the deadly disease annie ware have the fever i wonder if some fiend be lurk by my side who keep say the word over and over in my ear with that indescribable mixture of dull and preternaturally sharpen sense which often mark the first moment of such distress i walk slowly to my room and in a short time have make all the necessary preparation for leave home i feel like a thief as i steal slowly down the stair with my travelling-bag in my hand at the door i meet my father hey-day my darling where now off to annie 's as usual he have not hear the tiding should i tell he i might never see he again only too well i know the terrible danger into which i be go but he might forbid I yes off to annie 's i say in a gay tone and kiss he spring down the step i do not see my father again for eighteen day on the step of my uncle 's house i meet old jane a color woman who have nurse annie ware when she be a baby and who live now in a little cottage near by from whose door-step she could see annie 's window and in whose garden she raise flower of all sort solely for the pleasure of carry they to annie every day jane 's face be positively gray with sorrow and fear she look at I with a strange sort of unsympathizing hardness in she eye she have never love I i know what she think she be say to herself : why not this one instead of the other o auntie i say i would die for annie you know i would at this she melt o honey don ' ye say that the lord -- but she could say no more she throw she apron up over she head and stride away the door of the house stand open i walk through room after room and find no human be at last at the foot of the stair in the back part of the house i come upon all the servant huddle together in a cower weep group flat on the floor with he face to the wall lay black csar the coachman i put my hand on he shoulder he jerk away impatiently yer jest lemme lone will yer he say in a choke voice then lift up he head and see it be i he half spring to he foot with a look of shame and alarm and involuntarily carry he hand to he head say : -- o miss who be gwine to think yer -- here he too break down and bury he face in he great hand i do not speak but the little group instinctively open to let I pass up the stair i have a vague consciousness that they say something as i turn into a little cross-hall which lead to annie 's room but without attend to they word i open she door the room be empty the bed strip of clothes the window wide open i sink into a chair and look from side to side i be too late after all that be why none of the servant dare speak to I a little slipper of annie 's lay on the floor by the bed i take it up and turn it over and over in my hand then i become conscious that my aunt ann be speak to I -- be call I by name earnestly repeatedly with terror in she voice my dear dear child helen helen helen she be not dead she be in my room come and see for yourself i have see my aunt ann every day for nineteen year -- i never know she until that moment i never see she real face until that moment i follow she slowly through room and passageway till she reach she own chamber the door be open the room be very dark on the threshold she pause and whisper you must not be frightened darling she will not know you she have not know any one for six hour i knelt down by the bed in a few moment my eye become use to the darkness and i see annie 's face lie motionless on the farther edge of the bed turn to the wall it be perfectly white except the lip which be almost black and be swollen and crust over with the fearful fever she beautiful hair fall in tangled mass and half cover she face she seem to be lie very uncomfortably say aunt ann but the doctor order that she should not be disturb in any way i look at my aunt 's face and listen to she voice in bewilderment the whole world have for year call she and with apparent justice a hard and unsympathizing woman no human being have ever see a really free unconstrained smile on she face or hear from she lip a impulsive word when it be know that the genial rollick open-hearted henry ware be to marry she everybody shudder as year go on everybody who sit by henry ware 's fireside and be kindle and make welcome by he undiminished and unconquerable cheeriness feel at the same time chill and paralyze by the courteous unexceptionable dignity of mr ware even i have the freedom of a daughter in they house and loving my uncle hardly less than i love my father have never once suppose that anybody could love aunt ann or that she would permit it i always feel a little terror when i see annie kiss she or my uncle put he arm around she my own loving caress over-flowing mother have give I by inheritance and have teach I by example a type of love which know no life without expression and very well i know that that sweet mother of mine whom the whole town loved and who herself love the whole world seem always turn into stone by the simple presence of aunt ann and now aunt ann be sit on the floor by my side cling to my hand rest my head on she bosom and as i feel instantly and instinctively reveal in she every tone look word such intensity and passionateness of feeling as i have never in my whole life see before i see then that she have always hold I side by side with she own child in she heart and that she know the rare quality of the love i have for annie i ought not to have let you come here she say more as if speak to herself than to I they too have but one but aunt ann you could not have keep I out i whisper yes i know that my child she reply but no one else would know it from that moment there be between my aunt ann and I a subtle bond which partook of all the holiest mystery of love there be both motherhood and the love of lover in my love for annie annie 's mother feel they and be willing to have she own motherhood add to and minister to by they from that moment i believe not even she husband seem so near to she in she relation with she child as i i will not write out the record of the next two week they seem as they pass a thousand year and yet in look back on they they seem only like one terrible breathless night my aunt and i alone do all that be do for annie there be whole day and whole night during which she talk incessantly sometimes with such subtle semblance of she own sweet self that we could hardly believe she do not know what she say sometimes with such wild ravings that we shake in terror and could not look at she nor at each other there be other day and night through which she lay in a sleep which seemed-no more like real sleep than the shrill voice of she ravings have seem like she real voice these be most fearful of all through all these day and night two man with white face and fold arm walk up and down in the room below or crouch on the threshold of we door listen for sign or word from we one be annie 's father and the other be she lover george ware he be she second cousin fifteen year older than she and have love she since the day she be one year old when at the ceremony of she christening he a proud shy boy of sixteen have be allow to carry she up-stair with she sweet name rest fresh and new on she little dewy forehead ah seldom do such love spring and grow and blaze on this earth as have warm the very air around annie from the moment of she birth george ware be a man of rare strength as this love show and with just such faithfulness as he faithfulness to annie he have love and care for he mother who have be for twenty year a widow they live on the outskirts of the town in a small house almost bury in the heart of a pine wood the wood be thread in all direction by mile of narrow path which shine in the shaded sunlight as if they be satin-floored for nineteen year it have be george ware 's joy to roam these path with he cousin annie first the baby whom he draw in she wicker wagon next the wayward little child who walk with stumble step and cling to he finger next the gay school-girl who bring all she perplexity and all she joy to be confide to he under the pine next the shyer and more silent maiden who come less often but linger helplessly until twilight make the fragrant aisle solemn and dim as cloister at last the radiant the child-like woman the promise wife no winter could set a barrier across these pine-wood path when the whole country about lay block and drift and half bury with snow all these spicy foot-road be keep clear and level and ready for annie 's foot whole day of george ware 's strength go into the work and the joy of do this in open space where the snow have drift deep he work it into solid wall almost as high on either hand as annie 's head in dark nook where the spreading pine and hemlock lay low and wide he toss the snow into fantastic and weird mass on the right and leave and clear great space where he know the partridge-berry would be ready with a tiny scarlet glow to light up the spot this be george ware 's woo it never step into the glare the contention of profaner air it be not a seek a find a conquest but a slow sure growth of possession which have as eternal foundation and seem as eternally safe as the result of organic law george 's picture hang in annie 's room opposite the foot of she bed opposite the foot of the bed in she mother 's room hang a large engraving of the sistine madonna i fancy that in annie 's quieter moment she eye rest with a troubled look upon this picture and one day when she be in a deep sleep i exchange the picture i feel as if even lifeless canvas which have george 's face paint upon it might work she good at last there come a night -- they say it be the fourteenth but the word convey no meaning to I -- there come a night when dr fear who have be sit by annie 's bed for two hour watch she every breath spring suddenly to he foot and beckon to my aunt and I to follow he into the next room he shut the door walk very swiftly up to we look first into she face then into mine then feel she pulse and then mine and then turn to I say -- it will have to be you we look at he in sudden terror the tear be roll down he wrinkled cheek what be it william gasp aunt ann it will have to be you he go on look I in the face and take no notice of she question you pulse can be trust there have be a change when annie wake out of this sleep she will know you it may be in two hour and it may not be for six but if in that first moment she be alarmed or agitate in any way she will die o william let I stay i will be calm moan my poor aunt then i observe for the first time that she have call he william and then for the first and last time i hear dr fear call my aunt ann darling and i remember in that instant that it have be say once in my hearing that it be because of he love for mr henry ware that dr william fear have live and would die a lonely man darling he say and put one hand on she shoulder you would kill you child i forbid you to cross the threshold of that room till i come back you will thank I to-morrow can you not trust I ann and he look down from he full height this brave old man into the face of the woman he have love with a look like the look of one who die to save another it be but for one second and then he be again the physician and turn to I go on i have another patient to whom i must instantly go and whom i may not be able to leave for hour you can do all that i would do -- i believe -- then he feel my pulse again and nod he head with a sort of grim professional satisfaction which no amount of emotion could wholly divert from its delight in the steady nerve and undisturbed current of a healthy body -- resume you have but one thing to do : when she wake look perfectly compose if she speak answer she in a perfectly natural voice give she two drop of this medicine and tell she to go to sleep again if you do this she will fall asleep at once if you show the least agitation she may die -- probably will -- and dr fear be go my aunt sit silently weep i kiss she without speak and go back to my chair by annie 's bed i drop the two drop of medicine into a spoon and prop the spoon carefully on a little silver tray so that i could reach it instantly it be just three o'clock in the morning hour after hour pass i could not hear annie 's breath my own din in my ear like the whir of mill a terror such as i can never describe take possession of I what if i be to kill annie how could i look compose speak naturally what would she say if i could but know and have my answer ready i firmly believe that the dawn of light save my sens and annie 's life when the first red beam shoot through the blind at the farther end of the room tear come into my eye i feel as if angel be watch outside a tiny sunbeam creep between the slat and fall on the carpet it be no more than a hair 's breadth but it be companionship to I slowly steadily it come towards I i forget all else in watch it to this day i can not see a slow-moving sunbeam on a crimson floor without a shudder the clock strike six seven eight nine the bell ring for school the distant hum of the town begin still there be no stir no symptom of life in the colorless face on the pillow the sunbeam have creep nearly to my foot involuntarily i lift my right foot and stretch it out-to meet the golden messenger have i dare to move i should have kneel and reach my hand to it instead perhaps even the slight motion i do make hasten annie 's wake for at that instant she turn she head uneasily on the pillow and open she eye i see that she know I i wonder how i could have distrust my own strength to meet she look i smile as if we be at play together and say -- good morning dear she smile languidly and say how come i in mamma 's bed i say quietly take this medicine darling and almost before the drop have pass she lip she eye close and she have fall asleep again when dr fear come into the room at noon he give one swift anxious glance at she face and then fall on he knee and fold he face in he hand i know that annie be safe then he go into the next room silently take aunt ann by the hand and lead she back to annie 's bedside point to the little bead of moisture on she forehead and say -- save the revulsion be too much for the poor mother 's heart she sink to the floor he lift she in he arm and carry she out and for the rest of that day my aunt ann that hard and unsympathizing woman pass from one strange fainting-fit into another until we be in almost as great fear for she life as we have be for annie 's at twilight annie rouse from she sleep again she be perfectly tranquil but too weak to lift even she little hand which have grow so thin and so wrinkled that it look like a wilted white flower lie on the white counterpane hour by hour she gain strength under the powerful restorative which be use and still more from the wonderful elasticity of she temperament from the very first day however a indefinable terror of misgive seize I as often as i hear she voice or look into she eye in vain i say to myself : it be the weakness after such terrible illness it be only natural i feel in the bottom of my heart that it be more on the fourth day she say suddenly look up at the picture of george ware -- why why be cousin george 's picture in here where be the madonna i reply : i move it in here dear for you i think you would like it no she say i like the madonna best : the dear little baby please carry george back into my room where he belong my heart stand still with terror she have never call george ware she cousin since they engagement she especially dislike any allusion to they relationship this be she first mention of he name and it be in all respects just what it would have be a year before dr fear have forbid we to allude to he or to she wedding-day or in fact to any subject calculate to arouse new train of think in she mind i wonder afterward that we do not understand from the first how he have fear that she brain might not fully recover itself as the rest of she exquisitely organize body seem fast do day after day pass annie could sit up could walk about she room she gain in flesh and color and strength so rapidly that it be a marvel she be gentle and gay and loving she old rare sweet self in every little way and trait and expression not a look not a smile not a tone be want but it be the annie of last year and not of this she make no allusion to she wedding the day for which have now pass she do not ask for george the whole year have drop out of she memory part of she brain be still diseased no human touch could venture to deal with it without the risk of the most terrible consequence dr fear 's face grow day by day more and more anxious he be baffle he be afraid he consult the most eminent physician who have have experience in disease of the brain they all counsel patience and advise against any attempt to hasten she recollection upon any point they all have know similar case but never one so sharply define or so painful as this still they be unanimous in advise that nothing should be say to startle she that all must be trust to time through these terrible day george ware be braver than any one else he faith in the absoluteness of he hold on annie be too great to be disturb he be by nature as patient as he be resolute he have not woo he wife for eighteen year to lose she now in any way except by death he think he comfort we all do be brave sweet mother of annie he use to say to my poor aunt ann all will be well it be nothing to I to wait another year after have wait all these it be not even hard for I to go without see she if that be best nevertheless he face grow thin and he eye heavy and he form bent as week after week pass and he come daily to the house only to be tell the same weary thing that annie have not ask for he the physician have say that it would be better that she should not see he until she have of she own accord mention he name she nerve be still in such a state that any surprise throw she into palpitation and alarm which do not pass off for hour no human being could tell how great might be the shock of see he face how much it might recall to she and whether if it recall all she could bear it from the outset george believe the physician be wrong in this but he dare not urge he instinct against they knowledge and he be patient of nature and so the day go on on on and there be no change except that annie grow steadily better and we heart grow steadily sicker and sicker until we almost look back with longing on the day when we fear she would die and yet in every respect except the memory of she lover annie be the same as before the closest scrutiny could discover no other change in she except perhaps that she seem even gayer than she use to seem and a shade less tender but this also be as she have be before she have promise to be george ware 's wife one morning george bring I a small bunch of lovely wild thing from the pine wood tiarella leave just tip with claret color by the early frost spray of linnea two or three tiny white maiden 's hair fern all tie by a knot of patridge-berry vine thick-set with scarlet berry give these to annie for I will you dear helen he say and observe very carefully how she be affect by they i remember that it be just one year ago that day that he have ask she to be he wife and i tremble to think of what hide meaning i might be messenger in carry she this silent token but i too feel as george do that she be drift farther and farther away from the memory we desire she should regain and that no physician 's knowledge could be so true as love 's instinct and i ask no counsel of any one but go swiftly to annie with the leaf in my hand o you darling how perfectly lovely she exclaim with a laugh of delight why these must have come from george 's wood have you be up there no dear i say george bring they for you this morning oh the good darling she exclaim be it decide about he go to indium i could not repress a little cry of anguish and terror a year before there have be a plan for he go out to india on a mercantile venture which promise great profit it have be give up partly because he mother feel that she could not live without he partly because he feel that he could not longer live without annie what be it dear she say in she softest most sympathizing voice with a little flush of alarm on she pale cheek what hurt you be you ill oh my poor helen you be all wear out with nursing I i will nurse you presently only a little twinge of my old neuralgia dear i say faintly these autumn wind be set it at work again she look anxiously at I for a few seconds and then begin to untie the bunch of leaf and spread out the long vine on the bed oh if i only have some moss she say i run to the green-house and bring she handful of beautiful drip moss from the rock in the fernery she fill a saucer with they put the tiarellum leave all round the rim and wind the linnea vine in and out as they grow in the wood then she lean back on she pillow and begin break the partridge-berry vine into short bit each with a scarlet berry on it these she set upright in the moss change and rearrange they so often that i wonder what could be she purpose and lean forward to see no no she say playfully push I back not till it be do presently she say now look i look and see a perfect beautifully form g make by the scarlet berry on the green moss there she say i 'll send that back to george to show he that i have find he in the berry or no she add we 'll keep it till he come to see I the doctor say i could be carry down-stairs to-morrow and then i shall begin to ` receive ' and she laugh a gay little laugh and sink back tire that moment stand out in my memory as the saddest hardest one of all i think at that moment hope die in my heart when i tell george of this and show he the saucer of moss -- for she have order it to be set on the drawing-room table say it be too pretty to stay up here with bottle and invalid -- he bury he face in he hand for many minute when he lift it he look I steadily in the eye and say -- she have utterly forget this whole year but i will win she again then he kneel down and kiss every little leaf and berry which she hand have touch and go away without speak another word it be decide after this that it could do no harm for he to see she indeed he now demand it he resolution be take you need not fear he say to dr fear that i shall agitate she by approach she as if she be my own she be not my own but she will be we all sit with tremble hand and beat heart as the hour approach at which we know the experiment be to be make annie have be carry down-stair and lay upon a lounge in the western bay-window of the library the lounge be cover with dark green damask old csar have so implored to be allow to carry she down that annie have insist that he should be gratify and she go down as she have so often do in she childhood with she soft white face lie close to he shine black one as he put she down in she rose-colored wrapper on the dark green damask he kneel before she and burst out in spite of himself into a sort of wild chant of thanksgiving but as we enter the door he spring up ashamed and turn to aunt ann say : beg pardon missis but this rise yere be too much pink rise for old csar it be too much pink rise for any human eye to see unmoved we all cry : and annie herself shed a few tear but finally help we all by say gayly -- you 'll make I ill again if you all go on like this i hate people that cry no stranger 's eye would have detect the thousandth part of a second 's pause which george ware 's foot make on the threshold of that room when he eye first see annie before the second have end he be simply the eager glad affectionate cousin and have take calmly and lovingly the child 's kiss which annie give he as she have give it every day of she life we could not speak my uncle try to read he newspaper my aunt 's hand shake in they pretense of sewing i throw myself on the floor at the foot of annie 's lounge and hide my face in its cushion but george ware 's brave voice go steadily on annie 's sweet glad tone weak and low but still sweeter than any other tone i ever hear chime in and out like fairy bell from upper air more than a hour pass i do not know one word that we say then george rise say : i must not tire you little annie so i be go now will you come again to-morrow she ask as simply as a little child yes dear if you be not the worse for this he reply and kiss she forehead and walk very quickly away without look back i follow he instantly into the hall for i have see that in he face which have make I fear that strong man as he be he would fall i find he sit on the lowest step of the staircase just outside the door my god helen he gasp it be not only this last year she have forget she have go back five year oh no dear george i say you be mistaken she remember everything up to a year ago you know she remember about you go to india that be nothing he say impatiently you can not any of you see what i mean i suppose but i tell you she have forget five year of I she be to I just as she be when she be fourteen do you think i do not know the face and voice and touch of each day of my darling 's life oh my god my god and he sink down on the stair again in a silence which be worse than groan i leave he there and go back to annie how old cousin george look she be say as i enter the room i do not remember that he be so old why he look as old as you do sweet papa but then reflectively after all he be pretty old he be fifteen year older than i be -- and i be nineteen : thirty-four that be old be it not papa say she half petulantly why do not you speak any of you you be get too tired my darling say she father and now i shall carry you up-stair after annie be asleep my aunt ann and i sit for hour in the library go over and over and over with weary hopelessness all she word and look and try to comfort each other i think each know the utter despair of the other 's heart from this time george come and go with all he old familiarity : not a day pass without he see annie and planning something for she amusement or pleasure not a day pass without she showing in many way that he make a large part of she life be really a central interest in it even to we who know the sad truth and who look on with intentness and anxiety hardly less than those with which we have watch she sick-bed week before -- even to we it seem many time as if all must be right no stranger but would believe they lover not a servant in the house dream but that miss annie be still look forward to she wedding they have all be forbid to allude to it but they suppose it be only on account of she weakness and excitability but every day the shadow deepen on george ware 's face i could see though he would not admit it that the same despair which fill my soul be settle down upon he dr fear too who come and spend long evening with we and cautiously watch annie 's every tone and look grow more and more uneasy dr -- one of the most distinguished physician of the insane in the country be invite to spend a few day in the house he be present to annie as a old friend of she father 's and win at once she whole confidence and regard for four day he study she case and frankly own himself baffle and unable to suggest any measure except the patient wait which be kill we all to tell this frail and excitable girl who have more than once faint at a sudden noise that this man whom she regard only as she loving cousin have be she promise husband -- and that have be within two week of she wedding-day she have now utterly forget it and all connect with it -- this would be too fearful a risk it might deprive she forever of she reason otherwise she seem in every respect even in the smallest particular herself she recollect she music she study she friend she be anxious to resume she old life at all point every day she make allusion to old plan or incident she have forget absolutely nothing except the loverhood of she lover every day she grow stronger and become more and more beautiful there be a slight under-current of arch mischievousness and half petulance which she have never have before and which add to she sweet sympathetic atmosphere make she indescribably charming as she grow stronger she frolic with every human being and every living thing when the spring first open and she could be out of door she seem more like a divine mixture of ariel and puck than like a mortal maiden i find she one day lie at full length on the threshold of the greenhouse twenty great azalea be in full bloom on the shelf -- white pink crimson she have gather handful of the fall blossom and be make she gray kitten which be as intelligent and as well train as a dog jump into the air to catch they as she toss they up i sit down on the grass outside and watch she silently oh you sober old helen she say you 'll be a owl for a thousand year after you die why can not you caper a little you do not know how nice it be just then george come slowly walk down the garden path he hand clasp behind he he head bent forward and he eye fix on the ground he do not see we annie exclaim -- there be cousin george too look at he would not you think he have just hear he be to be execute at twelve to-day i do not see what ail everybody george george she call come here for how many year be you sentence dear and how could you have be so silly as to be find out and then she burst into a peal of the most delicious laughter at he bewildered look i do not know darling for how many year i be sentence we none of we know he say in a tone which be sadder than he mean it should be and sober she loving heart instantly she spring to she foot and throw both she arm around he right arm a pretty trick she have keep from she babyhood and say -- oh you dear good darling do anything really trouble you how heartless i be but you do not know how it feel to have be so awfully ill and then to get well again it make one feel all body and no soul but i have soul enough to love you all dearly you know i have and i will not have you troubled tell I what it be this minute and she look at he with tear in she eye one wonder often if there be any limit to human endurance if there be who can say he have reach it each year we find that the thing which we think have take we last strength have leave we with strength enough to bear a harder thing it seem so with such scene as this in those sunny spring day when annie ware first go out into life again each day i say there can never be another moment quite so hard to meet as this and the next day there come a moment which make I forget the one which have go before it be a ill fortune which just at this time make it imperatively necessary for george to go to the west for three month he have no choice he mother 's whole property be at stake no one but he could save it it be not certain that he could he last word to I be -- i trust more in you helen than in any other human be keep my name constantly in she thought write I everything which you would tell I if i be here it have become necessary now to tell the sad story of the result of annie 's illness to all those friend who would be likely to speak to she of she marriage the whole town know what shadow rest on we heart and yet as week after week go by and the gay sweet win beautiful girl move about among people again in she old way people begin to say more and more that it be after all very foolish for annie ware 's friend to be so distressed about she stranger thing have happen she be evidently a perfectly well woman and as for the marriage they have never like the match -- george ware be too old and too grave for she and besides he be she second cousin oh the torture of the ante-mortem of beloved one at which we be all force to assist yet it could not be wonder at that in this case the whole heart of the community be alive with interest and speculation annie ware 's sweet face have be know and love in every house in we village she father be the richest most influential man in the county and the most benevolent many a man and woman have kiss henry ware 's baby in she little wagon for the sake of henry ware 's good deed to they or theirs and while mr ware have always repel person by she haughty reticence annie from the first day she could speak until now have win all heart by she sunny open sympathizing nature no wonder that now when they see she again fresh glad beautiful and look stronger and in better health than she have ever do they say that we be wrong that annie and nature be right and that all would be well this spring there come to we town a family of wealth and position who have for many year live in europe and who have now return to make america they home they have take a furnished house for a year to make trial of we air and also perhaps of the society although rumor with the usual jealousy say that the neal do not desire any intimacy with they neighbor the grounds of the house which they have hire join my uncle 's and my aunt ann usually averse to make new acquaintance have call upon they at once and have welcome they most warmly to she house the family consist of mr and mr neal and two son arthur and edward they be people of culture and of wide experience but they be not of fine organization nor of the highest breeding and it will ever remain a mystery to I that there should have seem to be from the outset a especial bond of intimacy between they and my uncle and aunt i think it be partly the sense of relief with which they welcome a new interest -- a little break in the monotony of anxiety which have be for so many month corrode they very live almost before i know that the neal be accept as familiar friend i be startle one morning while we be at breakfast by the appearance of annie on she pony look in at we dining-room window she have a pretty way of ride up noiselessly on the green grass and make she pony which be tame as a newfoundland dog mount the stone step and tap with he nose on the pane of the long glass door till we open it i never see she so angelically beautiful as she be this morning she cheek be flush and she dark blue eye sparkle like gem in the sun presently she say hesitate a little -- edward neal be at the gate may i bring he in i tell he he might come but he say it be too like burglary and she canter off again without wait to hear my mother 's permission all that morning annie ware and edward neal sit with I on we piazza i look and listen and watch like one in a dream or under a spell i foresaw i foreknew what be to come with the subtle insight of love i see all never have i see annie so stir into joyousness by george 's presence as she seem to be by this boy 's the two together overflow in a sparkling current of gayety which be irresistible they seem two divine child send out on a mission to set the world at play what edward neal 's more sensuous and material nature lack be supply by the finer subtler quality of annie 's from that first day i could never disguise from myself that they seem so far as mere physical life go the absolute counterpart of each other i need not dwell on this part of my story when young heart be draw together summer day speed on very swiftly george ware alas be keep at the west week after week until it come to be month after month my uncle and aunt seem deliberately to shut they eye to the drift of event i think they be so thankful to watch annie 's bound health and happiness to hear glad voice and merry laugh echo all day in they house that they could not allow themselves to ask whether a new kernel of bitterness of danger lay at the core of all this fair seeming as for the child they do not know that they be loving each other as man and woman edward neal be only twenty-one annie but nineteen and both be singularly young and innocent of soul and so it come to be once more the early autumn the maple leave be begin to be red and my chrysanthemum have again set they tiny round disk of bud edward and annie have say no word of love to each other but the whole town look on they as lover and people begin to reply impatiently and incredulously to we assurance that no engagement exist early in October george come home very unexpectedly take even he mother by surprise he tell I afterwards that he come at last as one warn of god a presentiment of evil against which he have struggle for week finally so overwhelmed he that he set off for home without half a hour 's delay i find he on the night after he arrival sit in he old place in the big arm-chair at the head of annie 's lounge she still cling to some of she old invalid way and spend many evening curl up like a half-shut pink rise on the green damask cushion he look worn and thin but glad and eager and be give a lively account of he western experience when the library door open and come in unannounced with the freedom of one at home edward neal enter o edward here be cousin george exclaimed annie while a wave of rosy color spread over she face and half rise she take george 's hand in hers as she lean towards edward oh i be so glad to see you mr ware say edward with that indefinable tone of gentle respect which mark a very young man 's recognition of one much older whom he have be lead to admire annie have be talk to I about you all summer i feel as if i know you almost as well as she do i be heartily glad to see you a man of finer grain than edward neal would have know the whole truth in that first second by the blank stern look which spread like a cloud over george ware 's face but the open-hearted fellow only think that he have perhaps seem too familiar and go on -- i beg you pardon mr ware it must appear strange to you that i take the liberty of be so glad but you do not know how kindly i have be allow to feel that you friend here would permit I to call all they friend mine and he glance lovingly and confidently at my aunt and uncle who answer by such smile as they rarely give oh no wonder they love this genial frank sunny boy who have bring such light into they life in a moment george be he courteous self again and begin to express he pleasure at meeting mr neal but annie interrupt he oh now do not be tiresome of course you be to be just as good friend with edward as you be with I : sit down edward he be tell we the most delicious story he be the dearest cousin george in the world she add stroke he hand which she still keep in hers it give edward no more surprise to see she do this than it would have do to see she sit in she father 's lap even i feel with a sudden pang that george ware seem at that moment to belong to another generation than edward and annie edward seat himself on a low cricket at the foot of the lounge and look up in george 's face say most winningly -- please go on mr ware then he turn one full sweet look of greet and welcome upon annie who beam back upon he with such a diffused smile as only the rarest face have annie 's smile be one of she greatest charm it change she whole face the lip make but a small part of it no mortal ever see it without smile in answer it be beyond george ware 's power long to endure this probably he instinct feel in both edward 's atmosphere and annie 's more than we do he rise very soon and say to I if you be go home to-night helen will you let I walk up with you i have business in that part of the town but i must go now perhaps that will hurry you too much he add with a tone which be almost implore i be only too glad to go we leave-taking be very short a shade of indefinable trouble cloud every face but edward 's and annie 's george do not speak until we have leave the house then he stop short take both my hand in he with a grasp that both hurt and frighten I and exclaim -- how dare you keep this from I how dare you o george i say there be nothing to tell nothing to tell and he voice grow hoarse and loud nothing to tell do you mean to say that you do not know have not know that annie love that boy that puppy i tremble from head to foot i could not speak he go on : -- and i trust you so o helen i can never forgive you i murmured miserably for i feel myself in that moment really guilty -- what make you think she love he you can not deceive I helen he reply do not torture I and yourself by try tell I now how long this ` edward ' have be sit by she lounge tell I all then i tell he all it be not much he have see more that evening and so have i than have ever exist before he presence have be the one element which have suddenly define that which before have be hardly recognize he be very quiet after the first moment of bitterness and ask I to forgive he impatient word when he leave I he say -- i can not see clearly what i ought to do annie 's happiness be my only aim if this boy can create it and i can not -- but he can not : she be as utterly mine as it be possible for a woman to be you none of you know how utterly oh my god what shall i do and he walk away feebly and slowly like a old man of seventy the next day aunt ann send for I to come to she i find she in great distress george have return to the house after leave I and have have almost a stormy interview with my uncle he insist upon ask annie at once to be he wife make no reference to the past but appear at once as she suitor my uncle could not forbid it for he recognize george 's right and he sympathize in he suffering but he terror be insupportable at the thought of have annie agitate and of the possible result which might follow he implore george to wait at least a few week what and see that young lover at my wife 's foot every night say george fiercely no i will risk all lose all if need be i have be hold back long enough and he have go directly from my uncle 's room to annie herself in a short time annie have come to she mother in a perfect passion of weep and tell she that cousin george have ask she to be he wife and that she have never dream of such a thing and she think he be very unkind to be so angry with she how could she have suppose he care for she in that way when he have be like she elder brother all he life why he seem almost as old as papa say poor annie sobbing and cry and he ought to have know that i should not kiss he and put my arm around he if -- if -- she could not explain but she know annie have go to she own room ill my aunt and i sit together in the library silently cry we be wretched oh if george would only have wait say aunt ann i think it would have make no difference aunty say i no i be afraid not reply she and each know that the other be think of edward neal george ware left town the next day he send I a short note he could not see any one he say and beg I to give a farewell kiss for he to the sweet mother of my annie for mine she be and will be in heaven though she will be the wife of edward neal on earth when i next saw we annie she be edward neal 's promise bride a severe fit of illness the result of all these excitement confine I to my room for three week after george 's departure and i know only from aunt ann 's lip the event which have follow upon it george ware 's presence on that first evening have bring revelation to edward neal as well as to all the other member of that circle that very night he have tell he parent that annie would be he wife the next night while poor george be swiftly bear away edward be sit in my uncle 's library listen with a blanched cheek to the story of annie 's old engagement my uncle 's sense of honor would not let he withhold anything from the man seek she for he wife the pain soon pass by when he be tell that she have that very day refuse she cousin and betray almost resentment at he offer edward neal have not a sufficiently subtle nature nor acquaintance enough with psychological phenomenon to be disturb by any fear for the future he dismiss it all as a inexplicable result of the disease but a fix fact and a great and bless fortune for he my uncle however be less easily assure he insist upon delay and upon consult the same physician who have study annie 's case before they all agree that she be now a perfectly healthy and strong woman and that to persist in any farther recognition of the old bond after she have so intelligently and emphatically repudiate all thought of such a relation to she cousin be absurd dr fear alone be in doubt he say little but he shake he head and clasp he hand tight and implore that at least the marriage should be defer for a year annie herself however refuse to consent to this : of course no satisfactory reason could be allege for any such delay and she say as frankly as a little child edward and i have love each other almost from the very first there be nothing for either of we to do in life but to make each other happy and we shall not leave papa and mamma : so why should we wait they be not marry however until spring the whole town stand by in speechless joy and delight when those two beautiful young being come out from the village church man and wife it be a scene never to be forget the peculiar atmosphere of almost playful joyousness which they create whenever they appear together be something which could not be describe but which diffuse itself like sunlight we all try resolutely to dismiss memory and misgiving from we heart they seem disloyalty and sin george ware be in indium george ware 's mother be dead the cottage among the pine be sell to stranger and the glisten brown path under the tree be neglect and unused edward and annie lead the same gay child-like life after they marriage that they have lead before : they look even younger and gayer and sunnier when they dash canter through the river meadow she with rosy cheek and pale brown curl fly in the wind and he with close crisp black hair and the rich dark glowing skin of a spaniard the farm man turn and rest on they tool and gaze till they be out of sight sometimes i ask myself wonderingly be they ever still and tender and silent be this perpetual overflow the whole of love but it seem treason to doubt in the presence of such merry gladness as shone in annie 's face and in she husband 's too it be simply the incarnate triumph and joy of young life the summer go by the chrysanthemum bloom out white and full in my garden the frost come and then the winter and then annie tell I one day that before winter come again she would be a mother she be a little sober as she see the intense look on my face why darling be not you glad i think you would be almost as glad as i be myself annie sometimes misunderstand I now glad o annie be all i could say from that day i have but one thought annie 's baby together we work all dainty marvel for its ward-robe together we plan all possible event in its life : from the outset i feel as much motherhood to the precious little unseen one as annie do she use to say to I often -- darling it will be half my baby and half yours annie be absolutely and gloriously well through the whole of those mysterious first month of maternity which be to so many woman exhaust and painful every nerve of she body seem strung and attuned to normal and perfect harmony she be more beautiful than ever stronger than ever and so glad that she smile perpetually without know it for the first time since the old day dear dr fear 's face lose the anxious look with which he eye always rest upon she he be more at ease about she now before light one Sunday morning in December a messenger ring furiously at we bell we have be look for such tiding and be not alarm it be a fearful storm wind and sleet and rain and darkness have attend the come of annie 's little Sunday child into its human life a boy -- and miss annie 's all right old csar say with a voice almost as hoarse as the storm outside and he be go before we could ask a question farther in less than a hour i stand on the threshold of annie 's room but i do not see she until noon then as i creep softly into the dimly-lighted chamber the whole scene so recall she illness of two year before that my heart stand still with sudden horror in spite of all my joy now as then i knelt silently at she bedside and see the sweet face lie white and still on the pillow she turn and see I smile faintly but do not speak at she first glance a speechless terror seize I this be my annie the woman who for two year have be smile with my annie 's face have not be she the room grow dark i do not know what supernatural power come to my aid that i do not faint and fall annie draw back the bed-clothes with a slow feeble motion of she right hand and point to the tiny little head nestle in she bosom she smile again look at I gently and steadily for a second and then shut she eye presently i see that she be asleep i steal into the next room and sit down with my face bury in my hand in a moment a light step arouse I aunt ann stand before I she pale face all aglow with delight o helen my darling she be so well thank god thank god and she throw she arm around I and burst into tear i feel like one turn to stone be i mad or be they what have i see in that one steady look of annie 's eye be she really well i feel as if she have already die agonizingly i wait to see dr fear 's face he come in before tea see annie for a few minute and come down-stair rub he hand and singing in a low tone i never see anything like that child 's beautiful elasticity in my life he say we shall have she dancing down-stair in a month the cloud be utterly lift from all heart except mine my aunt and uncle look at each other with swim eye edward try to laugh and look gay but break down utterly and take refuge in the library where i find he lie on the floor with he face bury in annie 's lounge i go home stupefied bewildered i could not sleep a terror-stricken instinct tell I that all be not right but how should i know more than physician mother husband for ten day i see my annie every day for a hour she sweet strange gentle steady look into my eye when we first meet always paralyzed I with fear and yet i could not have tell why there be a fathomless serenity in she face which seem to I super-human she say very little the doctor have forbid she to talk she sleep the greater part of the time but never allow the baby to be move from she arm while she be awake there be a divine ecstasy in she expression as she look down into the little face it never seem like human motherhood one day edward come to I and say -- do you think annie be so well as they say i suppose they must know but she look to I as if she have die already and it be only she glorified angel-body that lie in that bed i could not speak to he i know then that he have see the same thing that i have see : if he strong rather obtuse material nature have recognize it what could so blind she mother and father and the doctor i burst into tear and leave he at the end of a week i see a cloud on dr fear 's face as he leave annie 's room one morning he stop I and say abruptly -- what do annie talk about she hardly speak at all i say ah he say well i have order she not to talk but do she ask any question he continue no i say not of I she have not ask one i see then that the same vague fear which be fill my heart be take shape in he from that moment he watch she hourly with a anxiety which soon betray itself to my aunt william why do not annie get stronger she say suddenly to he one day i do not know why he answer with a solemn sadness and emphasis in he tone which be as i think he intend it to be a partial revelation to she and a warning aunt ann stagger to a chair and look at he without a word he answer she look by one equally agonized and silent and leave the room the baby be now two week old annie be no stronger than on the day of he birth she lay day and night in a tranquil state smile with inexpressible sweetness when she be speak to rarely speaking of she own accord do with gentle docility all she be tell to do but look more and more like a transfigured saint all the arch joyous playful look be go there be no add age in the look which have take its place neither any sorrow but something ineffably solemn rapt remove from earth sometimes when edward come to she bedside a great wave of pity tenderness would sweep over she face give it such a heavenly look that he would fall on he knee o helen he say once after such a moment as this i shall go mad if annie do not get well i do not dare to kiss even she hand i feel as if she never have be mine at last the day and the hour and the moment come which i have know would come annie speak to I in a very gentle voice and say -- helen darling you know i be go to die yes dear i think so i say in as quiet a voice as hers you know it be better that i should darling she say with a tremble voice yes dear i know it i reply she draw a long sigh of relief i be so glad darling i think you know it but i could not be sure i think no one else understand i hope dear mamma will never suspect you will not let she if you can help it the dear doctor will not tell she he know though darling i want you to have my baby i think edward will be willing he be so young he will be happy again before long he will not miss he you know we have always say it be partly you baby look at he eye now helen she say turn the little face towards I and into a full light i start i have never till that moment see in they a subtle resemblance to the eye of george ware we have say that the baby have he mother 's eye -- so he have but there have always be a likeness between annie 's eye and george 's though hers be light-blue and he of a blue so dark that it be often believe to be black all the wares have a very peculiar luminousness of the eye it be so marked a family trait that it have pass into almost proverbial mention in connection with the distinguished beauty of the family the ware eye be always recognizable no matter what color it have take from the admixture of other blood at that moment i saw and i know that annie have see that the baby 's eye be not so much like she own as like the deeper sadder darker eye of she cousin -- brave hopeless dear george who be toiling under the sun of indium make a fortune for he know not whom we neither of we speak presently the little unconscious eye close in sweet sleep and annie go on hold he close to she heart you see dear poor mamma will not be able to bear see he after i die common mother would love he for my sake but mamma be not like other woman she will come very soon where i be poor mamma and then you will have to take papa home to you house and papa will have comfort in little henry but he must be you baby helen i shall speak to edward about it soon she be not strong enough to talk long she shed no tear however and look as calm as if she be tell I of pleasant plan for a come earthly summer i also be perfectly calm and feel strangely free from sorrow she absolute spirituality bear I up it be as if i speak with she in heaven thousand of century after all human perplexity have pass away after this day she grow rapidly weaker she have no pain there be not a single physical symptom in she case which the science of medicine could name or meet there be literally nothing to be do for she neither tonic nor stimulant produce the least effect she be noiselessly sink out of life as very old people sometimes die without a single jar or shock or struggle she beautiful serenity and entire freedom from suffer blinded aunt ann 's eye to the fact that she be die this be a great mercy and we be all careful not by a word or look to rouse she to the truth to all she mother 's inquiry annie invariably reply better dear mamma better only very weak and aunt ann believe until the very last that the spring would make she well again edward neal 's face during these week be like the face of a man lose in a trackless desert seek vainly for some sign of road to save he life sickness and death be as foreign to the young vital irrepressible current of he life as if he have be a bird or a antelope but it be not now with he the mere bewildered grief of a sensuous animal nature such as i should have anticipate that he grief would be he dimly feel the truth and be constantly terrify by it he come into annie 's presence more and more reverently each day he gaze speechlessly into she eye which rest on he always with angelic compassion and tenderness but with no more look of human wifely thought than if he and she be kneel side by side before god 's white throne sometimes he dare not touch even so much as the hand on which he own wedding-ring rest sometimes he would kneel by the bedside and bury he face and weep like a little child then he would throw himself on he horse and gallop away and not come home until twilight when he be always find on annie 's lounge in the library one night when i go to he there he say in a tone so solemn that the voice do not sound like he -- helen there be something i do not understand about annie do people always seem so when they be go to die i do not dare to ask she if she love I i feel just as much awe of she as if she have be in heaven it seem sometimes as if i must be go mad for i do not feel in the least as if she have ever be my wife she never have poor boy i thought but i only stroke he hair and say nothing wonder in my heart at the certainty with which in all nature love know how to define conquer reclaim he own the day before annie die she ask for she jewel-case and spend several hour in look over its contents and tell I to whom they should be give i observe that she seem to be search uneasily for something she could not find what be it dear i say she hesitate for a secondhand then reply -- only a little ring i have when i be a girl when you be a girl my darling i exclaimed she smile gently and say -- i feel like a old woman now oh here it be she add and hold it out to I to open for she the tiny padlock-shaped locket which hang from it it have become so tightly fasten together that it be with great difficulty i could open it when i do so i see lie in the hollow a little ring of black hair and i remember that annie have wear the ring when she be twelve year old she ask I to cut a few of the silky hair from the baby 's head and then one little curl from she own and lay they with the other she shut the locket and ask for a piece of paper and pencil she write one word with great difficulty fold the ring in the paper write another word on the outside and lay it in a corner of the jewel-case then she sink back on the pillow and slip she left hand under she cheek say she be very tired and almost instantly fall into a gentle sleep she do not wake until twilight i be to sleep on the lounge in she room that night and when she wake i be prepare it darling she say could you sleep as well in my big chair which can be tip back certainly sweet i say but why because that can be draw up so much nearer I it will be like sleep together at nine o'clock the nurse bring the baby in and lay he in annie 's bosom sound asleep annie would not let he lie anywhere else and be so grieve at any remonstrance that the doctor say she must be indulge in the desire when she be awake and be not speak to we she eye never leave the baby 's face she turn over with she face to the chair in which i lay and reach out she left hand towards I i take it in mine and so with we hand clasp above the little sleep baby we say good-night to each other i feel much better to-night than i have for some day dear helen she say i should not wonder if we all three sleep until morning very soon i see that she be asleep i watch she face for a long time it be perfectly colorless and very thin and yet there be not a look of illness on it the ineffable serenity the holy peace make it look like the face of one who have be transfigure translate who have not know and who never could know any death i can not account for the sweet calm which i feel through all these week i shed no tear i do not seem even to sorrow i accept all as annie herself accept it without wonder without murmur during the long hour of this last night i live over every hour of she precious beautiful life as i have know and share it until the whole seem to I one fragrant and perfect flower ready to be gather and worn in the bosom of angel at last i fall asleep i be waken by a low murmur from the baby who stir uneasily annie 's hand be still lock in mine as i seek to disengage it cautiously i feel with a sudden horror that the finger be lifeless i spring to my foot and bent over she she do not breathe out of that sweet sleep she body have pass into another which would know no waking and she soul have awaken free slowly i withdraw the little sleep baby from she arm and carry it to the nurse then i go to dr fear 's room he have sleep in the house for a week i find he dress but asleep on a lounge he have lie in this way he tell I for four night expect that each would be the last when i touch he on the shoulder he open he eye without surprise or alarm and say -- do she wake no i reply and that be all the day be just break : as the dark gray and red tint clear and roll away and leave a pale yellow sky the morning star which i could see from annie 's bedside fade and melt in the pure ether even while i be look at it it vanish and i think that like it annie 's bright soul disappear from my sight have blended in eternal day \* \* \* \* \* this be four year ago my aunt ann die as annie have say she would in a very few month afterward my uncle come a broken and tremble man to live with we and edward neal gladly give he little son into my hand as annie have desire he go abroad immediately find it utterly impossible to bear the sight of the scene of he lose happiness he come back in two year bring a bright young wife with he a sunny-haired english girl who he say be so marvelously like annie she be like the annie whom he know every day they baby boy be bring to we house to see he brother but i think two child of one name never before look so unlike my little henry be the center of he grandfather 's life and of mine he be a pensive child and have never be strong but he beauty and sweetness be such that we often tremble when we look in he face and remember annie george ware be still in indium every ship bring brave sweet letter and gift for the baby i send he the little paper which i find in the corner of annie 's jewel-case bear he name i know that it be for he when i see she feeble hand lay the baby 's hair and hers together in the locket in November annie 's grave be snowy with white chrysanthemum she love they better than any other flower and i have make the little hillock almost into a thicket of they in george ware 's last letter he write : -- when the baby be ten year old i shall come home he will not need I till then till then he be better in you hand alone after that i can help you the one-legged dancer very early one morning in march ten year ago i be sit alone on one of the crumble ledge of the coliseum : lark be singing above my head wall-flower be wave at my foot a procession of chant monk be walk slowly around the great cross in the arena below i be on the highest tier and they voice reach I only as a indistinct wail like the note of a distant aeolian harp but the joyous sun and sky and song be darken and dull by they presence a strange sadness oppress I and i sink into a deep reverie i do not know how long i have be sit there when i be suddenly rouse by a cry of pain or terror and the noise of fall stone i spring to my foot and look over see a young and beautiful woman lie fearfully near the edge of one of the most insecure of the project ledge on the tier below I -- the very one from which i have myself nearly fall only a few day before in stretch over after some asphodel which be beyond my reach i run down as fast as possible but when i reach the spot she have faint and be utterly unconscious she be alone i could see no other human being in the coliseum the chant monk have go even the beggar have not yet come i try in vain to rouse she she have fall so that the hot sun be beat full on she face i dare not leave she there for she first unconscious movement might be such that she would fall over the edge but i see that she must have shade and water or die every instant she grow whiter and she lip look more rigid i shout aloud and only the echo answer I as if in mockery a little lark suddenly fly out from a tuft of yellow wall-flower close by and burst into a swift carol of delight as he soar away at last with great effort i succeed in drag she by she foot -- for i dare not venture out so far as the spot on which she head lay -- to a safer place and into the partial shade of a low bush as i do this one of she delicate hand be scratch and tear on the rough stone and drop of blood come to the surface in the other hand be crush a few spike of asphodel the very flower no doubt which have lure I so near the same dangerous brink it seem impossible to go away and leave she but it be cruel to delay my foot feel like lead as i run along those dark gallery and down the stone flight of giddy stair just in the entrance stand one of those pertinacious seller of old coin and bit of marble i throw down a piece of silver on he little stand seize a small tin basin in which he have he choicest coin empty they on the ground and say in my poor italian lady -- ill -- water i have fill the basin at the old stone fountain near by and be half way up the first flight of stair again before he know what have happen when i reach the place where i have leave the beautiful stranger she be not there unutterable horror seize I have i after all leave she too near that crumble edge i groan aloud and turn to run down a feeble voice stop I -- a whisper rather than a voice for there be hardly strength to speak -- who be there oh thank god i exclaimed you be not dead and i spring to the next of the cross corridor from which the sound have come she be there sit up lean against the wall she look almost more terrify than relieve when she see I i bathed she face and hand in the water and tell she how i have find she insensible and have draw she away from the outer edge before i have go for the water she do not speak for some moment but look at I earnestly and steadily with tear stand in she large blue eye then she say i do not know that any one but myself ever come to the coliseum so early i think i should die here alone and robert be not willing i should come i owe you my life she add burst into hysterical cry then in a few moment she half laugh as if at some droll thought and say but how could you drag I you be not nearly so big as i be the angel must have help you and hold up the poor crushed asphodel she go on : as soon as i come to myself i see the asphodel in my hand and i say ` asphodel for burial ' and try to throw they away so that if robert come he would not find I dead with they in my hand for only yesterday he say to I ` please never pick a asphodel -- i can not bear to see you touch one ' slowly i soothe she and she recover she color and strength the owner of the basin follow by a half-dozen chatter vetturinus have climb up to we but we have peremptorily send they all away it be evident that she be not seriously hurt the terror rather than the fall have cause she fainting it be probably a sudden dizziness which have come as she draw back and turn after pick the flower have she fall in the act of pick they she must have be dash to the ground below at the end of a hour she be so nearly well that she walk slowly down the long stair lean on my arm and take frequent rest by the way i be about to beckon to one of the vetturinus when she say oh no my own carriage be near here up by the gate of the palace of the csars i ramble on without think at first of come to the coliseum : it will do I good to walk back every moment of the air make I feel better so we go slowly on up the solemn hill arm in arm like friend sit down now and then on old fall column to rest and look back at the silent majestic ruin which be brighten almost into a look of life under the vivid sun my companion speak little the reaction after she fearful shock have set in but every few moment she beautiful eye would fill with tear as she look in my face and press my arm i leave she at she apartment on the via felice my own be a mile farther on in the piazza del popolo and i would not let she drive so far it grieve I not to go with you to you door she say as she bid I good-bye but i shall come and see you to-morrow and bring my husband no you must not i reply to-morrow you will be wise enough -- or if you be not wise enough you will be kind enough to I because i ask it -- to lie in bed all day and i shall come very early in the morning to see how you be she turn suddenly on the carriage-step and lean both she hand on my knee exclaim in a voice full of emotion will you let I kiss you not even my mother give I what you have give for you have give I back life when it be too infinitely precious to lose surely you will not think I presume and she cheek flush a little presume my dear child i love you the first moment i see you lie there on the stone and i be almost old enough to be you mother too i reply and i kiss she sweet face warmly this be the beginning of my acquaintance and friendship with dora maynard at eleven o'clock the next morning i go to see she i be show into a room whose whole air be so unlike that of a roman apartment that i could scarcely believe i have not be transport to english or american soil in spite of its elegance the room be as home-like and cozy as if it nestle in the berkshire hill or stand on worcestershire meadow the window be heavily curtained and the furniture cover with gay chintz of a white ground with moss-rose bud thickly scatter over it between broad stripe of rose-pink the same chintz be flute all around the cornice of the room make the wall look less high and stately the doorway also be curtain with it great wreath and nod mass of pampas grass be above the door a white heron and a rose-colored spoonbill stand together on a large bracket in one corner and a huge gray owl be perch on what look like a simple old apple-tree bough over a inlay writing-table which stand at a odd slant near one of the window book be everywhere -- in low swing shelf suspend by large green cord with heavy tassel on low bracket shelf in unexpected place with deep green fringe or fluting of the chintz in pile on moorish stool or old venice chest every corner look as if somebody make it a special haunt and have just go out on a round mosaic table stand a exqusite black-and-gilt etruscan patera fill with white anemone on another table near by stand a silver one fill with the same flower pink and yellow each be circle round the edge with fringe mass of maiden-hair fern every lounge and chair have a low broad foot-stool before it ruffle with the chintz and in one corner of the room be a square pink and white and green moorish rug with ten or a dozen chintz-covered pillow pile up in a sort of chair-shaped bed upon it and a fantastic ebony box standing near the lid throw back and battledoor and shuttlecock and many other gay-colored game toss in confusion the wall be literally full of exquisite picture no very large or rare one all good for every-day live some fine old etching exquisite water-color a swarthy campagna herds-boy with a peacock feather and a scarlet ribbon in he black hat and for a companion-picture the herds-boy of the mountain fair rosy stand out on a opaline snow-peak with a glisten edelweiss in he hand opposite these a large picture of haag 's a camel in the desert the arab wife and baby in a flutter mass of basket and fringe and shawl and scarf on he back the arab father walk a few step in advance playing on musical pipe he tasseled robe blow back in the wind on one side of this a venice front and on another a crag of norway pine here and there small leaf of photograph from original drawing by the old master leonardo raphael titian and luinus and everywhere in all possible and impossible place flower and vine i never see wall so decorate yellow wall-flower wave above the picture of the norway pine great scarlet thistle branch out each side of the venetian palace cool maiden-hair fern seem to be grow all around the glowing crimson and yellow picture of the arab in the desert afterward i learn the secret of this beautiful effect large flat wide-mouthed bottle fill with water be hang on the back of the picture frame and in these the vine and flower be grow only a worshipper of flower would have devise this simple method of at once enshrine they and adorn the picture in one of the window stand a superbly-carved gilt table oblong and with curiously-twisted leg which bent inward and meet a small central shelf half-way between the top and the floor then spread out again into four strange claw-like vase which bear each two golden lily stand upright on this stand the most singular piece of wood-carving i ever see it be of very light wood almost yellow in tint it look like rough vine trellis with vine clamber over they its base be surround by a thick bed of purple anemone the smaller shelf below be also fill with purple anemone and each of the golden lily hold all the purple anemone it could -- not a shade of any other color but the purple and gold -- and rise above they the odd vine trellis in the pale yellow wood as i stand look at this in mute wonder and delight but sorely perplexed to make out the design of the carve i hear a step behind I i turn and see not my new friend as i have expect but she husband i think in that first instant i have never see a manlier face and form and i think so to-day robert maynard be not tall he be not handsome but he have a lithe figure square-shouldered straight strong vitalize to the last fiber with the swift current of absolutely healthy blood and the still swifter current of a passionate and pure manhood he eye be blue he hair and full beard of the bright-brown yellow which we call rightly or wrongly saxon he come very quickly toward I with both hand outstretch and begin to speak my dear madam he say but he voice break and with a sudden uncontrollable impulse he turn he back full upon I for a second and pass he right hand over he eye the next instant he recover himself and go on i do not believe you will wonder that i can not speak and i do not believe you will ever wonder that i do not thank you -- i never shall and he raise both my hand to he lip dora be in bed as you bid she to be he continue she be well but very weak she want to see you immediately and she have forbid I to come back to she room without you i think perhaps he add hesitatingly she be not quite calm enough to talk long forgive I for say it i know you love she already indeed i do reply i as if i have know she all my life i will not stay long and i follow he through a small dining-room also gay with flower and vine to a little room which have one side almost wholly of glass and open on a _ loggia _ full of orange-tree and oleander geranium and rose i will not describe dora maynard 's bed-room it be the dainty room of a dainty woman but spiritualize and individualize and make wonderful just as she sitting-room be by a creative touch and a magnetic presence such as few woman possess i believe that she could not be for twenty-four hour in the barrenest and ugliest room possible without contrive to diffuse a certain enchantment through all its emptiness she look far more beautiful this morning than she have look the day before i never forget the picture of she face as i see it then lie on the white pillow and turn toward the door with the eager expression which she waiting for I have give it neither of we speak for some seconds and when we do speak we take refuge in commonplace we heart be too full -- mine with a sudden and hardly explicable overflow of affection toward this beautiful be whom i have save from die hers with a like affection for I heighten a thousand fold by the intense love of love and of live that fill she whole soul and make she gratitude to I partake almost of the nature of adoration i think it be year before she could see I without recall the whole scene so vividly that tear would fill she eye often she would suddenly seize both my hand in hers kiss they and say oh but for these dear strong brave little hand where should i be and whenever we part for a length of time she be overshadow by presentiment i know it be superstitious and silly she would say but i can not shake off the feeling that i be safer in the same town with you i believe if any harm be to threaten I you would be near but the story i be to tell now be not the story of dora maynard 's life after i know she nor of we friendship and love for each other rare and beautiful as they be it be the story of she girlhood and of the strange wood-carving which stand on the gilded table in the bed of purple anemone one morning in April as i climb the long stone stair which lead to she apartment i meet anita the flower-woman who carry flower to she every day anita look troubled what be the matter my anita say i be the signora ill ah no thank the bless virgin say anita the dearest most beautiful of signoras be well but i be oblige to tell she to-day that there be no more anemones biagio go yesterday to the farthest corner of the villa dorium to a dark shady spot beyond the dove-cote which the stranger know not hope to find some but the heavy rain have beat they all down -- there be no longer one left and the signora have tear in she eye when i tell she and she do not care for all the other beautiful flower she say none of they could go on the gold table never yet have the signora put any flower on the gold table except the purple anemone and real tear stand in old anita 's eye why anita say i i be sure some other flower would look very pretty there i do not believe the signora will be unhappy about it anita shake she head and half smile with a look of pity compassion but signora you do not know that dearest and most beautiful of signoras have vision from the angel about she flower holy virgin if she would but come and hang flower around the bambino in we church none of the holy sister can so weave they as she do she make festa forever in the house for the signor and i think signora cross herself and look sharply at I perhaps the gold table be the shrine of she religion : do the signora know i could not help laugh oh no anita i say we do not have shrine in we religion anita 's face cloud iddio mio she say but the virgin will keep the dearest signora maynardus biagio and i have vow to keep a candle always burn for she in ara coeli the dearest most beautiful of signora and anita walk disconsolately on down the stair i find dora kneel before the gold table arrange great mass of maiden-hair fern around the wood carve and in the shelf below as i see the rapt and ecstatic expression of she face i understand why anita have believe the gold table to be a shrine they do not suit it like the anemone say she sadly and i can have no more anemone this year so poor anita tell I just now on the stair reply i she be almost cry she be so sorry she could not get they for you but i be sure dear the fern be beautiful on it i think the pale green look even better than the purple with the gold and the pale yellow wood i like the purple best say dora besides we always have purple at home and she eye fill with tear then turn suddenly to I she say why have you never ask I what this be i know you must have wonder : it look so strange -- this poor little clumsy bit of american pine on my gilt table shrine with flower yes i have wonder i acknowledge for i could not make out the design i reply but i think it might have some story connect with it which you would tell I if you wish i should know i do not think it clumsy i think it be fantastic and have a certain sort of weird life-likeness about it do you really think it have any life-like look about it and dora 's face flush with pleasure i think so but i suppose nobody else could see anything in it no one of my acquaintance have ever allude to it continue she half laughing half cry but i see they try to scrutinize it slyly when they be not observe as for poor old anita i believe she think it be we fetish she walk round it on tiptoe with she hand clasp on she apron but now she continue i will show you the same design in something else and she lead the way through she own bedroom to robert 's which be beyond on the threshold she pause and kiss I say : if you can stay with I to-day i will tell you the whole story dear but i want you to look at this chintz first then she walk to the window and draw out one of the curtain to its full width hold it up for I to see it be a green and white chintz evidently of cheap quality at first i do not distinguish any meaning in the pattern presently i see that the figure be all of vine and vine-leaf link in a fantastic fashion together like those in the wood-carving on the gold table oh yes i say i see it be exactly like the carve only it look different be on a flat surface dora do not speak she be gaze absently at the chintz she hold in she hand she face look as if she soul be mile and year away presently i see a tear roll down she cheek i touch she hand she start and smile sweetly say : oh forgive I do not think i be cry for any sorrow it be for joy i be so happy and my life have be so wonderful now would you really have patience to listen to a long story she say beseechingly a long story all about I -- and -- robert i have be want to tell you ever since i know you i think you ought to know all about we for my answer i sink into a large chair draw she down into my lap and say : begin you dearest child nothing could give I such pleasure begin at the begin she slip from my lap to a low footstool at my foot and rest both she arm on my knee in a graceful way she have look up into my face and begin by a sentence which make I start i use to work in a factory my start be so undisguised so uncontrollable that dora draw back and she cheek turn red perhaps i ought to have tell you before oh my dear beautiful marvellous child i exclaimed you can not so misjudge I i be startle only because you have always seem to I so much like one bear to all possible luxury i suppose you have be nurture on beauty so i have be she reply earnestly smile through tear nevertheless three year ago i be work in a factory in america i do not interrupt she again hour after hour pass by not until twilight be deepen into dusk do the story come to end i shall try to give it in dora 's own word -- they simplicity add so much to it but i can not give the heightened effect with which they fall upon my ear as i look down into she sweet child-woman 's face i do not remember much about mamma it be strange too that i do not because i be thirteen when she die but i always love papa best and stay all the time i could in he study mamma be very pretty the prettiest woman i ever see but i do not know how it be all she prettiness do not seem to make papa care about she he be a clergyman -- a episcopal clergyman -- and he father and he father 's father have be too so you see for three whole generation it have be all book and study in the family but mamma 's father be a farmer and mamma be stronger than papa she like to live in the country and be out of door which he hate i think i know now just how it all be but it use to puzzle I till i grow up when i be sixteen my aunt abby papa 's sister tell I that mamma be say to be the most beautiful girl in the whole state and that papa fall so in love with she when he be just out of college that he come very near die because he father do not wish they to be marry poor papa it be just so always with he he have such a poor feeble body that any trouble or worry make he ill i can see now that it be because he and all he family have be such scholar and live in the house and sit still all they life they body be not good for anything : and i be thankful enough that my body be like mamma 's but i do not know what good it would do I either if dear papa have not teach I all he way of see thing and feel thing mamma never seem to care much about anything except when dick or abby be sick and she always use to go to sleep in church while papa be say the most beautiful thing sometimes it use to make I almost hate she i hate everybody that do not listen to he but aunt abby say once that very few people could understand he and that be the reason we never stay long in one place people get tire of hear he preach this make I so angry i do not speak to aunt abby for two year except when i be oblige to but i see now that she be right as i read over papa 's sermon i see that they would seem very strange to common man and woman he see much more in every little thing than people generally do i use to tell he sometimes he ` see double ' and he would sigh and say that the world be blind and do not see half he never could take any minute by itself there be the past to cripple it and the future to shadow it poor poor papa i really think i have learn in a very strange way to understand he capacity for sadness i understand it by my own capacity for joy i often smile to think how i use to accuse he of see double for it be the very thing which robert say to I again and again when a sight or a sound give I such intense pleasure that i can hardly bear it and i see that while i have nearly the same sensitiveness to all impression from thing or from people which he have my body compel the impression to be joyous this be what i owe mamma if papa could have be well and strong he would have sing joy such as no poet have ever sing since sun begin to shine but most that he write be sad and i be afraid most that he teach the people be sad too or at any rate not hopeful as it ought to be in this beautiful bless world which ` god so love ' and love so perhaps it be better for people that papa never preach in any one parish more than three or four year probably god take care to send next a man who would make everybody take courage again however it be very hard for mamma and very hard for we although for we there be excitement and fun in get into new house and get acquaint with new people but the worst thing be that we have very little money and it use it up so to move from place to place and buy new thing i know all about this before i be ten year old as well as if i have be forty and by the time i be twelve i be a perfect little miser of both clothes and money -- i have such a horror of the terrible day which sometimes come when we sorely want both early in the spring after i be thirteen -- my birthday be in December -- we go to live in a little place call maynard 's mill it be a suburban village near the largest manufacturing town in the state the other two home which i could remember have be very small country village where none of the people be rich and only a few attend the episcopal church in maynard 's mill there be many rich people and almost everybody go to we church the whole place be own by mr maynard robert 's father he have go out there to live near he mill and the place be so beautiful that family after family of the rich mill-owner have move out there at first they use to go into town to church but it be a long drive cold in winter and hot in summer and so mr maynard build a beautiful chapel near he house and send for papa to come and preach in it mr maynard have be he classmate in college and love he very much just because they be ` so different ' papa say and i think it must have be so for mr maynard be the merriest man i ever see he laugh as soon as he see you whether there be anything to laugh at or not and he make you feel just like laugh yourself simply by ask you how you do i never see papa so happy as he be the day mr maynard 's letter come ask he to go there it be a very kind letter and the salary of which mr maynard speak almost apologetically say that it would be increase in a few year as the village grow be more than twice as large as papa have ever receive and there be a nice parsonage besides we move in April i always associate we move with blue hepatica for i carry a great basketful of they which i have take up root and all in the wood the morning we set out and what should i find under papa 's study window but a great thicket of wild fern and cornel bush grow -- just the place for my hepatica and i set they out before i go into the house the house be very small but it be so pretty that papa and i be perfectly happy in it poor mamma do not like the closet and the kitchen the house we have leave be a huge old-fashioned house with four square room on a floor one of these be the kitchen and mamma miss it very much but she live only a few day after we move in i never know of what disease she die she be ill but a few hour and suffer great pain they say she have injure herself in some way in lift the furniture it be all so sudden and so terrible and we be surround by such confusion and so many strange face that i do not remember anything about it distinctly i remember the funeral and the great mass of white and purple flower all over the table on which the coffin stand and i remember how strangely papa 's face look and then aunt abby come to live with we and we settle down into such a new different life that it seem to I as if it have be in some other world that i have know mamma my sister abby be two year old and my darling brother nat be ten when mamma die it be very hard to talk about dear nat i love he so he be so precious and he sorrow be so sacred that i be hardly willing to let stranger pity he ever so tenderly when he be a baby he spring out of mamma 's lap one day as she be reach up to take something from the mantel piece he fall on the andiron-head and injure he spine so that he could never walk he be twenty year old now he head and chest and arm be about as large as those of a boy of sixteen but all the rest of he poor body be shrunken and wither he have never stand upright and he can not turn himself in he chair or bed but he head and face be beautiful it be not only i who think so artist have see he sit at the window or be draw about in he little wagon and have beg permission to paint he face for the face of a saint or of a hero in they picture it be the face of both saint and hero and after all that must be always so i think for how could a man be one without be the other i know some very brave man have be very bad man but i do not call they hero nat be the only hero i ever know if i be a poet i would write a poem about he it should be call ` the crownless king ' oh how he _ do _ reign over suffering and loss and humiliation and what a sweet kingdom spread out around he wherever he be he do everybody good and everybody love he poor papa use to say sometimes ` my son be a far better preacher than i see i sit at he foot to learn ' and it be true even when he be a little fellow nat use to keep up papa 's courage many a time when papa look dark and sad nat would call to he ` dear papa will you carry I up and down a little while by the window i want the sky ' then while they be walk nat would say such sweet thing about the beauty of the sky and the delight it give he to see it that the tear would come into papa 's eye and he would say ` who would think that we could ever forget for a moment this sky which be above we ' and he would go away to he study comfort as i say when mamma die nat be ten and i be thirteen from that time i take all the care of he aunt abby be not strong and she do not love child she be just and she mean to be always kind to we but that sort of kindness be quite different from loving-kindness poor nat never could bear to have she do anything for he and so it very soon come about that i take all the care of he it be not hard for he be never ill he suffer constant pain but in spite of it he be always cheerful always say he feel well and never have any of the small ailment and disease which healthy child be apt to have ' i should not know what to do without the ache dot ' he say to I one day when he be only twelve year old ` i have get so use to it i should miss it as much as i should miss you say it help I to be good i do not think i should dare have it go away ' a few year later he write some lovely little verse call ` the angel of pain ' which i will show you we life after mamma die be very happy and peaceful it make I grieve for she even now to think how little she be miss we have all love she she be always pleasant and good and take the best possible care of we and of everything but she be not one of those person whose presence make itself necessary to people it seem hardly right to say such a thing but i really think papa seem more cheerful without she after the first i think that while she live he be always grope and reach after something in she which do not exist the hourly sight of she remind he hourly of he ideal of what a wife might be and he be forever hope that she might come a little nearer to it -- enter a little more into he world of thought and feeling this be how it have look to I since i have be marry and can understand just how terrible it must be to have the person whom you love best disappoint you in any way nat be in all my class in school although he be three year younger he be much cleverer than i and have have nothing to do poor dear all he life but lie in he chair and read i use to draw he to and from school in a little wagon the boy lift it up and down the step so carefully it do not jar he and papa have a special desk build for he so high that part of the wagon could roll under it and the lid could rest just wherever nat need it for write or study when we go home there be always a sort of procession with we a good many of the child have to go in the same direction but many go simply to walk by nat 's wagon and talk with he whenever there be a picnic or a nutting frolic we always take he the boy take turn in draw he nobody would hear a word of he stay at home he use to sit in he wagon and look on while the rest play and sometimes he would be leave all alone for a while but he face be always the happiest one there at school the boy use to tell he everything and leave thing to he decision almost every day somebody would call out at recess or intermission ` well i 'll leave it to nat ' -- or ` i 'll tell nat ' one day somebody shout ` take it before the king -- let 's call he king nat ' but it almost make nat cry he exclaim ` oh boy please do not ever say that again ' and they never do he have a great deal more influence over they than any teacher he could make they do anything sometimes the teacher themselves use to come to he privately and tell he of thing they do not like which the boy be get into the way of do and ask he to try to stop they if nat have not be a saint as i say before all this would have spoil he but he never think of its be any special power in he he use to think it be only because the boy be so kind-hearted that they could not bear to refuse any request which a poor cripple make when i think how happy those day be and how fast the darkest day of we life be draw near it make I shrink from happiness almost as much as from grief it seem only grief 's forerunner on the evening of my sixteenth birthday we be all have a very merry time in papa 's study pop corn over the open fire we have wheel nat near the fire and tie the corn-popper on a broom-handle so that he could shake the popper himself and i never see he laugh so heartily at anything papa laugh too quite loud which be a thing that do not happen many time a year it be the last time we hear the full sound of dear papa 's voice late that night he be call out to see a poor man one of the factory operative who be die it be a terrible snow-storm and papa have be so heated over the fire and in play with we that he take a severe cold the next morning he could not speak aloud the doctor say it be a acute bronchitis and would pass off but it do not and in a very few week it be clear that he be die of consumption probably the cold only develop a disease which have be long there i can not tell you about the last month of papa 's life i think i shall never be able to speak of they we see much worse day afterward but none that seem to I so hard to bear even when i think nat and i would have to go to the almshouse it be not so hard the love which most child divide between father and mother i concentrate on my father i love he with a adoration akin to that which a woman feel for she husband and with the utmost of filial love add nat love he almost as much the most touching thing i ever saw be to see nat from he wagon or wheel chair reach out to take care of papa in the bed nobody else could give he he medicine so well nobody could prepare he meal for he after he be too weak to use a knife and fork so well as nat how he could do all this with only one hand -- for he could not bend himself in he chair enough to use the hand farthest from the bed -- nobody could understand but he do and the very last mouthful of wine papa swallow he take the morning he die from poor nat 's brave little hand which do not shake nor falter though the tear be roll down he cheek papa live nearly a year but the last nine month he be in bed and he never speak a loud word after that birthday night when we have be so happy in the study he die in November on a dreary stormy day i never shall forget it he have seem easier that morning and insist on we all go out to breakfast together and leave he alone the door be open between the study and the dining-room we have hardly seat ourselves at the table when he bell ring aunt abby reach he first it could not have be a minute but he do not know she for the first and only time in my life i forget nat and be out of the room when i hear he sob dear nat not even then would he think of himself i turn back ` oh do not stop to take I dot ' he say ` run ' but i could not and when i reach the door push he chair before I all be over however the doctor say that even if we have be there at the first papa could not have bid we good-by that the death be from instantaneous suffocation and that he probably have no consciousness of it himself papa 's life have be insure for five thousand dollar and he have save during the three year we have live at maynard 's mill about one thousand more this be all the money we have in the world mr maynard have be very kind throughout papa 's illness he have persuade the church to continue the salary every day he have send flower and grape and wine and game and everything he could think of that papa could eat and what be kindest of all he have come almost every day to talk with he and cheer he up but he do not mean to let he kindness stop here the day after the funeral he come to see we to propose to adopt I i forget to say that aunt abby be to be marry soon and would take little abby with she so they be provide for and the only question be about nat and I fortunately dear nat be in the dining-room and do not see mr maynard when he come i have tell you what a merry man mr maynard be and how kind he be but he be also a very obstinate and high-tempered man he have never love nat i do not know why i think he be the only human being who ever fail to love he he pity he of course but he be so repel by he deformity that he could not love he as soon as mr maynard say ` now my dear child you must come to my house and make it you home always ' i see that he intend to separate I from nat i reply ' i can not leave nat mr maynard i thank you very much you be very good but it would break my heart to leave he and i be sure papa would never forgive I if i should do it ' he make a gesture of impatience he have foresee this and come prepared for it but he see that i promise to prove even more impracticable than he have fear ` you have sacrifice you whole life already to that miserable unfortunate boy ' he say ` and i always tell you father he ought not to permit it ' at this i grow angry and i reply : -- ` mr maynard nat do more for we all every hour of he life than we ever could do for he : dear papa use to say so too ' no doubt papa have say this very thing to mr maynard often for tear come into he eye and he go on : -- ' i know i know -- he be a wonderful boy and we might all learn a lesson of patience from he but i can not have the whole of you life sacrifice to he i will provide for he amply he shall have every comfort which money can command ' ` but where ' say i ` in a institution i know of under the charge of a friend of mine ' ' a hospital ' exclaimed i and the very think of my poor nat who have be the center of a loving home-circle of a merry school playground ever since he could remember -- the very think of he finding himself alone among diseased people and tend by hire attendant so overcome I that i burst into flood of tear mr maynard who hate the presence of tear and suffer as mirthful people always do rise at once and say kindly ` poor child you be not strong enough to talk it over yet but as you aunt must go away so soon i think it better to have it all settle at once ' ` it be settle mr maynard ' say i in a voice that half frighten I ' i shall never leave nat -- never so long as i live ' ` then you 'll do he the greatest unkindness you can -- that be all ' reply mr maynard angrily and walk out of the room i lock myself up in my own room and think the whole matter over how i could earn my own living and nat 's i do not know we should have about four hundred dollar a year i have learn enough in my childhood of poverty to know that we need not starve while we have that but simply not starve be a great way off from really live and i feel convinced that it would be impossible for I to keep up courage or hope unless i could contrive in some way to earn money enough to surround we home with at least a semblance of the old atmosphere we must have book we must have a flower sometimes we must have sun and air at last a inspiration come to I down stair in the saddened empty study sit little miss penstock the village dressmaker sew on we gloomy black dress she live all alone in a very small house near mr maynard 's mill i remember that i have hear she say how lonely she find it live by herself since she married sister who use to live with she have go to the west since then miss penstock have sometimes consent to go for a few day at a time to sew in the house of she favorite employer just to keep from forget how to speak ' the poor little woman say but she dislike very much to do this she be a gentlewoman and though she accept with simple dignity the necessity of earn she bread it be bitterly disagreeable to she to sit as a hire sewer in other people 's house she like to come to we house better than to any other we also be poor my aunt abby be a woman of great simplicity and a quiet stately humility like miss penstock 's own and they enjoy sit side by side whole day sew in silence miss penstock have always speak with a certain sort of tender reverence to nat and i remember that he like to be in the room where she sew all these thought pass through my mind in a moment i spring to my foot and exclaim ` that be it -- that be it ' and i run hastily down to the study miss penstock be alone there she look up in surprise at my breathlessness and my red eye i knelt down by she side and take the work out of she hand ` dear miss penstock ' say i ` would you rent part of you house ' she look up reflectively take off she spectacles with she left hand and tap she knee slowly with they as she always do when puzzling over a scanty pattern ' i do not know dora but i might i have think of it it be awful lonely for I as ` tis but it be such a risk take in stranger be it any friend of yours you be think of ' ` nat and I ' say i concisely miss penstock 's spectacles drop from she finger and she utter a ejaculation i never hear from she lip on any other occasion ` good heaven ' ` yes ' say i begin to cry ` nat and I i have get to take care of nat and if you would only let we live with you i think i could manage beautifully ' then i tell she the whole story of mr maynard 's proposal while we be talk aunt abby come in the problem be no new one to she papa and she have talk it over many a time in the course of the past sad year it seem that he have have to the last a strong hope that mr maynard would provide for we both poor papa as he draw near the next world all the conventionality and obligation of this seem so small to he he do not shrink from the thought of dependence upon other as he would have do in health ` but i always tell he ' say aunt abby ` that mr maynard be not go to do anything for nat beyond what money would do he would give he a thousand a year or two if need be but he would never set eye on he if he could help it ' ` aunt abby ' exclaim i ` please do not say another word about mr maynard 's help nat i would die before nat should touch a cent of he money ' ` there be no use talk that way ' say aunt abby whose tenderest mercy be often cruelly word ` mr maynard 's a good generous man and i be sure he be be the saving of we all but that be no reason he should set up to take you away from nat now and i know well enough nat can not live without you but i do not see how it be to be manage and aunt abby sigh then i tell she my plan they grow clearer and clearer to I as i unfold they the two gentle-faced spinster woman look at I with surprise miss penstock wipe she eye over and over ` if i could only be sure i be not go against you best interest to let you come ' say she ` oh miss penstock ' exclaim i ` do not think so -- do not dare to say no for that reason for i tell you i shall go away to some other town with nat if you do not take we there be no other house here that would do think how much better it would be for nat to stay among friend ' ` it be lucky i be they guardian ' say aunt abby with a unconscious defiance in she tone ` there can not anybody hinder they do anything i be willing to have they do my brother want to have mr maynard too but i tell he no i would either be whole guardian or none ' ' i think good aunt abby have have a dim foreboding that mr maynard 's kindness might take a shape which it would be hard to submit to great as she gratitude be she family pride resent dictation and resent also the imply slight to poor nat as i look back now i can see that except for this reaction of feeling she never would have consent so easily to my undertake all i undertake in go to housekeeping alone with that helpless child on four hundred dollar a year before night it be all settle and miss penstock go home two hour before she time ` so stir up somehow ' as she say ` to think of those bless child 's come to live in my house i could not see to thread a needle ' after tea mr maynard come again : aunt abby see he alone when she come up-stair she have be cry but she lip be close more rigidly than i ever see they aunt abby could be as determine as mr maynard all she say to I of the interview be ' i do not know now as he 'll really give in that he can not have thing as he want to for all he laughing and for all he goodness i do not believe he be any too comfortable to live with i should not wonder if he never speak to one of we again ' but mr maynard be too well-bred a man for any such pettiness as that he resentment show itself merely in a greater courtesy than ever combine with a careful absence of all inquiry as to we plan it hurt I very much for i know how it would have hurt dear papa but i know too that i be right and mr maynard be wrong and that comfort I four week from the day papa be bury the pretty parsonage be lock up cold dark empty aunt abby have go with little abby to she new home and nat and i be settle at miss penstock 's the night before we move mr maynard leave a note at the door for I it contain five hundred dollar and these word : -- ` miss dora will not refuse to accept this from one who hope to be she father ' but i could not take it i send it back to he with a note like this : -- ` dear mr maynard : -- i shall never forget that you be willing to be my father and i shall always be grateful to you but i can not take money from one who be displeased with I for do what i think right i promise you however for papa 's sake and for nat 's that if i ever need help i will ask it of you and not of any one else ' \* \* \* \* \* the next time i see mr maynard he put both he hand on my shoulder and say : ` you be a brave girl i wish i could forgive you but remember you promise ' and that be the last word mr maynard speak to I for three year we new home be so much pleasanter than we suppose it could be that at first in spite of we grief both nat and i be almost gay it be like a sort of picnic or play at housekeeping the room be sunny and cozy rich people in splendid house do not dream how pleasant poor people 's little room can be if the sun shine in and there be a few pretty thing we keep all the book which could ever be of use to nat and a picture of the sistine madonna which mr maynard have give we on the last christmas day and papa 's and mamma 's portrait the book and these make we little sitting-room look like home we have only two room on the first floor one of these be a tiny one but it hold we little cooking-stove and a cupboard with we few dish the other we call ` sitting-room ' it have to be dear nat 's bedroom also because he could not be carry up and down stair but i make a chintz curtain which shut off he bed from sight and really make the room look prettier for i put it across a corner and have a shelf put up above it on which nat 's stuff owl sit my room be over nat 's and a cord go up from he bed to a bell over mine so that he could call I at any moment if he want anything in the night then we have one more little chamber in which we keep the box of papa 's sermon and some trunk of old clothes and thing which nobody want to buy at the auction and papa 's big chair and writing-table we would not sell those i think perhaps some day we should have a house of we own -- i could not imagine how but if we do we should be glad of that chair and table and so aunt abby let we keep they though they be of handsome wood beautifully carve and would have bring a good deal of money for these four room we pay miss penstock three dollar a month the rent would have be a dollar a week but she say it be really worth a dollar a month to she to have people who would not trouble she nor hurt the house and as aunt abby think so too i believe she my plan be to have nat keep on at school and to take in sew myself or to work for miss penstock for the first year all go so smoothly that i be content i use to draw nat to and from school twice a day and that give I air and exercise everybody be very kind in give I sew and i earn four and five dollar a week we do not have to buy any clothes and so we lay up a little money but the next year people do not give I so much sew they have give it to I the first year because they be sorry for we but now they have forget very often i would sit idle a whole week with no work then i use to read and study but i could not enjoy anything because i be so worried i feel that trouble be come early in the fall dear nat be take ill -- the first illness of he life it be a slow fever he be ill for three month i often wonder how i live through those month when he recover he seem better than ever the doctor say he have pass a sort of crisis and would always be stronger for it the doctor be very kind several night he sit up with nat and make I go to bed and he would not let I pay he a cent though he come every day for week when i urge he to let we pay the bill he grow half angry and say ` do you think i be go to take money from you father 's daughter ' and then i feel more willing to take it for papa 's sake but the medicine have cost a great deal and i have not earn anything and so at the end of the second year we have be oblige to take quite a sum out of we little capital i do not tell nat and i do not go to mr maynard i go on from day to day in a sort of stupor wonder what would happen next i be seventeen year old but i know of nothing i could do except to sew i do not know enough to teach all this time i never once think of the mill i use to watch the man and woman go in and out and envy they think how sure they be of they wages and yet it never cross my mind that i could do the same thing i be afraid it be unconscious pride which prevent my thinking of it but the day come it be in the early spring i have be to the grave-yard to set out some fresh hepatica on papa 's grave he grave and mamma 's be in a inclosure surround by a high thick hedge of pine and cedar close to the public street as i knelt down hide behind the tree i hear step and voice they pause opposite I the person be evidently look over the fence then i distinguish the voice of we kind doctor ` poor kent ' he say ` how it would distress he to see he child now that nat barely pull through he fever but he seem to have take a new turn since then and be stronger than ever but i be afraid they be very poor ' to my astonishment the voice that reply be mr maynard 's ` of course they be ' say he impatiently ` but nobody will ever have a chance to help they till the last cent 's go that dora would work she finger off in the mill rather than ask or receive help ' ` but good heaven maynard you would never stand by and see tom kent 's daughter in the mill ' exclaim the doctor i could not hear the reply for they be walk away but the word ` in the mill ' ring in my ear a new world seem opening before I i have no particle of false pride all i want be to earn money honestly i could not understand why i have never think of this way i know that many of the factory operative who be industrious and economical support large family of child on they wages ` it would be strange enough if i could not support nat and myself ' think i and i almost run home i be so glad i say nothing to nat i know instinctively that it would grieve he the next day after i leave he at school i go to the largest mill and see the overseer he be a coarse disagreeable man but he have know my father and he treat I respectfully he say they could not give I very good wages at first but if i learn readily and be skillful in tend the loom i might in time make a very good live the sum that he name seem large try by my humble standard even at the beginning i should earn more than i have be able to for many month at my needle after tea i tell nat he lay very still for some moment the tear roll down he cheek then he reach up both hand and draw my face down to he and say ` dear sister it would be selfish to make it any harder for you than it must be at best but oh dot dot do you think you can dream what it be for I to have to lie here and be such a burden on you ' ` oh nat ' i say ` if you do not want to break my heart do not speak so i do not have to earn any more for two than i should have to alone it do not cost anything for you and if it do you darling do not you know that i could not live without you you be all i have get in the world ' nat do not reply but all that evening he face look as i never see it before nat be fifteen instinct be begin to torture he with a man 's sense of he helplessness and it be almost more than even he childlike faith and trust could bear the next day i tell miss penstock she have be as kind to we as a mother through this whole year and a half and i really think we have take the place of child in she lonely old heart but she never could forget that we be she minister 's child she always call I miss dora and do to this day she do not interrupt I while i tell she my plan but the color mount higher and higher in she face as soon as i stop speak she exclaim : -- ` dora kent be you mad -- a girl with a face like yours to go into the mill you do not know what you be about ' ` yes i do dear pennie ' i say -lrb- nat have call she pennie ever since he sickness when she have take tender care of he night and day -rrb- ' i know there be many rude bad man there but i do not believe they will trouble I at any rate i can but try i must earn more money pennie you know that as well as i do ' she do indeed know it but it be very hard for she to give approbation to this scheme it be not until after a long argument that i induce she to promise not to write to aunt abby till i have try the experiment for one month the next day i go to the mill everything prove much better than i have fear some of the woman in the room in which i be place have belong to papa 's sunday-school and they be all very kind to I and tell the other who i be so from the outset i feel myself among friend in two week i have grow use to the work the noise of the loom do not frighten or confuse I and it do not tire I to stand so many hour i find that i should soon be able to do most of my work mechanically and think about what i please in the mean time so i hope to be able to study at home and recite my lesson to myself in the mill the only thing that trouble I be that i could not take nat to and from school and he have to be leave alone sometimes but i find a very pleasant and faithful irish boy who be glad to earn a little money by draw he back and forth often stay with he after school till i come home at six o'clock this boy be the son of the irish gardener on the overseer 's place the overseer be a englishman he name be wilkin he be the only human be i ever dislike so that it be hard to speak to he he brother too the agent who have charge of all mr maynard 's business be almost as disagreeable as he they both look like bloated frog they wide shapeless mouth flat nose and prominent eye make I shudder when i look at they little patrick soon grow fond of nat as everybody do who come into close contact with he and he use often to stay at we house till late at night hearing nat 's story and watch he draw picture on the blackboard one of the thing i have keep be a great blackboard which papa have make for he it be mount on a stout standard so that it could be swing close in front of he chair or wagon and he would lie there and draw for hour together some of the picture he draw be so beautiful i could not bear to have they rub out it seem almost like kill thing that be alive whenever i dare to spend a penny for anything not absolutely needful i always buy a sheet of drawing-paper or a crayon for nat would rather have they than anything else in the world -- even than a book -- unless the book have picture one night when i go home i find he sit up very straight in he wagon with he cheek crimson with excitement patrick be with he and the table and the whole floor be cover with queer long jointed paste-board sheet with piece of gay-colored calico paste on they patrick look as excite as nat and as soon as i open the door he exclaim ` och miss dora see how he be plaze with um ' i be almost frighten at nat 's face ` why nat dear ' say i ` what be they i do not think they be very pretty ' and i pick up one of the queer thing and look at it ` the color be bright and pretty but i be sure almost all the pattern be hideous ' ` of course they be ' shout nat hysterically ` that be just it that be what please I so ' and he burst out cry i be more frightened still trample the calico under my foot i run and kneel by he chair and put my arm around he ` oh nat nat what be the matter ' cry i ` patrick what have you do to he ' poor patrick could not speak he be utterly bewildered he begin hastily pick up the print and shuffling they out of sight ` do not you touch one ' scream nat lift up he head again with tear roll down he cheek ` dot dot ' he go on speak louder and louder ` do not you see those be pattern patrick say mr wilkin buy they i can earn money too i can draw a million time prettier one than those ' like lightning the thing flash through my brain of course he could he draw better one every day of he life by dozen on the old blackboard with crumble bit of chalk again and again i have rack my brain to devise some method by which he might be teach as artist be teach and learn to put he beautiful conception into true shape for the world to see but i know that material and instruction be both alike out of we reach and i have hope earnestly that such longing have never enter he heart i sit down and cover my face with my hand ` you see sister ' say nat in a calmer tone sober himself by my excitement -- ` you see do not you ' ` yes dear i do see ' say i ` you will earn much more money than i ever can and take care of I after all ' to we inexperience it seem as if a mine have open at we foot poor patrick stand still unhappy and bewildered twist one of the pattern-book in he hand ` a ' be it these same that misther nat 'll be afther tryin ' to make ' say he ` oh no patrick ' say nat laughing ` only the picture from which these be to be make ' then we question patrick more closely all he know be that mr wilkin ' sister make many of the drawing patrick have see they lie in pile on mr wilkin ' desk some of they color some of they merely in ink the piece of paper be about the size of these pattern some six or eight inch square ` will i ask miss wilkin to come and show yee ' say patrick ` no no ' say we both hastily ` you must not tell anybody of course she would not want other people to be draw they too ' ` especially if she can not make anything better than these ' say nat pityingly already he tone have so change that i hardly recognize it in that moment the artist-soul of my darling brother have feel its first breath of the sweetness of creative power patrick promise not to speak of it to a human be as he be go out of the door he turn back with a radiant face and say : ` a 'twas meself that only think maybe the caliker would amuse he for a minnit with they quare color ' and he almost somerset off the door-steps utter a irish howl of delight ` you have make we fortune there 'll always be calico want and i can draw fifty pattern a day and i 'll give you half of the first pay i get for they ' call the excited nat but patrick be off we sit up till midnight i be scarcely less overwrought than nat he draw design after design and reject they as not quite perfect ` you know ' he say ' i must send something so very good to begin with that they can not help see at first sight how good it be ' ` but not so good that you can not ever make another equal to it ' suggest i out of my practical but inartistic brain ` no danger of that dot ' say nat confidently ` dot there be not anything in this world i can not make a picture of if i can have paper enough and pencil and paint ' at last he finish three design which he be willing to send they be all for spring or summer dress one be a curious block pattern the block of irregular shape but all fitting into each other and all to be of the gayest color here and there come a white block with one tiny scarlet dot upon it ` that be for a black-haired girl dot ' say nat ` you could not wear it ' the second be a group of fern tie by a little wreath of pansy nothing could be more beautiful the third be a fantastic mixture of pine-tassel and acorn i think it quite ugly but nat insist on it that it would be pretty for a summer muslin and so it be the next year when it be worn by everybody the little plumy pine-tassel of a bright green -lrb- which do not wash at all -rrb- and the acorn all tumble about on you lap all side up at once it be one o'clock before we go to bed and we might as well have sit up all night for we do not sleep the next morning i get up before light and walk into town to a shop where they sell paint i have just time to buy a box of water-color and get back to the mill before the bell stop ring all the forenoon the little white parcel lay on the floor at my foot as often as i look at it i seem to see nat 's picture dance on the surface i have give five dollar for the box i tremble to think what a sum that be for we to spend on a uncertainty but i have small doubt at noon i run home i eat little dinner -- nat would not touch a mouthful ` you must see the pansy and fern do before you go ' he say and before my hour be up they be so nearly do that i dance around nat 's chair with delight ' i know mr wilkin never see anything so pretty in he life ' say nat calmly the thought of mr wilkin be a terrible damper to I nat have not see he : i have ` nat ' say i slowly ` mr wilkin will not know that it be pretty he be not a man he be a frog and he look as if he lie i believe he will cheat we ' nat look shocked ` why dora i never in my life hear you speak so you shall not take they to he i will have patrick take I there ' ` no no dear ' i exclaimed ' i would not have you see mr wilkin for the world he be horrible but i be not afraid of he ' i mean that i would not for the world have he see nat he be coarse and brutal enough to be insulting to a helpless cripple and i know it but nat do not dream of my reason for insist so strongly on go myself and he finally yield i take the picture to the overseer 's office at noon i know that ` agent wilkin ' as he be call to distinguish he from he brother be always there at that time he look up at I as i draw near the desk with a expression which almost paralyze I with disgust but for nat 's sake i keep on i watch he closely as he look at the picture i think i detect a start of surprise but i could not be sure then he lay they down say carelessly ' i be no judge of these thing i will consult some one who be and let you know to-morrow noon if we can pay you brother anything for the design ' ` of course you know that the market be flood with this sort of thing miss kent ' he add as i be walk away i make no reply i be already revolve in my mind a plan for take they to another mill in town whose overseer be a brother of one of papa 's warden the next day at noon i go to the office my heart beat fast but i try to believe that i do not hope both the brother be there the overseer speak first but i feel that the agent watch I sharply ` so you lame brother draw these design do he miss dora ' ` my brother nat draw they sir i have but one brother say i try hard to speak civilly ` well ' say he ` they be really very well do -- quite remarkable consider that they be the work of a child who have have no instruction they would have to be rearrange and alter before we could use they but we would like to encourage he and to help you too ' he continue patronizingly ` and so we shall buy they just as they be ' ` my brother nat be not a child ' reply i ` and we do not wish to be help if the design be not worth money will you be so good as to give they back to I ' and i step nearer the desk and stretch out my hand toward the picture which be lie there but agent wilkin snatch they up quickly and cast a angry glance at he brother exclaim : -- ` oh you quite mistake my brother miss kent the design be worth money and we be glad to buy they but they be not worth so much as they would be if do by a experienced hand we will give you ten dollar for the three ' and he hold out the money to I involuntarily i exclaimed ' i have not dream that they would be worth so much ' nat could earn then in four hour ' work as much as i could in a week in that one moment the whole of life seem throw open for we all my distrust vanish and when the agent add kindly ` be sure and bring we all the design which you brother make i think we shall want to buy as many as he will draw he certainly have rare talent ' -- i could have fall on the floor at he foot to thank he so grateful do i feel for this new source of income for we and still more for the inexpressible pleasure for my poor nat from that day nat be a change boy he would not go to school in the afternoon but spend the hour from two till five in draw i have a cord arrange from we room to miss penstock 's so that he could call she if at any moment he need help and she be only too glad to have he in the house when i reach home at six i always find he lie back in he chair with he work spread out before he and such a look of content and joy on he face that more than once it make I cry instead of speak when i bent over to kiss he ` oh dot -- oh dot ' he use to say sometimes ` it be not all for the sake of the money splendid as that be but i do feel as if i should yet do something much better than make design for calico i feel it grow in I oh if i could only be teach if there be only some one here who could tell I about the thing i do not understand ' ` but you shall be teach dear ' i reply ` we will lay up all the money you earn i can earn enough for we to live on and then with you money in a few year we can certainly contrive some way for you to study ' it seem not too visionary a hope for nat 's design grow prettier and prettier and the agent buy all i carry he one week i remember he pay I thirty dollar and as he hand it to I see how pleased i look he say -- ` you brother be get quite rich be he not miss kent ' something sinister in he smile strike I at that moment as it have not do for a long time and i resolve to go more seldom to the office we do not lay up so much as we hope to we neither of we have a trace of the instinct of economy or save i could not help buy a geranium or fuchsia to set in the window nat could not help ask I to buy a book or a picture sometimes and he paint and pencil and brush and paper cost a good deal in the course of six month still we be very happy and very comfortable and the day fly by we little room be so cozy and pretty that miss penstock 's customer use often to come in to see it and if they happen to come when nat be there they almost always send he something afterward so at the end of two year you never would have know the bare little room we have flower in both window and as each window have sun the flower prosper and we have a great many pretty picture on the wall and nat 's sketch pin up in all sort of odd place a big beam run across the ceiling in the middle and that be hung full of charcoal sketch with here and there a sheet just paint in bar of bright color -- no meaning to they except to ` light up ' nat say i do not understand he then but i could see how differently all the rest look after the scarlet and yellow be put by they side some of we picture have lovely frame to they which nat have carve out of old cigar-box that patrick bring he sometimes he use to do nothing but carve for a week and he would say ` dot i do not believe drawing be the thing i want to do after all i want more i hate to have everything flat ' then he would get discourage and think all he have do be good for nothing ' i never can do anything except to draw till i go somewhere to be teach ' he would say and turn back to the old calico pattern with fresh zeal one day a customer of miss penstock 's bring nat a book about grape which have some picture of the different method of grape-culture in different country one of these picture please he very much it show the grape-vine loop on low tree in swing festoon he have the book prop up open at that picture day after day and keep draw it over and over on the blackboard and on paper till i be tire of the sight of it it do not seem to I remarkably pretty but nat say one day when i tell he so -- ` it be not the picture itself but what i want to make from it do not you see that the tree look a little like dancer whirling round hold each other by the hand -- one-legged dancer ' i could not see it ` well ' say nat ` look at this and see if you can see it any better ' and he draw out of he portfolio a sheet with a rough charcoal sketch of six or seven low gnarled bare tree with they bough inter-locked in such a fantastic manner that the tree seem absolutely reel about in a crazy dance i laugh as soon as i see it ` there ' say nat triumphantly ` now if i can only get the vine to go just as i want they to in and out you see that will dress up the dancer ' he work long over this design the fancy seem to have take possession of he brain he give name to the tree but he call they all man : ` it be a jolly crew of old king ' he say ` that be sesostri at the head and there be herod that old fellow with the gouty stomach under he left arm ' nat be now so full of freak and fun that we little room ring with laughter night after night patrick use to sit on the floor sometimes with he broad irish mouth stiffen into a perpetual grin at the sight of the mirth which though he could not comprehend it he find contagious ` but what will you do with it nat ' say i ` it will never do for a calico pattern ' ' i do not know ' say he reflectively ' i might make it smaller and hide the face and not make the limb of the tree look so much like leg and call it the vine pattern and i guess old wilkin would think it be graceful and i dare say miss wilkin would wear it if nobody else do ' ` oh nat nat how can you ' exclaim i ` when they have be so good to pay we so much money ' ' i know it ' say nat ` it be too bad i be ashamed now but do not this look like the two wilkin brother you say they look like frog ' he run on hold up a most ludicrous picture of two tall lank frog stand behind a counter and stretch out four front leg like greedy hand across the counter with a motto come out of the right-hand frog 's mouth : ` more design if you please mr kent -- something light and graceful for summer wear ' these be the word of a note which mr wilkin have send to nat a few week before i laugh till the tear run down my cheek for really the frog do look like the brother wilkin the picture haunt my mind for week afterward and seem somehow to revive my old distrust of they a few day after this nat have finish a set of design ` for summer wear ' as the order say and among they he have put in the ` one-legged dancer ' ` it 'll do no harm to try it ' say he ' i think it would be lovely print in bright-green on a white ground and nobody but you and I would ever see the king ' leg in it ' it really be pretty still i could not help see leg and head and king herod 's stomach in it and moreover it be entirely too large a figure for that year 's fashion in calico or muslin however i say nothing and carry it with the rest when i go the next day mr wilkin say as he hand I the money -- ` oh by the way miss kent one of the drawing have be mislay i suppose it be of no consequence we could not use it it be quite too large a figure and seem less graceful than you brother 's work usually be it be a picture of grape-vine ' ` oh ' say i ' i tell nat i do not believe that would be good for anything no it be not of the least consequence ' when i repeat this to nat he do not seem surprised at they refusal of the design they have already refuse several other in the course of the year but he seem singularly disturb at the loss of the drawing at last he urge I to go and ask if it have not be find ' i may do something with it yet dot ' he say ' i know it be a good design for something if not for calico and i do not believe they have lose it it be very queer ' but mr wilkin assure I with great civility and many expression of regret that the design be lose : that they have make careful search for it everywhere the thing would have pass out of my mind in a short time but for nat 's pertinacious reference to it every few day he would say ` it be very queer dot about the one-legged dancer how could such a thing be lose they never lose a drawing before i believe miss wilkin have get it and be go to paint a big picture from it herself ' ` why nat ' i exclaimed ` be not you ashamed that would be steal ' ' i do not care dot ' he say again and again ' i never shall believe that paper be lose ' i grow almost out of patience with he i never know he to be unjust to any one and it grieve I that he should be so to people who have be we benefactor about four month later one warm day in April i walk over to the town after my day 's work be do to buy a gown for myself and a new box of paint for nat i do not go to town more than two or three time a year and the shop-window delight I as much as if i have be only eleven year old as i walk slowly up and down look at everything i suddenly start back at the sight of a glossy green and white chintz which be display conspicuously in the central window of one of the largest shop there they be just as nat have draw they on the miss paper ` the one-legged dancer ' nat be right it be a pretty pattern a very pretty pattern for a chintz and there be -- i laugh out in spite of myself as i stand in the crowd on the sidewalk -- yes there be the ugly great knot in one of the tree which have make king herod 's stomach but what do it mean no chintz be make in any of mr maynard 's mill nor so far as i know in any mill in that neighborhood i be hot with indignation plainly nat 's instinct have be a true one the wilkins have steal the design and have sell it to some other manufacturer not dream that the theft could ever be discover by two such helpless child as nat and i i go into the shop and ask the price of the chintz in the window ` oh the grape-vine pattern that be a new pattern just out this spring it be one of the most popular pattern we ever have a lovely thing miss ' say the clerk as he lift down another piece of it ' i will take one yard ' say i with a choke voice i be afraid i should cry in the shop ` do you know where this chintz be make ' i add the clerk glance at the price-ticket and read I the name it be make by a firm i have never hear of in another state no wonder the wilkins think themselves safe when i show nat the chintz he seem much less excited than i expect he be not so very much surprised and to my great astonishment he be not at first sure that it would be best to let the wilkins know that we have discover they cheating but i be firm i would have no more to do with they my impulse be to go to mr maynard although during these three year he have never come to see we i feel sure that in the bottom of he heart there still be a strong affection for we and above all he be a just man he would never keep in he employ for one day any person capable of such wrong as the wilkins have do we ` but ' persist nat ` you do not know that either of the mr wilkins have anything to do with it they may both have honestly suppose it be lose it be much more likely that they sister steal it ' i have not think of this before poor miss wilkin nat 's artistic soul have be so outraged by some of she flagrant calico that he believe she capable of any crime at last i consent to go first to the wilkins themselves and i promise to speak very calmly and gently in the beginning and betray no suspicion of they i carry the chintz when i enter the office the overseer be talk in one corner with a gentleman whose back be turn to I the agent sit by the counter ` mr wilkin ' say i ` do you remember the grape-vine pattern my brother draw last winter -- the one which you refuse ' the instant i speak i see that he do remember i see that he be guilty and i see it all with such certainty that it enable I to be very calm ` let I see ' say he try to pretend to be rack he memory ` the grape-vine pattern it seem to I that i do recall something about a design with that name do you say we refuse it ' ` yes you refuse it but you do not return the draw you say it have be lose ' i reply ` ah yes yes -- now i recollect ' he say recover himself somewhat ` we make great search for the drawing i remember all about it now ' and he pause as if wait civilly to know what more there could possibly be to be say on that point but i watch he closely and see that he be agitate i look he steadily in the eye and do not speak while i slowly open my little bundle and unroll the piece of chintz ` can you possibly explain this mystery then sir that here be my brother 's design print on this chintz ' say i in a clear distinct tone hold out the yard of chintz at its full length as i say the word ` my brother 's design ' the gentleman who have be talk with the overseer turn quickly round and i see that it be mr maynard 's youngest son robert who a year before have come home from germany and have recently be take into the firm as partner he step a little nearer I and be evidently listen to my word ` come into this room mr maynard if you please and we will finish discuss the matter we be speak of ' say overseer wilkin turn pale and speak very hurriedly and try to draw mr maynard into the inner office-room ` and -- if you will call some other time miss kent ' say agent wilkin turn away from I and walk toward mr maynard in he anxiety to prevent my be see or hear ' i will try to attend to this matter but just now i have not another moment to spare ' and he begin at once to talk in a loud and voluble manner i do not know how i have strength and courage to do what i do then i do not know where the voice come from with which i speak then robert have always say that i look like a young lioness and that my voice sound like the voice of one cry ` fire ' i step swiftly up to he and before the astounded wilkin could speak a word i have hold up the chintz and exclaim ` but mr maynard will have time to spare and i thank god he be here mr maynard this design be one of my brother 's drawing he have make most of the calico design print in you father 's mill for a year and a half : i bring this one to the agent he say it be not good for anything but he steal the paper and sell it and here it be ' and then suddenly my strength all disappear great terror seize I and i burst into tear both the agent and the overseer begin to speak at once ` be silent ' thunder robert in the most commanding tone i ever hear out of human lip ` be silent both of you ' then he take the chintz away from I and take both my hand in he lead I to a chair say in a voice as sweet and gentle as the other be terrible ` pray be calm my dear young lady -- this matter shall be look into sit down and do not try to speak for a few minute ' then he walk over to the brother even through my tear i could see how terrify they look they seem strike dumb with fright he speak to they now in the most courteous manner but the courtesy be almost worse than the anger have be before ' i shall have to ask you for the use of the office for a short time gentleman this be a affair i prefer to investigate immediately and i would like to see this young lady alone ' they both begin to speak again but he interrupt they ' i will send for you presently not a word more now if you please ' and in spite of themselves they be oblige to walk out of the room as they turn to shut the door they face frighten I ` oh ' i exclaimed ` oh mr maynard they will kill nat i must go home at once ' and i rise tremble in every nerve he make I sit down again and bring I a glass of wine and say ` do not be afraid my dear child they will not dare harm you brother drink this and tell I you whole story ' then i tell he all he interrupt I only once to ask I about the price pay we for two or three especial pattern which he happen to recollect when i stop he jump up from he chair and walk up and down in front of I ejaculate ` by jove this be infernal -- i never hear of such a contemptible bit of rascality in my life i have tell my father ever since i come home that these man have bad face and i have look carefully for trace of cheating in they account but they be too cowardly to try it on a large scale ' he then tell I that the originality and beauty of the design which the wilkins have furnish the firm of late have attract general attention that they have say the best one be the work of a sister in england the other of the sister living with they when he tell I the price which have be pay for they i could not help groan aloud and bury my face in my hand ` oh my poor nat ' i exclaimed ` you might have have everything you want for that ' ` but he shall have it still miss kent ' say robert -- ' i shall give you a check for the whole amount before you leave this room and i do assure you that you brother have a fortune in he talent for draw probably this work be only the beginning of what he will do ' as robert open the office-door for I to pass out i see the two mr wilkins stand together at the gate through which i must go robert answer my look of alarm by say ' i shall walk home with you miss kent they shall not annoy you ' as we come near they both lift they hat with obsequious angry bow robert do not look at they but say in a low tone as we pass ` go to the office and wait there till i return ' when he bid I good-by at my door he say ' i shall go now to find my father and if he be at home the brother wilkin will be dismiss from we employ in less than one hour ' i look after he as long as i could see he then i go into we little sitting-room sink into a chair and sit motionless turn the check over and over in my hand and wonder if i really be awake and alive or if all be a dream in a few moment nat come home as patrick lift the wagon up over the door-step and nat catch sight of my face he call out ` oh sister what be the matter -- be you ill ' i run to he and put the check into he hand but it be some minute before i could speak the wonderful fortune do not overwhelm nat as it have I he be much stronger than i every stroke of he pencil during the last year have develop and perfect he soul he be fast come to have that consciousness of power which belong to the true artist and make a life self-centred ' i have feel that all this would come dear ' he say ` and more than this too ' he add dreamily ` we shall go on this be only the outer gate of we life ' he prophesy more truly than he know when he say that -- my dear bless artist-souled martyr i need not dwell on the detail of the next half-year a few word can tell they and then again world of word could not tell they three month from the day i carry the piece of chintz into the overseer 's office robert and i be marry in the beautiful chapel where papa use to preach all the mill be shut and the little chapel be crowd with the workman and workwoman when we come out they be all draw up in line on the green and robert and mr maynard both make they little speech nat and miss penstock and patrick be in mr maynard 's carriage and robert and i stand on the ground by the carriage-door after the people have go mr maynard come up to I and put both he hand on my shoulder just as he have do three year before and say ` you be a brave girl but you have to take I for you father after all ' nat 's wedding-present to I be a wood-carving of the ` one-legged dancer ' -- the one which stand on the little gilt table i shall never be separate from it when i first find out how very rich robert be i be afraid it seem to I almost wrong to have so much money but i hope we shall not grow selfish and i can not but be grateful for it when i see what it have do for my darling brother he be live now in a beautiful apartment in new york patrick be with he he devoted servant and miss penstock have go to keep house for they nat be study and work hard the best artist in the city be he friend and he picture be already know and seek when robert first propose this arrangement nat say ` oh no no i can not accept such a weight of obligation from any man not even from a brother ' robert rise and kneel down by nat 's chair and even then he be so far above he he have to bend over ` nat ' say he in a low tone ' i never kneel to any human being before : i do not kneel to dora when i ask she to give herself to I for i be sure i could so give myself to she as to make she happy but it be to you after all that i owe it that she be mine i never can forget it for a hour and i never can repay you -- no not in my whole life-time nor with all my fortune ' then he tell he that the sum which it would need to support he and miss penstock and patrick in this way be so small in comparison with we whole income that it be not worth mention ` and at any rate ' he say ` it be useless for you to remonstrate nat for i have already make fifty thousand dollar ' worth of stock so entirely yours that you can not escape from it the papers be all in my father 's hand and the income will be pay to you or leave subject to you order quarterly if you do not spend it nobody else will ' and then robert bent down lower and lift nat 's thin hand tenderly in he press they both against he check in the way i often do it be one of the few caress nat love i stand the other side of the chair and i stoop down and kiss he and say : -- ` and nat i can not be quite happy in any other way ' so nat yield it be hard to come away and leave he for some time i clung to the hope that he might come with we but the physician all say it would be madness for he to run the risk of a sea-voyage however i know that for he the next best thing to see europe himself be to see it through my eye i write to he every week and i shall carry home to he such art-treasure as he have never dream of possess next year we shall go home and then he will come back to maynard 's mill and live with we robert be have a large studio build for he on the north side of the house with a bed-room and little sitting-room opening out of it miss penstock too will always live with we we shall call she ` housekeeper ' to keep she contented and patrick be to stay as nat 's attendant poor fellow he be not quite full-witted we think but he love nat so devotedly that he make a far better servant than a cleverer boy would with a shade less affection and now you have hear the story of my life dear friend say dora as she rise from the seat and light the rose-colored taper in two low swing etruscan candlestick just above we head -- all that i can tell you she add slowly you will understand that i can not speak about the happiest part of it but you have see robert the only thing that trouble I be that i have no sorrow it seem dangerous dear nat although he have all he ever hope for need not fear be too happy because he have the ever-present pain to make he earnest and keep he ready for more pain i say so to he the day before i come away and he give I those verse i tell you of call ` the angel of pain ' then she repeat they to I : -- the angel of pain angel of pain i think thy face will be in all the heavenly place the sweetest face that i shall see the swiftest face to smile on I all other angel faint and tire joy weary and forsake desire hope falter face to face with fate and die because it can not wait and love cut short each loving day because fond heart can not obey that subtlest law which measure bliss by what it be content to miss but thou o loving faithful pain -- hate reproach reject slay -- dost only closer cling and bless in sweeter stronger steadfastness dear patient angel to thine own thou comest and art never know till late in some lone twilight place the light of thy transfigure face sudden shine out and speechless they know they have walk with christ all day when she have do we sit for some time silent then i rise and kiss she still silent go out into the unlighted room where the gilt table stand a beam of moonlight fall broad and white across its top and flicker on the vine-leaf and the fern in the dim weird light they shape be more fantastic than ever the door into the outer hall stand open as i go toward it i see old anita toiling slowly up the stair with a flat basket on she head she wrinkled face be all aglow with delight as soon as she reach the threshold she set the basket down and exclaim oh look look signora lift off the cover it be full of fresh and beautiful anemone of all color she move a few on top and show I that those beneath be chiefly purple one iddio mio will not the dearest of signoras be please now she say the saint

lightly back upon the anemone and hurry on in search of dora how one woman keep she husband why my sister marry john gray i never could understand i be twenty-two and she be eighteen when the marriage take place they have know each other just one year he have be passionately in love with she from the first day of they meeting she have come more slowly to love he : but love he she do with a love of such depth and fervor as be rarely see he be she equal in nothing except position and wealth he have a singular mixture of fault of opposite temperament he have the reticent dreamy procrastinating inertia of the bilious melancholic man side by side with the impressionable sensuousness the sensitiveness and sentimentalism of the most sanguine-nervous type there be great charm in such a combination especially to person of a keen alert nature my sister be earnest wise resolute john gray be nonchalant shrewd vacillate my sister be exact methodical ready john gray be careless spasmodic dilatory my sister have affection he have tenderness she be religious of soul he have a sort of transcendental perceptivity so to speak which keep he more alive to the comfort of religion than to its obligation my sister would have go to the stake rather than tell a lie he would tell a lie unhesitatingly rather than give anybody pain my sister live earnestly fully actively in each moment of the present it never seem quite clear whether he be think of to-day yesterday or to-morrow she be upright because she could not help it he be upright -- when he be upright -- because of custom taste and the fitness of thing what fatal discrepancy what hopeless lack of real moral strength endure purpose or principle in such a nature as john gray 's when i say these thing to my sister she answer always with a quiet smile i love he she neither admit nor deny my accusation the strongest expression she ever use the one which come nearest to be a indignant repelling of what i have say be one day when i exclaimed : -- ellen i would die before i would risk my happiness in the keep of such a man my happiness be already in he keep say she in a steady voice and i believe he be in mine he be to be my husband and not yours dear you do not know he as i do you do not understand he but it be not to give a analysis of she character or of he nor to give a narrative of they family history that i write this tale it be only one episode of they life that i shall try to reproduce here and i do it because i believe that its lesson be of priceless worth to woman ellen have be marry fourteen year and be the mother of five child when my story begin the year have go in the main peacefully and pleasantly the child three girl and two boy be fair and strong they life have be a very quiet one for we village be far remove from excitement of all kind it be one of the suburban village of -- and most of the family live there be the family of merchant or lawyer do business in the town go in early in the morning and return late at night there be usually in such community a strange lack of social intercourse whether it be that the daily departure and return of the head of the family keep up a perpetual succession of small crisis of interest to the exclusion of other or that the night find all the father and brother too tired to enjoy anything but slipper and cigar i know not but certain it be that all such suburban village be unspeakably dull and lifeless there be barely feel enough of good neighborhood to keep up the ordinary interchange of the commonest civility except for long visit to the city in the winter and long journey in the summer i myself should have find life insupportably tedious but ellen be absolutely content she day be unvaryingly alike a simple routine of motherly duty and housekeeping care she evening be equally unvaried be usually spend in sewing or reading while she husband in seven evening out of ten doze either on the sofa or on one of the child 's little bed in the nursery he exquisite tenderness to the child and he quiet delight in simply be where they be be the brightest point in john gray 's character and life such monotony be not good for either of they he grow more and more dreamy and inert she insensibly but continually narrow and harden and without dream of such a thing really come to be less and less a part of she husband 's inner life faithful busy absorb herself in the care of each day she never observe that he be live more and more in he child and he reverie and withdraw more and more from she she do not need constant play and interchange of sentiment as he do affectionate loyal devoted as she be there be a side of husband 's nature which she do not see nor satisfy perhaps never could but neither of they know it at this time mr gray be offer a position of importance in the city and it become necessary for they to move there to live how i rejoice in the change how bitterly i regret it before two year have pass they city home be a beautiful one and they connection and association be such as to surround they at once with the most desirable companionship at first it be hard for ellen to readjust she system of living and to accustom herself to the demand of even a moderately social life but she be by nature very fond of all such pleasure and she house soon become one of the pleasantest centre in a quiet way of the comparatively quiet city john gray expand and brighten in the new atmosphere he have always be a man of influence among man all he friend -- even he acquaintance -- love he and ask he advice it be a strange thing that a man so inert and procrastinating in he own affair should be so shrewd and practical and influential in the affair of other or in public affair this however be no stranger than many other puzzling incongruity in john gray 's character since he college day he have never mingle at all in general society until this winter after they removal to town and it be with delight that i watch he enjoyment of people and they evident liking and admiration for he he manners be singularly simple and direct he face which be not wholly please in repose be superbly handsome when animated in conversation its inscrutable reticence which baffle the keenest observation when he be silent all disappear and melt in the glow of cordial good-fellowship which light every feature when he talk i grow very proud of my brother as i watch he in he new sphere and surroundings and i also enjoy most keenly see ellen in a wider and more appreciative circle i spend a large part of the first winter in they house and share all they social pleasure and look forward to ever increase delight as my niece should grow old enough to enter into society early in the spring i go to the west and pass the entire summer with relative i hear from my sister every week she letter be always cheerful and natural and i return to she in the autumn full of anticipation of another gay and pleasant winter they meet I in new york and i remember afterwards though in the excitement of the moment i give it no second thought that when john gray 's eye first meet mine there be in they a singular and indefinable expression which rouse in I a instant sense of distrust and antagonism he have never thoroughly like I he have always have a undercurrent of fear of I he know i think he weak : he feel that i have never put full confidence in he that i really and truly love he be small offset for this would it not be so to all of we this part of my story be best tell in few word i have not be at home one week before i find that rumor have be for some month coupling john gray 's name with the name of mr emma long a widow who have but just return to -- after twelve year of married life in cuba john have know she in she girlhood but there have never be any intimacy or even friendship between they my sister however have know she well have correspond with she during all she life at the south and have invite she to she house immediately upon she return to -- emma long be a singularly fascinating woman plain and sharp and self-asserting at twenty-two she have become at thirty-five magnetic and win full of tact and almost beautiful we see such surprising development continually : it seem as if nature do she best to give every woman one period of triumph and conquest perhaps only they know its full sweetness to whom it come late in early youth it be accept unthinkingly as be the sunshine -- enjoy without deliberation and only weigh at its fullness when it be over but a woman who begin at thirty to feel for the first time what it be to have power over man must be more or less than woman not to find the knowledge and the consciousness dangerously sweet i never know -- i do not know to-day whether emma long could be justly call a coquette that she keenly enjoy the admiration of man there be no doubt whether she ever be conscious of even a possible harm to they from they relation to she there be always doubt even in the mind of she bitterest enemy i myself have never doubt that in the affair between she and john gray she be the one who suffer most she be the one who have a true deep sentiment and not only never mean a wrong but would have shrink for he sake if not for she own from the danger which she do not foresee but which be inevitable in they intimacy i think that she whole life afterward prove this i think that even my sister believe it mr long have spend six week in my sister 's house and have then establish herself in a very beautiful furnished house on the same street almost every day mr long 's carriage be at my sister 's door to take my sister or the child to drive almost every evening mr long come with the easy familiarity of a habituate guest in the house to sit in my sister 's parlor or send with the easy familiarity of a old friend for my sister and she husband to come to she or to go with she to the theater or to the opera what could be more natural -- what could be more delightful have the relation be one which centre around my sister instead of around my sister 's husband what could be do what offense could be take what obstacle interpose so long as the relation appear to be one which include the whole family yet no human being could see john gray five minute in emma long 's presence without observe that he eye he word he consciousness be hers and no one could observe she in he presence without see that she be kindle stimulate as she be in no other companionship all this the city have be see and gossip over for four month all this with weary detail be pour into my ear by kind friend my sister say no word for the first time in my life there be a barrier between we i dare not pass she every allusion to mr long be in the kindest and most unembarrassed manner she fall heartily and graciously into every plan which bring they together : she not only do this she also fully reciprocate all entertainment and invitation it be as often by ellen 's arrangement as by mr long be that a evening or a day be spend by the two family together she manner to mr long be absolutely unaltered she manner to john be absolutely unaltered when during a entire evening he sit almost motionless and often quite speechless listen to mr long 's conversation with other ellen 's face never change she could not have seem more unconscious if she have be blind there be many bond of sympathy between john gray and emma long which have never exist between he and he wife they be both passionately fond of art and have study it ellen 's taste be undeveloped and she instinctive liking those of a child but she listen with apparent satisfaction and pleasure to long hour of conversation about statue picture principle of art of which she be as unable to speak as one of she own baby would have be mrs long be also a woman who understand affair and one of she great charm to man of mind be the clear logical and yet picturesque and piquant way in which she talk of man and event ellen listen and laugh as heartily as any member of the circle at she repartee she brilliant characterization she off-hand description to john gray all this be a new revelation he have never know this sort of woman that a woman could be clever as man be clever and also be graceful adorn and tender with womanliness he have not suppose ah poor emma long not all my loyalty to my sister ever quite stifle in my heart the question whether there be not in mr long 's nature something which john gray really need -- something which ellen affectionate wise upright womanly woman as she be could never give to any man the winter wear on idle and malicious tongue grow busier and busier nothing except the constant presence of my sister wherever she husband and mr long be see together prevent the scandal from take the most offensive shape but ellen be so wise so watchful that not even the most malignant gossip-monger could point to anything like a clandestine intercourse between the two in fact they meet so constantly either in mr long 's house or my sister 's that there be small opportunity for they to meet elsewhere i alone know that on many occasion when mr long be spend the evening at we house ellen avail herself of one excuse and another to leave they alone for a great part of the time but she do this so naturally that be with such perfect art that not until long afterward do i know that it have be intentional this be one great reason of my silence during all these month in she apparent ignorance and unsuspiciousness of the whole thing she seem so gay so happy so sweet and loving how could i give she a pain and if she do not see it now she might never see it it could never surely become any more apparent no man could give so far as simple manner be concern more unmistakable proof of be absorb in passionate love for a woman than john gray give in emma long 's presence i begin to do ellen injustice in my thought i say after all she have not much heart no woman who love a man passionately could look on unmoved and see he so absorb in another how little i know towards spring ellen suddenly begin to look ill she lose color and strength and a slight cough which she have have all winter become very severe she husband be alarm we all be distressed we old family physician dr willi change color when he feel ellen 's pulse and say involuntarily -- my dear child how long have you have such fever as this ellen change color too under he steady look and reply -- i think doctor i have have a little fever for some week i have not feel really well since the autumn and i have be mean for some time to have a long consultation with you but we will not have it now she add playfully i have a great deal to tell you which these good people be not to hear we will talk it over some other time and she look at he so meaningly that he understand the subject must be drop that night she tell I that she wish I to propose to john to go over with I and spend the evening at mr long be that she have send for dr willi and she wish to have a long talk with he without john 's know it dear say i hastily i will not go to mr long 's with john i hate mr long why sally what do you mean i never hear you so unjust emma be one of the very sweetest woman i ever see in my life how can you say such a thing everybody love and admire she do not go if you feel so i never dream that you dislike she but i think john would be less likely to suspect I of any desire to have he away if you propose go there and i must have he out of the house i can not talk with the doctor if he be under the roof she say these last word with a excited emphasis so unlike she usual manner that it frighten I but i think only of she physical state i fear that she suspect the existence of some terrible disease i go with john to mr long 's almost immediately after tea he accept the proposal with unconcealed delight and i wonder if ellen observe the very nonchalant way in which he reply when she say she do not feel well enough to go he already like better to see mr long without he wife 's presence cordial and unembarrassed as she manner always be he secret consciousness be always disturb by it when we reach mr long 's house we learn that she have go out to dinner john 's face become black with the sudden disappointment and quite forget himself he exclaim : why what do that mean she do not tell I she be go the servant stare but make no reply i be confuse and indignant but john go on : we will come in and wait i be sure it be some very informal dinner and mr long will soon be at home i make no remonstrance know that it might annoy and disturb ellen to have we return john throw himself into a chair in front of the fire and look moodily into the coal make no attempt at conversation i take up a book very soon john rise saunter abstractedly about the room take up mr long 's work-basket and examine every article in it and at last sit down before she little writing-desk which stand open presently i see that he be write more than a hour pass i pretend to read but i watch my brother-in-law 's face i could not mistake its language suddenly there come a low cry of delight from the door why john mr long have enter the house by a side door and have meet no servant before reach the drawing-room be unprepared for find any one there from the door she could see john but could not see I except in the long mirror to which she do not raise she eye but in which i see she swift movement she outstretched hand she look of unspeakable gladness in less than a second however she have see I and with no perceptible change of manner have come rapidly towards I hold out she left hand familiarly to he as she pass he emma long be not a hypocrite at heart but she have a almost superhuman power of act it be all lose upon I however on that occasion i observe the quick motion with which john thrust into a compartment of the desk the sheet on which he have be write i observe the clasp of they hand as she glide by he i observe she face i observe he and i know as i have never fully know before how intensely they love each other my resolution be take cost what it might come what might i would speak fully and frankly to my sister the next day i would not longer stand by and see this thing go on at that moment i hate both john gray and emma long no possible pain to ellen seem to I to weigh for a moment against my impulse to part they i could not talk i availed myself of the freedom warrant by the intimacy between the family and continue to seem absorb in my book but i lose no word no look which pass between the two who sit opposite I i never see emma long look so nearly beautiful as she do that night she wear a black velvet dress with fine white lace ruffle at the throat and wrist she hair be fair and she complexion of that soft pale tint with a slight undertone of brown in it which be at once fair and warm and which can kindle in moment of excitement into a brilliance far outshine any brunette skin she talk rapidly with much gesture she be give john a account of the stupidity of the people with whom she have be dine she imitative faculty amount almost to genius no smallest peculiarity of manner or speech escape she and she could become a dozen different person in a minute john laugh as he listen but not so heartily as he be wont to laugh at she humorous saying he have be too deeply stir in the long interval of solitude before she return he cheek be flush and he voice unsteady she soon feel the effect of he manner and she gayety die away before long they be sit in silence each look at the fire i know i ought to make the proposition to go home but i seem under a spell i be conscious of a morbid desire to watch and wait at length mr long rise say -- if it will not disturb sally 's reading i will play for you a lovely little thing i learn yesterday oh no say i but we must go as soon as i finish this chapter she pass into the music-room and look back for john to follow she but he throw himself at full length on the sofa and say -- no i will listen here my quicken instinct see that he dare not go also that he have lay he cheek in a abandonment of ecstasy on the arm of the sofa on which she hand have be rest even in that moment i have a sharp pang of pity for he and the same old misgiving of question whether my good and sweet and almost faultless ellen could be love just in the same way in which emma long would be as soon as she have finish the nocturne a sad low sweet strain she come back to the parlor not even for the pleasure of give john the delight of the music he love would she stay where she could not see he face but i have already put down my book and be ready to go we good-night be short and more formal than usual all three be conscious of a undefined constraint in the air mr long glance up uneasily in john 's face as we leave the room she eye be unutterably tender and childlike when a look of grieved perplexity shadow they again my heart ache for she and for he this be no idle caprice no mere entanglement of sens between two unemployed and unprincipled heart it be a subtle harmony organic spiritual intellectual between two susceptible and intense nature the bond be as natural and inevitable as any other fact of nature and in this very fact lay the terrible danger we walk home in silence a few step from we house we meet dr willi walk very rapidly he do not recognize we at first when he do he half stop as if about to speak then suddenly change he mind and merely bow pass on a bright light be burn in ellen 's room why ellen have not go to bed exclaim john perhaps some one call say i guiltily oh i dare say reply he perhaps the doctor have be there but it be half-past twelve add he pull out he watch as we enter the hall he could not have stay until this time i go to my own room immediately in a few moment i hear john come up say a few word to ellen and then go down-stair call back as he leave she room -- do not keep awake for I wifie i have a huge batch of letter to answer i shall not get through before three o'clock i creep noiselessly to ellen 's room it be dark she have extinguish the gas as soon as she have hear we enter the house i know by the first sound of she voice that she have be weep violently and long i say -- ellen i must come in and have a talk with you not to-night dear to-morrow i will talk over everything all be settle good-night do not urge I to-night sally i can not bear any more it be strange -- it be marvellous what power there be in word to mean more than word i know as soon as ellen have say not to-night dear that she divine all i want to say that she know all i know and that the final moment the crisis have come whatever she might have to tell I in the morning i should not be surprised i do not sleep all night i toss wearily try to conjecture what ellen would do try to imagine what i should do in she place at breakfast ellen seem better than she have seem for week she eye be bright and she cheek pink but there be a ineffable almost solemn tenderness in she manner to john which be pathetic again the suspicion cross my mind that she know that she must die he too be disturb by it he look at she constantly with a linger gaze as if try to read she face and when he bid we good-by to go to the office he kiss she over and over as i have not see he kiss she for month the tear come into she eye and she throw both arm around he neck for a second -- a very rare thing for she to do in the presence of other why wifie he say you mus not make it too hard for a fellow to get off -- do not she look well this morning sally turn to I i be think last night that i must take she to the mountain as soon as it be warm enough but such cheek as these do not need it and he take she face in he two hand with a caress full of tenderness and spring down the step just at this moment mr long 's carriage come drive swiftly around the corner and the driver stop suddenly at sight of john oh mr gray mr gray call emma i be just come to take ellen and the child for a turn and we can leave you at the office on we way thank you say john but there be several person i must see before go to the office and it would detain you too long i be already much too late and without a second look he hurry on i see a slight color rise in mr long 's cheek but no observer less jealous than i would have detect it and there be not a shade less warmth than usual in she manner to ellen ellen tell she that she could not go herself but she would be very glad to have some of the child go and then she stand for some moment lean on the carriage-door and talk most animatedly i look from one woman to the other ellen at that moment be more beautiful than mr long the strong serene upright look which be she most distinguishing and characteristic expression actually shine on she face i wish that john gray have stop to see the two face side by side emma long might be the woman to stir and thrill and entrance the soul to give stimulus to the intellectual nature to rouse passionate emotion but ellen be the woman on whose steadfastness he could rest -- in the light of whose sweet integrity and transparent truthfulness he be a far safer and would be a far stronger man than with any other woman in the world as the carriage drive away with all three of the little girl laugh and shout and cling around mr long a strange pang seize I i look at ellen she stand watch they with a smile which have something heavenly in it turn suddenly to I she say : sally if i be die it would make I very happy to know that emma long would be the mother of my child i be about to reply with a passionate ejaculation but she interrupt I hush dear hush i be not go to die -- i have no fear of any such thing come to my room now and i will tell you all she lock the door stand for a moment look at I very earnestly then fold I in she arm and kiss I many time then she make I sit in a large arm-chair and draw up a low foot-stool sit down at my foot rest both arm on my lap and begin to speak i shall try to tell in she own word what she say sally i want to tell you in the begin how i thank you for you silence all winter i have know that you be see all i see feel all i feel and keep silent for my sake i never can tell you how much i thank you it be the one thing which support I it be a unspeakable comfort to know that you sympathize with I at every point but to have have the sympathy express even by a look would have make it impossible for I to bear up as long as i live darling i shall be grateful to you and moreover it make it possible for I to trust you unreservedly now i have always do you injustice sally i do not think you have so much self-control here she hesitate a instant it be not easy for she to mention john 's name but it be only for a second that she hesitate with a impetuous eagerness unlike herself she go on sally you must not blame john he have struggle as constantly and nobly as a man ever struggle neither must you blame emma they have neither of they do wrong i have watch they both hour by hour i know my husband 's nature so thoroughly that i know he very thought almost as soon as he know they himself i know he emotion before he know they himself i see the first moment in which he eye rest on emma 's face as they use to rest on mine from that day to this i have know every phase every step every change of he feeling towards she and i tell you sally that i pity john from the bottom of my heart i understand it all far better than you can far better than he do he love she at once far more and far less than you believe and he love I far more than you believe you will say in the absolute idealization of you inexperienced heart that this be impossible i know that it be not and i wish i could make you believe it for without believe it you can not be just to john he love I to-day in spite of all this with a sort of clinging tenderness bear of this very struggle he would far rather love I with all he nature if he could but just now he can not i see very clearly where emma give he what he need and have never have in I i have learn many thing from emma long this winter i can never be like she but i need not have be so unlike she as i be she have arm I with weapon when she least suspect it but she be not after all on the whole so nearly what john need as i be if i really believe that he would be a better man or even a happier one with she as he wife i should have but one desire and that would be to die but i think that it be not so i believe that it be in my power to do for he and to be to he what she never could i do not wonder that you look pityingly and incredulously you will see but in order to do this i must leave he i spring to my foot leave he be you mad no dear not at all very sane and very determine i have be for six month come to this resolve i begin to think of it in a very few hour after i first see he look at emma as if he love she i have think of it day and night since and i know i be right if i stay i shall lose he love if i go i shall keep it regain it compel it she speak here more hurriedly i have bear now all i can bear without betray my pain to he i be jealous of emma it almost kill I to see he look at she speak to she my poor poor darling i exclaimed and i have be think you do not feel it she smile sadly and toss back the sleeve of she wrapper so as to show she arm to the shoulder i start it be almost emaciated i have again and again in the course of the winter ask she why she do not wear she usual style of evening dress and she have reply that it be on account of she cough it be well that my face do not show loss of flesh as quickly as the rest of my body do she say quietly i have lose thirty-five pound of flesh in four month and nobody observe it yes dear she go on i have feel it more than that i have feel it increasingly every hour and i can bear no more up to this time i have never by look or tone show to john that i know it he wonder every hour what it mean that i do not i have never by so much as the slightest act watch he i have see note in emma 's handwriting lie on he desk and i have leave the house lest i might be tempt to read they i know that he have as yet do no clandestine thing but at any moment i should have lead they both into it by show one symptom of jealousy and i should have rouse in he heart a feeling of irritation and impatience with I which would have do in one hour more to intensify he love for she and to change its nature from a pure involuntary sentiment into a acknowledged and guilty one than year and year of free intercourse could do but i have reach the limit of my physical endurance my nerve be give away i be really very ill but nothing be out of order in my body aside from the effect of this anguish a month more of this would make I a hopelessly broken-down woman a month 's absence from the sight of it will almost make I well i could not refrain from interrupt she ellen you be mad you be mad you mean to go away and leave he to see she constantly alone unrestrained by you presence it have almost kill you to see it how can you bear imagine it know it better than i can bear see it far better because i have still undiminished confidence in the real lastingness of the bond between john and I emma long would have be no doubt a good a very good wife for he but i be the mother of he child and just so surely as right be right and wrong be wrong he will return to I and to they all wrong thing be like disease self-limit it be wrong for a man to love any woman better than he love he wife i do not deny that dear she say half smile through she tear at my indignant face but a man may seem to do it when he be really very far from it he may really do it for day for month -- for year perhaps but if he be a true man and he wife a true wife he will return john be a true husband and a still truer father : that i be the mother of he five child he can never forget if i have have no child it would be different if i have ever be for one moment a unloving wife it would be different but i be he i believe that he be mine and that i shall live to remind you of all these thing sally after time have prove they true i be almost dumb with surprise i be astounded to I it seem that she plan be simply suicidal i tell she in the strongest word i could use of the scene of the night before i could tell you of still more try scene than that sally i know far more than you but if i know ten time as much i should still believe that my plan be the only one of course i may fail it be all in god 's hand we none of we know how much discipline we need but i know one thing : if i do not regain john in this way i can not in any if i stay i shall annoy vex disturb torture he once the barrier of my silence and concealment be break down i shall do just what all other jealous woman have do since the world begin there be no torment on earth like those which a jealous woman inflict except those which she bear i will die sooner than inflict they on john even if the result prove I mistaken i shall never regret my course for i know that the worst be certain if i remain but i have absolute faith -- and she face be transfigure with it as she speak -- john be mine if i could stay by he side through it all and preserve the same relation with he which i have all winter all would sooner or later be well i wish i be strong enough my heart be but my body be not and i must go when she tell I the detail of she plan i be more astounded than ever she have take dr willi into she full confidence -lrb- he have be to we father and physician both ever since we father 's death -rrb- he entirely approve of she course he be to say -- which indeed he could do conscientiously -- that she health imperatively require a entire change of climate and that he have advise she to spend at least one year abroad it have always be one of john 's and ellen 's air-castle to take all the child to england and to germany for some year of study she propose to take the youngest four leave the eldest girl who be she father 's especial pet and companion to stay with he a maiden aunt of ours be to come and keep the house and i be to stay with the family this be the hardest of all ellen i can not i exclaimed do not -- oh do not trust I i shall never have strength i shall betray all some day and ruin all you hope you can not you dare not sally when i tell you that my life 's whole happiness lie in you silence john be unobservant and also unsuspicious he have never have a intimate relation with you you will have no difficulty but you must be here -- because dear there be another reason and here she voice grow very unsteady and tear run down she cheek in spite of all my faith i do not disguise from myself the possibility of the worst i can not believe my husband would ever do a dishonorable thing i do not believe that emma long would and yet when i remember what ruin have overtake many man and woman whom we believe upright i dare not be wholly sure and i must know that some one be here who would see and understand if a time be approach at which it would be needful for I to make one last effort with and for my husband face to face with he unless that come i do not wish you to allude to the subject in you letter i think i know just how all thing will go i believe that in one year or less all will be well but if the worst be to come you with you instinct will foresee it and i must be tell i should return then at once i should have power even at the last moment i believe to save john from disgrace but i should lose he love irrecoverably it be to save that that i go i could say but few word i be lift up and bear out of myself as it be by my sister 's exaltation she seem more like some angel-wife than like a mortal woman before i leave she room at noon i believe almost as fully as she do in the wisdom and the success of she plan there be no time to be lose every day between the announcement of she purpose and the carrying of it out would be a fearful strain on ellen 's nerve dr willi have a long talk with john in he office while ellen be talk with I john come home to dinner look like a man who have receive a mortal blow dr willi have purposely give he to understand that ellen 's life be in great danger so it be but not from the cough at first john 's vehement purpose be to go with they but she be prepare for this he business and official relation be such that it be next to impossible for he to do it and it would at best involve a great pecuniary sacrifice she overrule and remonstrate and be so firm in she objection to every suggestion of he of accompany or follow she that finally in spite of all he anxiety john seem almost pique at she preference for go alone in every conversation on the subject i see more and more clearly that ellen be right he do love she -- love she warmly devotedly two week from the day of my conversation with she they sail for liverpool the summer be to be spend in england and the winter in nice or mentone alice the eldest daughter a loving sunshiny girl of twelve be install in she mother 's room this be ellen 's especial wish she know that in this way john would be draw to the room constantly all she own little belongings be give to alice only think auntie say she mamma have give I all for my own she lovely toilette set and all the bohemian glass on the bureau and she ivory brush she say when she come home she shall refurnish she room and papa 's too oh my wise ellen could emma long have do more subtly early on the first evening after john return from new york have see they off i miss he i say bitterly to myself at mr long 's i suppose and go up-stair to find alice as i draw near she room i hear he voice reading aloud i go in he and alice be lie together on a broad chintz-covered lounge as i have so often see he and ellen oh auntie come here say alice hear mamma 's letter to I she give it to papa in new york she say it be like the sealed order they give to captain sometimes not to be open till they be out at sea it be all about how i be to fill she place to papa and there be ever so many little note inside more order which even papa himself be not to see only i suppose he 'll recognize the thing when i do they at that moment as i watch john gray 's face with alice 's nestled close and he arm clasp tight around she while they read ellen 's letter a great load roll off my heart i go through many dark day afterward but i never could quite despair when i remember the fatherhood and the husbandhood which be in he eye and he voice that night the story of the next twelve month could be tell in few word so far as its external incident be concern it could not be tell in a thousand volume if i attempt to reproduce the subtle undercurrent of john gray 's life and mine each of we be live a double life he more or less unconsciously i with such sharpened sens such overwrought emotion that i only wonder that my health do not give way i endure vicariously all the suspense and torment of the deepest jealousy with a sense of more than vicarious responsibility add which be almost more than human nature could bear ellen little know how heavy would be the burden she lay upon I she most express and explicit direction be that the familiar intimacy between we family and mr long 's be to be preserve unaltered this it would have be impossible for I to do if mr long have not herself recognize the necessity of it for she own full enjoyment of john 's society but it be a hard thing my aunt the ostensible head of we house be a quiet woman who have nothing whatever to do with society and who feel in the outset a great shrinking from the brilliant mr long i have never be on intimate term with she so that john and alice be really the only member of the household who could keep up precisely the old relation and so it gradually come about that to most of we meeting under each other 's roof stranger be ask to fill up the vacant place and in spite of all emma long 's effort and mine there be a change in the atmosphere of we intercourse but there be intimacy enough to produce the effect for which ellen be most anxious ie to extend the shelter of we recognition to the friendship between john and emma and to remove from they both all temptation to anything clandestine or secret they still see each other almost daily they still share most of each other 's interest and pleasure they still show most undisguised delight in each other 's presence again and again i go with they to the opera to the theater and sit through the long hour watch with a pain which seem to I hardly less than ellen 's would have be they constant sympathy with each other in every point of enjoyment they constant forgetfulness of every one else but there be all this time another side to john gray 's life which i saw and emma long do not see by every steamer come package of the most marvelous letter from ellen : letter to we all but for john a diary of every hour of she life each night she spend two hour in write out the record of the day i have never see letter which so reproduce the atmosphere of the day the scene the heart they be brilliant and effective to a degree that utterly astonish I but they be also ineffably tender and loving and so natural in they every word that it be like see ellen face to face to read they at first john do not show they even to I but soon he begin to say these be too rare to be keep to myself i must just read you this account or here be a page i must read until it at last become he habit to read they aloud in the evening to the family and even to more intimate friend who chance to be with we he grow proud beyond expression of ellen 's talent for write and well he might no one who listen to they but exclaim there never be such letter before i think there never be and i alone know the secret of they but these long brilliant letter be not all in every mail come also package for alice -- secret mysterious thing which nobody could see but which prove to be sometimes small note to be give to papa at unexpected time and place sometimes little fancy article as a pen-wiper or a cigar-case half work by ellen to be finish by alice and give to papa on some especial day the significance of which only mamma know sometimes a press flower which be to be put by papa 's plate at breakfast or put in papa 's button-hole as he go out in the morning i be more and more lose in astonishment at the subtle and boundless art of love which could so contrive to reach across a ocean and surround a man 's daily life with its expression there be also in every package letter to john from all the child : even the baby 's little hand be guide to write by every mail dear papa i love you just as much as all the rest do or dear papa i want you to toss I up more than once i see tear roll down john 's face in spite of he as he slowly decipher these illegible little scrawl the older child 's note be vivid and loving like they mother 's it be evident that they be have a season of royal delight in they journey but also evident that they thought and they longing be constantly revert to papa how much ellen really indite of these apparently spontaneous letter i do not know but no doubt they tone be in part create by she they show even more than do she own letter that papa be still the center of the family life no sight be see without the wish -- oh if papa be here and even little mary aged five be make a collection of press leaf for papa from all the place they visit louise have already great talent for draw and in almost every letter come two or three childish but spirited little picture all label draw for papa the true picture of we courier in a rage for papa to see the washerwoman 's dog for papa etc etc again and again i sit by almost tremble with delight and see john spend a entire evening in look over these little missive and read ellen 's letter then again i sit alone and anxious through a entire evening when i know he be with emma long but even after such a evening he never fail to sit down and write page in he journal-letter to ellen -- a practice which he begin of he own accord after receive the first journal-letter from she ha little alice he say we 'll keep a journal too for mamma will not we she shall not out-do we that way and so between alice 's letter and he the whole record of we family life go every week to ellen and i do not believe so utterly unaware be john gray of any pain in he wife 's heart about emma long i do not believe that he ever in a single instance omit to mention when he have be with she where and how long emma long write too and ellen write to she occasional affectionate note but refer she always to john 's diary-letter for the detail of interest i use to study mr long 's face while these letter be read to she john 's animated delight he enthusiastic pride must it seem to I have be bitter to she but i never see even a shade of such a feeling in she face there be nothing base or petty in emma long 's nature and strange as it may seem she do love ellen only once do i ever see a trace of pique or resentment in she manner to john and then i could not wonder at it a large package have come from ellen just after tea one night and we be all gather in the library read we letter and look at the photograph -- -lrb- she always send unmounted photograph of the place from which she write and if possible of the house in which they be live and the child often write above the window _ papa 's _ and mamma 's room etc etc -rrb- -- hour after hour pass the hall clock have just strike ten when the door-bell ring violently good heaven exclaim john spring up that must be mr long i totally forget that i have promise to go with she to mr willi 's party i say i would be there at nine tell she i be up-stair dress and he be go before the servant have have time to open the door mr long come in with a flush face and anxious look be mr gray ill she say he promise to call for I at nine to go to mr willi 's and i have be afraid he might be ill before i could reply the unconscious alice exclaim -- oh no papa be not ill he be so sorry but he forget all about the party till he hear you ring the bell we be so busy over mamma 's letter john will be down in a moment add i he run up-stair to dress as soon as you ring for one second emma long 's face be sad to see such astonishment such pain be in it my heart ache for she then a look of angry resentment succeed the pain and merely say i be very sorry but i really can not wait for he it be now almost too late to go she have leave the room and close the outer door before i could think of any word to say i run up to john 's room and tell he through the closed door he make no reply for a moment and then say -- no wonder she be vex it be unpardonable rudeness tell robert to run at once for a carriage for I in a very few moment he come down dress for the party but with no shadow of disturbance on he face he be still think of the letter he take up he own and put it into a inside breast-pocket say as he kiss alice papa will take mamma 's letter to the party if he can not take mamma i shed grateful tear that night before i go to sleep how i long to write to ellen of the incident but i have resolve not once to disregard she request that the whole subject be a seal one and i trust that alice would remember to tell it well i might at breakfast alice say -- oh papa i tell mamma that you carry she to the party in you breast-pocket that be you carry she letter i fancy that john 's cheek flush a little as he say -- you might tell mamma that papa carry she everywhere in he breast-pocket little girlie and mamma would understand i think from that day i never fear for ellen 's future i fancy too that from that day there be a new light in john gray 's eye perhaps it might have be only the new light in my own but i think when a man know that he have once for one hour forget a promise to meet a woman whose presence have be dangerously dear to he he must be aware of he dawn freedom the winter be nearly over ellen have say nothing to we about return dr willi tell I that from what ellen write to he of she health he think it would be safer for she to remain abroad another year say john to I one morning at breakfast oh she never will stay another year exclaim i not unless i go out to stay with she say john very quietly oh john could you and oh papa will you take I exclaimed alice and i in one breath yes and yes say john laughing and sally too if she will go he then proceed to tell I that he have be all winter contemplate this that he believe they would never again have so good a opportunity to travel in europe and that dr willi 's hesitancy about ellen 's health have decide the question he have be plan and deliberate as silently and unsuspectedly as ellen have do the year before never once have it cross my mind that he desire it or that it could be but i find that he have for the last half of the year be arrange he affair with a view to it and have enter into new business connection which would make it not only easy but profitable for he to remain abroad two year he urge I to go with they but i refuse i feel that the father and the mother and the child ought to be absolutely alone in this bless reunion and i have never regret my decision although the old world be yet a unknown world to I john gray be a reticent and undemonstrative man in spite of all the tenderness and passionateness in he nature but when he bid I good-by on the deck of the steamer as he kiss I he whisper : -- sally i shall hold my very breath till i see ellen i never know how i love she before and the tear stand in he eye i never see emma long after she know that john be to go abroad to join ellen i find myself suddenly without courage to look in she face the hurry of my preparation for alice be ample excuse for my not go to she house and she do not come to ours i know that john spend several evening with she and come home late with a sad and serious face and that be all a week before he sail she join a large and gay party for san francisco and the yosemite in all the newspaper account of the excursion mr long be speak of as the brilliant center of all festivity i understand well that this be the first reaction of she proud and sensitive nature under a irremediable pain she never return to -- but establish herself in a southern city where she live in great retirement for a year do good to all poor and suffer people and spend the larger part of she fortune in charity early in the second year there be a epidemic of yellow fever : mr long refuse to leave the city and go as fearlessly as the physician to visit and nurse the worst case but after the epidemic have pass by she herself be take ill and die suddenly in a hospital ward surround by the very patient whom she have nurse back to health nothing i could say in my own word would give so vivid a idea of the meeting between john gray and he wife as the first letter which i receive from little alice : -- darling auntie -- it be too bad you do not come too the voyage be horrid papa be so much sicker than i that i have to take care of he all the time but my head ache so that i keep see black spot if i stooped over to kiss papa but papa say i be just like another mamma oh auntie only think there be a mistake about the letter and mamma never get the letter to tell she that we be come and she be out on the balcony of the hotel when we get out of the carriage and first she see I and the lady who be with she say she turn first red and then so white the lady think she be sick and then the next minute she see papa and she just fall right down among all the people and look as if she be dead and the very first thing poor papa and i see when we get up-stair be mamma be carry by two man and papa and i both think she be dead and papa fall right down on he knee and make the man put mamma down on the floor and everybody talk out loud and papa never speak a word but just look at mamma and nobody know who papa be till i speak and i say -- ` that be my mamma and papa and i have just come all the way from america -- and then a gentleman tell I to kiss mamma and i do and then she open she eye and just as soon as she see papa she get a great deal whiter and she head fall back again and i be so sure she be die that i begin to cry out loud and i do think there be more than a hundred people all round we but louise say there be only ten or twelve and then the same gentleman that tell I to kiss mamma take hold of papa and make he go away and they carry mamma into a room and lay she on a bed and say we must all go out but i would not : i get right under the bed and they do not see I and it seem to I a thousand year before anybody speak and at last i hear mamma 's voice just as weak as a baby 's -- but you know nobody could mistake mamma 's voice and say she ` where be john -- i see john ' and then the gentleman say -- oh i forget to tell you he be a doctor -- he say -- ` my dear madam calm yourself ' -- and then i cry right out again and creep out between he leg and almost knock he down and say i ` do not you try to calm my mamma it be papa -- and I too mamma ' and then mamma burst out cry and then the old gentleman run out and i guess papa be at the door for he come right in and then he put he arm round mamma and they do not speak for so long i think i should die and all the people be listen and go up and down in the hall outside and i feel so frightened and ashamed for fear people would think mamma be not glad to see we but papa say that be always the way when people be more glad than they can bear and the surprise too be too much for anybody but i say at the tea-table that i hope i should never be so glad myself as long as i live and then the old gentleman -- he be a very nice old gentleman and a great friend of mamma 's and wear gold spectacles -- he say ` my dear little girl i hope you _ may _ be some day just as glad ' and then he look at papa and mamma and smile -- and mamma almost cry again oh altogether it be a horrid time the worst i ever have and so different from what papa and i think it would be but it be all over now and we be all so happy we laugh so all the time that papa say it be disgraceful that we shall have to go off and hide ourselves somewhere where people can not see we but auntie you do not know how perfectly splendid mamma be she be the prettiest lady in the hotel louise say she be ever so much fatter than she use to be and the baby have grow so i do not know she and she curl be more than half a yard long louise and mary have get they hair cut short like boy but they gown be splendid they say it be such a pity you have any make for I at home but oh dear auntie do not think i shall not always like the gown you make for I charlie be not here he be at some horrid school a great way off i forget the name of the place but we be all go there to live for the summer mamma say we should keep house in a ` apartment ' and i be perfectly horrify and i say ` mamma in one room ' and then louise and mary laugh till i be quite angry but mamma say that here a ` apartment ' mean a set of a good many room quite enough to live in i do not believe you can have patience to read this long letter but i have not tell you half no not one half of half good-by you darling aunty alice p -- i wish you could just see mamma it be not only I that think she be so pretty papa think so too he just sit and look and look at she till mamma do not quite like it and ask he to look at baby a little ellen 's first letter be short she heart be too full she say at the end -- i suppose you will both laugh and cry over alice 's letter at first i thought of suppress it but it give you such a graphic picture of the whole scene that i shall let it go it be well that i have the excuse of the surprise for my behavior but i myself doubt very much if i should have do any better have i be prepare for they come god bless and thank you dear sally for this last year as i can not ellen these event happen many year ago my sister and i be now old woman she life have be from that time to this one of the sunniest and most unclouded i ever know john gray be a hale old man white-haired and bent but clear-eyed and vigorous all the good and lovable and pure in he nature have go on steadily increase : he love for he wife be still so full of sentiment and romance that the world remark it he grandchild will read these page no doubt but they will never dream that it could have be they sweet and placid and beloved old grandmother who through such sore strait in she youth keep she husband esther wynn 's love-letter my uncle joseph norton live in a very old house it be one of those many mansion in which that father of all sleeper george washington once sleep for two night this however be before the house come into the possession of we family and we seldom

which i always sleep when i visit there these wooden wall be of pale green the tile be of blue and white and afford I endless study and perplexity be paint with a series of half-allegorical half-historical half-scriptural representation which might well have puzzle a older head than mine the parlor be white with gold ornament the library be of oak with mahogany wainscoting and so be the two great central hall upper and lower the balustrade of the staircase be of apple-tree wood more beautiful than all the rest have fine red vein on its dark polished surface these hall be line with portrait of dead norton man and woman who look as much at home as if the grand old house have always bear they name and well they might for none of the owner who have go before have be of as gentle blood as they and now they would probably never be take down from the wall for my uncle have buy the house and my uncle 's son would inherit it and it have never yet be know that a norton of we branch of norton have live wastefully or come to want my uncle have marry very late in life : he be now a gray-haired man with little child around he knee it be say once in my presence by some one who do not know i listen that he heart have be break when he be little more than a boy by the faithlessness of a woman older than himself and that he would never have marry if he have not see that another heart would be break if he do not be that as it may he bearing towards he wife be always of the most chivalrous and courteous devotion so courteous as perhaps to confirm this interpretation of he marriage my aunt be a uninteresting woman of whom if she be not in sight one never think but she have great strength of affection and much good sense in affair she child love she she husband enjoy the admirably order system of she management and she house be a delightful one to visit although she do not contribute to the flavor of live she never hinder or thwart those who could there be freedom in

friendship such as be rare between a man of sixty and a girl of fifteen i understand he far better than he wife do and he affection for I be so great and so caress that he use often to say laughingly

aunt sarah i have always mean to have they burn up i dare say this come out of one of they in some way and she resume she habitual expression of nonchalance perhaps so say uncle jo folding up the paper and put it in he pocket i will look after breakfast she glance up again surprised and say why be it of any importance oh no no say he hastily with a shade of embarrassment in he voice it be only a old letter but i think there might be more from the same person who be it say aunt sarah languidly i do not know only the first name be sign say he evasively and the placid lady ask no more the child be busy with fido and breakfast go on but i watch my uncle 's face i have never see it look just as it look then what could that old yellow letter have be my magnetic sympathy with my uncle tell I that he be deeply move at dinner-time my uncle be late and aunt sarah say with a little less than she usual dignity i never do see such a man as mr norton when he take a notion in he head he be be

mysterious letter be forget by everybody except my uncle and I one bitterly cold night we be sit around a blaze coal fire in the library it be very late aunt sarah be asleep in she chair my uncle be read suddenly the door open and robert come in bring a letter on he little silver tray : it be past eleven o'clock the evening mail have be bring in long before why what be that robert say uncle jo start up a little alarmed one of they old letter sir reply robert i just get it on the cellar stair sir my uncle take the letter hastily robert still stand as if he have more to say and he honest blank face look stupefy with perplexity if you please sir he begin it be the queerest thing ever i see that letter 's be put on they stair sir within the last five minute why robert what do you mean say my uncle thoroughly excited oh dear groan aunt sarah creep out of she nap and chair if you be go into another catechism about those old letter i be go to bed and she leave the room not stay long enough to understand that this be a new mystery and not a vain rediscussing of the old one it seem that robert have be down cellar to see that the furnace fire be in order for the night as soon as he reach the top of the stair in come up he remember that he have not turn the outside damper properly and go back to do it i be not go three minute sir and when i come back there lay the letter right side up square in the middle of the stair and i would take my bible oath sir as ` twa not there when i go down who be in the hall when you go down robert say my uncle sternly nobody sir every servant in the house have go to bed except jane -lrb- my aunt 's maid -rrb- and she be go up the stair over my head sir when i first go down into the cellar i know she be sir for she call through the stair to I and she say ` master 'll hear you robert ' you see sir jane and I do not know as it be so late and we be frighten when we hear the clock strike half-past eleven that will do robert say uncle jo you can go and robert disappear relieved but puzzle there seem no possible explanation of the appearance of the letter there and then except that hand have place it there during the brief interval of robert 's be in the cellar there be no human hand in the house which could have do it be a restless ghost wander there bent on betray poor esther 's secret to stranger what do it what could it mean will you read this one with I nell say my uncle turn it over reverently and open it no i say but i will watch you read it and i sit down on the floor at he foot the letter be very short he read it twice without speak and then say in a unsteady voice : this be a earlier letter than the other i think this be a joyous one poor esther i believe i know she whole story but the mystery be inexplicable i would take down these wall if i think i could get at the secret long past midnight we sit and talk it all over and rack we brain in vain to invent any theory to account for the appearance of the letter on that cellar stairway my uncle 's tender interest in the poor dead esther be fast be overshadow by the perplexing mystery a few day after this mary the cook find another of the letter when she first go down-stair in the morning and robert place it by my uncle 's plate with the rest of he mail it be the strangest one of all for there be not a word of write in it that could be read it be a foreign letter some line of the fade old postmark be still visible on the back the first page look as if it have be write over with some sort of sympathetic ink but not a word could be decipher fold in a small piece of the thinnest of paper be a mouldy and crumble flower of a dull-brown color on the paper be write -- pomegranate blossom from jaffa and a few line of poetry of which we could make out only here and there a word even aunt sarah be thoroughly arouse and excite now robert have be in the cellar very late on the previous night and be sure that at that time no papers be on the stair i never go down they stair sir say robert without look -- and listen too he add under he breath with a furtive look back at the cook who be stand in the second doorway of the butler 's pantry the truth be robert have be afraid of the cellar ever since the finding of the second letter : and all the servant share he uneasiness between eleven at night and seven the next morning this mute ghostly waif from palestine with the half-century old dust of a pomegranate flower in its keep have come up that dark stairway it appear now that the letter be always find on the fourth stair from the top this fact have not before be elicit but there seem little doubt about it even little princess say -- yes papa i be sure that the one i find be on that stair for i now remember fido come up with only just one or two bound to the top as soon as he see I we be very sober the little child chatter on it mean nothing to they this breath from such a far past but to heart old enough to comprehend there be something infinitely sad and suggestive in it i already feel though i have not read one word of she writing that i love the woman call esther as for my uncle he very face be become change by the thought of she and the mystery about the appearance of the letter he begin to be annoyed also for the servant be grow suspicious and unwilling to go into the cellar mary the cook declare that on the morning when she find this last letter something white brush by she at the foot of the stair and robert say that he have for a long time hear strange sound from that staircase late at night just after this my aunt go away for a visit and several day pass without any further discovery on the stair my uncle and i spend long hour in talk over the mystery and he urge I to read or to let he read to I the two letter he have pet he say i will tell you something one reason they move I so be that they be strangely like word write by a woman whom i know thirty year ago i do not believe two such woman have be on the earth i kiss he hand when he say this yet a strange unwillingness to read esther 's letter withhold I i feel that he have right and i have not but the end of the mystery be near it be reveal as it ought to have be to my uncle himself one night i be waken out of my first sleep by a very cautious tap at my door and my uncle 's voice say -- nell -- nell be you awake i spring to the door instantly o uncle be you ill -lrb- my aunt have not yet return -rrb- no pet but i want you down-stairs dress yourself and come down into the library my hand tremble with excitement as i dress yet i be not afraid : i know it be in some way connect with esther though my uncle have not mention she name i find he sit before the library table which be literally cover with old letter such as we have before see o uncle i gasp as soon as i see they yes dear i have get they all there be no ghost then he tell I in few word what have happen it seem that he have go down himself into the cellar partly to satisfy himself that all be right with the furnace partly with a vague hope of find another of the letter he have find nothing have examine the furnace lock the door at the head of the cellar stair and go up to he bed-room while he be undress a strange impulse seize he to go back once more and see whether it might not happen to he as it have to robert to find a letter on return after a few moment ' interval he throw on he wrapper take a candle and go down the first thing he see on open the door which he have himself lock only five minute before be a letter lie on the same fourth stair i confess nell say he for a minute i feel as frightened as black bob but i sit down on the upper step and resolve not to go away till i have discover how that letter come there if i stay till day-light nearly a hour pass he say the cold wind from the cellar blow up and sway the candle-flame to and fro all sort of strange sound seem to grow louder and louder and still he sit gaze helplessly in a sort of despair at that motionless letter which he have not lift from the stair at last purely by accident he look up to the staircase overhead -- the front stair down which he have just come from he room he jump to he foot there up among the dark cobwebbed shadow he think he see something white he hold up the candle it be yes it be a tiny corner of white paper wedge into a crack by stand on the beam at the side he could just reach it he touch it -- pull it -- it come out slowly -- another of esther 's letter they be hide in the upper staircase the board have be worn and jar a little away from each other and the letter be gradually shake through the open some heavier or quicker step than usual give always the final impetus to a letter which have be for day slowly work down towards the fated outlet stealthily as any burglar he have creep about he own house have take up the whole of the front staircase carpet and have with trouble pry off one board of the stair in which the letter be hide there have be a spring he find but it be rust and would not yield he have carefully replace the carpet carry the letter into the library and come for I it be now half-past one o'clock at night dear bless uncle jo i be a old woman now good man and strong man have give I love and have show I of they love for other but never do i feel myself so in the living presence of incarnate love as i do that night sit with my white-haired uncle face to face with the fade record of the love of esther wynn it be only from one note that we discover she last name this be write in the early day of she acquaintance with she lover and while she be apparently little more than a child it be evident that at first the relation be more like one of pupil and master for some time the letter all commence scrupulously my dear friend or my most beloved friend it be not until year have pass that the master become the lover we fancy uncle jo and i as we go reverently over the beautiful page that esther have grow and develop more and more until she be the teacher the helper the inspirer we feel sure though we could not tell how that she be the stronger of the two that she move and live habitually on a higher plane that she yearn often to lift the man she love to the freer height on which she soul lead its glorified existence it be strange how little we gather which could give a clew to she actual history or to he the letter almost never give the name of the place only the day and year many of they only the day there be dearth of allusion to person it be as if these two have live in a separate world of they own when person be mention at all it be only by initial it be plain that some cruel inexorable bar separate she from the man she love a bar never speak of -- whose nature we could only guess -- but one which she strong and pure nature feel itself free to triumph over in spirit however submissive the external life might seem they relation have last for many year so many that that fact alone seem a holy seal and testimony to the purity and immortality of the bond which unite they esther must have be a middle-aged woman when as the saddened letter reveal she health fail and she be order by the physician to go to europe the first letter which my uncle have read the one which princess find be the letter in which she bid farewell to she lover there be no record after that only two letter which have come from abroad one be the one that i have mention which contain the pomegranate blossom from jaffa and a little poem which after long hour of labor uncle jo and i succeed in decipher the other have two flower in it -- a edelweiss which look as white and pure and immortal as if it have come from alpine snow only the day before and a little crimson flower of the amaranth species which be wrap by itself and mark from bethlehem of judea the only other word in this letter be i be better darling but i can not write yet it be evident that there have be the deepest intellectual sympathy between they closely and fervently and passionately as they heart must have love the letter be never from first to last simply lover ' letter keen interchange of comment and analysis full revelation of strongly marked individual life constant mutual stimulus to mental growth there must have be between these two we be incline to think from the exquisitely phrased sentence and rare fancy in the letter and from the graceful movement of some of the little poem that esther must have have ambition as a writer then again she seem so wholly simply passionately a woman to love and be love that all thought of anything else in she nature or she life seem incongruous oh groan uncle jo after read one of the most glowing letter oh be there really ever in any other man 's arm but mine a woman who could say such thing as these between kiss o nell nell thank god that you have not the dower of such a double fire in you vein as esther have all night we sit reading and reading and reading when the great clock in the hall strike six we start like guilty person oh my childie say uncle jo how wrong this have be in I poor little pale face go to bed now and remember i forbid you to go to school to-day and i forbid you get up until noon i promise you i will not look at another letter i will lock they all up till to-morrow evening and then we will finish they i obey he silently i be too exhaust to speak but i be also too excite to sleep until noon i lay wide awake on the bed in my darkened room living over esther wynn 's life marvelling at the inexplicable revelation of it which have be put into we hand and wonder until the uncertainty seem almost anguish what be that end which we could never know do she die in the holy land or do she come home well and strong and do she lover die some day leave he secret treasure of letter behind he and poor stricken esther to go to she grave in fear lest unfriendly hand might have gain possession of she heart 's record he be a married man we feel sure have the wife whom he do not love pace up and down and up and down for year over these dumb witness to that of which she have never dream the man himself when he come to die do he writhe thinking of those silent eloquent precious letter which he must leave to time and chance to destroy or protect do man carry he dead down the very stair on which he have so often knelt unseen and wafted kiss towards the hidden esther all these conjecture and question and thousand more hurry in wild confusion through my brain in vain i close my eye in vain i press my hand on my eyelid countless face dark light beautiful plain happy sad threatening implore seem dancing in the air around my bed and say esther esther we know she be fair for there be in one of the letter a tiny curl of pale brown hair but we believe from many expression of hers that she have no beauty oh if i could but have know how she look at last i fall asleep and sleep heavily until after dark this refresh my overwrought nerve and when at nine o'clock in the evening i join my uncle in the library i be calmer than he we say very few word i sit on he knee with one arm around he neck and hand in hand we reverently lift the frail tremble sheet we learn nothing new in fact almost any one of the letter be a round revelation of esther 's nature and of the great love she bear -- and there be little more to learn there be more than a hundred of the letter and they embrace a period of fifteen year we arrange they in pile each year by itself for some year there be only two or three we wonder whether during those year they have live near each other and so have not write or whether the letter have be destroy when the last letter be lay where it belong we look at each other in silence and we both sigh uncle jo speak first childie what shall we do with they i do not know uncle i say i should feel very guilty if we do not make sure that no one else read they i should feel very guilty myself except that i have read they with you they seem to I to belong to you somehow uncle jo kiss I and we be silent again then he say there be but one way to make sure that no human being will ever read they -- that be to burn they but it be as hard for I to do it as if they have be write to I could you not put they back in the stair and nail it up firmly say i it be a stormy night the wind be blow hard and sleet and snow driving against the window at this instant a terrible gust rattle the icy branch of the syringa-bush against the window with a noise like the click of musketry and above the howling of the wind there come a strange sound which sound like a voice cry burn burn uncle jo and i both hear it and both spring to we foot white with a nervous terror in a second he recover himself and say laughing pet we be both a good deal shake by this business but i do think it will be safer to burn the letter poor poor esther i hope she be safe with she lover now oh do you doubt it say i i do not no say he i do not either thank god uncle jo say i do you think esther would mind if i copy a few of these letter and two or three of the poem i so want to have they that it seem to I i can not give they up i love she so i think she would be willing the storm suddenly die away and the peaceful silence around we be almost as startling as the fierce gust have be before i take it as a omen that esther do not refuse my wish and i select the four letter which i most desire to keep i take also the pomegranate blossom and the edelweiss and the crimson amaranth from bethlehem i think esther would rather that these should not be burn i say yes i think so too reply uncle jo then we lay the rest upon the fire the generous hickory log seem to open they arm to they in a few seconds great pant stream of fire leap up and rush out of we sight bear with they all that be perishable of esther wynn 's letter just as the crackling shadowy shape be fall apart and turn black my uncle spring to a indian cabinet which stand near and seize a little box of incense-powder which have be bring from china by he brother he shake a few grain of it into the fire a pale fragrant film rise slowly in coil wreath and cloud and hide the last moment of the burning of the letter when the incense smoke clear away nothing could be see on the hearth but the bright hickory coal in they bed of white ash i shall make every effort say uncle jo to find out who live in this house during those year i presume i can by old record somewhere oh uncle i say do not i think they would rather we do not know any more you sweet woman child he exclaim you be right you instinct be truer than mine i be only a man after all i will never try to learn who it be that esther love i be very glad he add that this happen when you aunt sarah be away it would have be a great weariness and annoyance to she to have read these letter dear courteous uncle jo i respect he chivalrous little artifice of speech and try to look as if i believe he would have carry the letter to he wife if she have be there and i think dear he hesitatingly proceed we would better not speak of this it will be one sacred little secret that you and you old uncle will keep as no more letter will be find on the stair the whole thing will be soon forget oh yes uncle reply i of course it would be terrible to tell it be not we secret you know it be dear esther wynn 's i do not know why it be that i lock up those four letter of esther wynn 's and do not look at they for many month i feel very guilty in keep they but a power i could not resist seem to paralyze my very hand when i thought of open the box in which they be at last long after i have leave uncle jo 's house i take they out one day and in the quiet and warmth of a summer noon i copy they slowly carefully word for word then i hide the original in my bosom and walk alone without tell any one whither i be go to a wild spot i know several mile away where a little mountain stream come foam and dash down through a narrow gorge to empty itself into we broad and placid river i sit down on a mossy granite boulder and slowly tear the letter into minutest fragment one by one i toss the white and tiny shred into the swift water and watch they as far as i could see they the brook lift they and toss they over and over lodge they in mossy crevice or on tree root then sweep they all up and whirl they away in dark depths of the current from which they would never more come to the surface it be a place which esther would have love and i wonder as i sit there hour after hour whether it be really improbable that she know just then what i be do for she i wonder also as i often before have wonder if it might not have be by esther 's will that the sacred hoard of letter which have lie undiscovered for so many year should fall at last into the hand of my tender and chivalrous uncle jo it be certainly a strange thing that on the stormy night which i have describe when we be discuss what should be do with the letter both uncle jo and i at the same instant should have fancy we hear the word burn burn the follow letter be the earliest one which i copy it be the one which robert find so late at night and bring to we in the library : -- Friday evening sweetest : -- it be very light in my room to-night the full moon and the thought of you i see to write but you would forbid I -- you who would see only the moonlight and not the other oh my darling my darling i have be all day in field and on edge of wood i have never see just such a day : a June sun and a September wind clover and butter-cup under foot and a sparkling October sky overhead i think the earth enjoy it as a sort of masquerade frolic the breeze be so strong that it take the butterfly half off they air-leg and they fairly reel about in the sun as for I i sit here and there on hillock and stone among fern and white cornel and honey-bee and bobolink i be the only still thing in the field i wait so long in each spot that it be like be transplant when i move myself to the north or the south and i discover a few thing in each country in which i live for one thing i observe that the little busy bee be not busy all the while that he do a great amount of aimless idle snuffing and tasting of all sort of thing besides flower especially he indulge in a run accompaniment of gymnastics among the grass-stalk which can not possibly have anything to do with honey i watch one fellow to-day through a series of positive trapeze movement from top to bottom and bottom to top of a grass-tangle when he get through he shake himself and smooth off he leg exactly as the circus-man do then he take a long pull at a clover well ah the clover dearest you should have see how it swing to-day the stupidest person in the world could not have help think that it keep time to invisible band-playing and be try to catch hold of the buttercup i lay down at full length and look off through the stem and then i saw for the first time how close they be and that they constantly sway and touch and sometimes lock fast together for a second stately as a minuet it look but joyous and loving as the wildest waltz i ever dance in you arm my darling oh how dare we presume to be so sure that the flower be not glad as we be glad on such a day as to-day i never doubt it and i pick one as reverently and hesitatingly as i would ask the queen of the fairy home to tea if i meet she in a wood laughing be you darling yes i know it poor soul you can not help be a man i suppose nor would i have you help it my great strong glorious one how i adore the thing which you do which i could not do oh my sweet master never fear that i do you less reverence than i should all the same i lie back on my ferny hillock and look you in the eye and ask you what you think would become of you if you have no little one of my kind to bring you honey and when i say this -- you -- ah my darling now there be tear in my eye and the moonlight grow dim i can not bear the think what you would do when i say those word good-night perhaps in my sleep i will say they again and you will be there to answer in the morning i shall write out for you to-day 's clover song you own the clover song be not in the letter we find it afterward on a small piece of paper so worn and broken in the fold that we know it must have be carry for month in a pocket-book a song of clover i wonder what the clover think -- intimate friend of bob-o-link lover of daisy slim and white waltzer with butter-cup at night keeper of inn for travel bee serve to they wine dregs and lees leave by the royal humming-bird who sip and pay with fine-spun word fellow with all the lowliest peer of the gayest and the best comrade of wind beloved of sun kiss by the dew-drop one by one prophet of good luck mystery by sign of four which few may see symbol of nature 's magic zone one out of three and three in one emblem of comfort in the speech which poor man 's baby early reach sweet by the roadside sweet by sill sweet in the meadow sweet on hill sweet in its white sweet in its red oh half its sweet can not be say sweet in its every living breath sweetest perhaps at last in death oh who know what the clover think no one unless the bob-o-link the line which be write on the paper inclose the pomegranate flower from jaffa we decipher with great trouble the last verse we be not quite sure about for there have be erasure but i think we be right finally pomegranate blossom heart of fire i dare to be thy death to slay thee while the summer sun be quicken thy breath to rob the autumn of thy wine -- next year of all ripe seed of thine that thou mayest bear one kiss of mine to my dear love before my death for heart of fire i too be rob like thee like thee i die while yet my summer sun of love be near and warm and high the autumn will run red with wine the autumn fruit will swing and shine but in that little grave of mine i shall not see they where i lie pomegranate blossom heart of fire this kiss so slow so sweet thou bearest hence can never lose even in death its heat redder than autumn can run with wine warmer than summer sun can shine forever that dear love of mine shall find thy sacred hidden sweet the next letter which i copy be one write five year after the first it be not so much a letter as a allegory and so beautiful so weird that we wonder esther do not set it to tune as a poem Sunday morning my darling : -- even this blaze September sun look dull to I this morning i have come from such a riotous dream all last night i walk in a realm of such golden splendor that i think even in we fullest noon i shall only see enough light to grope by for day and day i do not know how to tell you my dream i think i must put it in shape of a story of two people but you will know darling that in my dream it be you and i and i honestly do dream it love every word just as i shall write it for you only there be no word which so glow and light and blaze as do the chamber through which we walk i have be read about the wonderful gold mine of which every one be talk now and this lead to my dream you can laugh if you like sweet master mine but i think it be all true and i call it the mine of gold there be but one true mine of gold and of it no man know and no woman save those who go into it neither can they who go tell whether they sink into the earth 's heart or be catch up into the chamber of the air or lead to the outer pavilion of the sea suddenly they perceive that all around above below they be gold : rock of gold higher than they can see cave whose depths be bright with gold lake of gold which be molten and leap like fire but in which flower can be dip and not wither sand of gold soft and pleasant to touch innumerable shape of all thing beautiful which wave and change but only from gold to gold air which shine and shimmer like refiner 's gold warmth which be like the glow of the red gold of ophir and everywhere golden silence hand in hand walk the two to whom it be give to enter here : of the gold they may carry away only so much as can be hide in they bosom grain which be spill or be leave on they garment turn to ash only to each other may they speak of these mystery but all man perceive that they have riches and that they face shine as the face of angel suddenly it come to pass that one day a golden path lead they farther than they have ever go before and into a vast chamber too vast to be measure its wall although they be of gold be also like crystal this be a mystery only three side be wall the fourth side be the opening of a gallery which stretch away and away golden like a broad sunbeam : from out the distance come the sound of rush water however far they walk in that gallery still the golden sunbeam stretch before they still the sound of the water be no nearer : and so would the sunbeam and the sound of the water be forever for they be eternity but there be a fourth mystery on the wall of crystal gold on all side shine face not dead face not picture face live face -- warm smile reflect face then it be reveal to the two who walk hand in hand that these be the face of all who have ever enter in as they between the wall of crystal gold flash face of the son of god look into eye of earthly woman -- these be the first : and after they all in they generation until to-day the son of man with the woman they have love the man 's face smile but the face of the woman have in they a joy greater than a smile presently the two who walk hand in hand see they own face add to the other with the same smile the same joy and it be reveal to they that these face be immortal through all eternity they will shine on the wall of crystal gold and those who have once look on they can never more see in each other change or loss of beauty if as they walk there in the broad sunbeam a angel meet they bear the token of a golden bowl that be break and a silver cord that be unloosed they follow he without grief or fear thinking on that chamber of crystal gold good-by darling esther the third letter be write three year after this one sadness be begin to cloud the free joyous outpouring of esther 's heart probably this sadness be one of the first symptom of the failure of she health it be from this letter chiefly -- although there be expression in other which deepen the impression -- that we infer that she lover have try to stimulate in she a intellectual ambition Wednesday evening dear one : -- you last letter give I great pain it break my heart to see you look so earnestly and expectantly into my future beloved that i have grow and develop so much in the last seven year be no proof that i can still keep on grow if you understand darling you would see that it be just the other way i have grow year by year hour by hour because hour by hour i have love you more that be all i have feel the growth i know it as clearly as you do but i know the secret of it as you do not and i know the limit of it as you can not i can not love you more precious one neither would i if i could one heart-beat more in a minute and i should die but all that you have so much loved and care for dear call it intellectual growth and expansion in I have be only the clearing refining and stimulating of every faculty every sense by my love for you when i have say or write a word which have please you thus if there be any special fitness or eloquence in the word it be only because i seek after what would best carry my thought to you darling what would be best frame best set to keep the flower or the sky which i have to see alone -- to keep they till you could see they too oh dear one do understand that there be nothing of I except my heart and my love while they be wonderingly tremblingly rapturously grow within I under the sweet warmth of you love no wonder i change day by day but precious one it be end the whole solemn steadfast womanhood within I recognize it beloved master in one sense you can teach I no more i be content i desire nothing one moment of full consciousness of you of life of you love be more than all century of learn all eternity of inspiration i

say such thing to I any more and whenever you feel such ambition and hope stir in you heart read over this little verse and be sure that you child know what she say when she write it : -- the end of harvest o love who walkest slow among my sheaf smile at tint and shape thy smile of peace but whispering of the next sweet year 's increase -- o tender love thy loving hope but grieve my heart i rue my harvest if it leave thee vainly wait after harvest cease like one who have be mock by title lease to barren field dear one my word deceive thee never heart one summer have they grain ` be sow not

of love quicken and heat it under you gaze then as i have look up in you eye i have sometimes have a flash of consciousness of a transfiguration in the very flesh of my face just as i have a sense of rapturous strength sometimes in the very flesh and bone of my right hand when i strike on the piano some of beethoven 's chord but i know that except in the light of you presence i have no beauty i have not so much to lose by illness as other woman but dear one that little be go i can read in the pity look of all my friend how altered i be even if i do not see it with my own eye i should read it

' oh how firmly i would bind you by it all the weary indifferent or unhappy look love i would blot out from you memory and have the thought of I raise but one picture in you mind i would have it as if i have die and leave of my face no record on earth except one wonderful picture by some great master who have catch the whole beauty of the one rarest moment of my life darling if you look back you will find that moment for it must have be in you arm and let love be the master who will paint the immortal picture as for this thin pale listless body which just now answer to the name of I there be nothing in or about it which you know presently it will be carry like a half-lifeless thing on board a ship the wind will blow roughly on it and it will not care if god will darling i will come back to you well and strong if i can not come well and strong i hope never to come at all do not call I cruel you would feel the same i also should combat the resolve in you as you do in I but in my heart

little if i have see you to say farewell my beloved i should not have kiss you many time as have be we wont that be for hour of joy i should have kiss you three time -- only three time -- on you

darling separate solemn slow not like the swift and joyous one we use to know when we kiss because we love each other simply to taste love 's sweet and lavish we kiss as the summer lavish heat -- but as they kiss whose heart be wring when hope and fear be spend and nothing be leave to give except a sacrament first of the three my darling be sacred unto pain we have hurt each other often we shall again when we pine because we miss each other and do not understand how the write word be so much colder than eye and hand i kiss thee dear for all such pain which we may give or take bury forgive before it come for we love 's sake the second kiss my darling be full of joy 's sweet thrill we have bless each other always we always will we shall reach until we feel each other past all of time and space we shall listen till we hear each other in every place the earth be full of messenger which love send to and fro i kiss thee darling for all joy which we shall know the last kiss oh my darling my love -- i can not see through my tear as i remember what it may be we may die and never see each other die with no time to give any sign that we heart be faithful to die as live token of what they will not see who see we parting breath this one last kiss my darling seal the seal of death it be on my sixteenth birthday that i copy these letter and poem of esther wynn 's i keep they with a few other very precious thing in a curious little inlaid box which come from venice and be so old that in many place its side be worm-eaten it be one of my choicest treasure and i be never separate from it when i be twenty year old i have be for two year a happy wife for one year a glad mother and have for some time remembered esther only in the vague passing way in which happy soul recall old shadow of the grief of other heart as my boy enter on a second summer he begin to droop a little and the physician recommend that we should take he to the sea-side so it come to pass that on the morning of my twentieth birthday i be sit with my baby in my arm on a rocky sea-shore at one of the well-known summer resort of the new hampshire coast near I sit a woman whose face have interested I strangely ever since my arrival she seem a invalid but there be a atmosphere of overflow vitality about she in spite of she feebleness which make she very presence stimulating and cheer to every one i have long to speak with she but as yet have not do so while i sit watch she face and my baby 's and the face of the sea she be join by she husband who have just come from a walk in the field and have bring she a large bouquet of red clover and feathery grass she take it eagerly with great delight and exclaim : -- i wonder what the clover think intimate friend of bob-o-link i could not control the sudden start with which i hear these word who be this that know esther wynn 's verse by heart i could hardly refrain from speak to she at once and betray all but i reflect instantly that i must be very cautious it would be almost impossible to find out what i long to know without reveal how my own acquaintance with the verse have come about day pass before i ventured to allude to the subject but one evening as we be walk together she stoop and pick a clover-blossom and say -- i really think i love red clover better than any wild flower we have i think so say i when i saw you take that big bunch you husband bring you the other morning that be before i know you : i feel almost rude i watch you so in spite of myself but i have watch you quite as much say she smile i think then of give you a part of the clover edward always bring I huge bouquet of it every day he know so well how i love it i hear you quote a little couplet of verse about it then say i look away from she that she might not see my face : i be so near you i could not help hear what you say oh yes say she i wonder what the clover think intimate friend of bob-o-link ' -- i do not know but that old clover-song be the real reason i love clover so my mother teach it to I when i be a little child it be all very quaint and sweet would you like to hear it i feel myself color scarlet but i reply -- oh yes pray repeat it when she have repeat the verse she go on speak to my great relief save I from the necessity of say anything that be write a great many year ago by a aunt of my mother 's my mother have a little manuscript book bind in red morocco very fade and worn which my grandmother keep on she bureau till she die last year and it have in it this little clover-song and several other with aunt esther 's diary while she be abroad she die abroad die in jerusalem and be bury there there be something mysteriously sad in she life i think : grandmother always sigh when she speak of she and use to read in the little red book every day she be only she half-sister but she say she love she better than she do any sister of she own once i ask grandmamma to tell I about she but she say ` there be nothing to tell child she be never marry : she die the autumn before you mother be bear and you mother look very much like she when she be young she be like she too in many way ' and that be all grandmamma would ever say but we always call she aunt esther and know all she verse by heart and the diary be fascinating it seem strange to read such vivid write record of people you never see do not you think so yes it must very say i she go on : i always have a very special love for this old aunt esther which i could hardly account for i be to have the little red book when my mother die and -- she hesitate a moment -- and i name my first baby for she esther wynn the baby only live to be a few week old and i often think as i look at she little grave-stone of the other one so many thousand mile away alone in a strange land bear the same name on my way home i stop for a few day ' visit at uncle jo 's late one night sit in my old place at he foot in the library i tell he this sequel to the romance of the letter oh childie how could you help show that you know about she say he you must have betray it no i be sure i do not i say i never speak about it after that day and she be too absorb herself in the reminiscence to observe my excitement what be you friend 's name say uncle jo i tell he he spring from he chair and walk rapidly away to the end of the library presently he come back and stand before
