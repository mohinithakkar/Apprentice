translation of the edda before appear in book form have be publish in _ l'echo de la littérature et des beaux art _ a periodical edit by the major 's friend m de belenet frye love poetry though he idea on the subject be rather those of the eighteenth century than we own it be interesting to find a english officer reading voltaire gessner ariosto and quote they from memory -lrb- which explain that some of he quotation have to be correct -rrb- the sentimental vein of rousseau 's generation still flow and vibrate in he as when he say that he have never be able to read the letter of wolmar to

follow : agathodemon a philosophical romance translate from the german of wieland by we frye member of the academy deglus arcadus in rome and of the royal society of northern antiquarian of copenhagen ex-major of infantry in he british majesty 's service frye describe with accuracy and show much appreciation of fine scenery and architecture he judgement in painting and sculpture be sincere though often betray the autodidact and amateur he love music especially rossinus 's opera which be then begin they long career of triumph theatricals of all sort especially ballet have a great attraction for he and elicit he enthusiastic comment in compare tragedy and comedy which he have see perform in different country he give repeat proof of he knowledge and critical insight we can take he as a good example of that intelligent class of english traveller whose intercourse with the continental _ litteratus _ have so well contribute to establish the good reputation of british culture and refine appreciation of the art the chief interest of frye 's reminiscence lie however in quite another direction he be a friend of liberty a friend of france a admirer of napoleon and a hater of the tory régime which bring about napoleon 's downfall france 's attempt at european domination in the napoleonic era be graciously describe as but so many effort towards spread the light of civilization over europe these word write about a quite recent work and à propo of the entente cordiale apply perfectly to frye 's reminiscence travel immediately before and after the emperor 's collapse he find that everywhere except in tuscany the french domination be regret because the ideal of liberty and equality have shine and vanish with the tricolor flag he admire the french people though not the _ ultra _ and bigot and have fine word of praise for the french army : yes the french soldier be a fine fellow i have serve against they in holland and in egypt and i will never flinch from render justice to they exemplary conduct and lofty valor he take trouble to refute the exaggerated report which be then circulate all over europe about the cruelty and vandalism practice by the french : if the french since the revolution have not always fight for liberty they have do so invariably for science and wherever they carry they victorious arm abuse be abolish amelioration of all kind follow and the art of life be improve we government since the accession of george iii have never raise its arm except in favor of old abuse to uphold despotism and unfair privilege or to establish commercial monopoly sometimes indeed speak of he own country and its government major frye use very hard word which might seem unpatriotic if we do not know from many other memoirs and letter to what a terrible strain orthodox toryism couple with bigotry and hypocrisy have put the patience of liberal englishman at that period he call the british government the most dangerous artful and determine enemy of all liberty -- england he say have be always ready to lend a hand to crush liberty to perpetuate abuse and to rivet the fetter of monarchical feudal and ecclesiastical tyranny and later on he inveigh against the english merchant who contribute with they gold to uphold the corrupt system of pitt and to carry on unjust unreasonable and liberticide war whatever may be the final judgement of history on the tory principle in politics in the day of the congress of vienna major frye 's love of liberty and intellectual progress entitle he to the sympathy of those who share he generous feeling and do not consider that personal freedom and individual rights be article for home use only since frye write the whole of europe excepting perhaps russium have reap the benefit of the french revolution and reduce if not suppress what the major call kingcraft and priestcraft he do not attempt to divine the future but the history of europe in the nineteenth century have be largely in accordance with he desire and hope it be not a small merit for a writer in the midst of one of the most rabid reaction that the world have know to have cling with such tenacity to ideal the complete victory of which may

promise to give you from time to time the detail of my tour and my reflection on the circumstance that occur at this momentous crisis to I who have spend the greatest part of my life out of europe the whole scene be so new that i be quite bewildered with it and you will i be afraid as i write on the impulse of the moment find my idea at time rather incoherently put together what change have take place in europe within the last two year and how great be those which occur during the interval of my passage from ceylon last year which island i quit about the time that we receive in that part of the world intelligence of the battle of leipsic have have a long passage from distant taprobane it be only on my arrival at the cape of good hope that i learn to my utter astonishment the news of the capitulation of pari to the ally power and of the overthrow of the power and dynasty of napoleon i recollect that at the cape there be great rejoicing and jubilee on this occasion but i confess as to myself i do not see any reason for give vent to this extravagant joy and i must have have even at that time somehow or other a presentiment of what would soon happen as in communicate this intelligence to a friend in indium i make use of these word : get a court dress make my good friend and a big wig ruffle shirt and hair-powder and stick a old-fashioned sword by you side for depend on it old fashion will come into play again the most arbitrary and aristocratic notion will be revive and terrible machination will be frame against the liberty of europe of course at the cape we only hear one side of the question and i begin to be almost convince that it be as necessary for humanity as for the repose of europe that the giant should be put down and i be console when it be effect ostensibly at least by the voice of the people i have scarcely be three month in england when the return of napoleon from elba and the extraordinary dislocation of the bourbon from the throne of france summon europe again to arm the crusade be preach at vienna and behold he grace of wellington appoint the godfrey of the holy league i have reason about six week before the news of this event reach london from some conversation i have with a intelligent friend who have just return from a tour on the continent to suppose that the slightest combination against the bourbon would prove successful from they injudicious conduct and from the temper of the people but i never could have suppose that the return of the man of elba would be hail with such unparalleled and unanimous acclamation as i have long ago wish for a opportunity of visit the continent of europe which have never before occur to I i eagerly embrace the offer make to I by my friend major-general wilson formerly lieut-governor of ceylon -lrb- 1 -rrb- to accompany he on a military tour through the country about to be the theater of war though i have never before visit the continent -lrb- except with the british army in the invasion of holland in 1799 when i begin my military career -rrb- yet i be not wholly unprepared for travel have unite to a classical as well as military education a tolerable knowledge of history and a partial acquirement of the principal modern european language which i have begin to learn when very young and which i keep up during my leisure hour in indium which like those of don quixote be many i prefer this study infinitely to that of the asiatic language for which i never feel any taste as i dislike bombast hyperbole and exaggeration and though a ardent admirer of the muse i never could find pleasure in what voltaire term le bon style oriental ou l'on fait danser les montagnes et les colline and i prefer the amatory effusion of ovid to those of the great king solomon himself the war will no doubt commence in belgium and of course the emperor napoleon will be the assailant for it can not be suppose that after the act of ban pass against he by the amphictyon of vienna he will remain tranquil and not strike the first blow which may render he master of belgium and its resource we embark at ramsgate on the first of may for ostend on board of a small vessel bind thither we fellow passenger be two officer of dragoon several commissary with they servant horse etc after a passage of twenty-four hour we enter the harbor of ostend at one o'clock the follow day ostend once so flourishing and opulent have long since fall into decay its usual dullness be however just now interrupt by the bustle of troops land to join the ally army cavalry infantry artillery horse gun store etc be land every minute the quay be the only part of this city which can boast of handsome building the fortification seem to be much out of repair in fact the aggrandizement of antwerp occasion necessarily the deterioration of ostend the general and myself go to put up at the _ tête d'or _ the only inn where we could procure bed and we embark early next morning at the embouchure of the canal on board of a _ treckschuyt _ which convey we in three hour to bruge the landscape between ostend and bruge be extremely monotonous it be a uniformly flat country yet it be please to the eye at this season of the year from the verdure of the plain which be all appropriate to pasturage and from the appearance of the different village and town of which the eye can embrace a considerable number there be a good road on the bank of the canal and the troops on they line of march enliven much the scene bruge formerly the grand mart and emporium of the commerce of the east not only for the low country but for all the north of europe seem if we may judge from the state of the building and the stillness that prevail to be also in a state of decline we however have only time to visit the _ hotel de ville _ and to remark the immense height of the steeple on the _ grande place _ we observe a number of pretty woman in the street and in the shop employ in lace make bruge have be at all time renown for the beauty of the female sex and this bring to my recollection a passage in schiller 's tragedy of the _ maid of orlean _ wherein the duke of burgundy say that the greatest boast of bruge be the beauty of its woman another _ treckschuyt _ be to start at twelve o'clock for ghent but we prefer go by land and general wilson hire a carriage for that purpose the distance be about thirty mile the road from bruge to ghent or gand be perfectly straight line with tree and pave like a street the country be quite flat and though there be nothing to bind the horizon the tree on each side of the road intercept the view we arrive at ghent about six in the afternoon of the 4th and have some difficulty in find room as the different hotel be fill with officer of the ally army but at length after many ineffectual application at several we obtain admission at the _ hotel de flandre _ where we take possession of a double-bedded room the only one unoccupied gand seem to be a very neat clean and handsome city with a air of magnificence about it the _ grande place _ be very striking and the promenade be align with tree we inspect the exterior of several public building and visit the interior of several church in the cathedral we have the honor of see at high mass he most christian majesty monsieur and the comte de blacas vicomte de chateaubriand and other compose the court of _ notre père de gand _ as loui xviii be humorously term by the french from he have fix he head-quarter here a great many french officer who have follow he fortune be also here but they seem principally to belong to the garde du corps a number of military attend the service in the cathedral in order to witness the devotions of the bourbon family monsieur have all the appearance of a wear out debauchee and to see he with a missal in he hand and the strange contrite face he assume be truly ridiculous these prince instigate no doubt by the priest make a great parade of they sanctity for which however those who be acquaint with they character will not give they much credit but religious cant be the order of the day _ intra et extra iliacos muros _ abroad as well as in england the king of france take the lead have in view no doubt the advice of buckingham to richard iii : a pray ' r book in you hand my lord be well for on that ground i 'll make a holy descant and m de chateaubriand will no doubt trumpet forth the devotion and christian humility of he master those however who be at all acquaint with this prince 's habit and be not interested in palliating or conceal they insinuate that he devotions at the table be more sincere than at the altar and that like the giant margutte in the morgante maggiore of pulcus he place more faith and reliance on a cappone lesso ossium arrosto than on the consecrate but less substantial wafer -lrb- 2 -rrb- after contemplate this edifying spectacle we return to we inn and the next morning after breakfast we set out on we journey to bruxelle the road be exactly similar to that between bruge and gand but the country appear to be richer and more diversified and many country house be observable on the road side we pass thus several neat village at one o'clock we stop at alost to refresh we horse and dine at the table d'hôte be a number of french officer belong to the garde du corps on enter into conversation with one of they i find that he as well as several other of they have serve under napoleon and have even be patronise and promote by he but i suppose that be the son of the ancient _ noblesse _ they think that gratitude to a _ parvenu _ like he be rather too plebeian a virtue some of they however with whom i converse after dinner seem to regret the step they have take if we be successful say they it can only be by means of the ally army and who know what condition they may impose on france if we should be unsuccessful we be exile probably for life from we country during dinner two pretty look girl with musical instrument enter the hall and regale we ear with singing some romance among which be _ dunoi le troubadour _ and _ la sentinelle _ they sing with much taste and feeling i surmise this be not the only profession they exercise if i might judge from the _ doux yeux _ they occasionally direct to some of the officer these girl do not at least seem by they demeanor as if likely to incur the anathema of rinaldo in the _ orlando furioso _ : meritamente muoro una crudele but rather more disposed to dar vita all ` amator fidele -lrb- 3 -rrb- alost be a neat clean town or large village and the same description will serve for all the town and village in brabant and flander as they be build on the same plan we arrive at bruxelle late in the evening and put up at the _ hotel d'angleterre _ this morning the general and myself go to pay we respects to the _ gran capitano _ of the _ holy league _ and we leave we card he be i hear very confident of the result of the campaign and no doubt he have for he the prayer of all the pious in england against those atheistical fellow the french and these prayer will surely elicit a host of angel to come down to aid in the destruction of the pandemonium of pari where satan 's lieutenant sit enthrone the reflect people here be astonish that napoleon do not begin the attack the inhabitant of belgium be in general from all that i can hear or see not at all pleased with the present order of thing and they much lament the be sever from france the two people the belgian and hollander do not seem to amalgamate and the former though they render ample justice to the moderation good sense and beneficent intention of the present monarch who be personally respect by every one yet do not disguise they wish to be reunite to france and do not hesitate to avow they attachment to the emperor napoleon this union do not please the hollander either on other grounds they complain that they interest have be sacrifice entirely to those of the house of orange and they say that from the readiness they display in shake off the yoke of france and the great weight they thereby throw into the scale they be entitle to the restitution of all they colony in asia africa and america the colony of the cape of good hope and ceylon be what they most regret for these colony in particular furnished ample employment and the means of provision for the cadet of patrician family if you tell they they have acquire the belgic province as a indemnification they answer : so much the worse for we for now the patronage of the colonial office must be divide between we and the belgian the preparation for the grand conflict about to take place be carry on with unabating activity the conscription be rigorously enforce and every youth capable of bear arm be enrol almost all the officer of the belgian army and a great proportion of the soldiery have serve with the french and have be participator of they laurel one can not therefore suppose that they be actuate by any very devour zeal against they former commander nor have i find amongst the shop-keeper or respectable people with whom i have converse and who have be falsely represent as have suffer much from the tyranny of napoleon any who dislike either he person or government and certainly none either high or low express the cannibal wish that i hear some english country gentleman and london merchant utter for the destruction of pari and of the french people nor would it be easy to find here man of the _ humane _ and _ generous _ sentiment profess by some of we alderman and contractor when they welcome with ferocious acclamation of joy and be ready to embrace the baschkir or cossack who tell they that he have slaughter so many french with he own hand nor would the lady here be so eager to kiss old blucher as be the case in london this city be fill with british and hanoverian troops they conduct be exemplary nor be any complaint make against they the highland regiment be however the favorite of the bruxelloi and the inhabitant give they the preference as lodger they be extremely well behave -lrb- they say when speaking of the highlander -rrb- and they cheerfully assist the different family on whom they be quarter in they household labor this reflect a good deal of credit on the gallant son of caledonium they superior morality to those of the same class either in england or in ireland must strike every observer and must in spite of all that the _ obscuranten _ or _ chevalier de l'eteignoir _ and other who wish to check the progress of the human mind may urge to the contrary be mainly attribute to the general prevalence of education _ a la portée de tout le monde _ wherever the people be enlighten there be less crime ignorance be never yet the safeguard of virtue as for myself i honor and esteem the scottish nation and i must say that i have find more liberal idea and more sound philosophy among individual of that nation than among those of any other and it be a tribute i owe to they loudly to proclaim my sentiment for though personal gratitude may seem to influence I a little on this subject yet i should never think of put forth my opinion in public be it not found on a impartial observation of the character of this enterprising and persevere people a woman who have some highlander quarter in she house tell I in speaking of they : monsieur ce sont de si bonnes gen ils sont doux comme des agneaux ils n'en seront pas moins des lion a jour du combat be my reply i have amuse myself with visit most of the remarkable object here but you must not expect from I a detail of what you will find in every description book you wish to have my idea on the subject that most strike I individually and those you shall have but it would be very absurd and presumptuous in I to attempt to give a _ catalogue raisonné _ of building and picture and statue or to set up as a connoisseur when i know nothing either of sculpture of architecture or painting nor be i desirous of imitate the young englishman who in write to he father from italy describe so much in detail and so scientifically every production or staple peculiar to the city which he happen to visit that he write like a cheese-monger from parma like a silk mercer from leghorn like a olive and oil merchant from lucca like a picture dealer from florence and like a antiquarian from rome bruxelle may 10 the _ hôtel d'angleterre _ where we be lodge be within four minute walk from the finest part of the city where the parc and royal palace be situate the parc be not large but be tastefully lay out in the dutch style and be the fashionable promenade for the _ beau monde _ of bruxelle the woman without be strikingly handsome have much grace they air manner and dress be perfectly _ à la francaise _ a good café and restaurant be in the center of one of the side and the building on the quadrangle environ the parc which form the palace and other tenement be superb the next place i go to see be the _ hôtel de ville _ and its tower of immense height it be a fine gothic building but that which should be the central entrance be not directly in the center of the edifice so that one wing of it appear considerably larger than the other which give it a awkward and irregular appearance on the place or square as we should call it where the _ hôtel de ville _ stand be hold the fruit and vegetable market and a finer one or more plentifully supply i never behold this _ place _ be interesting to the historian as be the spot where count egmont and hoorn suffer decapitation in the reign of philip ii of spain by order of the duke of alva who witness the execution from a window of one of the house the conduct of these nobleman at the place of execution be so dignified that even the ferocious duke could not avoid wipe he eye harden as he heart be by religious and political fanaticism and though he hold they in abhorrence as rebel and traitor a tear do fall for they down he iron cheek how fortunate for the liberty of holland that william the taciturn do not also fall into the claw of that moloch philip i next visit the museum and picture gallery where i witness the annual exposition of the modern school of paint the specimen i see pleased I much particularly because the subject be well choose from history and the mythology which to I be far more agreeable than the subject of the painting of the old flemish school but i be tell often that i know nothing about painting so i shall make no further remark but content myself with send you a catalogue with the picture mark therein which make most impression on I with respect to the church of brussels those of ste gudule and of the capuchin be the finest and most remarkable in the former be the temptation of adam by the serpent richly carve in wood in figure as large as life group round the pulpit -lrb- 4 -rrb- the _ place du sablon _ be very striking from the space it occupy and on it be a fountain erect by lord bruce -lrb- 5 -rrb- the fountain which be to be meet with in various part of the city be highly ornamental and among they i must not omit to mention a singularly grotesque one which be hold in great veneration by the lower order of the bruxelloi and be by they regard as a sort of palladium to the city it be the figure of a little boy who be at _ peace _ accord to the late lord melville 's -lrb- 6 -rrb- pronunciation of the word and who spout out he water incessantly reckless of decorum and put modesty to the blush what would we vice-hunter say to this he be a sabbath breaker in the bargain and continue he occupation on sunday as well as other day and _ in fine _ he rejoice in the name of _ mannekenpi _ the rampart or rather site of the rampart -lrb- for the fortification of bruxelle no longer exist -rrb- form a agreeable promenade but the favorite resort of all the world at bruxelle in the afternoon be the _ attee verte _ here all class meet here the rich display they equipage and horse and the lower order assemble at the innumerable _ guinguette _ which be to be meet with here in order to play at bowl domino smoke and drink beer of which there be a excellent sort call _ bitterman _ the avenue on each side of the carriage road be occupy by pedestrian and on one side of the road be the canal cover at all time with barge and boat deck with flag and streamer at the cabaret be bench and table in the open air under the tree and here be to be see the artisan the bargeman and the peasant take they afternoon _ délassement _ and group of man woman and child drink beer and smoking these group remind I much of those one see so often in the old flemish picture with this difference that the old costume of the people be almost entirely leave off female minstrel with guitar stroll about singing french romance and collect contribution from this cheerful laughter-loving people the dark walk as it be call near the park be a favorite walk of the upper class in the evening there he grace of wellington be sometimes to be see with a fair lady under he arm he generally dress in plain clothes to the astonishment of all the foreign officer he be say to be as successful in the field of idalium as in those of bellona and the lady whom he honor with he attention suffer not a little in they reputation in the opinion of the _ compères _ and _ commères _ of bruxelle i have only be twice to the theater since i have be here the _ salle de spectacle _ be indifferent but they have a excellent company of comedian the representation be in french i see the _ festin de pierre _ of corneille exceedingly well perform the actor who do the part of don juan and sganarelle be excellent and the scene with m dimanche wherein he demand payment of he bill be admirably give i have also see the _ plaideur _ of racine a very favorite piece of mine every actor play he part most correctly and the scene between the comtesse de pimbeche and chicaneau and l'intimé wherein the latter disguise as a _ baillus _ offer himself to be kick by the former be give in very superior style the scene of the trial of the dog with the oration of petit jean as _ demandeur _ and l'intimé as _ défenseur _ be play with good effect i never recollect have witness a theatrical piece which afford I greater amusement namur may 12 we leave brussels yesterday afternoon and have obtain passport to visit the military post we go to genappe a small village half-way between bruxelle and namur where we bring to for the night at a small but comfortable inn call _ le rous d'espagne _ two battalion of the regiment nassau-usingen be quarter in genappe we arrive at namur this morning at nine o'clock and put up at the _ hôtel d'arenberg _ on the road we stop at a peasant 's house to drink coffee and we be entertain by we hostess with complaint against the prussian who commit as she say all sort of exaction on the peasantry on whom they be quarter not content with exact three meal a day when they be only entitle to two and for which they be bind to give they ration they sell these and appropriate the money to they own use then the demand for brandy and _ schnapps _ be increase but what can be expect from a army whose leader encourage they in all they excess blucher by all account be a vandal and be actuate by a most vindictive spirit the prussian reproach the belgian with be in the french interest how can they expect it to be otherwise they have prosper under french domination and certainly the conduct of the prussian be not calculate to inspire they with any love towards themselves nor veneration for the sovereign who have such all-devouring ally i ask this woman why she do not complain to the officer she answer hélas monsieur c'est inutile on donne toujors la même réponse : ' _ nicht verstehn _ ' for it appear when these complaint be make the prussian officer pretend not to understand french namur be now the head-quarter of marshal blucher who be in the enjoyment of diver _ noms de guerre _ such as marshall vorwärts der alte teufel on the high road about two mile and a half before we reach namur we meet with a party of prussian lancer who be return from a forage excursion they be sing some warlike song or hymn which be singularly impressive it bring to my recollection the description of the rhenish band in the _ lay of the last minstrel _ : who as they move in rugged verse song of teutonic feud rehearse the prussian cavalry seem to be compose of fine-looking young man and i admire the genuine military simplicity of they dress to which might be most aptly apply the word of xenophon when describe the costume of the younger cyrus : -lrb- greek : _ en tae persikae stolae ouden ti hubrsmenae _ -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- in substitute merely the word -lrb- greek : _ prussika _ -rrb- for -lrb- greek : _ persikae _ -rrb- one see in it none of those absurd ornament and meretricious foppery which give to we cavalry officer the appearance of astley 's man -lrb- 8 -rrb- the situation of namur be exceedingly picturesque particularly when view from the height which tower above the town whereon stand the citadel which be demolish by order of joseph ii as be the fortification of all the frontier fortress the present belgian government however mean to reconstruct they and namur in particular the citadel of which from the natural strength of its position be too important a post to be neglect the town itself be situate on the confluent of the sambre and meuse and lie in a valley completely command and protect by the citadel the church be splendid and there be a appearance of opulence in the shop the inhabitant from its be a frontier town be of course much alarm at the approach contest for they will probably suffer from both party we hear at the inn and in the shop which we visit the same complaint against the prussian the country in the environs of this place be exceedingly diversified and it present the first mountain scenery we have yet meet with the bank of the meuse hereabouts present either a abrupt precipice or coteaux cover with vine gently slope to the water 's edge namur be distant thirty-four mile from brussels and there be water conveyance on the meuse from here to liége and maastricht mon may 14 we start yesterday morning at four o'clock from namur the whole road between namur and mon present a fine rich open country abound in wheat but not many tree we stop to breakfast at fleurus at a inn where there be some prussian officer one of they a lieutenant in the 2nd west prussian regiment have the kindness to conduct we to see the field of battle where the french under jourdan defeat the austrian in 1794 it be at a very short distance from the town he explain the position of the two army in a manner perfectly clear and satisfactory to we the prussian officer all seem very eager for the commencement of hostility and they only fear be now that all these mighty preparation will end in nothing viz either that the french people alarm at the magnitude of the preparation against they will compel the emperor napoleon to abdicate or that the ally will grow cool and under the influence of austrium bring about a negotiation which may end in a recognition of the imperial title and dynasty they would compound for a defeat at first provide the war be likely to be prolong in the meantime reinforcement continue to arrive daily for they army we hear but little news of the intention or movement of the other ally it be forbid to enter into political discussion it be difficult to ascertain the true state of affair we continue we journey through charleroy and binch to this place at a small village between binch and mon we be stop by a sentinel at a prussian outpost and we passport demand neither the sentinel however nor the sergeant nor any of the soldier present could read or understand french in which language the passport be draw up but the sergeant tell I that the officer be in a house about a quarter of a mile distant and that he would conduct I thither but that he himself could not presume to let we pass from not know the tenor of we passport i go accordingly with the sergeant to this house there i find the officer command the piquet and several other sit at table carouse with beer and tobacco and nearly invisible from the cloud of smoke which pervade the room i explain to the officer who we be and request he to put on the passport he _ visa _ in the german language so that the non-commissioned officer at the various post through which we might pass would be able to understand it and let we pass without hindrance this he do accordingly and we proceed on we journey we arrive here in the evening and put up at the _ hôtel royal _ we find at charleroy binch and here a number of people employ in repair and reconstruct the fortification man woman and boy be all put in requisition to accelerate this object as it be the intention of the belgian government to put all the frontier fortress in the most complete state of defense on ascend one of the steeple this morning we have a fine view of the surrounding country and of the height of genappe which be close to mon and memorable for the brilliant victory gain by dumouriez over the austrian in 1792 the landscape present a undulating campaign country gentle slope and alternate plain cover with corn as far as the eye can reach and intersperse with village and farmhouse in mon be a very large splendid shop or warehouse of millinery perfumery jewellery etc it be call _ la toilette de vénus _ and be serve by a very pretty girl who i have no doubt from she simpering look and eloquent eye would have no objection to be a sedulous priestess at the altar of the goddess of amathus a battalion of hollander -- a very fine body of man -- march into this place yesterday evening the rest of the garrison be compose of belgian chiefly conscript leuze may 15 yesterday morning we leave mon and proceed to ath to breakfast a multitude of people be employ there also at the fortification the garrison of ath be compose of hanoverian ath remind I of the war of king william iii and my uncle toby 's siege -lrb- 9 -rrb- there be so little remarkable to be see at ath that we proceed to this place shortly after breakfast and arrive at one o'clock it be only ten mile distance between ath and leuze we take up we quarter with major-general adam who command the light brigade of general sir h clinton 's division this brigade be quarter here and in the adjacent farmhouse general adam though he have attain he rank at a very early age be far more fit for it than many of we older general some of whom -lrb- i speak from experience -rrb- have few idea beyond the fix of a button or lappel or polish a belt and who place the whole _ ar recondita _ of military discipline in pipe-clay heel-ball and the goose step fortunately for this army the duke of wellington have too much good sense to be a martinet and the good old time be go by thank god when a soldier use to be sentence to two or three hundred lash for have a dirty belt or be without a _ queue _ to the duke of york also be humanity much indebted for he endeavor to check the frequency of corporal punishment the duke of york with all he zeal for the service never lose sight of the comfort of the soldier and be indefatigable in he exertion to ameliorate he condition we have a pleasant dinner party at general adam 's and at night i go to sleep at the house occupy by captain c one of the aide-de-camp of the general -lrb- 10 -rrb- a active intelligent officer who have formerly serve in the marine which service he have quit in order to enter the regular army may 16 yesterday morning we pay a visit to tournay which be distant from leuze about ten mile and we breakfast at the _ signe d'or _ we then proceed to pay we respects to the commandant general v -lrb- 11 -rrb- the garrison consist of belgian general v have be some time in england as a prisoner of war he be make prisoner i think he say at batavium he receive we very politely and not only give we permission to visit the work of the citadel but send a sergeant to accompany we the new citadel be build on the site of the old one and like it be to be a regular pentagon the fortification of the city itself be not to be reconstruct these of the citadel which will be very strong render they superfluous the sergeant be a native of würtemberg and have serve in the army of he own country and in that of france in most of the campaign under napoleon he be a fine old veteran and very intelligent for he explain to we the nature of the work with great perspicuity with true suabian dignity he refuse a five franc piece which i offer he as a slight remuneration for the trouble he have take and as he seem i think rather offend at the offer i feel myself bind to apologize from the number of workman employ in repair the citadel it will not be long before it be place in a respectable state of defense tournay be a large handsome city and the spacious quai on the bank of the scheld which run through it add much to the neatness of its appearance it be only ten mile distant from lille but all communication from france be stop we learn that some of the hanoverian have be desert in return we meet with a young french hussar who have come over to the ally he seem to be a impudent sort of fellow and say with the utmost _ sang-froid _ that the reason he desert be that he have not be make a officer as he be promise and he hope that loui xviii would be more sensible of he merit than the emperor napoleon we return to leuze to dinner in the afternoon this morning we go to assist at a review of general clinton 's division on a plain call _ le paturage _ about seven mile distant from leuze the light brigade and the hanoverian brigade form this division the maneuver be perform with tolerable precision but they be chiefly confine to advance in line retire by alternate company cover by light infantry and change of position on one of the flank by _ échelon _ the british troops be perfect the hanoverian not so they be for the most part new levy in one of the _ échelon _ movement when the line be to be form on the left company of the left battalion a hanoverian battalion instead of preserve its parallelism be make a terrible diversion to its right when a thundering voice from the commander of the brigade to the commandant of the battalion : _ mein gott herr major will gehn sie hin _ rouse he from he reverie when he must have perceive have he wheel up into line the fearful interval he have leave between he own and the next battalion on the leave after the review have finish we repair to the château of the prince de ligne then occupy by lieut-general sir h clinton to partake of a breakfast give by he and he lady on the break up of the breakfast party general wilson and myself remain at the château to dine with general adam _ al fresco _ in the garden under the tree the palace and garden of the prince de ligne be both very magnificent the latter be of great extent but too regular too much in the dutch taste to please I little or no furniture be in the palace but there be some family picture and a theater fit up in one of the hall for the purpose of private theatricals in the garden be a monument erect by the late prince de ligne to one of he son charle by name who be kill in the russian service at the siege of ismail the present prince be a minor and reside at bruxelle grammont may 18 we leave leuze yesterday afternoon and arrive here at seven in the evening in order to be present at the cavalry review the next morning we partake of a elegant supper give to we by we friend major grant of the 18th hussar and we be much entertain and enliven by the effusion of he brilliant genius and inexhaustible wit the whole cavalry of the british army pass in review this morning before the duke of wellington who be there with all he staff and receive the salute of all the corps like godfrey _ con volto placido e composto _ it be a very brilliant spectacle the duke de berri be present i think i never behold so ignoble and disagreeable a countenance as this prince possess i think to myself that he have much better have stay away from this review for he must be insensible to all patriotism who could take pleasure in contemplate a foreign force about to enter and ravage he own country we learn that the duchess d'angoulême be to have a review of the _ fidèles _ very shortly she be certainly much more warlike than the male of that family this disposition be increase by she religious fanaticism this render she of course a most dangerous person to meddle with politics but great allowance must be make for she feeling which must naturally be embittered by the recollection of so much suffering during the revolution and of the barbarous and inhuman treatment experience by she father and mother i observe a peculiarity in this part of the country viz that there be village lie close to each other in some of which french be speak in other flemish and that with some few exception the inhabitant of neighbouring village be reciprocally unintelligible general wilson do not intend to return to bruxelle i shall accompany he as far as gand and then return to bruxelle to await the issue of the contest bruxelle June 11 i take leave of general wilson at gand on the 22nd of last month and immediately return here where i have be ever since i have shift my quarter to a less expensive hotel and be now lodge at the _ hôtel de la paix _ we get a excellent dinner at the table d'hôte for one and a half franc wine not include this be pay for extra and be generally at the price of three franc per bottle this hotel be very neatly fit up and be very near the _ hôtel de ville _ at the table d'hôte i frequently meet prussian officer who on come in to visit bruxelle put up here we have just learn the proceedings of the _ champ de mai _ at pari by which it appear that napoleon be solemnly recognize and confirm as emperor of the french this intelligence send a young prussian officer who sit next to I in a transport of joy for this make the war certain the prussian seem determine to revenge themselves for the humiliation they suffer from the french during the time they occupy they country and i sincerely pity by anticipation the fate of the french peasant upon whom these gentleman may chance to be quarter terrible will be the first shock of battle and it may be daily expect and dreadful will be the consequence to the poor inhabitant of the seat of war can not this war be avoid i be not politician enough to foresee the consequence of allow napoleon to keep quiet and undisturbed possession of the throne of france but the consequence of a defeat on the part of the ally will be the loss of belgium and the probable annihilation of the british army certainly the dissolution of the coalition for the minor german power and very likely austrium also would be induce to make a separate peace we can clearly see that napoleon have not now the power he formerly possess and that the republican party into whose hand he have throw himself seem disposed not only to remain at peace but to shackle he in every possible manner it be evident too that he last success be owe to the dislike of the people to the bourbon from they injudicious and treacherous conduct and the threat and impossible language hold by the priest and emigrant towards the holder of property pave the way for the success of he enterprise and enable he to achieve a triumph unparalleled in history on the contrary by force he to go to war should he gain the first victory belgium will be re-unite to france all the resource of that country bring into the scale against the ally napoleon will be more popular than ever the republican party will be put to silence the enthusiasm of the army will rise beyond all restraint and in a word napoleon will be himself again the other ally can do little without the assistance of england and we finances be by no means in a state to bear such intolerable drain as to the prussian on minute enquiry i do not find that they be so ill-treated by the french as be generally believe and that except the burden of have troops quarter on they -lrb- no small annoyance i allow -rrb- they have not much reason to complain the quartering of the troops on they and the payment of the war contribution be the necessary consequence of the occupation of they country by a enemy but i have just be read a german work write by a native of berlin shortly after the entry of the french troops in that city after the battle of jena in 1806 this work be entitle _ vertraute briefe aus berlin _ and in it the author distinctly declare that the discipline observe by the french troops during the occupation of berlin be highly strict and praiseworthy and that the few excess that take place be commit by the troops of the rhenish confederation and he add that the inhabitant prefer have a french soldier quarter on they to a westphalian bavarian or würtembergher further the troops that behave with the greatest oppression and insolence towards the burgher be those belong to a corps compose of native prussian raise for the service of napoleon by the prince of isenburg -lrb- 12 -rrb- in he recruit address the prince invite the prussian youth to enter into the service of the invincible napoleon and tell he that to the soldier of napoleon everything be permit the regiment be soon fit up and the soldier begin to put in practice in good earnest the theory of the _ affiche _ they commit excess of all sort and one officer in particular behave so brutally and infamously to a poor tailor on whom he be quarter and to whom before he enter the french service he be under the greatest obligation that general hulin the commandant of the place at berlin during the french occupation be oblige to cashier he publicly on the parade and to cause he epaulette to be tear from he coat in order to mark the disgust and indignation that he and all the french officer feel at the base ingratitude of this man this work vertraute briefe -lrb- confidential letter -rrb- contain much curious matter and very interesting anecdote respect the corruption venality and depravation that prevail in the prussian court and army previous to the war in 1806 let this suffice to show that the prussian have not so much reason to complain against the french as they pretend to have besides the conduct of the prussian government itself be so vacillate and contradictory that they have themselves only to blame for what they suffer they should have support austrium in 1805 but the fact be that the vanity and the _ amour propre _ of the prussian military be so hurt at the humiliation they experience at and after the battle of jena that it be this that have embittered they so much against the french let it not however be suppose for a moment that i seek to excuse or palliate the conduct of napoleon towards prussium i have always think it not only unjust but impolitic impolitic because prussium be and ought always to be the obvious and natural ally of france and napoleon instead of endeavor to crush that power should have aggrandize she and make she the paramount power in germany it be in fact he obvious policy to cede hanover in perpetuity to prussium and have render thereby the breach between the house of brandenburgh and hanover irreparable and irreconcilable this would have throw prussium necessarily into the arm of france in whose system she must then have move and all british influence on the continent would have be effectually put a end to another prime fault of napoleon be that he do not crush and dismember austrium in 1809 as he have it in he power to do and by so do he would have merit and obtain the thanks and good will of all germany for have overturn so despotic and light-fearing a government but he have pay dearly for these error instead of destroy a despotic power -lrb- austrium -rrb- he choose rather to crush a enlighten and liberal nation for such i esteem the prussian nation and i always separate the prussian people from they government the latter fell and fall unpitied after one battle but it have be almost miraculously restore by the unparalleled exertion and energy of the burgher and people may this be a lesson to the government and may the king of prussium not prove ungrateful troops continue to arrive here daily and now that the ceremony of the _ champ de mai _ be over we may expect that napoleon will repair to he army and commence operation June 17 napoleon arrive at maubeuge on the 18th and the grand conflict have begin the prussian be attack on the 14th and 15th at ligny and drive from they position -lrb- 13 -rrb- they be say to have suffer immense loss and to be retreat with the utmost confusion we turn come next the thunder of the cannon be hear here distinctly the most part of yesterday and some part of we army must have be engage we troops have all march out of bruxelle in the direction of the frontier in the affair with the prussian we learn that the duke of brunswick be kill and that blucher narrowly escape be make prisoner June 18 the grand conflict have begin with we it be now four o'clock pm the issue be not know the roar of the cannon continue unabated all be bustle confusion and uncertainty in this city car with wound be come in continually the general opinion be that we army will be compel to retreat to antwerp and it be even expect that the french will be in bruxelle to-night all the towns-people be on the rampart listen to the sound of the cannon this city have be in the greatest alarm and agitation since the 16th when a violent cannonade be hear during the afternoon from what i have be able to collect the french attack the prussian on the 14th and a desperate conflict take place on that day and the whole of the 15th -lrb- 14 -rrb- when the whole of the prussian army at ligny fleurus and charleroy be totally defeat and drive from its position a dislocation of we troops take place early in the morning of the 16th and we advanced guard consist of the highland brigade and two battalion of nassau-usingen fall in with the advanced guard of the french army command by marshal ney near quatre-bra and make such a gallant defense against he corps d'armée as to keep it in check the whole day and enable itself to fall back in good order to its present position with the rest of the army about ten mile in front of bruxelle indeed i be inform that nothing could exceed the admirable conduct of the corps above mention yesterday we hear no cannonade but this afternoon it have be unceasing and still continue all the caricature and satire against napoleon have disappear from the window and stall the shop be all shut the english family fly to antwerp and the proclamation of the baron de capellen -lrb- 15 -rrb- to the inhabitant wherein he exhort they to be tranquil and assure they that the bureau of government have not yet quit bruxelle only serve to increase the confusion and consternation the inhabitant in general wish well to the arm of napoleon but they know that the retreat of the english army must necessarily take place through they town that we troops will perhaps endeavor to make a stand and that the consequence will be terrible to the inhabitant from the house be liable to be burn or pillage by friend or foe all the baggage of we army and all the military bureau have receive order to repair and be now on they march to antwerp and the road thither be so covered and block up by waggon that the retreat of we army will be much impeded thereby probably my next letter may be date from a french prison bruxelle June 21 judge my friend of my astonishment and that of almost everybody in this city at the news which be circulate here early on the morning of the 19th and have be daily confirm viz that the french army have be completely defeat and be in full flight leave behind it 220 piece of cannon and all its baggage waggon and _ munitions de guerre _ i have not be able to collect all the particulars but you will no doubt hear enough of it for i be sure it will be _ say _ or _ sing _ by all the partisan of the british ministry and all the tory of the unite kingdom for month and year to come for further detail therefore i shall refer you to the gazette the follow however you may consider as a tolerably fair précis of what take place the attack begin on the 18th about ten o'clock -lrb- 16 -rrb- and rage furiously along the whole line but principally at hougoumont a large _ métairie _ on the right of we position which be occupy by we troops and from which all the effort of the enemy could not dislodge they the slaughter be terrible in this quarter from twelve o'clock till evening several desperate charge of cavalry and infantry be make on the rest of we line both side fight with the utmost courage and obstinacy and be prodigal of life in the extreme but it be generally suppose that we army must have succumb towards the evening have it not be for the arrival of bulow 's division of prussian follow closely by blucher and the rest of the army which have rally with uncommon celerity these move on the right flank of the french and decide the fortune of the day by a charge which be second by a general charge from the whole of the english line on the center and left of the french see themselves thus turn a panic it be say spread among the young guard of the french army and a cry of _ sauve qui peut nous sommes trahis _ spread like wildfire the flight become universal the old guard alone remain refuse quarter and perish like leonida and he spartan the prussian cavalry be fresh pursue the enemy all night _ l'épée dan les rein _ and it may be conceive from they previous disposition that they would not be very merciful to the vanquish indeed on the 15th it be say that the french be not very merciful to they it be like the combat of achille and hector no thought but rage and never cease strife till death extinguish rage and thought and life france will now call out to napoleon as augustus do to varus give I back my legion the loss on both side be very great but it must have be prodigious on the side of the french the whole ally army be in full pursuit several friend and acquaintance of mine perish in this battle viz lieut-general sir t picton colonel sir h elli and colonel morice June 22 this morning i go to visit the field of battle which be a little beyond the village of waterloo on the plateau of mont st jean but on arrival there the sight be too horrible to behold i feel sick in the stomach and be oblige to return the multitude of carcase the heap of wounded man with mangled limb unable to move and perish from not have they wound dress or from hunger as the ally be of course oblige to take they surgeon and waggon with they form a spectacle i shall never forget the wound both of the ally and the french remain in a equally deplorable state at hougoumont where there be a orchard every tree be pierce with bullet the barn be all burn down and in the court-yard it be say they have be oblige to burn upward of a thousand carcase a awful holocaust to the war-demon as nothing be more distressing than the sight of human misery when we be unable to silence it i return as speedily as possible to bruxelle with cowper 's line in my head : war be a game which be they subject wise king should not play at i hope this battle will at any rate lead to a speedy peace June 28 we have no other news from the ally army except that they be move forward with all possible celerity in the direction of paris you may form a guess of the slaughter and of the misery that the wound must have suffer and the many that must have perish from hunger and thirst when i tell you that all the carriage in bruxelle even elegant private equipage landaulet barouche and berline have be put in requisition to remove the wound man from the field of battle to the hospital and that they be yet far from be all bring in the medical practitioner of the city have be put in requisition and be order to make domiciliary visit at every house -lrb- for each habitation have three or four soldier in it -rrb- in order to dress the wound of the patient the bruxelloi the woman in particular have testify the utmost humanity towards the poor sufferer it be suggest by some humane person that they who go to see the field of battle from motive of curiosity would do well to take with they bread wine and other refreshment to distribute among the wound and most people do so for my part i shall not go a second time napoleon it be say narrowly escape be take he carriage fall into the hand of the ally and

morning at twelve o'clock i experienced considerable difficulty in procure a passport to quit bruxelle my name have be include in that of general wilson which he carry back with he to england we ambassador be absent and i be bandy about from bureau to bureau without success so that i begin at last to think that i should be necessitate to remain at bruxelle all my life when fortunately it occur to mr l that he be intimately acquaint with the english consul and he kindly undertake to procure I one and succeed on arrival here we put up at the _ pommelette d'or _ the price of a place in the diligence from bruxelle to liége be fifteen frank we pass thro ' louvain but too late to see anything the country about liége be extremely striking and picturesque the river meuse flow thro ' the city and the bank of the river outside the town be very _ riant _ and agreeable liége be a large well-built city but rather gloomy as to its appearance and lie in a hollow completely surround by lofty hill the remains of its ancient citadel stand on a height which completely command the city on another height stand a monastery a magnificent building there be a great many coal-pit in the vicinity of liége and a great commerce of coal be carry on between this city and holland by the _ treckschuyte _ on the meuse we visit the ancient episcopal palace and the church the palace be completely dismantle this city suffer much during the revolt of the belgian province against the emperor joseph ii and have distinguish itself by the obstinacy of its defense it be treat with great rigor by the austrian government the fortification be blow up and nothing now remain on the site of the old citadel but a large barrack i remain two whole hour on this height to contemplate the beauty of the expanse below the bank of the river which meander much in these part and the numerous _ maisons de campagne _ with the public promenade and allées line with tree exhilarate the scene of the environs for the city itself be dull enough several pretty villa be situate also on the height and be i to dwell here i should choose one of they and seldom descend into the valley and city below where narrow care and strife and envy dwell liége however sombre in its appearance be a place of much opulence and commerce a belgian garrison do duty here at the inn after dinner i fall into conversation with a belgian priest and as i be dress in black he fancy i be one of the cloth and he ask I if i be a belgian for that i speak french with a belgian accent apparemment monsieur est ecclésiastique -- monsieur je suis né anglais et protestant he then begin to talk about and declaim against the french revolution for that be the doctrine now constantly din into the ear of all those who take order and he conclude by say that thing would never go on well in europe until they restore to god the thing they have take from he i tell he that i differ from he very much for that the sale of the church domain and of the land and fund belong to the suppress ecclesiastical establishment have contribute much to the improvement of agriculture and to the comfort of the peasantry whose situation be thereby much ameliorate and that they be now in a state of affluence compare with what they be before the french revolution i add : enfin monsieur dieu n ' a pas besoin des chose terrestre on my say this he do not chuse to continue the conversation but call for a bottle of wine drink it all himself with the zest of a tartuffe i believe that he be surprise to find that a englishman should not coincide with he sentiment for i observe all the adherent of the ancient régime of feudality and superstition have a idea that we be anxious for the re-establishment of all those abuse as they themselves be and it must be confess that the conduct of we government have be such as to authorize they fully in form such conjecture and that we shall be they staunch auxiliary in endeavor to arrest and retrograde the progress of the human mind in fact i soon perceive that my friend be not overload with wit and that he be one of those priest so well describe by metastasio : il di cui sapere sta nel nostro ignorar maastricht 27th June this morning after a promenade on the bank of the meuse -- for i be fond of river and wood -lrb- _ flumina amo silvasque inglorius _ -rrb- -- we embark on a _ treckschuyt _ and arrive here after a passage of four hour the scenery on the bank of the meuse all the way from liége to maastricht be highly diversify and extremely romantic but here at maastricht this cease and the dull uniformity of the dutch landscape begin when on the rampart of the city to the north and west a immense plain as far as the eye can reach present itself to view a few tree and sandhill form the only relief to the picture the town itself be neat clean and dull like all dutch town the fortification be strong and well worth inspection the most remarkable thing in the neighborhood of maastricht be the montagne de st pierre which from have be much excavate for the purpose of procure stone form a labyrinth of a most intricate nature i advise every traveller to visit it and if he have a classical imagination he may fancy himself in the labyrinth of crete aix-la-chapelle 29th June we start in the morning of the 28th from maastricht in the diligence for aix-la-chapelle and arrive here at twelve o'clock put up at van gülpen 's hotel _ zum pfälzischen hofe _ -lrb- à la cour palatine -rrb- which i recommend as a excellent inn and the host as very good people the price of we journey from liége to maastricht in the water-diligence be 2-1\/2 frank and from maastricht to aix-la-chapelle by land be 7 frank the person the road from maastricht to this place be not very good but the country at a short distance from maastricht become picturesque much diversify by hill and dale and well wood as the meuse form the boundary between the belgic and prussian territory we enter the latter sooner after leave maastricht i find my friend l a most agreeable travel companion travel seem to be he passion as it be mine and fortune have so far favor I in this particular that my professional duty and private affair have lead I to visit the four quarter of the globe after dinner on the first day of we arrival here we go to visit the _ hôtel de ville _ before which stand on a pedestal in a bason a ancient bronze statue of charlemagne it have nothing to recommend it but its antiquity the _ hôtel de ville _ be similar to other gothic building use for the same purpose in the great hall thereof there be a large picture represent the ambassador of all the power who assist at the signing of the treaty of aix-la-chapelle in 1742 and a full length portrait of the present king of prussium as master of the city occupy the place where once stand that of napoleon its late lord we next go to see the cathedral and sit down on the throne on which the german caesar use to be crown we view likewise the various costly article of plate the gift of pious prince the most remarkable thing among they be several superb dress of gold and silver embroidery so thickly lay on that they be of exceed weight these dress form part of the wardrobe of the virgin mary next to be see be a case or chest of massy silver adorn with innumerable precious stone of great value which case contain the bone or ash of charlemagne he right arm bone be however preserved separate in a glass case the sword of this prince too and the imperial crown be to be see here the sacristan next proceed to show to we the other relic but have begin with the exhibition of a rag dip in the sweat of jesus christ and a nail of the holy cross we begin to think we have see enough and go away perfectly satisfied there be no other monument in honor of charlemagne but a plain stone on the floor of the church with the simple inscription carolo magno on go out of the city thro ' one of the gate and at a short distance from it we ascend the mountain or rather hill call the louisberg on which be build a ridotto and café as also a column erect in honor of napoleon with a suitable inscription the inscription be efface and be about to be replace by another in the german language in commemoration of the downfall of the _ tyrant _ as the coalition be pleased to call he this tyrant be however extremely regret by the inhabitant of aix-la-chapelle and not without reason for he be a great benefactor to they and continually embellish the city confirm and increase its privilege the inhabitant be not at all pleased with they new master for the behavior of the prussian military have be so insulting and overbearing towards the burgher and student that it be i be tell a common exclamation among the latter allude to the prussian have stile themselves they deliverer : _ de nostris liberatoribus domine libera no _ indeed i can evidently discern that they be not particularly pleased at the result of the battle of waterloo in the evening i go to the theater which have the most inconvenient form imaginable be a rectangle as anti-gallicanism be the order of the day only german drama be allow to be perform and this night it be the tragedy of faust or dr faustus as we term he in england not the faust of goethe which be not mean for nor at all adapt to the stage but a drama of that name write by klingmann -lrb- 18 -rrb- it be a strange wild piece quite in the german style and full of horror and diablery in this piece the sublime and terrible border close on the ridiculous for instance the devil and faust come to drink in a beer-schenk or ale-house ` tis true the devil be incognito at the time and be call der fremde or the stranger it be only towards the conclusion of the piece that he discover himself to be satan the actor who play the part of the stranger have something in he physiognomy very terrific and awe-inspiring in another scene which to we would appear laughable and absurd but which please a german audience three woman in mask come on the stage to meet faust in a churchyard and on unmask display three skeleton head poor faust have stipulate to give he soul to the devil for aid he in the attainment of he desire the devil on he part agree to allow he to commit four deadly sin before he shall call on he to fulfil he contract faust in the sequel kill he wife and he father-in-law satan then claim he faust plead in arrest of judgement that he have only committed two crime out of the four for which he have agree and that there consequently remain two other for he to commit before he could be claim the devil in rejoinder inform he that he wife be with child at the time he kill she which constitute the third crime and that the very act of make a contract with the devil for he soul form the fourth faust overwhelm with confusion have not a word to say and satan seize he by the hair of he head carry he off in triumph this piece be write in iambic of ten syllable and the versification appear to I correct and harmonious and the sentiment forcible and poetical this fully compensate for the bizarrerie of the story itself which by the bye with all the reproach throw by the adherent of the classic taste on those of the romantic be scarcely more _ outré _ than the introduction of death -lrb- -lrb- greek : _ thanato _ -rrb- -rrb- as a dramatic personage in the _ alcesti _ of euripide there be at aix-la-chapelle at one of the hotel a faro bank it be open like the gate of hell _ nocte atque die _ and gaming go forward without intermission this seem indeed to be the only occupation of the stranger who visit these bath there be near this hotel a sort of place or quadrangle with arcade under which be shop and stall at one of these shop i meet with the most beautiful girl i ever behold a tyrolese by birth and the daughter of a print-seller she be from the italian tyrol roveredo i think she say be she birthplace she unite much grace and manner with she beauty on account of which i could not avoid compliment she in she native tongue which she seem pleased to hear she eye and eyebrow bring to my recollection the description of those of alcina : sotto due negrus e sottilissimi archi son due nerus occhus anzus due chiarus solo pietosi a riguardare a mover parchus intorno a cuus par che amor scherzo e volí -lrb- 19 -rrb- two black and slender arch rise above two clear black eye say sun of radiant light which ever softly beam and slowly move round these appear to sport in frolic flight hence scatter all he shaft the little love -- _ trans _ w rise we then proceed to look at the suburb of this city call bortscheid by far the finest part of the city and at some elevation above it it command a extensive view we also visit the various bath establishment the taste of the water have some resemblance to that of harrogate and be good in bilious scrofulous and cutaneous complaint on we return to the hotel we learn the news of the capitulation of pari to the ally power it be say to be purely a military convention by which the french army be to evacuate pari and retire behind the loire there be no talk and no other intelligence about napoleon except that he have be compel by the two house of legislature to abdicate the throne we be still in the dark as to the intention of the ally i regret much that my friend and fellow traveller l be oblige to return to bruxelle and can not accompany I to cologne to which place i be impatient to go and to pay my respects to old father rhine so renowned in history cologne i leave aix-la-chapelle on the morning of the 2nd of July and arrive at cologne about six o'clock in the evening put up at the inn _ zum heiligen geist _ -lrb- holy ghost -rrb- which be situate on the bank of the river the price of the journey in the diligence be 18 frank on the road hither lie julier a large and strongly fortify town surround by a marsh it must be very important as a military post the road after quit julier run for the most part thro ' a forest and have be much improve and enlarged by the french before they improve it it be almost impassable in wet weather we meet on the road several prussian waggon and reinforcement on they march to bruxelle two of my fellow traveller in the diligence be very intelligent young man belong to respectable family in cologne and be return thither they likewise complain much of the overbearing demeanor of the prussian military towards the burgher cologne be a large but very dull look city as dull as liége it would seem as if all town and city under ecclesiastical domination be dull or render so by the prohibition of the most innocent amusement the fortification be out of repair but the prussian government intend to make cologne a place of great strength the name of the village on the opposite of the river be deutz and in the time of the french occupation there be a _ tête-de-pont _ the next morning i be oblige to appear before the police and afterwards before the _ commandant de la place _ in order to have my passport examine and _ visé _ at the bureau of the police it be remark to I that my passport be not _ en règle _ the feature of the bearer not be therein specify i reply that it be not my fault that it be give to I in that shape by the english consul at bruxelle and that it be not my province to give to the consul any direction as to its form and tenor the commissary of police then ask I what business i be about in travel and the follow conversation take place : be haben sie für geschäfte -- keine ich reise nur um vergnügen 's willen -- sonderbar -- worin liegt da sonderbare dass man reist um ein schönes land zu sehen -lrb- 20 -rrb- -- he make no answer to this but one of he coadjutor stand by he say in a loud whisper ein herumreiser which mean a adventurer or person who travel about for no good -- in a word a suspicious character i then say with the utmost calm and indifference : gentleman as soon as you shall have finish all you commentary on the subject of my passport pray be so good as to inform I what i be to do whether i may go on to mayence and frankfort as be my intention or return to bruxelle the commissary after a slight hesitation sign the _ visa _ and i then carry it to the bureau of the commandant whose secretary sign it without hesitation merely ask I if i be a military man in the afternoon i go to visit the dome or cathedral it be a fine specimen of gothic architecture but singular enough the steeple be not yet finish in this cathedral the most remarkable thing be the chapel of the three king wherein be deposit a massy gold chest inlay with precious stone of all sort and of great value contain the bone of the identical three king -lrb- it be say -rrb- who come from the east to worship the infant jesus at bethlehem the scripture say it be three wise man or magi the legend however call they king and give they gothic name let schoolman and theologian reconcile this difference : _ ce n'est point notre affaire _ to I it appear that when the german tribe embrace christianity and enrol themselves under the banner of st peter it be think but fair to allow they to give vent to a little nationality and to blend they old tradition with the new-fangled doctrine and no doubt the sovereign pontiff think that the people could never be make to believe too much the same policy be practice by the jesuit missionary in china where in order to flatter the national vanity and bend it to they purpose they represent jesus christ as be a great personal friend and correspondent of confucius to return to these monarch wise man or magus : they _ scull _ be keep separate to the rest of the bone and each _ scull _ bear a crown of gold but if you be fond of miracle legend and detail of relic come with I to the church of st ursulum in this city and see the proof positive of the miraculous legend of the eleven thousand virgin who suffer martyrdom in this city in the time of attilum the bone of all of whom be carefully preserve here and adorn the interior wall of the church in the guise of arm arrange in a armoury eleven thousand scull each bear a golden or gilt crown grin horribly on the spectator from the upper part of the interior wall of the church where they be place in a row what a fine subject this would make for a ballad in the style of bürger to suppose that on a particular night in the year at the midnight hour when mortal in slumber be bind the bone all descend from the wall where they be arrange form themselves into body clap on they head and dance a skeleton dance round the ghost of attilum the people of cologne in the time of the ecclesiastical electorate have the reputation of be extremely superstitious and no doubt there be many who implicitly believe this pious tale indeed who could refuse they assent to its authenticity on behold the proof positive in the scull and bone i recollect that in the history of the compère mathiew -lrb- 21 -rrb- the père jean rate mightily the native of cologne for they bigotry and superstition and for the bad reception they give to he and to he philosophy that people be happier from a blind belief as some pretend appear to I extremely problematical for my part under no circumstance can i think bliss to consist in ignorance nor have i feel any particular discomfort in have learn at a very early age to put under my foot as lucretius express it the _ strepitum acheronti avarus _ on the contrary it have make I a perfect cosmopolitan extinguish all absurd national and religious prejudice and render I at home wherever i travel and i meet the catholic the lutheran the moslem the jew the hindou and the guebre as a brother _ quo I cunque ferat tempesta deferor hospe _ -lrb- 22 -rrb- let I add one word more to obviate any misrepresentation of my sentiment from some malignant pharisee that tho ' i be no friend to king-craft and priest-craft and can not endure that religion should ever be blended with politics yet i be a great admirer of the beautiful and consoling philosophy or theosophy of jesus christ which inculcate the equality of mankind and represent the creator of the universe the author of all be as the universal father of the human race cologne derive its name from _ colonia _ as it be a roman colony plant here to protect the left bank of the rhine from the incursion of the german horde it be here that the grand and original manufactory of the far-famed _ eau de cologne _ be to be see the _ eau de cologne _ be a sovereign remedy for all kind of disorder and if the _ affich _ of the proprietor jean-marie farina be worthy of credit he be as formidable a check to old pluto as ever aesculapius be the sale of this water be immense on my return to the inn i meet with a dutch clergyman who be travel with he pupil three very fine boy the son of a dutch lady of rank he be to conduct they to the university of neuwied on the right bank of the rhine in order to place they there for they education the young man seem to have profit much from they study they tutor seem to be a well-informed man and of liberal idea he prefer speak german to french as he say he have not much facility in express himself in the latter language he say if i be go he way he would be happy to have the pleasure of my company to which i very willingly accede and we agree to start the next morning early so as to arrive at bonn to breakfast and then to go on to godesberg where he propose to remain

terrible awe-inspiring name such as drachenfel löwenberg the highest of they be call drachenfel or the rock of dragon and on it stand the burg or chateau of a feudal count or _ raubgraf _ who be the terror of the surrounding country and have give rise to a very interesting romance call _ the knight of the seven mountain _ this feudal tyrant use to commit all sort of depredation and descend into the plain below in order to intercept the convoy of merchandize passing between aix-la-chapelle and frankfort it be to check these abuse and oppression that be institute the famous secret tribunal _

espionage as to give to they proceedings a appearance of supernatural agency a simple accusation be sufficient for they to act upon provide the accuser solemnly swear to the truth of it without reserve and consent to undergo the same punishment as the accuse be subject to in case the accusation should be false till this solemnity be go through no pursuit be institute against the offender

tale of he however be entirely free from this defect and be found on a fact it be call _ dankbarkeit und liebe _ -lrb- gratitude and love -rrb- there be more real pathos in this novelette than in the

who do not chuse to have so formidable a neighbor so close to they frontier as the rhine then be the prussian government however to whom it now belong seem too fully aware of its importance not to

coblentz where there be a elegant stone bridge across the moselle troops without intermission continue to pass over the fly bridge bind to france from the different german state viz saxon hessian prussian etc so that one might apply to this scene anna comnena 's expression relative to the crusade and say that all germany be tear up from its foundation and precipitated upon france i suppose no less than 70000 man have pass within these few day the german papers particularly the _ rheinische mercur _ continue to fulminate against france and the war yell resound with as much fury as ever from the number of troops that continue to pass it would seem as if the ally do not mean to content themselves with the abdication of napoleon but will endeavor to dismember france the prussian officer seem to speak very confidently that alsace and lorraine will be sever from france and reunite to the germanic body to which they say every country ought to belong where the german language be speak

with the jacobin and the brissotin and by betray the latter to the former be in part the cause of the sanguinary measure adopt by robespierre -lrb- 27 -rrb- the object of this atrocious policy be that the french people would by witness so many execution become disgusted at the sanguinary tyranny of robespierre and recall the bourbon unconditionally which fortunately for france and thanks to the heroism and bravery of the republican army do not take place for have the restoration take place at that time a dreadful reaction would have be encourage and the cruelty of the reign of terror surpass with the same view emissary be dispatch from the court of coblentz to the south of france in order under the disguise of patriot to preach up the most exaggerated corollary to the theory of liberty

the french commissioner who be send after the abdication of napoleon by the provisional government to treat with the ally in which it appear that the british commissioner lord s -lrb- tewart -rrb- -lrb- 28 -rrb- brother to the secretary of state for foreign affair make rather a simple figure by he want of historical knowledge or recollection he begin it seem in rather a bully manner in the presence of the commissioner to declaim against what he call the perfidy and mutiny of the french army against they lawful sovereign when the venerable lafayette who be one of the commissioner and who be ever foremost when he country have need of he assistance remark to he that the english revolution in 1688 which the english be accustomed always to stile glorious and which he -lrb- lafayette -rrb- stile glorious also be effectuate in a similar manner by the british army abandon king jame and range themselves under the standard of the prince of orange that if it be a crime on the part of the french army to join napoleon they ancient leader who have lead they so often to victory it be a still greater crime on the part of the english army to go over to the prince of orange who be unknown to they and a foreigner in the bargain and that therefore this blame of the french army come from the mouth of a englishman surprise he the more so as the duke of marlborough the boast and pride of the english set the example of defection from he sovereign who have be he greatest benefactor lord s -lrb- tewart -rrb- who do not appear to be at all conscious of this part of we history be stagger a smile be visible on the countenance of all the foreign diplomatist assemble there and lord s -lrb- tewart -rrb- to hide he confusion and with a ill-disguised anger turn to lafayette and say that the ally would not treat until napoleon should be deliver to they je m ' étonne my lord qu'en faisant une proposition si infâme et si deshonorante vous vous plaisez de vous adresser au prisonnier d'olmütz be the dignified answer of that virtuous patriot and ever ardent veteran of liberty -lrb- 29 -rrb- the main street in frankfort call the _ zeil _ be very broad and spacious and can boast of a number of splendid house belong to individual particularly the house of schweitzer -lrb- 30 -rrb- and on the quaus on the bank of the mayn there be a noble range of building the bridge across the mayn be very fine and on the other side of the river be the suburb of sachsenhansen which be famous for be the head-quarter of the priestess of the venus vulgivaga who abound in this city there be in frankfort a immense number of jew who have a quarter of the city allot to they the garden that environ the town be very tastefully lay out and serve as the favorite promenade of the _ beau monde _ of frankfort the cathedral will always be a place of interest as the temple wherein in later time the german caesar be crown and inaugurate at the _ hôtel de ville _ call the _ römer _ which be a ugly gothic building but interesting from its be in this edifice that the emperor be choose be to be see the celebrated golden bull which be write on parchment in the latin language with a golden seal attach to it in the hall where the elector use to sit on the election of a emperor of the roman be to be see the portrait of several of the emperor and a very striking one in particular of the emperor joseph ii in full length in he imperial robe there be no table d'hôte at the _ swan _ for supper but this meal be serve up _ à la carte _ which be very convenient for those who do not require copious meal at the same table with I at supper sit a very agreeable man with whom i enter into conversation he be a hessian and have serve in a hessian battalion in the english service during the american war he be so kind as to procure I admission to the casino at the hotel rumpf -lrb- 31 -rrb- where there be a literary institution and where they receive newspaper pamphlet and review in the german french english and italian language in frankfort there be several house of individual which merit the name of palace and there be a great display of opulence and industry in this city in the environs there be abundance of _ maison de plaisance _ for commerce it be the most bustling city -lrb- inland -rrb- in all germany besides it be the seat of the present german diet and from here as from a center diverge the high road to all part of the empire i have be once at the theater which be very near the _ swan _ a german opera the scene whereof be in indium be give the scenery and decoration be good appropriate and the singing very fair the theater itself be dirty and gloomy the german language appear to I to be better adapt to music than either the french or english the number of dactylic termination in the language give to it all the variety that the _ sdrucciolus _ give to the italian as to poetry no language in the world suit itself better to all the vagary and phantasy of the muse since it possess so much natural rythm and allow like the greek the combination of compound word and a redundancy of epithet and it be besides so flexible that it lend itself to all the ancient as well as the modern metre with complete success : indeed it be the only modern language that i know of which do so as for political opinion here the german seem neither to wish nor to care about the restoration of the bourbon but they talk loudly of the necessity of tear alsace and lorraine from france in fact they wish to put it out of the power of the french ever to invade germany again a thing however little to be hope for for the minor and weaker germanic state have always hitherto -lrb- and will probably again at some future day -rrb- invoke the assistance of france against the greater and stronger i observe that the austrian government be not at all popular here and that its bad faith in financial matter be so notorious and have be so severely feel here that a merchant tell I allude to the bankruptcy of the austrian government on two occasion when there be no absolute necessity for the measure that frankfort have suffer more from the bad faith of the austrian government than from all the war contribution levy by the french bruxelle 28th July on arrival at coblentz we hear that napoleon have surrender himself unconditionally to capt maitland of the _ bellerophon _ he never should have humiliate himself so far as to surrender himself to the british ministry he owe to himself to he brave fellow soldier to the french nation whose sovereign he have be not to take such a step but rather die in the field like we richard iii a glorious death which cast a lustre around he memory in spite of the darker shades of he character or if he could not fall in the field he should have die like hannibal rather than commit himself into the hand of a government in which generosity be by no mean a distinguish feature and which on many occasion have show a petty persecute and vindictive spirit and thus i have no hesitation in portray the characteristic of we tory party which unfortunately for the cause of liberty rule with undivided sway over england he will now end he day in captivity for he destination appear to be already fix and st helena be name as the intended residence he will i say be expose to all the taunt and persecution that petty malice can suggest and this with the most uncomfortable reflection : for have he be more considerate of the spirit of the age he might have set all the monarch ultra and oligarch and they minister at defiance but he wish to ape charlemagne and the caesar and to establish a universal empire : a thing totally impossible in we day and much to be deprecate be it possible consign to st helena napoleon will furnish to posterity a proverb like that of dionysius at corinth this banishment to st helena will be very ungenerous and unjust on the part of the english government but i suppose they satellite and adherent will term it a act of clemency and some _ church and kingman _ would no doubt recommend hew he in piece as samuel do to agag i stop three day at aix-la-chapelle to drink the water and then come

see for they have be so often describe before that it would be a perfect waste of time and i can do better in refer you at once to the _ guide des voyageurs à pari _ so that i shall content myself with merely indicate these object which make the most impression on I my first visit be as you will have no doubt guess to the palais royal : there i breakfast there i dine and there i pass the whole day without the least _ ennui _ it be a world in itself it swarm at present with officer of the ally army the variety of uniform add to the splendor and novelty of the scene the restaurant and cafés

dress very well as indeed most french woman do and have a remarkably fine turn arm which she take care to display on all occasion i do not however perceive much animation in she she always appear the same nor have she make any more impression on I -- tho ' i be of a very susceptible nature in this particular -- than a fine statue or picture would do there she sit on a throne and receive the hommage and compliment of most of the visitor and the money of all which seem to please she most for she receive the compliment which be pay she with the utmost _ sang-froid _ and indifference and the money she take especial care to count english troops conjointly with the national guard do duty at the entrance of the palais royal from the rue st honoré and it become necessary to have a strong guard to keep the peace as frequent dispute take place between the young man of the capital and the prussian officer against whom the french be singularly inveterate the french when leave to themselves be very peaceable in they pleasure and the utmost public decorum be observe they sobriety contribute much to this but if there be in london a establishment similar to that of the palais royal it would become a perfect pandemonium and would require a army to keep the peace the french police keep a very sharp look-out on all political offence but be more indulgent towards all moral one as long as public decorum be not infringe and then it be severely punish but they have none of that censoriousness or prying spirit in france which be so common in england to hunt out and criticise the private vice of they neighbor which in my opinion do not proceed from any real regard for virtue but from a fanatical jealous envious and malignant spirit those vice-hunter never have the courage to attack a man of wealth and power but a poor artisan or labourer who buy a piece of meat after twelve o'clock on Saturday night or a glass of spirit during church-time on Sunday be term a sabbath-breaker and imprison without mercy in the palais royal the three most remarkable temple of dissipation be very 's for gastronome robert 's faro bank for gamester and the café montausier for

the different restaurant and cafés with a assortment of bijouterie and other knick-knack to sell she be full of wit and repartee but she answer to all those who attempt to squeeze she hand and make love to she be always : _ achetez quelque choose _ she name be céline and she have a great flow of conversation on all subject but that of love which she invariably cut short by _ achetez quelque

subject for contemplation a chill of awe and veneration pervade my whole frame when i first enter into that glorious temple of the art i feel as i should be i admit among supernatural being or as if i have shuffle off this mortal coil and be suddenly usher into the presence of the illustrious tenant of another world in fact i feel as if olympus and the whole court of immortal be open to my view no i can not describe these thing i can only feel they i throw down the pen and call upon expressive silence to muse they praise of the picture gallery too what can i say that can possibly give you a idea of its variety and extent here be the finest work of the italian flemish and french school and you be as much embarrassed to single out the favorite object as the grand signor would be among six or seven hundred of the most beautiful woman in the world to make he choice the only fault i find in this collection be that there be rather too many scripture piece crucifixion martyrdom and allegorical picture and too few from historical or mythological subject yet perhaps i be wrong in class the scripture piece with martyrdom crucifixion grilling of saint and madonna there be very many beautiful episode in the scripture which would furnish admirable subject for painter why then have they choose disgusting subject such as judith saw off holoferne ' head siserah 's head nail to the bedpost john the baptist 's on a trencher etc but the picture represent martyrdom be too revolting to the eye and should not be place in this museum it be report that the ally mean to strip this museum -lrb- of sculpture and painting -rrb- no it can not be they never surely can be guilty of such a act of vandalism and contemptible spite i be aware that there be a great clamor amongst a certain description of english for restore these statue and picture to the country from whence they come and that it be the fashion to term the translation of they to pari a revolutionary robbery but let we bring these gentleman to a calm reasoning on the subject the statue and painting in question belong either to government at war with france or to individual inhabit those country now with respect to individual i will venture to affirm on the best authority that the property of no individual be take from he without a equivalent those who have statue and picture of value and wish to sell they receive they full value from the french government but there be no force use on the occasion in fact many who be in want of money be rejoice at the opportunity of sell as they could never have otherwise dispose of those valuable article to individual at the same price that the french government give i recollect a day or two ago be in conversation with a milanese on this subject and other connect with the occupation of italy by the french i happen to mention that the conquest of italy by the republican army must have be attend with confiscation of property he assure I that no such thing as confiscation of property take place that so far from be the loser by the french invasion and the establishment of they system they have on the contrary be considerable gainer for that the country flourish under they domination in a manner before unknown and that one of the greatest advantage attendant on the occupation be the establishment of a equality of weight and measure the decimal division of the coin the introduction of a admirable code of law free would from all barbarism -- legal political and theological -- and intelligible to all class so that there be no occasion to cite old author and go back for three or four hundred year to hunt out authority and precedent for what man of sense could determine at once by follow the dictate of they own judgment with respect to the statue and picture belong to the different government of italy it must never be forget that these government make war against the french revolution either openly or insidiously and do they utmost to aid the coalition to crush the infant liberty of france those who do not act openly do so covertly and indirectly in short from they tergiversation and intrigue they have no claim whatever on the mercy of the conqueror who treat they with a great deal of clemency the destruction of these government be loudly call for by the people themselves who look on the french as they deliverer it will be admit i believe that it be and have be the custom on the continent in all war for all party to levy war contribution on the conquer or occupy country but buonoparte think it more glorious for the french name to take work of art instead of money and not a statue or picture be take from the vanquished government except by a solemn treaty of cession or give in lieu of contribution at the option of the owner and the prince be very glad to give up they picture and statue which the most of they do not know how to appreciate in lieu of money which they be all anxious to keep and on these article a fair value be fix by competent judge in this manner do the french become the possessor of these valuable object of art and in this manner be the noble museum in paris fill up and surely nothing could be more generous and liberal than the use make of the museum by the french government foreigner be indeed more favored than the inhabitant themselves to the inhabitant of pari this museum be open twice a week but to foreigner on produce they passport it be open every day in the week all the year round artist of all nation be allow during a certain number of hour each day to come to copy the statue and picture which suit they taste and stove be light for they accommodation during winter and all this grati -- now before these object of art be collect here they be distribute some in church and some in government palace to see the first require a specific introduction to the owner to see the second application to the attendant of the church become necessary and for both these you be require to pay fee to the servant and church-attendant who be always impatient to take you fee and hurry you through the apartment or chapel scarcely give you time to examine anything to be admit into the government palace be a matter of favor and here also fee be require -lrb- 32 -rrb- here in the louvre there be no introduction require no court to be pay to _ major-domo _ no favor it be open to all class high and low without exception and no money be allow to be give but there be some people in they ridiculous fury against the french revolution who would fain persuade we that before that epoch there be a golden age on the earth that there be no act of violence commit no fraud practice no property injure no individual ill-used that every prince govern like numa that every noble be a bayard and every priest like a primitive apostle why i need go no further than the seven year ' war to show that in that war during the height of european civilisation and carry on between the most polished nation in europe there be much more act of violence and rapine carry on than ever be do by the french republican i by no means wish to excuse or even palliate the act of ferocity which take place at that epoch of the french revolution call the reign of terror which be execute by a people work up to frenzy by a recollection of they wrong and i know too well that many virtuous individual fall victim to they indiscriminating fury but i do believe and aver that much more clamor be make at the execution of a handful of corrupt courtier intriguing and profligate woman of quality and worthless priest than all the rest put together to return to the seven year ' war -lrb- i may be permit to take this retrospect i hope since it be the fashion and those who differ with I in opinion go much farther back than i do -rrb- let the french royalist and emigrant recollect the confiscation of property and barbarity exercise by marshall richelieu in hanover where many family be reduce to beggary they may not chuse to recollect this but the hanoverian do and they have not forget the _ pavillon de hanovre _ so call by the wit of the time from its have be build by the marshall with money arise from the spoil of hanover will they recollect also the harsh treatment inflict on the burgher and citizen of a town in germany who be shut up in a room and keep without food or drink for nearly three day because they would not consent to fix a heavy and unwarrantable contribution on they fellow citizen when these unhappy but virtuous man be only allow to go out for the necessity of nature attend by sentry and on the third day when faint with hunger a little bread and water be give to they with a assurance that in future they be not to expect such luxury have they forget the devastation commit in berlin by the austrian in the seven year ' war when they pillage burn or destroy all the valuable property of the royal palace the most valuable work of art vase statue of antiquity the loss of which could never be replace when they lop off the head arm and leg of the statue have they forget the conduct of the belligerent power at the siege of dresden at the same epoch when whole family among whom be helpless old man and woman with child at the breast be compel to leave dresden in the middle of a most rigorous winter and be drive to take refuge in the field where the most of they perish with hunger and cold and where many individual lose they reason and become insane from the treatment they receive have they forget the merciless barbarity inflict by the russian in the same war on the inhabitant of the prussian territory they rip up and burn man woman and child and the dreadful retaliation inflict on they at the battle of zorndorff when the prussian exasperate at the idea of those horror so fresh in they memory on be order to bury the russian dead throw the wound man also belong to that nation into the grave dig for the dead to be thus bury alive and hastily fill they up with earth as if fearful that they might relent do they give themselves time for reflection these be not exaggeration they be give by a author celebrate for he impartiality and deep research and who be a eye-witness of many of these proceedings i mean archenholz in he admirable history of the seven year ' war -lrb- 33 -rrb- then again in the war of american independence -lrb- and here my countryman must excuse I if i point out the act of injustice commit by they when act in obedience to a unprincipled and arbitrary government and in a cause hostile to freedom -rrb- who do not recollect the private property wantonly destroy and confiscate by the english they employ the indian tribe those merciless savage of the forest to scalp etc which call forth the indignation of a chatham and the grossly unjust pillage and confiscation of property which take place at st eustatius by the commander of a _ religious and gracious king _ -lrb- 34 -rrb- again who do not recollect the gentle but deep reproof give by the american general schuyler to the english general burgoyne when the latter be make prisoner by the american under gate general schuyler 's valuable house barn etc have be burn by the express order of burgoyne nevertheless schuyler receive he with dignified politeness magnanimously stifle the recollection of the injury he have receive and obtain for he a good quarter merely remark general have my house and farm not be burn i could have offer you a more comfortable abode how burgoyne must have feel this reproof yet he be not by nature a harsh man but he have the order of he government to exercise severity he be educate in tory principle and passive obedience be they motto can one forget likewise even in the late war nelson 's conduct to caracciolus at naple whom he cause to be hang on board of a english ship of war together with a number of other patriot in violation of a solemn capitulation by which it have be stipulate that they should be consider as prisoner of war and send to france then again the wanton destruction of the capitol and other public building at washington not devoted to military purpose which it be not usual to destroy or deface and the valuable public library too which be burn what excuse can be offer for this be the time of omar return it be fair and allow by the law of war to blow up and destroy arsenal magazine contain warlike store and engine of destruction but to destroy with gothic barbarity building of great symmetry and beauty and a library too -- o fie why i will defy any man to point out a single instance where the french republican army or napoleon ever injure or wantonly destroy a single national edifice a single work of art a single book belong to any other country on the contrary they invariably extend they protection to the art and science why at vienna where there be i understand a most splendid museum and many most valuable work of art and antiquity tho ' this city fall twice into they possession they never destroy or take away a single article but on the contrary there as well as in berlin they invite the inhabitant to form a civic guard for the protection of they property as to the vandalism shewn during the reign of terror and i by no means seek to palliate it that be of short duration it be madness if you will but it be disinterested -- and other nation who talk a great deal about they superior morality would do well to look at home they would there observe in they own historic page that the atrocity of the french revolution have not only be equal but surpass perhaps by more dreadful scene commit at wexford in 1798 under the auspices of the government then rule ireland and which the noble and virtuous -- -lrb- 35 -rrb- disdain to serve excuse this long digression but i feel it my duty to open the eye of my countryman and prevent they from support on all occasion the unjust act of they government which reflect dishonor on a great and enlighten nation which can boast among its annals of some of the most heroic splendid and disinterested character that ever the world produce all that i need add on the subject of the statue and picture be that put out of the question the justice or injustice of the restitution it will be a great loss to england and to english artist in particular should they be remove : many a artist can afford to make a trip to pari who would find it beyond he means to make a journey to florence or rome if these object of art be to be take away it should be stipulate so in the treaty of peace and then everybody would understand it this would be put it on the fairest footing you then say to france : you gain these thing by conquest you lose they by defeat but for god 's sake let we have no more of that _ cant _ about revolutionary robbery pari -- i go for the first time to the grand opera or as it be here call the académie royale de musique which be in the rue de richelieu _ armida _ be the piece perform the music by glück the decoration be splendid and the dancing beyond all praise the scene represent the garden of armida and the nymph dance fully express in the mimic art those beautiful line of tasso : cogliam d'amor la rosa amiamo or quando esser si puote riamato amando -lrb- 36 -rrb- the effect of the dissolution of the palace and garden by the wave of armida 's wand be astonishing it appear completely to be the work of inchantment from the rapidity of execution which follow the _ potentissime parole _ the french recitative however do not please I the serious opera be a exotic and do not seem to thrive on the soil of france the language do not possess sufficient intonation to give effect to the recitative on the contrary the comic opera be excellent and here the national music and singing appear to great advantage it never degenerate to the grotesque or absurd _ buffo _ of the italian but be always exquisitely graceful simple touching and natural among the ballet i have see perhaps three of the best viz _ achille à scyro flore et zéphire _ and _ la folle par amour _ in the ballet of flore and zéphire the dancer who do these two part appear more aerian than earthly to use a phrase of burke 's i never behold so _ beautiful a vision nina _ or _ la folle par amour _ be a ballet from private life the title sufficiently explain its purport it be exquisitely touching and pathetic o what a divine creature be bigottini what symmetry of form what innate grace what a captivating expression of countenance and then the manner in which she do the mad scene and she return to reason oh i be move even to tear never have any performance such a effect upon I what a magnificent _ tout ensemble _ be the grand opera at paris whenever i feel chagrined or melancholy i shall come here i feel as if i be in a new world the fiction appear reality my sens be ravish and i forget all my care i have very little pleasure in visit royal palace unless they have be the residence of some transcendent person like napoleon or frederick ii of prussium as the sight of splendid furniture and royal pomp afford I no gratification and i would rather visit washington 's or lafayette 's farm in company with these distinguish man than dine with all the monarch of europe after a hasty glance at the furniture of the tuilery what fix my attention for a considerable time be la salle des maréchaux where be the portrait of all the modern french marshall they be all full length portrait and be striking resemblance some be in the marshall 's undress uniform and other in the full court costume which be very elegant be the costume of the time of franci i with the spanish hat and plume i do not observe ney 's or soult 's portrait among they in front of the great square of the tuilery where the troops exercise stand the arch of triumph erect by napoleon commonly call _ l'arc du carrousel _ it be a beautiful piece of architecture but be far too small to tally with such a vast mass of building as the palace and office of the tuilery by the side of they it appear almost lilliputian it would have be better to have make it in the style of the triumphal arch of the porte st deni on this arc of the carrousel be _ bas-relief _ both outside and inside represent various action of napoleon 's life he be always represent in the roman costume with the imperial laurel on he brow with king kneel and present the key of conquer city on the outside be statue large as life in modern military costume represent the different _ arme _ which compose the french army -lrb- 37 -rrb- on the top of this arc du carrousel be a antique car of triumph to which be harness the four bronze horse which be take from the façade of the church of san marco in venice they be of beautiful workmanship and of great antiquity what various and mighty revolution have these horse witness cast in corinth in the time of the glory of the grecian commonwealth and remove by conquest to rome they witness the successive fall of the grecian and roman state transfer to constantinople in the time of constantine and from thence remove to venice when constantinople fall into the hand of the french and venetian transfer from thence to pari in 1798 they have witness the successive fall of the eastern and western empire of the republic of venice and the napoleonic dynasty and empire report say they be to be restore to venice and who know whether they may not be destine one day to return to they original country greece under perhaps russian auspices the garden of the tuilery which lie at the back part of the palace be very spacious well lay out in walk and line with tree large basin inlay with stone fountain and statue add to the grandeur of these garden they extend from the tuilery as far as the place loui xv parallel to the seine and be separate by a wall and parapet and a beautiful cast iron railing from the quaus and on the other side from the rue de rivoli one of the new street and the best in paris for pedestrian on the side opposite the palace itself be the _ place loui xv _ call in the time of the republic _ place de la révolution _ and where the unfortunate loui xvi suffer decapitation the _ place loui xv _ be by far the most magnificent thing of the kind i have ever see and far exceed the handsomest of we square in london on one side of it be the _ hótel du garde meuble _ a superb edifice on the other the quaus the river and on the other side of the river be the _ palai du corps législatif _ now the place where the chamber of deputy hold they sit and which have a magnificent façade in front of this place be the champ elysées and avenue of neuilly and behind the garden and palace of the tuilery my next visit be to the _ place vendôme _ where stand the majestic column of the grand army to I this column be the most striking thing of its kind that i have hitherto see it be of bronze and of the most beautiful workmanship cast from the cannon take from the austrian in the war of 1805 and on it be figure in bas-relief the various battle and achievement wind round and round from the base to the capital it be construct after the model of the column of trajan in rome the next place i visit be the chamber of deputy it be a fine building with a doric façade and column it be peculiarly striking from its noble simplicity on the façade be bas-relief represent action in napoleon 's life the flight of step lead to the façade be very grand and there be colossal figure represent prudence justice fortitude and other legislative virtue the chamber itself where the deputy hold they sitting be in the form of a greek theater the arch of the semi-circle form the gallery appropriate to the audience and comprehend in its enclosure the seat of the deputy like the seat in a greek theater on the chord of the semi-circle where the _ proscenium _ should be be the tribune and president 's seat the whole be exceedingly elegant the orator whose turn it be to speak leave he seat ascend the tribune and face the deputy the anti-rooms adjoining this chamber be fit up with long table and fauteuil and be appropriate to the sitting of the various committee these antichamber be hung round with picture represent the victory of the french army but they be cover with green baize and carefully conceal from the public eye in order to stifle recollection and prevent comparison pari August i mount on horseback and ride out to st cloud to breakfast pass through the champ elysées the bois de boulogne and the little town of passy and return by the quaus as far as the bridge of jéna which i pass and go to visit the _ hôtel des invalides le champ de mar _ the _ pantheon _ or church of st geneviève and the palace of the luxembourg this be pretty good work for one day and as you will expect some little account of my idea thereon i shall give you a _ précis _ of what most interested I in the champ elysées be quarter several english regiment who be encamp there and this add to the liveliness of the scene we soldier seem to enjoy themselves very much they be in the midst of place of recreation of all kind such as guinguette tennis-court dance salon and cafés and besides these -lrb- place of elysium for english soldier -rrb- wine and brandy shop innumerable we soldier seem to agree very well with the inhabitant in the bois de boulogne be hanoverian troops as well as english at passy i stop at the house occupy by my friend major c of the 33rd regt -lrb- 38 -rrb- who be to accompany I to st cloud st cloud be a exceedingly neat pretty town well and solidly build and tolerably large there be a great many good restaurant and cafe as st cloud with its palace promenade and garden form one of the most favorite resort of the parisian on sunday and _ jours de fête _ diner _ de société _ and _ noce et festins _ be often make here and there be both land and water conveyance during the whole day there be two road by land from paris : the one on the quaus the whole way the other through the bois de boulogne and champ elysées the garden of st cloud be lay out something in the style of a _ jardin anglai _ but mix with the regular old fashion garden it abound in lofty tree beautiful site and well arrange vista command extensive view of pari and the country environ st cloud be the favorite residence of napoleon and the furniture in the palace here show he to be a man of the most refined taste all be elegant and classic there be nothing superfluous the furniture be modern but in strict imitation of the furniture of the ancient and chiefly in bronze there be superb vase and candelabra in marble magnificent clock of various kind marble bust and bust in bronze of great man and bronze statue large as life hold lamp the chair and sofa too be in a classic taste as be the bed and bath we be inform here that blucher who pass one night here tear with he spur the satin covering of one of the sofa and that he do it wilfully but i never can believe that the old man would be so silly and i rather think that this story be a invention of the keeper of the palace or that if it be do it be do by a accident merely but the fact be that blucher have a contempt for and hate the parisian and like to mortify they on all occasion he threaten to do a number of thing which he never seriously intend merely for the sake of tease they and it must be own that they deserve a little contempt from the want of _ caractère _ they show on the entrance of the ally be it as it may blucher be the _ bête noire _ of the parisian and they be as much afraid of he as the child be of _ monsieur croque-mitaine _ we return from st cloud by the quaus cross the bridge of jéna gallop along the _ champ de mar _ take a hasty glance at the _ hôtel des invalides _ a magnificent edifice and which may be distinguish from all other building by its gilded cupola it be a superb establishment in every respect and be furnish with a excellent library a great many old soldier be to be see in this library occupy in read they be very polite to all visitor particularly to lady nothing can better demonstrate the superior character intelligence and deportment of the french soldier over those of all other country than the way in which they employ they time in literary pursuit they dignified politeness to visitor and the intelligent answer they give to question i be afraid we british veteran brave as they be in the field occupy themselves when lay up as invalid more in destroy they body by spirituous liquor than in improve they mind by read the chapel of this establishment where be display the banner and trophy take at different epoch from the enemy of france and which be much mutilate by the war since the revolution be now strip of all the ensign of glory they be all burn by the french themselves previous to the capitulation of pari in 1814 in order to prevent they fall into the hand of the enemy a old soldier who be my guide related this with tear in he eye but suddenly check himself say : _ mais telle est l'histoire _ the only thing now in this chapel that interest the eye of the traveller be the monument of vauban and turenne of the rest nought remain but the brilliant souvenir fuit ilium et ingens glorium teucrorum -lrb- 39 -rrb- i have a great deal of difficulty in induce this old soldier to accept of three frank i tell he at last that as he do not want it himself to take it and give it to somebody that do i then visit the rest of the establishment there be a whole range of room which contain model or plan in relief of all the fortress of france they be admirably and most minutely execute not only the fortification and public building but the private house the garden orchard meadow mountain hill and dale bridge tree every feature of the ground in fine and of the surrounding country be give in miniature in fact it give you the same idea of the place themselves and of the environ country as if you be hold up in the air over they to inspect they or as if you view they from a balloon at the distance of 800 yard from the earth the model of strassburg lille and three or four other have be take away by the austrian and prussian but i have see those of calais dunkirk villefranche toulon and brest and in fact almost every other french fortress this be one of the most interesting sight in pari and for this we be certainly indebted to the occupation for i question much if traveller be ever permit to see these model until pari fall into the hand of the ally prussian sentry do duty at the door how grate this must be to the old invalid among the model i must not omit to mention a very curious one which represent the battle of lodus the town of lodus the bridge and river be admirably execute the soldier be represent by little figure about a quarter of a inch in height and cobweb be dispose so as to represent the smoke of the firearm buonaparte and he staff be on horseback on one side of the bridge there be also a very fine model of the _ hôtel des invalides _ itself from hence we go to the garden and palace of the luxembourg these garden form the midday and afternoon promenade of that part of the city in one wing of the palace be the chamber of peer elegantly fit up and in some respect resemble a greek theater the bust of cicero brutus demosthene phocion and other great man of antiquity adorn the niche of this chamber and on the grand _ escalier _ be the statue in natural size of kleber dessaix caffarellus and other french general report say that these statue will be remove in the picture gallery at the luxembourg be a choice collection of picture of the modern french school such as guérin david etc the subject be extremely well choose be take from the mythology or from ancient and modern history i be too glad to find no crucifixion martyrdom nor eternal madonna i distinguish in particular the _ judgment of brutus _ and the _ serment des horaces et des curiaces _ connoisseur find the attitude too stiff and talk to you of the italian school but i prefer these yet i have better hold my tongue on this subject for i be tell i know nothing about painting poor labédoyère -lrb- 40 -rrb- be sentence to be shoot by the court martial which try he and the sentence will be carry immediately into execution he fate excite universal sympathy and i have see many people shed tear when talk on this subject he certainly ought to be protect by the 12th article of the capitulation the french be very uneasy the ally have begin to strip the louvre and there be no talk of what the term of peace be to be or what be the determination of the ally this be a dreadful state of uncertainty for the french people and may lead to a general insurrection the ally continue pour troops into france and levy contribution _ vae victis _ seem they motto france be now a disarmed nation and no french uniform be to be see except that of the national guard and the garde royale france be at the mercy of she enemy and prostrate at they foot a melancholy prospect for european liberty the ally have parade and review two or three time a week and the sovereign of russium austrium and prussium constantly attend wellington be they showman these crown head like mightily play at soldier i should think he grace must be heartily tire of they massacre and persecution of the protestant have begin to take place in the south of france and the priest be at work again threaten with excommunication and hell the purchaser and inheritor of emigrant estate and church land these priest and emigrant be incorrigible frequent quarrel take place almost every evening in the palais royal between the prussian officer and the french particularly some of the officer from the army of the loire i rather suspect these latter be the aggressor the prussian be gorge with plunder come there to eat drink and amuse themselves and have as little stomach for fight as the soldier of lucullus have after have enrich himself but the officer of the army of the loire be poor fellow in a very different predicament they have not even be pay what be due to they and they have none of those nice felicity -lrb- to use a expression of charlotte smith 's -rrb- -lrb- 41 -rrb- which make life agreeable be ready for any combat to set they life on any cast to mend it or to be rid of ' t the prussian indulge in every sort of dissipation which they be enable to do by the plunder which they have accumulate and of which they have form i understand a _ dépôt _ at st germain they send these article of plunder to town every day to be sell and then divide the profit which be sure to be spend in the palais royal and other place of revel and debauchery they sometimes affect a fastidiousness of stomach which be quite laughable and not at all peculiar to the german who be in general bless by nature with especial good appetite and they spend so much money that the english officer who have not have the advantage of plunder that these prussian have have must appear by the side of they stingy and niggardly i be witness one day to a whimsical scene which will serve to give you a idea of the air of importance these gentleman give themselves i be one day at versaille and after have visit the palace and garden i enter the salon of a restaurateur and call for a veal cutlet and _ vin ordinaire _ there be a fat prussian major with two or three of he companion at one of the table who have be make copious libation to bacchus in burgundy and champaign he hear I call for _ vin ordinaire _ and whether it be to show he own magnificence i know not but he call out to the _ cafetière _ : madame votre vin ordinaire est il buvable car j' en veux donner a mon trompette et s ` il n'est pas bon il n'en boira pas faites venir mon trompette now i dare say in he own country this major would not have disdain even the schwarze bier of brandenburgh scarcely any quarrel i believe take place between the english and french nor do i hear of any violent fracas but one in this instance the english officer concern must have be sad brutal vulgar fellow they however after behave in a most gross insulting manner be compel by some frenchman not to eat but to drink they word and that out of a vessel not usually employ in drinking i shall not repeat the contemptible affair but it furnish the subject of a caricature the english officer in general behave in a handsome and liberal manner and they conduct be speak of in high term of encomium by very many of the french themselves i regret however exceedingly that any of the british officer should have imbibe the low prejudice and vulgar hatred against the french which certain people preach up in england to cover they own peculation and interested view a young friend of mine with whom i be one day talk on political subject say to I : i can not help agree with you in many thing but i be stagger when i think that you idea and reasoning be so contrary to the idea in which i have be bring up so that i rather avoid enter at all on political question i do not wonder at all at this for i recollect when i be at school at eton the system be to drill into the head of the boy strong aristocratic principle and hatred of democracy and of the french in particular we be order to write theme against the french revolution and verse of triumph over they defeat with now and then a sly theme on the great advantage of hereditary nobility in these verse god almighty be to be

natural and experimental philosophy who be accustom to give lecture annually to the etonian that he visit be no longer agreeable and would be dispense with in future as philosophy have do a great deal of harm and have cause the french revolution with respect to my visit to versaille i be much strike with the vast size and magnificence of the building and with the ingenuity display in the arrangement of the grounds and the numerous group of statue grotto aqueduct fountain and ruin still it please I less than st cloud for i prefer the taste of the present day in gardening and the arrangement of ground to the ponderous and tawdry taste of the time of loui xiv and i prefer st cloud to versaille just as i should prefer a grecian nymph in the simple costume of arcadium to a fine court lady rouge and dress out with hoop diamond and headdress of the tune of queen anne napoleon must have have a exquisite taste -lrb- 32 -rrb- exception to this be i understand the gallery at

the duke of berrus be at lille and a grand _ fête _ be give in the evening to celebrate the second restoration of the bourbon firework be let off the city be brilliantly illuminate and boy -lrb- hire of course -rrb- go about the street sing the follow refrain à bas à bas napoléon vivent vivent les bourbon a number of beautiful woman elegantly attire parade up and down the public promenade which be exceedingly well and tastefully lay out this city be build with great regularity and the street be broad neat and clean it be by far the handsomest city i have ever see either in france or belgium the _ hôtel de ville _ and the theater both be on the _ grande place _ and be well worth see lille be renown for its fortification i much wish to visit the citadel but i be not permit at dinner at the table d'hôte at the _ hôtel du commerce _ i remark a french officer declaim violently against napoleon but i hear afterwards that he be the son of a emigrant the rest of the company do not seem to approve he discourse and shew visible impatience at it lille may be easily recognize at its approach from the immense quantity of wind-mill that be in the vicinity of this city some of which be use for grind of wheat and other for the expression of oil a great deal of flax from whence the oil be make grow in the country i leave lille on the morning of the 24th inst with the courier for amien from amien i take the diligence to beauvai and on arrival there i put up under the hospitable roof of my friend major g of the 18th light dragoon lately make lt-colonel for he gallantry at waterloo -lrb- 42 -rrb- i do not want for amusement here for the next day a _ fête champêtre _ be give just outside the wall of the town and i admire the grace and tournure of the female peasantry and they good dancing how much more creditable be these innocent and agreeable _ fêtes _ to the fair and meeting in england which be generally signalize in drunkenness the next afternoon present a novel sight to the inhabitant of beauvai it be a grand cricket match play between the officer of the 10th and 18th dragoon it be win by the latter mainly owe to the superior play of colonel g of the 18th who never touch a bat since he be at burney 's school the officer afterwards dine _ al fresco _ and many toast accompany by the huzza be give to the astonishment of the bystander who seem to consider we as little better than barbarian one of the officer wish to pay a compliment to the inhabitant of beauvai propose the health of loui xviii but they seem to take it coldly and not at all to be flatter by the compliment after five day very agreeable residence at beauvai i put myself in the diligence to return to pari during the journey a ardent political altercation arise between a young lady who appear to be a warm partisan of napoleon on the one side and a garde du corps on the other the lady be second by a young gentleman of whom it be difficult to say whether he sustain she argument from a dislike to the present order of thing or from a wish to ingratiate himself in she favor the argument of the garde du corps be espouse but soberly by one of the passenger who be a mathematical professor at one of the lyceum he be not by any mean a ultra but he support the bourbon with moderate gentlemanly and i therefore believe sincere attachment this professor seem a well inform sort of man he tell I that he be acquaint with sir jame m formerly recorder at bombay on we arrival at the _ bureau des messageries _ the whole company forget they dispute and part good friend and the young man who be partisan of the young lady in the political dispute take care to inform himself of she abode in paris \* \* \* \* \* remark on the various dramatic performance which i witness at pari with opinion on the french theater in general in my idea of dramatic work i be neither rigidly classic nor romantic and i think both style may be good if properly manage and the interest well keep up in a word i be please with all genre _ hors le genre ennuyux _ -lrb- 43 -rrb- and tho ' a great admirer of shakespeare and schiller i be equally so of voltaire racine and corneille i take equal delight in the pathos of the sentimental drama of kotzebue as in the admirable satire and _ vis comica _ of the unrivalled molière so that on my arrival at paris i be not violently prejudice either for or against the french stage but rather pre-occupied to use a gentler term in its favor and i have not be at all disappointed for i think i can pronounce it with safety the first perhaps the only stage in europe i now mean to speak not of opera nor of operas-comique nor of melodrame nor of vaudeville all these have they respective merit but when i speak of the french stage i confine myself to the regular theater of tragedy and comedy of they classical piece in a word to the dramatic performance usually give at the _ théâtre français _ the first piece i see perform be _ manlius _ -lrb- 44 -rrb- but i be too far off from the stage to judge of the act and could do little more than catch the sound the parterre and the whole house be full i be in the fourth tier of box yet i could distinguish at interval the finest and most prominent trait of talma 's act particularly in that scene where he upbraid he friend with have betray he this he give with uncommon energy and effect the plot of this piece be very similar to that of _ venice preserved _ -lrb- 45 -rrb- the next piece i see represent be the _ avare _ of molière which to I be one of the greatest dramatic treat i have ever witness every part be well support the next be _ athalie _ of racine here too i be highly gratified mlle george perform the part of athalie and give I the perfect ideal of the haughty queen she narration of the dream be give with the happiest effect and in she attempt to conceal she uneasiness and she affected contempt of the dream in these line : un songe I devroi -- je inquiéter d'un songe she seem in reality to labor under all the anxiety and fatigue arise from it that fine scene between joad and joa be well give and the little girl who do the part of joa perform with a good deal of spirit the actor who play joad recite in a most impressive manner the advice to the young prince terminate in these line : vous souvenant mon fil que caché sous ce lin comme eux vous fûtes pauvre et comme eux orphelin the interrogate scene between athalie and joad be give spiritedly but the rather abrupt and uncourtierlike reply to the queen 's remark il sont deux puissans dieux -- lui seul est dieu madame et le vôtre n'est rien -- excite a laugh and i fancy never fail to do so every time the piece be perform racine have several passage in he tragedy which perhaps have rather too much _ naiveté _ for the dignity of the cothurnus for instance in the answer of agamemnon to achille in the tragedy of _ iphigénie _ : puisque vous le savez pourquoi le demander a poet of to-day would be quiz for a line like the above but who dare venture to point out any defect in a author of whom voltaire have say and with justice too that the only criticism to be make of he -lrb- racine -rrb- would be to write under every page : admirable harmonieux sublime the costume and the decoration at the _ théâtre français _ be so strictly classical and appropriate in every respect that it be to I a source of high delight to witness the representation of the favorite piece of racine corneille molière and voltaire which i have so often read with so much pleasure in the closet and no small quantity of which i have by heart the next piece i saw be the _ cinnna _ of corneille and here it be that i beheld talma for the second time i be of course highly pleased tho ' i be rather far off to hear very distinctly this be however no very great loss as i be perfectly well acquaint with the tragedy talma 's gesture he pause 's he natural mode of act give a great relief to the long declamation with which this tragedy abound when this tragedy be give it be during the time that poor labédoyère 's trial be go on and the allusion to augustus ' clemency be eagerly seize and applaud it be hope that loui xviii would imitate augustus vain hope i have see _ phèdre _ the part of phèdre by that admirable actress mlle duchesnoi who perform the part so naturally and with so much passion that we entirely forget the extreme plainness of the person she act with far more feeling and pathos than mlle george i shall never be able to forget mlle duchesnoi in _ phèdre _ she give I a full idea of the impassioned queen nor be it possible to depict with greater fidelity the vénus toute entière à sa proie attachée as in that beautiful speech of phèdre to oenone wherein she reveal she passion for hippolyte and pourtray the terrible struggle between duty and female delicacy on the one hand and on the other a flame that could not be overcome convinced as it be of the complete inutility of further effort of resistance and invoke death as she only refuge i be move even to tear i be so great a admirer of the whole of this speech begin mon mal vient de plus lorn etc and end un reste de chaleur tout prêt à s ` exhaler that i think in it racine have not only unite the excellency of euripide sappho and theocritus in describe the passion of love but have far surpass they all that speech be certainly the masterpiece of french versification and scarcely inferior to it be that beautiful and ingenuous confession of love by hippolyte to aricie what a admirable _ pendant _ to the love of phèdre in hippolyte you behold the innocence simplicity and ingenuousness of a first and pure attachment : in phèdre the _ embrasement _ the ungovernable delirium of a criminal passion i have see mlle duchesnoi again in the _ mérope _ of voltaire and admire she more and more this be a admirable play the dialogue be so spirited the agitation of maternal tenderness and the occasional burst of feeling impossible to be restrain render this play one of the most interesting perhaps on the french stage and mlle duchesnoi give with the happiest effect she part in those two scene the first wherein she suppose egisthe to be the person who have kill she son in the other where have discover the reality of he person she be oblige to dissemble the discovery but on egisthe be about to be sacrifice she exclaim barbare c'est mon fil the part of egisthe be give by a young actor who make he appearance at this theater for the first tune and he execute he part with complete success -lrb- firmin i think be he name -rrb- lafond do the part of polyphonte and do it well at this tragedy many allusion be catch hold of by the audience accord as they be bourbonically or napoleonically incline at that part of polyphonte 's speech wherein he say : le premier quus fut rous fut un soldat heureux quus sert bien son pay n ' a pas besoin d'ayeux thunder of applause proceed from those who apply it to napoleon at the line : est il d'autre parti que celui de nos rois a loud shout and clap proceed from the royalist but i fancy if hand have be show these last would have be in a sad minority i have often amuse myself with compare the _ mérope _ of voltaire with that of maffeus and be puzzle to which to give the preference maffeus have make polyphonte a more odious and perhaps on that account a more theatrical character while voltaire 's polyphonte be more in real life in the play of voltaire he be a rough brutal soldier void of delicacy of feeling and not very scrupulous but not that praeternatural deep design villain that he be represent in the piece of maffeus in fact maffeus 's polyphonte appear too _ outré _ but then on the stage may not a little exaggeration be allow just as statue which be destine to be place in the open air or on column appear with greater effect when larger than the natural size alflerus seem to have give the preference to the mérope of voltaire i have see talma a second time in the part of nero in the britannicus of racine mlle george play the part of agrippina talma be nero from head to foot he very entry on the stage give a idea of the fiery and impatient character of the tyrant and in the scene between he and he mother agrippina nothing could be better delineate the forced calm of agrippina while reproach she son with he ingratitude and the impatience of nero to get rid of such a importunate monitress be give in a style impossible to be surpass talma 's dumb show during this scene be a masterpiece of the mimic art if talma give such effect to he rôles in a french drama where he be shackle by rule how much greater would he give on the english or german stage in a tragedy of shakespeare or schiller blank verse be certainly better adapt to tragedy than rhymed alexandrine but then the french language do not admit of blank verse and to write tragedy in prose unless they be tragedy in modern life would deprive they of all charm but after all i find the harmonious pomp and to use a phrase of pope 's the long majestic march and energy divine of the french alexandrine very please to the ear i be sure that the french poet deserve a great deal of credit for produce such masterpiece of versification from a language which however elegant be the least poetical in europe which allow little or no inversion scarce any poetic license no _ enjambement _ compel a fixed caesura have in horror the hiatus and in fine be subject to the most rigorous rule which can on no account be infringe which reject hyperbole which be measure by syllable the pronunciation of which be not feel in prose compel the alternative termination of a masculine or feminine rhyme and with all this require more perhaps than any other language that cacophony be sedulously avoid such be the difficulty a french poet have to struggle with he must unite the most harmonious sound with the finest thought in italian very often the natural harmony of the language and the music of the sound conceal the poverty of the thought besides italian poetry have innumerable licens which make it easy to figure in the tuscan parnassus and where anyone who can string together _ rime _ or _ versus sciolti _ be dignified with the appellation of a poet whereas from french poetry a mediocrity be and must be of necessity banish neither be it sufficient for a author to have sublime idea these must be file and prune inspiration can make a poet of a german a italian or a englishman because he may revel in unbounded license of metre and language but in french poetry inspiration be by no means sufficient severe study and constant practice be as indispensable as poetic verve to constitute a french poet the french poet be sensible of this and on this account they prefer imitate the ancient polish they rough marble and fitting it to the national taste to strike out a new path the abbé delille the best poet of we day that france have produce have go further he have read and admire the best english poet such as milton pope collin and goldsmith and have not disdain to imitate they yet he have imitate they with such elegance and judgment that he have leave nothing to regret on the part of those of he countryman who be not acquaint with english and he have render they beauty with such a force that a foreigner verse in both language who do not previously know which be the original and which the translation might take up passage in pope thomson collin and goldsmith and read parallel passage in delille and be extremely puzzle to distinguish the original : for none of the beauty be lose in these imitation and yet in prefer to imitate it must not be infer that he be deficient in original thought to return to the theater i have see mlle mar in the _ rôle _ of henriette in the _ femme savante _ of molière oh how admirable she be she realize completely the conception of a graceful and elegant frenchwoman of the first society she do not act she be at home as it be in she own salon smile at the silly pretension of she sister and at the ridiculous pedantry of trissotin she refusing the kiss because she do not understand greek be give with the greatest _ naiveté _ in a word mlle mar reign unrivalled as the first comic actress in europe i have see too _ les plaideurs _ of racine and _ les fourberies de scapin _ of molière both exceedingly well give particularly the scene in the latter wherein it be announce to géronte that he son have fall into the hand of a turkish corsair and he answer que diable allait-il faire dans la galère i have see also _ andromaque _ _ iphigénie _ and _ zaïre _ mlle volnai do the part of andromaque but the monotonous plaintiveness of she voice which never change weary I in _ iphigénie _ i be more gratify for mlle george do the part of clytemnestre and she sister a young girl of seventeen make she début in the part of iphigénie with great effect the two sister support each other wonderfully well and lafond do agamemnon very respectably mlle george the younger have succeed in _ iphigénie _ appear in the part of zaïre a bold attempt and tho ' she do it well and with much grace yet it be evidently too arduous a task for she the whole onus of this affect piece rest on the _ rôle _ of zaïre in the part where _ naiveté _ be require she succeed perfectly and she burst : mais orosmane m ` aime et j' be tout oublie be most happy but she be too faint and betray too little emotion in portray the struggle between she love for orosmane and the unsubdued symptom of attachment to she father and brother and to the religion of she ancestor in short where much passion and pathos be require there she prove unequal to the task but she have evidently all the quality and disposition towards become a good actress and with more study and practice i have no doubt that three or four year hence she will be fully equal to the difficult task of give effect to and portray to life the exquisitely touching and highly interesting _ rôle _ of zaïre she be not call for to appear on the stage after the termination of the performance tho ' frequently applaud during it the actor who do the part of orosmane in that scene wherein he discover he have kill zaïre unjustly give a groan which have a unhappy effect it be such a awkward one that it make all the audience laugh no people catch ridicule so soon as the french what i principally admire on the french stage be that the actor be always perfect in they part and all the character be well sustain the performance never flag for a moment and i have experience infinitely more pleasure in behold the drama of racine and voltaire than those of shakespeare and for this reason that on we stage for one good actor you have the many who be exceedingly bad and who do not comprehend they author : you feel consequently a _ hiatus valde deflendus _ when the principal actor or actress be not on the stage i have be delighted to see kemble and mr siddon and miss o'neil and while they be on the stage i be all eye and ear but the other actor be always so inferior that the contrast be too obvious and it only serve to make more conspicuous the flagging of interest that pervade the tragedy of shakespeare _ macbeth _ alone perhaps excepted i speak only of shakespeare 's fault as a dramaturgus and they be rather the fault of he age than he own for in everything else i think he the greatest litterary genius that the world ever produce and i place he far above any poet ancient or modern yet in allow all this i do not at all wonder that he dramatic piece do not in general please foreigner and that they be disgust with the low buffoonery interruption of interest and want of arrangement that ought of necessity to constitute a drama for i feel the same objection myself when read shakespeare and often lose patience but then when i come to some sublime passage i become wrapt up in it alone and totally forget the piece itself in order to inspire a foreigner with admiration for shakespeare i would not give he he play to read entire but i would present he with a _ recueil _ of the most beautiful passage of that great poet and i be sure he would be so delighted with they that he would readily join in the all hail that the british nation award he thus you may perceive the distinction i make between the creative genius who design and the artist who fill up the canvas between the poet and the dramaturgus i be probably singular in my taste as a englishman when i tell you that i prefer shakespeare for the closet and racine or voltaire or corneille for the stage : and with regard to english tragedy i prefer as a act drama home 's _ dougla _ -lrb- 46 -rrb- to any of shakespeare 's _ macbeth _ alone except and for this plain reason that the interest in _ dougla _ never flag nor be divert in give my mite of admiration to the french stage i be fully aware of its fault of the long declamation and the _ fade galanterie _ that prevail before voltaire make the grand reform in that particular : and on this account i prefer voltaire as a tragedian to racine and corneille the _ phédre _ and _ athalie _ of racine be certainly masterpiece and little inferior to they be _ iphigénie andromaque _ and _ britannicus _ but in the other i think he must be pronounced inferior to voltaire as a proof of my argument i need only cite _ zaïre alzire mahomet sémiramis l'orphelin de la chine brutus _ voltaire have i think unite in he dramatic writings the beauty of corneille racine and crébillon and have avoid they fault this however be not i believe the opinion of the french in general but i follow my own judgment in affair of taste and if anything please I i wait not to ascertain whether the master have say so it show a delicate attention on the part of the director of the _ théâtre français _ now that so many foreigner of all nation be here to cause to be represent every night the masterpiece of the french classical dramatic author since these be piece that every foreigner of education have read and admire and he would much rather go to see act a play with which he be thoroughly acquaint than a new piece of one which he have not read for as the recitation be extremely rapid it would not be so easy for he to seize and follow it without previous reading of molière i have already see the _ avare _ the _ femme savante _ and the _ fourbery de scapin _ since these i have see the _ tartuffe _ and _ george dandin _ both inimitably perform how i enjoy the scene of the _ pauvre homme _ in the _ tartuffe _ and the lecture give to george dandin by m and mme de sotenville wherein they recount the virtue and merit of they respective ancestor of molière indeed there be but one opinion throughout europe in the comic line he bear away the palm unrivalled and here i fully agree with the general i must not quit the subject of french theatricals without speaking of the _ opéra comique _ at the _ théâtre faydeau _ it be to the sort of light piece that be give here that the french music be peculiarly appropriate and it be here that you seize and feel the beauty and melody of the national music these little _ chanson _ _ romance _ and _ arietta _ be so please to the ear that they imprint themselves durably on the memory which be no equivocal proof of they merit i can not say as much for the tragic singing in the _ opéra serium _ at the grand french opera which to my ear sound a perfect psalmody there be but one language in the world for tragic recitative and that be italian on the other hand in the _ genre _ of the _ opéra comique _ the french stage be far superior to the italian in the french comedy everything be graceful and natural the italian can not catch this happy medium so that they comedy and comic

french soldiery who can be accuse of plunder and exaction but what bring the french name in disrepute be the conduct of certain _ prefect _ and _ administrator _ in germany who be promote to these post for no other reason than because they be of the old _ noblesse _ or return _ emigrant _ whom napoleon favor in preference to the republican whom he fear these emigrant repay he favor with the basest ingratitude after be guilty of the grossest and most infamous _ concussion _ on the inhabitant of those part of germany where they jurisdiction extend they have the hypocrisy after the restoration to declaim against the oppression of the _ usurper 's _ government and its system : but napoleon richly deserve to meet with this ingratitude for employ such unprincipled fellow i believe he be never aware of the villany they carry on or they would have meet with he severest displeasure in be remove from office as be the case with wirion at verdun -lrb- 49 -rrb- i do not find that the french soldier with whom i have converse be so much attach to the person of the emperor as i be lead to believe but they be attach to they country and liberty and in serve he they conceive they be serve the man _ par excellence _ of the people the french army too be beloved by the people instead of be dread by they as the army of most other european nation be in short whenever i meet with and hold conversation with soldier of this army i be always tempt to address they in the word of elvira to pizarro when she seek to console he for he defeat : yet think another morning shall arise nor

after when i address they in german and explain to they the behavior of the boy they scold he severely for he impertinence to we and threaten he with the _ schlag _ should it occur again the rest of

during the time of the continental blockade as it be the central depôt of the commerce between france and italy napoleon be much respect and regret here and with reason as he be a great benefactor to this city the lyonnese be too frank too open in they sentiment and too grateful not to render justice to he great talent and good quality while they blame and deplore he ambition in fact a experience of a few day and some acquaintance i make here have give I a very favourable impression of the inhabitant of this city the man be frank in they manners polite well inform and free from all frivolity the woman be in general handsome well shaped and have much grace and be exceedingly well educate they seem totally free from the _ petite-maîtressism _ of the parisian woman and both sex seem to possess a good deal of what the french term _ caractère _ have the parisian resemble the lyonnese pari would never have fall twice into the hand of the enemy nor would the lyonnese woman have welcome the entry of the invader into they city with wave handkerchief etc these quality of the inhabitant the beauty of the country and the cheapness of all the comfort and luxury of life would make lyon one of the most agreeable place of residence to a foreigner of liberal sentiment and principle cloth and silk be the staple manufacture of lyon particularly the latter i accompany my friend mr m -- to see he fabrique of silk which be of considerable extent and importance and everything appear to I as far as one totally ignorant of the business and its process could judge admirably regulate and rapid in its execution the _ tournure _ of the _ grisette _ of lyon be very striking and they possess completely the _ grata protervita _ the _ vultus nimium lubricus aspicus _ which horace so much admire in glycera i visit both the theater here viz : the _ grand théâtre _ situate near the _ hôtel de ville _ and the smaller one call the _ théâtre des célestins _ at the former be some good dancing and at the latter i be engage in a conversation which i can not forbear cite as it will serve to show the dislike the people have to the feudal system and the dread they have of its re-establishment tho ' they can know nothing about it except by tradition the piece perform be call _ le petit poucet _ -lrb- tom thumb and the ogre -rrb- but i miss my old acquaintance the ogre and he seven-league boot of mother goose and find that in this melodrama he be transform into a tyrannical and capricious _ seigneur féodal _ there be a very pretty young lady about 16 year of age accompany by she father in the same box with I and i observe to she où est donc l'ogre il parait que l'on en a fait un seigneur féodal ouus monsieur -lrb- she reply -rrb- et avec raison car il étaient bien les ogres de ce temps là

study english and that she father be a miniature painter i take leave of she not without feel much affect and my heart not a little percosso dall ' amoroso strale i must not forget to mention that there be a most spacious and magnificent building on the _ quaus du rhône _ to the north of the bridge which serve as a café and ridotto or assembly room for ball etc i be afraid to say how many foot it have in length but it be the most superb establishment of the kind i have ever meet with fortunately for the city of lyon the famous decree of robespierre for its destruction and the column with the inscription lyon a porté les armes contre la liberté lyon n'est plus which be to occupy its place be never put in execution and tho ' this city suffer much from revolutionary vandalism yet it soon recover and have flourish ever since in a manner unheard of at any former period no people be more sensible than the lyonnese of the great benefit produce by the revolution and no people more deprecate a return to the _ ancien régime _ oct 2nd geneva i start in the diligence for geneva on the 28th sept and find it exceedingly cold on ascend the mountain call the _ cerdon _ the scenery be savage and wild and the road in many part be on the brink of precipice we stop at nantua for supper and partook of some excellent trout there be a large lake near the town and ` tis here that the swiss landscape begin command a narrow pass stand the fort of l'ecluse the austrians lose a great many man in attempt to force it from this place you have a noble view of the alp and mont-blanc towering above they as this be the first time i beheld these celebrated mountain i be transport with delight and my mind be fill with a thousand classical and historical recollection the scenery the whole way from fort l'ecluse to geneva be most magnificent and uncommonly vary mountain and valley winter and summer on the same territory descend the city of geneva open gradually you behold the lake leman and the rhône issue from it we enter the city which be fortify and after cross the double bridge across the rhône we arrive at the _ hôtel de l'eau de genève _ at 12 o'clock the most striking thing in the city of geneva to the traveller 's eye as he enter it be the view of the arcade on each side of the street excellent for pedestrian and for protection against sun and rain but which give a heavy and gloomy appearance to the city a immense number of watch-maker be another distinguish feature in this city the first thing shewn to I by my _ valet de place _ be the house where jean jacque rousseau be bear i then desire he to shew I the spot where that barbarian calvin cause to be burn the unhappy servetus for not have the same religious opinion as himself the most agreeable promenade of the city be on the bastion and rampart a place call _ la treille _ and a garden or park of small extent call _ plain palais _ in this park stand on a column the bust of jj rousseau this park be the scene of a great deal of bloodshed in 1791 on account of political dispute between the aristocratic and democratic party or rather between the admirer and imitator of the french revolution and those who dread such innovation this affair excite so much horror and the recollection of it operate so powerfully on the imagination of the inhabitant that the place become entirely abandon as a public promenade and avoid as a polluted spot for many year very likely however a sort of lustration have take place a oration be pronounced and the place again declare worthy of contribute to the recreation of the inhabitant it be now become the favorite promenade of the citizen of geneva tho ' there be still some who can not get over they old prejudice and never set they foot in it there be likewise a pleasant walk as far as the town of carrouge in savoy which town have be lately cede by the king of sardinium to the republic of geneva in geneva the sentiment of the inhabitant do not seem to be favourable either to the french revolution or to napoleon they political idea accord very much with those profess by the government party in england and they make a great parade of they just now as a means of court the favor of england and of the ally sovereign the government here have shew a great disposition to second the view of the ally power in persecute those frenchman who have be proscribe by the bourbon government this state lose its independence during the revolutionary war and be incorporate with france as the citizen be suspect of be more favourable to the english than suit the policy of the french government of that time they be view with a jealous eye and i believe some individual be harshly treat but what most vex and displeased they be the enforcement of the conscription among they for the genevoi do not like compulsion they be besides more pacific than war-like and tho ' like the dutch they have display great valor where they interest be at stake yet mercury be a deity far more in veneration among they than bellona the natural talent of this people be great and it have be favor and develop by the freedom of they institution and this republic have produce too many eminent man for that talent to be call in question they seem to have decide talent and disposition for financial operation a genevoi have the aptitude of great application unite to a very discerning natural genius and he generally succeed in everything he undertake literature be much cultivate here and the female who be in general handsome and graceful excel not only in the various feminine accomplishment such as music dancing and drawing but they carry they research into the higher branch of litterature and science and acquire with great facility foreign language it be true that you now and then meet with a little pedantry on the part of the young man and some of the young woman be _ tant soit feu précieuses _ and you may guess from they conversation which be sometimes force that the person who speak have be learn he discourse by heart from some book in the morning with the intention of sport it as a natural conversation in the evening in short one do not meet with that _ abandon _ in society that be to be meet with in paris you must measure you word well to shine in a genevese society this however be a very pardonable sort of coxcombry and tho ' it appear sometimes pedantic and occasionally laughable yet it tend to encourage learning and science and compel the young man to read in order to shine and captivate the fair the genevese woman make excellent wife and mother and many stranger strike with they beauty and talent as well as with the _ agrémens _ of the country in general marry at geneva and settle themselves there for life it be observe that the genevoise be so attach to they country that on form a matrimonial connection with foreigner they always stipulate that they shall not be remove from it on the dismemberment of the empire of napoleon geneva be _ agregé _ to the helvetic confederation as a independent canton of which there be now twenty-two three viz geneva vaud and neufchatel be french in language and manners one the tessino be italian and the remain eighteen be all german it be a great advantage to geneva to belong to the helvetic confederacy as formerly when she be a isolate independent state she be in continual dread of be swallow up by one or other of she two powerful neighbor france and the king of sardinium and only exist by they forbearance and mutual jealousy i walk out one morning to ferney in order to visit the chateau of voltaire and to do hommage to the memory of that great man the benefactor of the human race it be he who give the mortal blow to superstition and to the power of the clergy it be the fashion for priest ultra and tory to rail against he but i judge he by he work and the effect of he work he memory be hold in reverence by the inhabitant of ferney as they father and benefactor he spend he whole fortune in act of the most disinterested charity he save entire family from ruin and portion off many a young woman who be deprive of the gift of fortune and enable they to form happy matrimonial connection in short do good seem to have be one of the most ardent passion of he soul in three memorable instance he shew he hatred of cruelty and injustice and unmask triumphantly ecclesiastical imposture and fanaticism he have be reproach with vanity but surely that may be pardon in a man who receive the hommage of the whole literary world who be consider as a oracle and whose every sentence be record whose talent be so universal that he excel in every branch of litterature that he undertake ferney which be only a miserable village when voltaire first take up he residence there be now a large flourish and opulent town i find voltaire 's chateau occupy by a fat heavy swiss officer who be on duty there ferney be at this moment occupy by the troops of the swiss confederation he be at breakfast but on my state to he that i be come to see the apartment of voltaire he direct the housekeeper to shew they to I on the left hand side after ascend a flight of step before you come into the château be a chapel build by voltaire with this simple inscription : _ deo erexit voltaire _ in the apartment usually occupy by he for the purpose of composition be preserve he chair table inkstand and bed as sacred relic and in the salon be to be see the portrait of several public character he contemporary and which be constantly append there in he life time among these portrait i distinguish those of frederick the great of prussium catherine ii of russium lekain diderot alembert franklin helvetius marmontel and washington besides many other there be nothing remarkable either in the château or in the garden appertain to it but as it stand on a elevation it command a fine view which be so well describe in that ode which begin : ô maison d'aristippe ô jardin d'epicure i return to geneva and dine with my friend m picot the banker who present I to he brother 's family which i find a very amiable one and i be particularly delighted with he father a fine venerable old man who be a pastor of the church of geneva and a great admirer of we poet thomson and milton i have make acquaintance at the _ ecu de genève _ with a very gallant and accomplished officer the chevalier zadera a pole by birth and a colonel in the french army -lrb- 51 -rrb- he have be on the staff of the prince d'eckmühl at hamburgh and have serve previously in st domingo in germany and in italy he have just quit the french service have a great repugnance to serve under the bourbon dynasty and he be about to go to italy on private business he seem a very well inform man and well verse in french italian and german litterature he also understand well to read and write english and speak it but not at all fluently he acquire he english in the united state of america whither he go when he escape from the horror of st domingo by the american he be receive with open arm and unbounded hospitality as the compatriot of pulaskus who fall gloriously fight in they cause the cause of liberty at the battle of savannah he be liberally supply with money by several individual without the smallest expectation or chance of repayment at the time and be forward in this manner from town to town and from state to state throughout the whole union so that the tour he make and the time he pass in that land of liberty he reckon as far the most agreeable epoch of he life one evening at the _ ecu de genève _ i find zadera in altercation on political subject with two french ultra who have be emigrant a genevoi and a bernoi both anti-liberal this be fearful odds for poor zadera to be alone against four _ acharnés _ i sit down and espouse he cause and we maintain we argument gloriously the dispute begin on the occasion of zadera condemn the harshness shewn by the government of geneva towards the _ conventionnel _ and other who be banish from france on the second restoration of loui xviii by a vote of the _ chambre introuvable _ in refuse they a asylum in the republic and compelling they to depart immediately in a very contumelious manner i say it be inconsistent and unworthy of the genevese who call themselves republican to persecute or join in the persecution of the republican of france in order to please foreign despot the other then begin to be very violent with I i reply monsieur vous avez beau parler les genevois sont de très bons cambistes et les meilleurs banquiers de l'europe mais il ne sont pas bons républicains geneva have be so often describe by tourist that i shall not attempt any description except to remark that there be several good cabinet and collection of picture belong to individual there be a magnificent public library the manufacture be those of watch and model of the alp which be exceedingly ingenious there be no theatrical amusement here and during divine service on Sunday the gate of the city be shut and neither ingress nor egress permit fortunately they liturgy -lrb- the calvinistic -rrb- be at least one hour shorter than the anglican ball and concert take place here very often and the young genevoi of both sex be generally proficient in music they amuse themselves too in summer with the tir de l'arc in common with all the swiss canton October 3rd i have be in doubt whether i should go to lausanne return to pari or extend my journey into italy but i have at length decide for the latter as zadera who intend to start immediately for milan have offer I a place in he carriage _ à frai commun _ i find he so agreeable a man and possess sentiment so analogous to my own that i eagerly embrace the offer and we be to cross the simplon so that i shall behold a travel over that magnificent _ chausée _ make by napoleon 's order which i have so much desire to see and which everybody tell I be a most stupendous work and exceed anything ever make by the roman as the chevalier have serve in italy and be much _ répandu _ in society there i could not possibly have a pleasanter companion he have with he dante and alfierus and i have gessner 's _ idyll _ and my constant travel companion ariosto so that we shall have no loss for conversation for when we native wit be exhaust a page or two from any of the above author will suggest innumerable idea anecdote and subject of discourse milan 10th oct we start from geneva at seven in the morning of the 4th October and in half a hour enter the savoyard territory of which _ douanier _ with blue cockade -lrb- the cockade of the king of sardinium -rrb- give we intimation the road be on the south side of the lake leman in evian and thonon the two first village we pass thro ' we do not find that _ aisance _ comfort and cleanliness that be perceivable on the other side of the lake in the delightful canton de vaud the double yoke of priestcraft and military despotism press hard upon the unhappy savoyard and wring from he he hard-earned pittance while no people be better off than the vaudoi yet the savoyard be to the full as deserving of liberty as the swiss the savoyard possess honesty fidelity and industry in a superior degree and these quality he seldom or ever lose even when expose to the temptation of a great metropolis like pari to which they be compel to emigrate as they own country be too poor to furnish the means of subsistence to all its population when in paris and other large city the savoyard contrive by the most indefatigable industry and incredible frugality to return to they native village after a certain lapse of time with a little fortune that be amply sufficient for they comfort the poorest savoyard in paris never fail to remit something for the support of he parent both voltaire and rousseau have render justice to the good quality of this honest people it be a thousand pity that this country -lrb- savoy -rrb- be not either incorporate with france or make to form part of the helvetic confederacy on pass by la meillerie we be remind of la nouvelle héloise and the word of st preux : le rocher est escarpé : l'eau est profonde et je suis au désespoir on the opposite side of the lake be to be see the little white town of claren the suppose residence of the divine julie a little beyond st gingolph which lie at the eastern extremity of the lake we quit savoy and enter into the valai which now form a component part of the helvetic confederacy german be the language speak in the valai as the high road into italy pass thro ' the whole length of this canton napoleon cause it to be separate from the helvetic union and to form a republic apart with the ulterior view and which he afterwards carry into execution of annex it to the french empire the valai form a long and exceedingly narrow valley thro ' the whole length of which the rhône flow and fall into the lake leman at st gingolph the breadth of this valley in its widest part be not more probably than 1000 yard and in most place considerably narrower and it be enclose on each side or rather wall up by the immense mountain of the higher alp which rise here very abruptly and seem to shut out this valley from the rest of the world the high road run nearly parallel to the course of the rhône and be sometimes on one side of the river and sometimes on the other communicate by bridge from the sinuosity of the road and the different point of view present by the salient and re-enter angle of the mountain the scenery be extremely picturesque grand and striking and as sometimes no outlet present itself to view you do not perceive how you be ever to get out of this valley but by a stratagem similar to that of sindbad in the valley of diamond at st maurice be a remarkable one-arched bridge build by the roman we stop at martigny to pass the night within one mile of martigny and before arrive at it we perceive the celebrated waterfall call the _ pissevache _ and the appellation though coarse be perfectly applicable from martigny a bridle road branch off which lead across the grand st bernard to aoste the next morning we arrive at sion call in the language of the country sitten the metropolis of the valai it be a neat-looking and tolerably large town and which from its position might be make a most formidable military post as there be a steep hill close to it which rise abruptly from the center of the valley and command a extensive view east and west work erect on this height would enfilade the whole road either way and totally obstruct the approach of a enemy there be besides a large castle on the southern _ parous _ of mountain which hem in this valley which would expose to a most galling fire and take in flank completely those who should attempt to force the passage whether come from st maurice or brieg we stop two hour at sion to mend a wheel and this give I time to ascend the mountain on which the castle stand there be several mason and workman employ in the construction of a church which they be erect at the request and entire expense of he sardinian majesty i could not ascertain what be the reason that induce the king to build a church in a foreign territory i do not observe either on the road or in any of the village thro ' which we pass any striking specimen of valaisan female beauty but i often remark the prominent bosom that rousseau describe as frequent among they we meet with several _ crétins _ or idiot all of whom have _ goitre _ in a greater or less degree these _ soul of god without sin _ as the crétins be call be very merry soul they always appear to be laugh they seem to have adopt and unite three system of philosophy : they be diogene as to independence and neglect of decency and cleanliness democritus as to they disposition to laugh perpetually and aristippus inasmuch as they seem to be perfectly contented with they state they be in general fat and well feed for the poorest inhabitant give they something they have a good deal of cunning and many curious anecdote be related of they which shew that they be endowed with a sort of sagacity resemble the instinct of animal i recollect one myself mention by zimmermann in he essay on solitude of a crétin who be accustom to imitate with he voice the sound of the village clock whenever it strike the hour and quarter one day by some accident the clock stop yet the cretin go through the chime of the hour and quarter with the same regularity as the clock would have do have it be go we arrive at night at the village of brieg at the foot of the simplon and put up at a very comfortable inn brieg and glisse be two small village lie within a quarter of a mile distance from each other the direct road run thro ' brieg and be a great advantage to this town while glisse lose this benefit from the opposition shewn by its inhabitant to the annexation of the valai to the french empire they now deeply regret this refusal as few traveller chuse to stop at glisse _ passage of the simplon _ chus mi darà la voce e le parole convenientus a si nobil soggetto -lrb- 52 -rrb- who will vouchsafe I voice that shall ascend as high as i would raise my noble theme -- trans w rise how shall i describe the simplon and the impression that magnificent piece of work the _ chaussée _ across it make on my mind on arrival at the village of the simplon which lie at nearly the greatest elevation off the road and be more than half-way across i write in my enthusiasm for the author of this gigantic work the follow line : o viaggiator se avessi tu veduto quel monte pria che fosse il cammin fatto leverestus le mani e stupefatto diresti chus l'avrebbe mai creduto son come quel d'alcide i tuoi miracoli vincesti napoleon ' più grandus ostacolus imagine a fine road or causeway broad enough for three carriage to go abreast cut in the flank of the mountain wind along they contour sometimes zigzag on the flank of one ravine and sometimes turn off nearly at right angle to the flank of another separate from each other by precipice of tremendous depth and communicate by one-arched bridge of surprising boldness besides stone bridge at each re-enter angle to let pass off the water which flow from the innumerable cascade which fall from the summit of the mountain ice and snow eternal on the various _ pic _ or _ aiguille _ -lrb- as the summit be here call -rrb- which tower above you head and yet in the midst of these _ belle horreur _ the road be so well construct so smooth and the slope so gentle that when there be fog which often happen here and prevent you from behold the surround scenery you would suppose you be travel on a plain the whole time balustrade be affix on the side of the most abrupt precipice and buttress also in order to secure the exterior part of the _ chaussèe _ on the whole length of the _ chaussèe _ on the exterior side be conical stone of four foot in height at ten pace distant from each other in order to mark the road in case of its be cover with snow there be besides _ maison de refuge _ or cottage at a distance of one league from each other wherein be station person to give assistance and food to traveller or passenger who may be detain by the snow storm there be always in these cabin a plentiful supply of biscuit cheese salt and smoked meat wine brandy and fire-wood in those part of the road where the side of the ravine be not slope enough to admit of the road be cut along they subterraneous gallery have be pierce through the rock some of fifty some of a hundred and more yard in length and nearly as broad as the rest of the road in a word it appear to I the grandest work imagine or make by man and when combine with its extreme utility far surpass what be related of the seven wonder of the world there be fifty-two bridge throughout the whole of this route which begin at the distance of three mile from geneva skirt the southern shore of the lake run thro ' the whole valai traverse the simplon and issue from the gorge of the mountain at domo d'ossolum terminate at rho in the milanese from brieg to the toll-house the highest part of the road the distance be about 18 mile it make I dreadfully giddy to look down the various precipice and what add to the vertigo one feel be the deafening noise of the various waterfall as the road be cut zigzag in many part you appear to preserve nearly the same distance from brieg after three hour ' march as after half a hour only since you have that village continually under you eye nor do you lose sight of it till near the toll-house brieg appear when view from various point of the road like the card-house of child the valai like a slip of green baize and the rhône like a very narrow light blue ribband and when at brieg before you ascend you look up at the toll-house you would suppose it impossible for any human be to arrive at such a height without the help of a balloon it remind I of the castle of the enchanter in the _ orlando furioso _ who keep ruggiero confine and who ride on the hippogriff the village of the simplon be a mile beyond the toll-house descend we stop there for two hour to dine a snow storm have fall and the weather be exceedingly cold the mountain air have sharpen we appetite but we could get nothing but fish and egg as it be a _ jour maigre _ and the valaisan be rigid observer of the ordinance of the catholic church we however on assure the landlord that we be _ militaire _ prevail on he to let we have some ham and sausage german be the language here the road from the toll-house to domo d'ossolum -lrb- the first town at the foot of the mountain on the italian side -rrb- be a descent but the slope be as gentle as on the rest of the road fifteen mile beyond the village of the simplon stand the village of isellum which be the frontier town of the king of sardinium and where there be a rigorous _ douane _ and ten mile further be domo d'ossolum where we arrive at seven in the evening between isellum and domo d'ossola the scenery become more and more romantic vary at every step cataract fall on all side and three more gallery to pass domo d'ossolum appear a large and neat clean town and we put up at a very good inn at isellum begin the italian language or rather piedmontese the next morning we proceed on we journey till we reach fariolo which be on the northern extremity of the _ lago maggiore _ the road from domo d'ossolum thro ' the village of ornavasso and vagogna be thro ' a fertile and picturesque valley or rather gorge of the mountain narrow at first but which gradually widen as you approach to the lake the river toso run nearly in a parallel direction with the road the air be much milder than in switzerland and you soon perceive the change of climate from its temperature as well as from the appearance of the vine and mulberry tree and indian corn call in this country _ grano turco _ at fariolo after breakfast my friend zadera take leave of I and embark he carriage on the lake in order to proceed to lugano and i who be bind to milan have hire a cabriolet proceed to arona after stop one hour to refresh the horse at belgirate the whole road from fariolo to arona be on the bank of the _ lago maggiore _ and nothing can be more neat than the appearance of all these little town which be solidly and handsomely build in the italian taste before i arrive at arona and at a distance of two mile from it i stop in order to ascend a height at a distance of one-eighth of a mile from the road to view the celebrated colossal statue in bronze of st charle borromaeus which may be see at a great distance it be seventy cubit high situate on a pedestal of twenty foot to ascend which require a ladder you then enter between he leg or rather the fold of he gown and ascend a sort of staircase till you reach he head there be something so striking in the appearance of this black gigantic figure when view from afar and still more when you be at the foot of it that you would suppose yourself live in the time of fairy and enchanter and it strongly remind I of the arabian night as if the statue be the work of some génie or perus or as if it be some rebel genius transform into black marble by solomon the great prophet i be not very well acquaint with the life and adventure of this saint but he be of the borromean family who be the most opulent proprietor of the milanese every tract of land palace castle farm in the environs of arona seem to belong to they if you ask whose estate be that whose villa be that whose castle be that the answer be to the count borromeo who seem to be as universal a proprietor here as _ nong-tong-paw _ at pari or _ monsieur kaniferstane _ at amsterdam -lrb- 53 -rrb- arona be a large straggling but solidly build town and present nothing worth notice we proceed on we journey the next morning shortly after leave arona the road diverge from the lake and traverse a thick wood until it reach the bank of the tessino on the other bank of which communicate by means of a fly bridge stand the town of sesto calende the tessino divide and form the boundary between the sardinian and austrian territory and sesto calende be the frontier of he imperial royal and apostolic majesty after a rigorous search of my portmanteau at the _ douane _ and exhibit my passport i be allow to proceed on my journey to milan at rho where i stop to dine stand a remarkably ancient tree say to have be plant in the time of augustus the country present a perfect plain highly cultivate all the way from sesto to milan the _ chaussée _ be broad and admirably well keep up and line on both side with poplar the road in lombardy be certainly the finest in europe i enter milan by the gate which lead direct to the esplanade between the citadel and the city and drive to the _ pension suisse _ which be in a street close to the cathedral and ducal palace milan 12 October i be just return from the _ teatro della scala _ renown for its immense size : it certainly be the most stupendous theater i ever behold and even surpass the expectation i have form of it so much so that i remain for some minute lose in astonishment i be much strike with the magnificence of the scenery and decoration a _ opera _ and _ ballo _ be give every night and the same be repeat for a month when they be replace by new one the box be all hire by the year by the different noble and opulent family and in the _ parterre _ the price be only thirty soldus or sous about fifteen penny english for which you be fully as well regale as at the _ grand opéra _ at paris for three and a half franc and far better than at the italian theater in london for half a guinea the opera i see represent be call _ l'italiana in algieri _ opera buffa by rossinus the _ ballo _ be one of the most magnificent spectacles i ever behold the scenery and decoration be of the first class and superior even to those of the _ grand opéra _ at paris the _ ballo _ be call _ il cavaliere del tempio _ the story be take from a occurrence that form a episode in the history of the crusade and which have already furnish to walter scott the subject of a very please ballad entitle the _ fire-king _ or _ count albert and fair rosalie _ battle of foot and horse with real horse christian and moslem dance incantation excellent and very appropriate music leave nothing to be desire to the ravished spectator in the _ ballo _ all be do in pantomime and the acting be perfect the italian seem to inherit from they ancestor the faculty of represent by dumb show the emotion of the mind as well as the gesture of the body and in this they excel all other modern nation the dancing be not quite so good as what one see at the pari theater and besides that sort of dancing they be very fond in italy of grotesque dance which appear to I to be mere _ tour de force _ but the decoration be magnificent and the cost must be great it be a fine moonlight night on my return from the _ scalum _ which give a very please effect to the _ duomo _ or cathedral as i pass by it the innumerable aiguille or spire of the most exquisite and delicate workmanship taper and terminate in point all newly whiten give such a appearance of airiness and lightness to this beautiful building that it look more visionary than substantial and as if a strong puff of wind would blow it away the next morning i go to visit the cathedral in detail it stand in the place call _ piazza del duomo _ on this _ piazza _ stand also the ducal palace the principal cafés and the most splendid shop be in the same _ piazza _ which form the morning lounge of milan parallel to one side of the _ duomo _ run the _ corsia de ' servi _ the widest and most fashionable street in milan the resort of the _ beau monde _ in the evening and lead directly out to the _ porta orientale _ the cathedral appear to I certainly the most striking gothic edifice i ever behold it be as large as the cathedral of notre dame at paris and the architecture of the interior be very massive there be little internal ornament however except the tomb or mausoleum of st charle borromeo round which be a magnificent railing there be also the statue of this saint and of st ambrogio there be several well-executed bas-relief on the outside of the church from scripture subject and the view from any of the balcony of the spire be very extensive on the north the alp cover with snow and appear to rise abruptly within a very short horizon tho ' they distance from milan be at least sixty or seventy mile and on all the other side a vast and well-cultivated plain as far as the eye can reach thickly stud with town and village and the immense city of milan nine mile in circumference at you foot the street in general in milan be well pave there be a line of trottoir on each side of the street equi-distant from the line of house so that these trottoir seem to be make for the carriage wheel to roll on and not for the foot passenger who must keep within the space that lie between the trottoir and line of house with the exception of the _ piazza del duomo _ there be scarcely anything that can be call a _ piazza _ in all milan unless irregular and small open place may be dignified with that name the house and building be extremely solid in they construction and handsome in they appearance a canal run thro ' the city and lead to pavia on this canal be stone bridge of a very solid construction the shop in milan be well store with merchandize and make a very brilliant display the finest street without doubt be the _ corsia de ' servi _ in the part of it that lie parallel to the cathedral it be about as broad as the _ rue st honoré _ at pari but two hundred yard beyond it it suddenly widen and be then broader than portland place the whole way to the _ porta orientale _ on the left hand of this street on proceed from the cathedral to the _ porta orientale _ be a beautiful and extensive garden a ornamental iron railing separate it from the street from the number of fine tree here there be so much shade therefrom that it form a very agreeable promenade during the heat of the day on the right hand side of the _ corsia de ' servi _ proceeding from the cathedral be the finest building -lrb- house of individual -rrb- in milan among which i particularly distinguish a superb palace build in the best grecian taste with a colonnaded portico surmount by eight column just outside the _ porta orientale _ be the _ corso _ with a fine spacious road with _ allées _ on each side line with tree the _ corso _ form the evening drive and _ promenade à cheval _ of the _ beau monde _ i have see nowhere except in hyde park such a brilliant show of equipage as on the corso of milan i observe that the woman display a great _ luxe de parure _ at this promenade the woman here appear to I in general handsome and report say not at all cruel they have quite a _ fureur _ for dress and ornament hi the adapting of which however they have not so much taste as the french woman have the milanese woman do not understand the _ simplicité recherchée _ in they attire and be too fond of glare color the milanese woman be accuse of be too fond of wine and a calculation have be make that two bottle _ per diem _ be drink by each female in milan but suppose this calculation be true let not the english be startle for the wine of this country be exceedingly light lighter indeed than the weakest burgundy wine indeed i conceive that two bottle of lombard wine be scarce equivalent in strength to four wine glass of port wine the lombard for this reason never drink water with they wine and indeed it be not necessary for i be afraid that all the wine drink in milan be already baptise before it leave the hand of the vendor except that reserve for the priesthood such at any rate be the case before the french revolution and no doubt the wine seller would oppose the abolition of so _ ancient _ and _ sacred _ a custom the milanese be a gay people hospitable and fond of pleasure : they be more addict to the pleasure of the table than the other people of italy and dinner party be in consequence much more frequent here than in other italian town the woman here be say to be much better educate than in the rest of italy for napoleon take great pain to promote and encourage female instruction well know that to be the best means of regenerate a country the dialect speak in the milanese have a harsh nasal accent to my ear peculiarly disagreeable pure italian or tuscan be little speak here and that only to foreigner french on the contrary be speak a good deal but the milanese male and female among one another speak invariably the _ patois _ of the country which have more analogy to the french than to the italian but without the grace or euphony of either i have visit likewise the _ zecca _ or mint where i observe the whole process of coin they still continue to coin here napoleon of gold and silver with the date of 1814 and they coin likewise crown or dollar with marium theresa 's head with the date of the last year of she reign the double napoleon of forty _ franchus _ of the kingdom of italy be a beautiful coin on the run be the word _ dio protegge l'italium _ it may not be unnecessary to remark that in italy by the word _ napoleone _ as a coin be mean the five franc piece with the head of napoleon and a twenty franc gold piece be call _ napoleone d'oro _ at the _ zecca _ i be show some gold silver and bronze medal strike in commemoration of the formation of the lombardo-venetian kingdom under the sceptre of austrium they bear the follow inscription which if i recollect aright be from horace : redeunt in aurum tempora priscum -lrb- 54 -rrb- but this golden age be consider by the italian as a very leaden one and it seem to bear as much analogy to the golden age as the base austrian copper coin daub over with silver and make to pass for fifteen and thirty soldus have to the real gold and silver _ napoleonus _ which by the way be say to be fast disappear they be send to vienna and milan will probably be in time bless with a similar paper currency to that of vienna napoleon seem to be as much regret by the milanese as the austrian government be abhor in fact everybody speak with horror and disgust of the _ aspro boreal scettro _ and of the _ aquilum che mangium doppio _ a allusion take from the arm of austrium the double-headed eagle i have visit the ancient ducal now the royal palace it be a spacious building chaste in its external appearance but its ulterior very magnificent its chiefest treasure be the various costly column and pilaster of marble and of _ jaune antique _ which be to be meet with the _ salle de danse _ be peculiarly elegant and in one of the apartment be a fine painting on the plafond represent jupiter hurl thunderbolt on the giant jupiter bear the head of napoleon good god how this man be spoil by adulation the staircase of the palace be superb and the furniture be of the most elegant description be faithfully and classically model after the antique roman and grecian after visit the ambrosian library -lrb- by the way it be quite absurd to visit a library unless you employ whole day to inspect the various edition -rrb- i go to the hospital which be a stupendous building and make up 8000 bed the arrangement of this hospital merit the greatest praise i then peep into several church and i verily believe my conductor would have make I visit every church in milan if i have not lose all patience and cry out : _ perche sempre chiese sempre chiese andiamo a vedere altra cosa _ he conduct I then to the citadel or rather place where the citadel stand and which now form a vast barrack for the austrian troops we then go to visit the _ teatro olimpico _ which be build by napoleon it be build in the style of the roman amphitheatre but much more of a oval form than the roman amphitheatre be in general that be to say the transverse axis be much longer in proportion to the conjugate diameter than be the case in the roman amphitheatre and it be by no means so high in the time of napoleon game be execute in this circus in imitation of the game of the ancient for napoleon have a great hankering to ape the roman caesar in everything there be for instance gymnastic exercise race on foot horse race chariot race like those of the roman combat of wild beast and as water can be introduce into the arena there be sometimes exhibit _ naumachia _ or naval fight these exhibition be extremely frequent at milan during the vice-regency of prince eugène napoleon during this government indeed milan flourish in the highest degree of opulence and splendor and profit much by be one of the principal depôts of the inland trade between france and italy during the continental blockade besides enjoy the advantage of be the seat of government during the existence of the _ regno d'italia _ even now tho ' groan under the leaden sceptre of austrium it be one of the most lively and splendid city i ever behold and i make this remark to a milanese he answer with a deep sigh : ah monsieur si vous aviez été ici dans le temps du prince eugène mai aujourd ` hui nous sommes ruinés my next visit be to the _ porta del sempione _ which be at a short distance from the amphitheatre and which be it finish would be the finest thing of the kind in europe it be design and would have be complete by napoleon have he remain on the throne figure represent france italy fortitude and wisdom adorn the façade and there be several bas-relief among which be one represent napoleon receive the key of milan after the battle of marengo all be yet unfinished column pedestal frieze capital and various other architectural ornament besides several unhewn block of marble lie on the ground and probably this magnificent design will never be complete for no other reason than because it be imagine by napoleon and might recall he glory verily legitimacy be childishly spiteful yesterday morning i go to see a italian comedy represent at the _ teatro re _ the piece be _ l'ajo nell ' imbarazzo _ -- a very droll and humorous piece -- but it be not well act from the simple circumstance of the actor not have they part by heart and the illusion of the stage be destroy by hear the prompter 's voice full as loud as that of the actor who follow he prompting something in the same way that the clerk follow the clergyman in that prayer of the anglican liturgy which say we have err and stray from we way like lose sheep a italian audience be certainly very indulgent and good-natured as they never hiss however miserable the performance but in speaking of theatrical performance no person should leave milan without go to see the _ teatro girolamo _ which be one of the curiosity of the place peculiar to milan and more frequented perhaps than any other this be a puppet theater but puppet so well contrived and so well work as to make the spectacle well worth the attention of the traveller it be the _ nec plus ultra of marionettism _ in which signer girolamo the proprietor have make a revolution which will form a epoch in the annals of puppetry have drive from the stage entirely the _ graziosissima maschera d'arlecchino _ who use to be the hero of all the piece represent by the puppet and substitute himself or rather a puppet bear he name in the place of harlequin as the principal _ farceur _ of the performance he have contrived to make the puppet girolamo a little like himself but so much caricatured and so monstrously ugly a likeness that the bare sight of it raise immediate laughter the theater itself be small be something under the size of we old haymarket little theater but be very neatly and tastefully fit up the puppet be about half of the natural size of man and girolamo aid by one or two other work they and give they gesture by means of string which be however so well contrived as to be scarcely visible and girolamo himself speak for all as besides be a ventriloquist he have a most astonishing faculty of vary he voice and adapt it to the _ rôle _ of each puppet so that the illusion be complete the scenery and decoration be excellent sometimes he give opera as well as drama and there be always a _ ballo _ with transformation of one figure into another which form part of the performance these transformation be really very curious and extremely well execute almost all the piece act on the theater be of girolamo 's own composition and he sometimes choose a classical or mythological subject in which the puppet girolamo be sure to be introduce and charge with all the wit of the piece he speak invariably with the accent and _ patois _ of the country and he joke never fail to keep the audience in a roar of laughter he mode of speech and slang phrase form a absurd contrast to the other figure who speak in pure italian and pompous _ versus scioltus _ for instance the piece i see represent be the story of alcesti and be entitle _ la scesa d'ercole nell inferno _ to redeem the wife of admetus hercule before he commence this undertaking wish to hire a valet for the journey have a interview with girolamo and engage he hercule speak in blank verse and in a phrase full of _ sesquipedalium verba _ demand he country and lineage girolamo reply in the piedmontese dialect and with a strong nasal accent : _ de mi pais de piemong _ girolamo however though he profess to be as brave as mar himself have a great repugnance to accompany he master to the shades below or to the _ casa del diavolo _ as he call it and while hercule fight with cerberus he shake and tremble all over as he do likewise when he meet _ madonna morte _ all this be very absurd and ridiculous but it be impossible not to laugh and be amuse at it a anecdote be related of the _ flesh and blood _ girolamo that he have a very pretty wife who take it into she head one day to elope with a french officer and that to revenge himself he dramatize the event and produce it on he own theater under the title of _ colombina scampa coll ` uffiziale _ have fill the piece with severe satire and sarcastic remark against woman in general and colombina in particular the atelier of the famous artist in mosaic rafaellus be well worth inspect and here i have a opportunity of behold a copy in mosaic and nearly finish of the celebrated picture of leonardo da vincus represent the _ caena dominus _ what a useful as well as admirable art be the mosaic to perpetuate the painting of the greatest master i recollect on behold this work that eustace in he _ tour thro ' italy _ -lrb- 55 -rrb- relate with a pious horror that the french soldier use the original picture as a target to practice at with ball cartridge and that christ 's head be single out as the mark this absurd tale which have not the least shadow of truth in it have it appear gain some credit among weak-minded people and i therefore beg leave to contradict it in the most formal manner it be buonaparte who the moment the picture be discover order it to be put in mosaic no the french be the protector and encourager and by no mean the destroyer of the work of art and this ridiculous story of the picture be use as a target be probably invent by the priesthood who seem to have take great delight in impose on poor eustace 's credulity to I it seem that such a story could only have be invent by a monk and believe and repeat by a old woman or a bigot the priest and french emigrant have invent and spread the most shameful and improbable calumny against the french republican and against napoleon and that credulous gull john bull have be silly enough to give full credence to all these tale and stand stare with he eye and mouth open at the recital while a vulgar jobbing ministry -lrb- as cobbet would say -rrb- _ pick he pocket _ quite of a piece with this be the say mr eustace 's bigotry in not chus to call lombardy by its usual appellation lombardy and affectedly term it the plain of the po why so will be ask why because mr eustace hate the ancient lombard and hold they very nearly in as much horror as he do the modern french because as he say they be the enemy of the church and make war on and despoil the holy see the fact be that the lombard prince be the most enlighten of all the monarch of they time they be the first who begin to resist the encroachment of the clergy and to shake off that abject submission to the holy see which be the characteristic of the age the lombard be a fine gallant race of man and not so bigoted as the other nation of europe where have there ever reign a better and more enlighten and more just and humane prince than theodoric -lrb- 56 -rrb- but theodoric be a arian hence mr eustace 's aversion for he with the most servile devotion reject condemn and anathematize whatever the church reject condemn and anathematize for myself i look on the extinction of the lombard power by charlemagne to have be a great calamity have it last the reformation and deliverance of europe from papal and ecclesiastical tyranny would have happen probably three hundred year sooner and the inquisition never have be plant in spain i have make this digression from a love of justice and from a wish to vindicate the french republic and napoleon from one at least of the many unjust aspersion cast on they i feel it also my duty to state on every occasion that i belong to a army send to egypt in order to expel they from that country have be a eyewitness of the good and beneficial reform and improvement that the french make in egypt during a period of only three year they do more for the good of that country in this short period than we have do for indium in fifty year be oblige to be in london on the 24th December i take leave of the agreeable city of milan with much regret on the 19th of October and engage a place in a swiss _ voiture _ go to lausanne my fellow traveller be two brunswick officer in the service of the princess of wale who be return to they native country and a hungarian and he son settle in domo d'ossolum nothing occur till we arrive at arona where we be detain a whole day in consequence of some informality in the passport of the two german viz that of its not have be _ visé _ by the sardinian chargé d'affaire at milan during we detention at arona i fall in with a young frenchman who be go to milan in company of some swiss friend the swiss be permit to proceed but the other be not for no other reason than because he be a frenchman so that he take a place in we carriage in order to return to switzerland i find he a very agreeable companion for tho ' much chagrined and vex at this harsh and ungenerous treatment on the part of the piedmontese authority he soon recover he good humor and contribute much to the pleasure of we journey the german come back to arona very late at night and during the rest of the journey give vent to they feeling with many a execration such as _ verfluchter spitzbube hundsfott _ on the head of the inexorable police officer of arona the next day on pass by belgirate we take a boat to visit the borromean island and afterwards return to rejoin we carriage at fariolo the first of these island that we visit be the _ isolum bellum _ where there be a large and splendid villa belong to the borromean family the room be of excellent and solid structure and there be some good family picture the furniture be ancient but costly the _ rez de chaussée _ or lower part of the house which be completely _ à fleur d'eau _ with the lake be tastefully pave and the wall decorate with a mosaic of shell one would imagine it the abode of a sea nymph i thought of calypso and galatea there be in these apartment _ à fleur d'eau _ two or three exquisite statue lausanne 11th November i have be now nearly three week at lausanne and be much pleased both with the inhabitant who be extremely affable and well-informed and with the beautiful site that environ this city the capital of the canton de vaud the sentiment of the vaudoi with the exception of a few absurd family among the _ noblesse _ who from ignorance or prejudice be stickler for the old time be highly liberal and as they acquire they freedom and emancipate themselves from the yoke of the bernoi thro ' the means of the french revolution they be grateful to that nation and receive with hospitality those who be proscribe by the present french government they behavior thus form a noble contrast to the servility of the genevese the government of the canton de vaud be wholly democratic and be compose of a landamman and grand and petty council all _ bourgeois _ or of the most intelligent among the agricultural class who know the interest of they country right well and be not likely to betray they as the _ noblesse _ be but too often induce to do for the sake of some foolish ribband rank or title the _ noblesse _ be in a manner self-exiled -lrb- so they say -rrb- from all participation in the legislative and executive power for they have too much _ morgue _ to endure to share the government with those whom they regard as _ roturier _ but the real state of the case be that the people will not elect they and the people be perfectly in the right for at the glorious epoch when without bloodsh the burgher and plebeian upset the despotism of bern the conduct of the _ noblesse _ be very equivocal la harpe be the leader of this beneficial revolution for which however the public mind be fully prepared and disposed and la harpe be a virtuous ardent and incorruptible patriot this canton have be for a long period of year in a state of vassalage to that of bern all the post and office of government be fill by bernoi and the vaudoi be exclude from all share in the government and from all public employment of consequence when the sun of revolution after gloriously rise in america have shine in splendor on france and have successfully dissipate the mist of tyranny feudality priestcraft and prejudice it be natural that those state which have languish for so many year in a humiliating situation should begin to look about they and enquire into the origin of all the shackle and restraint impose on they and no doubt the vaudoi soon discover that it be a anomaly in politics as well as in reason that two state of such different origin the one be a latin and the other a teutonic people with language custom and manners so different should be blended together in a system in which all the advantage be on the side of bern and nought but vassalage on the part of vaud a chief be alone want to give the impulse he be soon find the business be settle in forty-eight hour and by the mediation of the french government vaud be declare and acknowledge a independent state and for ever release from the dominion of bern the federative constitution be then abolish throughout the union and a general government call the helvetic republic substitute in its place but this constitution not suit the genius and habit of the people nor the locality of the country be not of long duration trouble break out and insurrection which be foment and encourage by the adherent of the old régime but napoleon by a wise and salutary mediation step in between they and prevent the effusion of blood by restore the old confederation modify by a variety of amelioration in the act of mediation napoleon contented himself with separate the valai entirely from the confederation and shortly after annex it to france on account of the high road into italy across the simplon run thro ' that territory and which it become of the utmost importance to he to be master of the new helvetic confederation be inviolably respect and protect by napoleon for never after the act of mediation do any french troops enter in the canton de vaud or any part of the union to pass into italy they always move on the savoy side of the lake to enter into the valai this act of mediation save probably a good deal of bloodshed and in a very short time give such general satisfaction and be in every respect so useful and beneficial to the helvetic union that in spite of the intrigue of the senate of bern who have never be able to digest the loss of vaud the ally power in the year 1814 solemnly guarantee the helvetic confederation as establish by the act of mediation merely restore the valai to its independence and aggregate it as a independent canton to the general union geneva on its be sever from the french empire and recover its independence solicit the helvetic union to be admit as a member and component part of that confederacy which be agree to and it be and remain aggregated to it also in 1815 on the return of napoleon from elba and on the renewal of the war the bern government make a most barefaced attempt to regain possession of the canton de vaud to this they be no doubt secretly encourage by the ally and principally it be say by the british government the most dangerous artful and determine enemy of all liberty but this project be completely foiled by the penetration energy and firmness of the inhabitant of the canton de vaud and of its government in particular the central government of the union be at that time hold at bern and it be agree upon in the diet that switzerland should remain perfectly neutral during the approach conflict a army of observation of 80000 man be vote and levy to enforce this neutrality but the command of it be give to de watteville who have be a colonel in the english service and be a determine enemy of the french revolution and of everything connect with or arise out of it on the approach of the austrian army de watteville instead of defend the frontier and repel the invasion disband he army and allow the austrian to enter no doubt he be encourage if not positively order to do this by the government of bern many member of which be suppose to have receive bribe from the british government to render the decree neutrality null and void at the same moment that this army be disband the directoral canton -lrb- bern -rrb- cause to be intimate to the canton de valid that it be the wish and intention of the high ally to replace switzerland in the exact state it be in previous to the french revolution and that in consequence two commissioner would be send from bern to lausanne to take charge of the bureau archive and _ insignia _ of government etc and to act as a provisional government under the direction of bern the landamman and the grand and petty council at lausanne on learn this intelligence immediately see thro ' the scheme that be plan to deprive they of they independence they therefore pass a decree threaten to arrest and punish as conspirator the commissioner should they dare to set they foot in the canton and declare such of they countryman who should aid or abet this scheme or deliver up a single document to the commissioner traitor and rebel they likewise call on the whole canton to arm in defense of its independence and proclaim at the same time that should this plan be attempt to be carry into execution they would join they force to those of napoleon and thus endanger the position of the ally they take they measure accordingly the whole canton sew to arm the bernoi and the ally be alarm and consultation hold the count de bubna the austrian general be consult think the attempt so hazardous and so pregnant with mischief that he have the good sense to recommend to the ally power and to the canton of bern to desist from they project and not to make or propose any alteration in the helvetic constitution as guarantee in 1814 he advice be of great weight and be adopt and thus the vaudoi by they firmness preserve they independence they meet with great support likewise on this try occasion from general la harpe preceptor to the emperor of russium and a relation to the gentleman of the same name who be so instrumental in the emancipation of vaud la harpe who enjoy the confidence of he pupil exert himself greatly in procure he good office in favor of the vaudoi he countryman and this be no small weight in the scale lausanne be a irregularly build city and not very agreeable to pedestrian for its continual steep ascent and descent make it extremely fatiguing and there be a part of the town to which you ascend by a flight of stair the house in lausanne have be humorously enough compare to musical note the country in the environs be beautiful beyond description and have at all time elicit the admiration of traveller there be a agreeable promenade just outside the town on the left hand side of the road which lead to geneva call _ montbenon _ which be the fashionable promenade and command a fine view of the lake on the left hand side be a casino and garden use for the _ tir de l'arc _ of which the vaudoi in common with the other helvetic people be extremely fond on the right hand side of the road be a deep ravine plant in the style of a english garden with serpentine gravel walk and on the other side of the ravine stand the upper part of the city the cathedral _ hôtel de ville _ and the _ chateau du bailli _ which be the seat of government from the terrace of the cathedral you enjoy a fine view but a still finer and far more comprehensive one be from the signal house or _ belvédère _ near the forest of sauvabelin -lrb- _ silva bellonae _ in pagan time -rrb- -lrb- 57 -rrb- in this wood fair dance and other public festival be hold and it be the favorite spot for party of pleasure to dine _ al fresco _ it be a pity however that the edifice call the _ belvédère _ be not conceive in a better taste it have a uncouth and barbarous appearance lausanne be situate about a quarter of a mile -lrb- in a right line -rrb- from the lake and you descend continually in go from the city to the lake leman by a good carriage road until you arrive on the border of the lake where stand a neat little town call ouchy or as it be sometimes term _ le port de lausanne _ there be a good quaus and pier the passage across the lake from ouchy to the savoy side require four hour with oar i have make several pleasant acquaintance here viz m pidon the landamman a litterato of the first order genl la harpe the tutor of the emperor of russium but the most agreeable of all be the baron de f -lrb- alkenskiold -rrb- a old gentleman of whose talent merit and delightful disposition i can not speak too highly he have the most liberal and enlighten view and opinion and be extremely well verse in english french and german litterature he be a dane by birth and be exile early in life from he own country on account of a accusation of be implicate in the affair of struensee and it be generally suppose that he be one of queen matilda 's favored lover which supposition be not improbable as in he youth to judge from he present dignified and majestic appearance he must have be a uncommonly handsome man he have live ever since at lausanne and tho ' near seventy-four year of age and torment with the gout he never lose he cheerfulness and pass he time mostly with he book he give dinner party two or three time a week which be exceedingly pleasant and one be sure to meet there a small but well inform society of native and foreigner most german traveller of rank and litterary attainment who pass thro ' lausanne bring letter of introduction and recommendation to the baron and be sure to meet with the utmost hospitality and attention the woman of the canton de vaud be in general very handsome well shaped and graceful litterature music dancing and drawing be cultivate by they with success and among the man tho ' one do not meet perhaps with quite as much instruction as at geneva -lrb- i mean that it be not so general -rrb- yet no pedantry whatever prevail as in geneva at lausanne they have sincere and solid republican principle and they do not pay that servile court to the english that the genevese do nor have they as yet adopt the phrase _ dieu I damne _ pari dec 5th i return to pari by geneva and cross the jura chain of mountain pass thro ' dole auxonne and dijon at geneva where i stop three day i meet at a musical party give by m picot the banker the celebrated cantatrice grassinus who look as beautiful as ever and sing in the most fascinating style several air particularly _ quelle pupille tenere _ in the opera of the _ orazj e curiazi _ to my taste she style of singing be far preferable to that of catalanus there be much more pathos and feeling in the singing of grassinus it be completely and truly the _ cantar che nell ` anima si sente _ catalani be very powerful wonderful if you will in execution but she do not touch my heart as grassinus do on my return to pari from geneva i find that the condition of peace have be make public they be certainly hard not so much on account of the cession of territory which be trifling as on account of the vast sum of money that prance be oblige to pay and the still more galling condition of have to pay and feed at she expense a army of occupation of 150000 man of the ally troops for a term of three or five year and to cede during that period several important fortress the inhabitant of pari look very gloomy and nobody seem to think that the peace will last half as long prussium and austrium strive hard to wrest alsace and german lorraine from france host of german publicist have accompany they army into france and have write pamphlet upon pamphlet to prove that mountain and not river be the proper boundary of nation and that wherever the german language prevail the country ought to belong to the germanic body ergo the vosge mountain be the natural boundary of france and alsace and german lorraine should revert to germany russium and england however oppose this and insist that these two province should remain with france but i have no doubt that the first movement that may occur in france -lrb- and they will perhaps be secretly encourage -rrb- will serve as a pretext for the ally to separate these country definitively from france the louvre have be strip of the principal statue and picture which have be send back to the place from whence they be take to the great mortification of the parisian most of whom would have consent to the cession of alsace and lorraine and half of france to boot on condition of keep the statue and picture the english bureau be prepare to leave paris and the troops will soon follow a new french army be organize and several swiss battalion be raise it be generally suppose that by the end of December france with the exception of the fortress and district to be occupy by the ally power will be free from the pressure of foreign troops the chamber of peer be occupy with the trial of marshall ney the conseil de guerre which be order to assemble for that purpose have declare itself incompetent the friend of ney advise he to claim the protection of the 12th article of the capitulation of pari and madame ney it be say apply both to the duke of wellington and to the emperor of russium both ungenerously refuse to the former nature have not give a heart with much sensibility and the latter bear a petty spite against ney on account of he title _ prince de la moskowa _ it be pretty generally anticipate that poor ney will be condemn and execute for tho ' at the representation of _ cinna _ a few night ago at the théâtre français the allusion to clemency be loudly catch hold of and applaud by the audience yet i suspect loui xviii be by no means of a relent nature and that he be as little inclined to pardon political trespass as he ancestor loui ix be dispose to pardon those against religion for accord to gibbon he recommendation to he follower be : _ si quelqu'un parle contre la foi chrétienne dans votre présence donnez lui l'épée ventre-dedan _ December 18th i meet with a emigrant this day at the palais royal who be acquaint with my family in london it be the vicomte de b \*\*\*\*\* ye -lrb- 58 -rrb- he have reside some time in england and also in switzerland he be a amiable man but a most incorrigible ultra he display at once the idea that prevail among the ultra which must render they eternally at variance with the mass of the french nation in speaking of the state of france he say : _ je n'aus jamai cessé et jamais je ne cesserai de regarder comme voleur tous les acquéreurs des biens des émigrés il faudroit pour le bonheur de la france qu'elle fût placés dans le même état ou elle était avant la révolution _ he would not listen to my reason against the possibility of effect such a plan even be the plan just and reasonable in itself i tell he that for the emigrant to expect to get back they property be just as absurd as for the descendant of those saxon family in england whose ancestor be dispossess of they estate by william the conqueror to think of regain they and to call upon the duke of northumberland for instance as a descendant of a norman invader to give up he property as unjustly acquire by he progenitor we do not hold long converse after this he idea and mine diverged too much from each other the english be very much out of favor with the emigrant as well on account of the strip of the louvre as on account of not have shoot all the _ libéraux _ they have the folly to believe that the ally troops would merely make war for the emigrant ' interest and after have put to death a considerable quantity of those who should be designate as rebel and jacobin by they -lrb- the emigrant -rrb- would replace france in the exact position she be in 1789 and

night half way between st quentin and compiègne the axle tree of the carriage break we be at least two mile from any village one way and three the other but a lone house be close to the spot where the accident happen we have therefore the choice of go forward or backward the postillion and myself help the carriage on with we hand or to take refuge at the lone house till dawn of day i prefer the latter we knock several time at the door of the lone house but the owner refuse to admit we say that he be sure we be _ gen de mauvaise vie _ and that he would shoot we if we do not go away the postillion and i then determine on retrograde two mile the distance of the nearest village and remain there till morning we arrive there with no small difficulty and labor for it snow very fast and heavily and it require a good deal of bodily exertion to push on the carriage arrive at the village we knock at the door of a small cottage the owner of which sell some brandy he receive I very civilly give I some egg and bacon for supper and a very fair bed the next morning after have the axle tree repair we proceed on we journey to compiègne i suffer much from the cold during this

with in society to kiss the trial of she brother be now go on for aid and abet the escape of lavalette i sincerely hope he will escape any severity of punishment but i more fear the effect of tory vengeance against he in england in the shape of deprive he of he commission than i do the sentence of any french court yet tho ' i wish he well i can not help feel the remains of a little grudge against he for he calumny against napoleon in accuse he of poisoning the sick of he own army before the wall of st jean d'acre i have always vindicate the character of napoleon from this most unjust and unfounded aspersion because have be in egypt with abercrombie 's army and have have daily intercourse with belliard 's division of the french army after the capitulation of cairo and during we joint march on the left bank of the nile to rosetta i know that there be not a syllable of truth in the story mr walli however tell I that she brother have express deep regret that he ever give credence and currency to such a report and that he acknowledge that he be himself deceive but he do napoleon a irreparable injury and he work on the egyptian campaign contribute in a very great degree to excite the hatred of the english people against napoleon as well as to flatter the passion and prejudice of the tory in the affair however of lavalette wilson have nobly retrieve he character and obliterate all recollection of he former error it be amazing the popularity he and he two gallant associate have acquire in france by this generous and chevaleresque enterprise i meet at col wardle 's a very pleasant french society : conversation music and singing fill up the evening April 15th i have be present to a very agreeable lady madame esther fournier who hold a _ conversazione _ at she

great vivacity and talent and general guilleminot and he lady col paulet who marry m vanderberg 's second daughter be on the staff of general guilleminot at the battle of waterloo and suffer much from a fever and ague that he catch on the night bivouac i have attend a séance of the institution of the _ sourds-muet _ found by the famous abbé de l'epée and continue with equal success by he successor the abbé s -lrb- icard -rrb- -lrb- 63 -rrb- who deliver the lecture and exhibit the talent and proficiency of he pupil the eldest pupil massieu himself deaf and dumb be a extraordinary genius and he may be say in some measure to direct all the other massieu who have a very interesting and even handsome countenance and manners extremely prepossessing conduct the examination of the pupil by means of sign and write on a slate or paper and it be wonderful to observe the progress make by these interesting young person who have be so harshly treat by nature the definition they give of substance and quality be so just and happy and in they situation definition be everything for they can not learn by rote as other boy often do who in the study of philology acquire only word and not thing or meaning the deaf and dumb person on the contrary acquire at once by this method of instruction the philosophy of grammar and then it be far from be the dry study that many people suppose a german princess who be present exclaim in a transport of admiration at some of the specimen of definition and inference give by the pupil oh i wish that i be bear deaf and dumb be it only to learn grammar properly sir sidney smith be present at this lecture and seem incline to make himself a little too conspicuous for instance before the examination begin he seat himself close by the abbé s -lrb- icard -rrb- and pull a paper out of he pocket say that he have find it on the ground on he way hither and that it be part of a leaf from a edition of cicero which contain a sentence so applicable to the character and talent of he friend the abbé that he request permission to read it aloud and translate it into french for the benefit of those who do not understand latin he then read the sentence the abbé not to be out-done in compliment then rise and make a most flaming speech in eulogium of he friend the heroic defender of st john d'acre and point he out to the audience as the first person who have foiled the arm of the usurper now this word usurper apply to napoleon do not at all please the audience and it shew a great deal of servility on the part of the abbé to insult fall greatness and in the person too of a man who have render such vast service to science in fact this episode be receive coldly and somewhat impatiently by the audience and many think it be a thing _ get up _ between the admiral and the abbé to flatter each other 's vanity indeed my friend mr wallis next to whom i be place and who do not at all agree with the gallant admiral in politics intimate this in a whisper loud enough to be hear by all the audience and add : such a humbug be enough to make one sick sir sidney smith hear all this and seem a good deal abashed and disconcerted he however have the good sense to say nothing and the examination begin paris may 5th i form a party with some friend to visit the cemetery of père la chaise we remark in particular the place where poor labédoyère and marshal ney be bury there be no tombstone on the former but some shrub have be plant and a black wooden cross fix to denote the spot where he lie to marshal ney there be a stone sepulchre with this inscription : _ cy-gît le maréchal ney prince de la moskowa _ this cemetery be most beautifully lay out the multitude of tomb the variety of inscription in prose and verse some of which be very affect the yew the willow all render this a delightful spot for contemplation it command a extensive view of pari and the surrounding country foreigner of distinction who die in pari be generally bury here but it would require a volume to describe to you in detail this interesting cemetery i think the practice of strew flower over the grave be very touching and classic it remind I of the description of marcellus 's death in virgil : manibus date lilium pleni we however strew over the tomb of labédoyère and ney not lily but violet for my friend mr w -lrb- alli -rrb- who be of we party have a great aversion to the lily we have just hear of didier 's capture and execution at grenoble -lrb- 64 -rrb- there be continual report of insurrection and plot but it be now well know that the most of they be _ get up _ by the ultra to entrap the unwary the french people seem sink in apathy and to wish for peace at any rate nothing but the most extreme provocation will induce they to take up arm but then if they once do so woe to the _ chambre introuvable _ as the present chamber of deputy be call certainly such a set of venal merciless and ignorant bigot and blockhead never be collect in any assembly there have occur several scandalous scene at nîmes and other place the protestant be openly insult and threaten and the government be either too weak to prevent it or as be suppose secretly encourage those excess in fact in pari there be two police the one that of the government the other and by far the most troublesome that of _ monsieur _ -lrb- 65 -rrb- and the violent ultra party or as they be collectively call the _ pavilion marsan _ -lrb- 66 -rrb- the priest be at work everywhere trump up old legend forge communication from the holy ghost receive letter drop from heaven by jesus christ and all this be do with the idea of work on fanatical mind to induce they to commit act of outrage and violence on those whom the priest designate as enemy to the faith and on weak one with the idea of frightening they into restore the land and property which they have purchase or inherit and which formerly belong to emigrant or to the church a lady of my acquaintance -lrb- to give you a idea of the art of these holy hypocrite -rrb- send for a priest to confess and to receive absolution not from any faith in the efficacy of the business but merely from a desire of conform to the ceremony of the national worship the priest arrive but begin by apologize to she that he be sorry he could not administer to she the sacrament of absolution she surprize ask the reason he answer that it be because she uncle have purchase church land which she inherit and that unless she could resolve to restore they to the church he could not think of give she absolution the lady be at a loss whether to be indignant at he impudence or to laugh outright at he folly she however assume a become gravity and _ sang-froid _ and tell he that he be very much mistaken if he think he have get hold of a simpleton or a bigot in she that she have send for he merely with the idea of conform to the national worship and not with the most remote persuasion of the necessity or efficacy of he or any other priest 's absolution she add : you conduct have open my eye as to the view of all you cloth i see you be incurable i shall never send for any of you again and be assure this anecdote shall not be forget you may retire the priest abashed and mortified in find himself mistaken in he suppose prey stammer a excuse and retire i intend to remain at pari until after the marriage ceremony of the duke and duchess of berrus and i shall then proceed to lausanne it be expect there will be some disturbance on the occasion of this marriage i have witness a execution by the guillotine on the place de grève near the _ hôtel de ville _ the criminal be guilty of a burglary and murder it be the only execution -lrb- except political one -rrb- that have take place at paris for the last six month whereas in england they be string up by dozen every fortnight independent of there be far less crime commit in france than in england the french code punish but few offence with death why be not the sanguinary english criminal code with death in every line -- why be it not reform i say ` twould be well if we legislator instead of they puerile and frothy declamation against revolutionary principle and the ambition of napoleon would occupy themselves seriously with this subject but then the lawyer would all oppose the simplification of we code they find by experience that a complicated one obstruct by custom statute and act of parliament difficult to be correctly interpret and frequently at variance with each other be a much more profitable thing a much wider and more lucrative field for the exercise of they profession than the simplicity of the code napoléon and they would die of rage and despair at the thought of anybody not a lawyer be able to interpret the law himself now as we country gentleman and member of parliament be always much inclined to take lawyer 's advice and be besides fully persuade and convince that there be no abuse whatever in england and that everything be as it should be there be no hope of any amelioration in this particular all reasoning and argument be lose on such political optimist the punishment of the guillotine certainly appear to be the most humane mode of terminate the existence of a man that could possibly be invent the apparatus be preserve in the _ hôtel de ville _ and be never expose to view or erect on the place of execution till about a hour before the execution itself take place at the hour appoint the criminal be bring to the scaffold fasten to the board place at right angle with the fatal instrument the head protrude thro ' the groove which embrace the neck the executioner pull a cord the axe descend and the head of the criminal fall into a basket the whole ceremony of the execution do not take three minute when the criminal once arrive at the foot of the guillotine there be none of that horrible struggle that take place in the operation of hang June 21st 1816 the ceremony of the marriage of the duke and duchess of berrus pass off quietly enough several people it be true be arrest for seditious expression but no tumult occur a great apprehension seem to prevail lest something should occur but the

backwards and forwards be conduct i have no doubt that in this petition more be mean than meet the ear that the oligarch of bern as well as the ultra of france have a share in it and that it may be consider not so much as a attempt to compel the canton to refuse asylum to these exile as to excite the great power to enforce the abolition of the independence of vaud and to replace it under the dominion and authority of the canton of bern everybody here however see thro ' the drift of this petition and many person whose name be put down as have sign it have write to they friend at lausanne to declare not only that they never sign such a petition but they entire ignorance even of the agitation of the question till they see the petition itself in print the french government however have not venture to act any further upon it than to make a pompous display of the royalist zeal and _ bon esprit _ that pervade the department of the doub i see a good deal of mlle michaud i find she conversation extremely agreeable she have lend to I a italian work by verrus entitle _ le nottus romane al sepolcro di stipione _ she be a very rigid catholic have be educate by a priest of very strict idea she devotion however do not render she less cheerful or less amiable she have express a wish to hear the protestant church service i offer to accompany she and we go together one Sunday to the cathedral church at lausanne but it unfortunately happen that on that day a sermon be preach which must have give a great deal of pain to she filial feeling mr levade the minister take it into he head to give a political sermon in which after a great deal of commonplace abuse of voltaire rousseau and the french revolution and very fulsome adulation towards the english government -lrb- a subject which be bring in by the head and shoulder -rrb- of that _ island _ -lrb- as he term it -rrb- _ surround by the ocean _ he lavish a great deal of still more fulsome adulation on the bourbon and then most wantonly and unnecessarily begin a furious declamation against the _ régicides _ as he term they who have take refuge in the canton and intimate pretty plainly how please it would be to god almighty that they should be expel from it this intolerant discourse more worthy of a rave jesuit than of a protestant minister be deservedly scout by the inhabitant of lausanne but this do not hinder poor mlle michaud from be much affect at the opprobrious tirade direct against a set of man among whom she father bear a conspicuous part and who act from patriotic motive i must not omit to state that in this discourse m levade interweave some hyperbolical compliment towards the young prince of sweden who attend the service that morning he tell he that the eye of all europe be fix upon he and that providence have he under he especial care now the follow be the character of m levade -lrb- 72 -rrb- he be a time-serving meddling priest and a most flagrant adulator of the power that be he think that by declaim against the french revolution and against voltaire and rousseau that he will get into favor with the great people who pass thro ' lausanne with the french and english government adherent and with the great tory family of england no considerable personage ever pass through lausanne but mr levade be the first to make he a visit and no rich or noble english family arrive with whom he do not ingratiate himself and he be not spare of he adulation this mode of procedure have be a very profitable concern to he as he have receive a vast number of present and several valuable legacy besides secure a number of pupil among the english family that come or that have be here he be in short a thorough parasite and time server in every sense of the word this adulation of the bourbon family in he sermon besides the meanness of it be highly misplace come from the mouth of a protestant minister and somebody exclaim on leave the church : _ que doit-on penser d'un ministre protestant du canton de vaud qui prodigue des louanges à une famille qui a été l'ennemie acharnée de l'elise reformée et qui a persécuté les protestants d'une manière si atroce _ but mr levade -lrb- tho ' to the honor of the clergyman of the canton de vaud he be singular among _ they _ -rrb- yet he have many person who perfectly resemble he among the member of the church of england and who be as eager to support despotism and to crush liberty as any disciple of loyolum or any janissary of the grand signor the other protestant minister of this canton be highly indignant at this sermon in fact it be the first time in this city that the house of god have be profane by the introduction of political subject into a religious discourse this sermon be the common topic of conversation for many day after chambéry 2d August i leave lausanne for geneva on 28 July i stop at nyon to pay a visit to mme duthon with whom i become acquaint at paris i dine with she and pass a most agreeable day she talent be of the first order and she be as great a enthusiast for the german language and litterature as myself besides be well verse in italian she have a female relation with she we take a boat after dinner to navigate the lake and we visit the château and domain of joseph napoleon the next day i proceed to geneva i determine on make the journey into italy this time by mont-ceni and to make it on foot as far as the foot of mont-ceni on the italian side intend to profit of the opportunity of the first conveyance i should meet with at suza to proceed to turin i accordingly forward my portmanteau to turin to the care of a banker there and sally forth from geneva at six o'clock on the morning of 1st August i stop to dine at frangy and reach romilly at seven in the evening there be nothing worthy of remark at romilly the next morning i stop at aix to breakfast and visit the bath establishment the scenery be picturesque on this route and the whole road from aix to chambéry be align with remarkably fine large tree at three in the afternoon i arrive at chambéry the capital of savoy it be a large handsome city situate in a fruitful valley with a great many garden and orchard surround it there be a strong garrison here among the many _ maison de plaisance _ in the environs of this city the most distinguishable be the villa of general de boigne who have pass the greatest part of he life in indium in the service of scindiah one of the mahratta chief -lrb- 73 -rrb- and it be by de boigne 's assistance that scindiah from be a petty chief with not more than three or four hundred horse become the founder of a powerful kingdom comprize chiefly of the province of the gange and jumna tear from the mogol empire whose sovereign fall into the hand of scindiah scindiah cause the mogol emperor 's eye to be put out and keep he as a state prisoner in delhus till the year 1805 when on the mahratta engage in war with the english scindiah be defeat by lake and lose the greater part of he conquest de boigne have quit indium in 1796 long before this rupture take place and at that time scindiah have a fine regular army of thirty battalion of 1000 man each disciplined armed and equip in the european manner he have likewise sixty squadron of regular cavalry and a formidable train of artillery at chambéry i meet with two french _ voyageur de commerce _ who with that positiveness which be often the national characteristic insist that de boigne owe he riches and fortune to he treachery in have betray and sell tippoo saib to the english when he be in tippoo 's service and i find this be the current report all over savoy now it be a accusation totally devoid of foundation as i shall presently show and i take this opportunity of vindicate the reputation of de boigne by simply state that de boigne could never have betrayd tippoo since he be never in he service 2dly that he have when in the service of scindiah fight against tippoo when the mahratta coalesce with the english against that prince in 1792 and that have it not be for the assistance give by the mahratta to the english -lrb- a most impolitic coalition on the part of the mahratta as it turn out afterwards -rrb- tippoo would not have be compel to conclude so humiliating a treaty of peace 3dly that de boigne have quit indium in 1796 three year before the second war and death of tippoo in 1799 i state too that i be perfectly well acquaint with these particulars of de boigne 's career from have serve six year in indium and from have be personally acquaint with a gentleman of the name of lucius ferdinand smith who be the ultimate friend of de boigne and he lieutenant general in the service of scindiah i add that i could not conceive how so unjust and unfounded a aspersion on de boigne 's character could find currency i hope that what i say will be effectual towards do away this injurious report but very probably it will not for when the vulgar once imbibe a opinion it be difficult to eradicate it from they mind and they be not at all oblige to the person who endeavor to undeceive they so that general de boigne 's treachery and sale of tippoo to the english will be hand down to posterity among the savoyard as a fact of which it will be as little permit to doubt as of the treachery of juda chambéry August 3d at the _ table d'hôte _ this day i nearly lose all patience on hear a elderly english gentleman extol the english ministry to the sky and abuse the army of the loire call they rebel and traitor i stand up in defense of these gallant man and state that the french army in the time of the republic and of the empire be the most constitutional of all the european army since they be take from and identify with the people and that it be this brotherly feeling for they fellow citizen that induce they to join the standard of napoleon on he return from elba that they only follow the voice of the nation that all france be indignant at the tergiversation and breach of faith on the part of the restore government in a variety of instance and that have napoleon and the army be out of the question the bourbon would not have fail to be upset from the indignation they measure have excite among the people he then say that the army of the loire be a most dangerous body of man and that that be the reason why the ally insist on they be disband i reply that this be the highest compliment he could pay they and the greatest feather in they cap since it go to prove that as long as this army be in existence neither the crown despot nor the ultras thought themselves safe and that they could not venture to pursue they anti-national project which be all direct towards deprive the french people of all they have gain by the revolution and bring they back to the _ blessing _ of the ancient _ régime _ he could say nothing in reply but that he fear i have jacobin principle to which i make rejoinder : if these be jacobin principle i glory in they some sardinian officer who be present seem to enjoy my argument tho ' they say nothing and one take I aside when we quit the table and say he rejoice to see I take the old man in hand as he disgust they every day by he tirade against the liberal party and by he fulsome adulation of the british government the old gentleman hold forth likewise in a long speech respect the finances of england in praise of the sink fund and when it be suggest to he that england from the immense national debt must one day become bankrupt : _ non monsieur _ -lrb- he say -rrb- _ la caisse d'amortissement empêchera cela _ in fine the _ caisse d'amortissement _ be to work miracle i reply that the principle of the _ caisse d'amortissement _ be good provide a constant and consistent economy be practice but that at present and during the whole time from its establishment it have be a mockery on the understanding of the nation when we reflect on the profligate expenditure of public money occasion by the ruinous unjust and liberticide war which be enter into and foment by the british government indeed i say it be like the conduct of a man who possess a income of 200 # per annum should set apart in a box as a _ caisse d'épargne _ 20 # annually and at the same time continue a style of live the annual expence of which would so far exceed he income as to oblige he to borrow 7 or 800 # every year the old gentleman be all amort at this comparison which must be obvious to every one nothing show in a more glaring light the blind and superstitious reverence pay to great name for because this sink fund be propose by pitt all he adherent extol it to the sky without analyze it and give he besides the credit of a invention to which he have no right whatever st jean de maurienne i start from chambéry on the morning of the fourth of August and stop at montmélian to breakfast here begin the valley of maurienne and as this valley along which the road be cut be extremely narrow be hem in on each side by the high alp montmélian which stand on a eminence in the center of the valley -lrb- the road run thro ' the town -rrb- must be a post of the utmost importance towards the defense of this pass it be a fortify place of great consideration in the former war and if the fortification be repair and improve it might be make almost impregnable as it would enfilade the road on each side from the above-mentioned feature of the ground the valley narrow more and more as you proceed from the high mountain that align it and from its sinuosity it follow that at every angle or curve cause by these sinuosity you appear as if you be shut out from all the rest of the world and could proceed no further the river isère run thro ' and parallel with this valley it rise in the mountain of savoy and fall into the rhône in dauphiné i pass the night at aiguebelle from aiguebelle to st jean de maurienne be twelve league and i find myself so tired with walk and my leg from be swell give I so much pain that i determine to give up the _ gloriole _ of make the whole journey on foot as i intend and to remain here for two day to repose and then profit by the first conveyance that might pass to conduct I to turin from aiguebelle the valley become still more narrow and there be a continual ascent tho ' it be so gentle as scarcely to be perceptible every spot of ground in this valley which will admit of cultivation be put to profit by the industry of the inhabitant here one see bean indian corn and even wine for the heat be very great indeed in summer and autumn owing to the ray of the sun be concentrate as it be into a focus in this narrow valley and be the bed of the isère to be deepen or be it less liable to overflow from the melting of the snow in spring and summer much land which be now a marsh might be apply to agricultural purpose the inhabitant of this valley regret very much the separation of savoy from france as during the time that duchy be annex to the french empire each peasant possess a ass could earn three frank per diem in transport merchandise across mont-cenis st jean de maurienne be a neat little town i put up at the same inn and sleep in the same bedroom which be occupy by poor didier who be put to death at grenoble for have raise the standard of liberty he be surprize here in bed by the _ carabiniere realus _ of the sardinian government those satellite of despotism and accord to the barbarous principle lay down by the crown head deliver over to the french authority i observe a great many _ crétins _ in this valley suza 10th August on the morning of the 8th August two _ vetturinus _ pass by the inn at st jean de maurienne and i engage a place in one of they as far as turin we arrive at the village of modena in the evening the landscape be much the same as what we have hitherto pass but the climate be considerably colder from the land be more elevated hitherto i have suffer much inconvenience from the heat the next morning we reach lans-le-bourg the last town of savoy lie at the foot of mount ceni after breakfast we begin the ascent of mont ceni and i make the whole way from lans-le-bourg to the _ hospice _ of mont ceni that be the whole ascent a distance of twenty-five italian mile on foot this _ chaussée _ be another wonderful piece of work of napoleon a broad carriage road wide enough for three carriage to go abreast and cut zig-zag with so gentle a slope as to allow a heavy french diligence to pass with the utmost ease across a mountain where it be formerly think impossible a wheel could ever run this _ chaussée _ be passable at all season of the year the mountain be not so high as that of the simplon and be less liable to impediment from the snow the obstacle from nature be less and you can descend in a sledge from the _ hospice _ by glide down the side of the cone and thus descend in nine or ten minute whereas the ascent require four hour ' time from lans-le-bourg to the _ hospice _ on mont-ceni the road be on the flank of a immense mountain and you have no ravine to cross the road be cut zig-zag on the flank of the mountain and form a considerable number of very acute angle as it be make with so gentle a slope that you scarcely feel the difficulty of the ascent these repeat zig-zag and acute angle form by the road and the very slight slope give to the ascent make the different branch appear to be almost parallel to each other and it be a very curious and novel sight when a number of carriage be travel together on this road to see they with they horse ' head turn different way yet all follow the same course just like ship on different tack beat against the wind to arrive at the same port a comparison that could not fail immediately to occur to a sailor there be scarcely ever any detention on this road from the fall of snow as there be a considerable number of person employ to _ deblay _ it as soon as it fall but here as well as on the simplon there be _ maison de refuge _ at a short distance from each other we stop for two hour at the inn at mont-ceni which be about one hundred yard from the _ hospice _ it be a remarkable fine day and i enjoy my walk very much the mountain air be keen and brace and particularly delightful after be shut up for some many day in the close valley we have some excellent trout for dinner at mont-ceni near the _ hospice _ be a large lake which be freeze during eight month of the year here reign eternal winter and the mountain be cover with snow that never melt from mont-ceni to suza the descent be very grand and striking and the scenery resemble that of the simplon there be more obstacle of nature than on the former part of the road and here ravine be connect by the means of bridge and there be subterraneous gallery to pass thro several _ chute d'eau _ be here observable one of they i can not avoid mention as be very magnificent it be form by the cenischium -lrb- 74 -rrb- which divide savoy from piedmont and run into the dora at suza we be highly gratify at the sight of the sublime scenery on all side and at the magnificent _ chaussée _ and we all -lrb- i mean the passenger in the two coach and myself -rrb- do hommage to the mighty genius who conceive and cause to be execute such a stupendous work we arrive at suza at six o'clock pm turin 18th August suza be a tolerably large town and have a neat appearance it be command and defend by the fort of brunettus now dismantle but which be to be repair accord to the treaty of 1815 it will then be a very important post and completely barr the pass of suza the road from suza to rivolus be thro ' a valley widen at every step at rivolus you _ débouche _ at once from the gorge of the mountain into a boundless plain the road be then on a magnificent _ chaussée _ the whole way to turin and every vegetable production announce a change of climate to those come from savoy here be field of wheat indian corn mulberry and elm tree and vine hang in festoon from tree to tree which give a most picturesque appearance to the landscape and together with the country house serve as a relief to the boundless plain the _ chaussée _ be line with tree on each side the whole way from rivolus to turin i observe among carriage of all sort small car like those use by child draw by dog these car contain one person each they be frequent in this part of the country and such a conveyance be call a _ cagnolino _ the convent of st michael situate on a immense height to the right of the road between suza and rivolus be a very striking object the mountain form a single cone and it appear impossible to reach the summit except on the back of a hippogriff : e ben appar che d'animal ch ` abbia ale sium questa stanza nido o tana proprium -lrb- 75 -rrb- the castle seem the very neat and lair of animal

of a circular form be inlay with black marble and admit scarce any light so that it have more the appearance of a mausoleum than of a chapel it remind I of the _ palace of tear _ in the arabian night in the environs of turin the most remarkable building be a villa belong to the king call _ la venezia _ and the _ superga _ a magnificent church build on a eminence five mile distant from turin in the royal palace on the _ piazza del castello _ there be some superb furniture but the exterior be simple enough the country environ turin form a plain with gentle undulation increase in elevation towards

have excel all other dramatic poet in the general _ dénouement _ of he piece except perhaps voltaire alone i do not speak of alflerus so much as a poet as a _ dramaturgus _ i may be mistaken and it be perhaps presumptuous in I to attempt to judge but it have always appear to I that voltaire and alfierus have manage dramatic effect and the intrigue and catastrophe of they tragedy better than any other author shakespeare god as he be in genius be in this particular very deficient schiller too the greatest modern poetic genius perhaps and the shakespeare of germany have here fail also and nothing can be more correct than the estimate of alfierus make by forsyth -lrb- 79 -rrb- when after speak of he defect he say : yet where live the tragic poet equal to alfieri schiller -lrb- then live

charge be leave to the conscience of the aubergiste which in italy be in general of prodigious width i therefore advise every traveller who go with a _ vetturino _ to be a spesato otherwise he will have to pay four or five time as much and not be a whit better regale the _ vetturinus _ generally pay from three to three and a half franc for the supper and bed of they passenger as the _ vetturinus _ invariably make a halt of a hour and half or two hour at mid-day in some town or village this halt enable you to take you _ déjeuner à la fourchette _ which you pay for yourself unless you stipulate for the payment of that also with the _ vetturino _ by pay something more say one a half franc per diem for that in this part and indeed in the whole of the north of italy not a female servant be to be see at the inn and man make the bed it be otherwise i understand in tuscany the whole appearance of the country from astus to alexandrium present a immense plain extremely fertile but the crop of corn be off the ground the landscape would not be please to the eye be it not relieve by the frequency of mulberry tree and the vine hang in festoon from tree to tree the village and farmhouse on this road be extremely solid and well build we arrive at alexandrium about twelve o'clock and after breakfast i hire a horse to visit the field of battle of marengo which be in the neighborhood of this city marengo itself be a village five mile distant from alexandrium arrive on the plain i be conduct to the spot where the first consul stand at the time that he perceive the approach of desaix 's division i figure to myself the first consul on he white charger halt he army then in some confusion ride along the line expose to a heavy fire from the austrian who cannonade the whole length of the line aide-de-camp and orderly fall around he himself calm and collect spy ` vantage and observe that the austrian deployment be too extended and they center thereby weaken suddenly profit of this circumstance to order desaix 's division to advance and lead the charge which decide the victory on that memorable day which accord to mascheronus : _ splende nell ' abisso de ' secoli qual sole _ the whole field of battle be a extensive plain with but few tree and to use campbell 's line : every turf beneath the foot mark out a soldier 's sepulchre the column erect to commemorate this glorious victory have be throw down by order of the austrian government -- a poor piece of puerile spite but worthy of legitimacy alexandrium be or rather _ be _ for the fortification no longer exist more remarkable for be a important military post than for the beauty of the city itself there be however a fine and spacious _ place _ which serve as a parade for the garrison and be plant with tree by the french when they hold it form a agreeable promenade the fortification be blow up by the austrian before the place be give over to the sardinian authority a flagrant breach of faith and contract since by the treaty of 1814 they be bind to give up all the fortify place that be restore or cede to the king of sardinium in the same state in which they be find when the french evacuate they and the austrian take possession provisorily the french regard -lrb- and with reason -rrb- this fortress as the key of lombardy always keep the fortification in good repair and well provide with cannon but the austrian government know itself to be unpopular in italy and tremble for the safety of she dominion be always fearful that the piedmontese government might one day be induce to favor a insurrectionary or national movement in the north of italy determine finding that it could not keep the fortress for itself which it strive hard to do under diver pretext to render it of as little use as they possibly could do to the king of sardinium so they blow up the fortification and carry off the cannon leave the king without a single fortified place in the whole of he italian dominion to defend himself in case of attack against a austrian invasion on the morning of the 15th August we pass thro ' tortona now no longer a fortress of consequence all this country may be consider as classic ground immortalize by the campaign of napoleon when commander in chief of the army of the french republic in italy a far greater and more illustrious _ rôle _ than when he assume the imperial bauble and condescend to mix with the vulgar herd of king we arrive at voghera to breakfast and at casteggio at night the country be much the same as that which we have already pass thro ' be a plain with a rich alluvial soil mulberry tree and a number of solidly build stone farmhouse the next morning at eleven o'clock we arrive at piacenza on the po and be detain a quarter of a hour at the _ douane _ of she majesty the archduchess as marium louisa the present duchess of parma be stile we be now arrive in she dominion we drive to the _ hôtel di san marco _ which be close to the _ piazza grande _ and alight there on the piazza stand the _ hôtel de ville _ and in front of it be two equestrian statue in bronze of the prince farnesi the statue however of the rider appear much too small in proportion with the horse and they resemble two little boy mount on lincolnshire carthorse i do not visit the church and palace in this city from not have time and besides i do not feel myself inclined or _ bind _ -lrb- as some traveller think themselves -rrb- to visit every church and every town in italy i really believe the _ cicerone _ think that we _ ultramontani _ live in mud hovel in we own country and that we have never see a stone edifice till we arrival in italy for every town house which be not a shop be term a _ palazzo _ and they would conduct you to see all of they if you would be guide by they i have a opportunity during the two hour we halt here of walk over the greater part of the city after a hasty breakfast piacenza be a large handsome city among the female that i saw in the street the spanish costume seem very prevalent no doubt from be so long govern by a spanish family on leave piacenza we pass thro ' a rich meadow country and meet with a immense quantity of cattle grazing the road be a fine broad _ chaussée _ considerably elevated above the level of the field and be line with poplar where this land be not in pasture cornfield and mulberry tree with vine in festoon vary the landscape which be additionally enliven by frequent _ maison de plaisance _ and excellently build farmhouse we pass thro ' firenzuolum a long well-built village or rather _ bourg _ and we bring to the night at borgo san donino at this place i find the first bad inn i have meet with in italy that be the house tho ' large be so out of repair as to be almost a _ masure _ we however meet with tolerably good fare for supper we fall in with a traveller at borgo san donino who relate to we a account of a extraordinary robbery that have be commit a few month before near this place in which the _ then _ host be implicate or rather be the author and planner of the robbery it happen as follow a swiss merchant one of those man who can not keep they own counsel a _ bavard _ in short be travel from milan to bologna with he cabriolet horse and a large portmanteau he put up at this inn at supper he enter into conversation with mine host and ask if there be any danger of robber on the road for that he should be sorry -lrb- he say -rrb- to fall into they hand inasmuch as he have with he in he portmanteau 24000 frank in gold and several valuable article of jewellery mine host assure he that there be not the slightest danger the merchant go to bed directing that he should be awaken at daybreak in order to proceed on he journey mine host however take care to have he call full a hour and half before daybreak assure he that light would soon dawn the merchant set out but he have hardly journey two mile when a shot from behind a hedge by the road side bring he horse to the ground four man in mask rush up seize he and bind he to a tree they then rifle he portmanteau take out he money and jewel and wish he good morning before we arrive at borgo san donino we cross the trebbium one of the many tributary stream of the po and which be famous for two celebrated battle one in ancient the other in modern tune -lrb- and probably many other which i do not recollect -rrb- but here it be that hannibal gain he second victory over the roman and here in 1799 the russian under souvoroff defeat the french under macdonald after a obstinate and sanguinary conflict but they could not prevent macdonald from effect he junction with massena to hinder which be souvoroff 's object in fact in this country to what reflection doth every spot of ground we pass over give rise every field every river have be the theater of some battle or other memorable event either in ancient or modern time _ quis gurges aut quae flumina lugubris ignara bellus -lrb- 81 -rrb- _ we start from borgo san donino next morning about ten mile further on the right hand side of the road stand a ancient gothic fortress call castel guelfo between this place and parma there be a very troublesome river to pass call the taro which at time be nearly dry and at other time so deep as to render it hazardous for a carriage to pass and it be at all time requisite to send on a man to ford and sound it before a carriage pass this river fill a variety of separate bed as it meander very much and it extend to such a breadth in its _ débordements _ as to render it impossible to construct a bridge long enough to be of any use this however be the dry season we pass it without difficulty two or three other stream on this route _ seguacus del po _ be cross in the same manner the road to parma after pass the taro lie nearly in a right line and be border with poplar if i be not mistake it be somewhere in this neighborhood that the carthaginian under hannibal suffer a great loss in elephant who die from cold be incamp during the winter i be tell there be not a colder country in europe than lombardy during the winter season which arise no doubt from its vicinity to the alp opulence seem to prevail in all the village in the vicinity of parma and a immense quantity of cattle be see grazing in the meadow on each side of the road the female peasantry wear the spanish costume and be remarkably well dress we arrive at parma at twelve o'clock and stop there three hour parma after a hasty breakfast mr g -- and myself sally forth to see what be possible during the time we stop in this city leave the captain who refuse to accompany we to smoke he pipe this city be very large and there be a very fine _ piazza _ the street be broad the building handsome and impose and there be a general appearance of opulence we first proceed to visit the celebrated amphitheatre call _ l'amfiteatro farnese _ in honor of the former sovereign of the duchy it be a vast building and unite the convenience both of the ancient and modern theater it have a roof like a modern theater and the seat in the _ parterre _ be arrange like the seat in a ancient greek theater above this be what we should call box and above they again what we usually term a gallery a vast and deep arena lie between the _ parterre _ and the orchestra and fill up the space between the audience and the _ proscenium _ it be admirably adapt both for spectator and hearer when a tragedy comedy or opera be act a scaffolding be erect and seat place in the arena at other time the arena be make use of for equestrian exercise and chariot race in the style of the ancient combat with wild beast etc or it may be fill with water for the representation of naval fight -lrb- _ naumachium _ -rrb- in this case you have a vast oval lake between the spectator and the stage it be a great pity that this superb and interesting building be not keep in good repair the fact be it be seldom or ever make use of except on very particular occasion : it be almost useless in a place like parma so fall from its high estate but be such a amphitheatre in paris london or any great city it might be use for all kind of _ spectacles _ and amusement a small theater from the design of bernino stand close to this amphitheatre and be build in a light tasteful manner if fresh paint and light up it would make a very brilliant appearance this may be consider as the court theater at a short distance from the theater be the museum of parma in which there be a well choose gallery of picture among the most striking picture of the old school be without doubt that of st jerôme by correggio but i be full as much dare i be so heretical as to say more pleased with the production of the modern school of parma a distribution of prize have lately be make by the empress marium louisa and there be many painting model of sculpture and architectural design that do infinite credit to the young artist i remark one painting in particular which be worthy of a fuselus it represent the battle of the river god scamander with achille the subject of most of the painting i saw here be take from the mythology or from ancient and modern history and this be perhaps the reason that they please I more than those of the ancient master why in the name of the -lrb- greek : to kalon -rrb- do these painter confine themselves so much to madonna crucifixion and martyrdom when they own poet ariosto and tasso present so many subject infinitely more please then again in many of these crucifixion and martyrdom the gross anachronism such as introduce monk and soldier with match-lock and woman in gothic costume at the crucifixion totally destroy the seriousness and interest of the subject by annihilate all illusion and exciting risibility parma will ever be renown in history as the birthplace of caius cassius the mend and colleague of brutus the empress marium louisa live here in the ducal palace which be a spacious but ornamental edifice she live ` tis say without any ostentation out of she own state she presence in italy would be attend with unpleasant consequence to the power that be on account of the attachment bear to napoleon by all class of society and it be on this account that on she last visit to bologna she receive a intimation from the papal authority to quit the roman territory in twenty-four hour we next pass thro ' st hilario and reggio and bring to the evening at the village of rubbiera at st hilario be the entrance into the duke of modena 's territory and here we undergo again & n examination of trunk as we do both on enter and leave the territory of marium louisa reggio be a large walled city but i have only time to visit the cathedral and to remark therein a fine picture of the virgin and the chapel call capella dellum morte reggio pretend to the honor of have give birth to the divine ariosto : quel grande che cantò l'armus e gli amorl as guarinus describe he i believe the face of the country from parma to reggio be exactly the same as what we have pass thro ' already the next day -lrb- 20 August -rrb- we pass thro ' modena where we stop to breakfast and refresh horse it be a large and handsome city the ducal palace be striking and in the cathedral be present the famous bucket which give rise to the poem of tassonus call _ la secchium rapita _ a air of opulence and grandeur seem to prevail in modena at samoggium we enter the papal territory and again undergo a search of trunk within three mile of bologna a number of villa and several tannery which send forth a most intolerable odour announce the approach to that celebrated and venerable city on the left hand side before enter the town be a superb portico with arcade about one and a half mile in length which lead from the city to the church of san luca on the right be the appennine tower gradually above you bologna lie at the foot of these mountain on the eastern side and here the plain end for those who be bind to florence which lie on the western side of the vast ridge which divide italy we arrive at bologna at half-past seven in the evening and here we intend to repose a day or two i shall then cross the appennine for the first time in my life a reinforcement of mule or ox be require for every carriage from the ascent the whole way you can travel i understand very little quicker _ en poste _ than with a _ vetturino _ we be lodge at bologna in a very comfortable inn call _ locanda d'inghilterra _ bologna 22d August the great popularity of bologna which be a very large and handsomely build city lie in the colonnaded portico and arcade on each side of the street throughout the whole city these arcade be mightily convenient against sun and rain and contradict the assertion of rousseau who assert that england be the only country in the world where the safety of foot passenger be consult whereas here in bologna not only be _ trottoir _ broader than those of london in general but you be effectually protect against sun and rain and be not oblige to carry a umbrella about with you perpetually as in london this arcade system be however rather a take off from the beauty of the city and give it a gloomy heavy appearance which be not diminish by the sight of friar and mendicant with which this place swarm and announce to you that you be in the holy land at bologna it be necessary to have a sharp eye on you baggage on account of the crowd of ragged _ fainéans _ that surround you carriage while it be unload the first thing that the _ cicerone _ generally take you to see in italy be the church and mine would not probably have spare I one but i be more anxious to see the university i however allow he to lead I into two of the principal church viz the _ duomo _ or cathedral and the church of san petronio both magnificent gothic temple and worth the attention of the traveller on the _ piazza del gigante _ be a fine bronze statue of neptune the _ piazza _ take its name from this statue as at one time in italy after the introduction of christianity and when the ancient mythology be totally forget the statue of the god be call giant or name after devil and they prototype believe to be such in the museum at the university be a admirable collection of fossil mineral and machine in every branch of science there be some excellent picture also the university of bologna be you know at all time famous and its celebrity be not at all diminish for i believe bologna boast more scientific man and particularly in the science _ positive _ than any other city in italy in the _ palazzo pubblico _ -lrb- _ hôtel de ville _ -rrb- be a christ and a samson by guido renus but what pleased I most in the way of painting be the collection in the gallery of count marescalchus the count have be at great pain to form it and have show great taste and discernment it be a small but unique collection here be to be see a head of christ the coloring of which be so brilliant as to illuminate the room in which it be append when the shutter be close and in the absence of all other light except what appear thro ' the crevice of the window shutter this head however do not seem characteristic of christ it want the gravity the soft melancholy and unassuming meekness of the _ great reformer _ : in short from the vivid fire of the eye and the too great self-complacency of the countenance it give I rather the idea del biondo dio che in tessalium si adorá i pass two hour in this cabinet i next repair to the center of the city with the intention of ascend one at least of the two square tower or _ campanilus _ which stand close together one of which be _ strait _ the other a lean one _ garisendus _ be the name of the lean tower and it form a parallelipipedon of 140 foot in height and about twenty foot in breath and length it lean so much as to form a angle of seventy-five degree with the ground on which it stand the other tower the strait one be call _ asinelli _ and be a parallelipipedon of 310 foot in height and about twenty-five foot in length and breadth i ascend the lean tower but i find the fatigue so great that i be scarcely repay by the fine view of the surrounding country which present on one side a immense plain cover with town village and villa and on the other the appennine tower one above another when on the top of _ garisendus _ _ asinelli _ appear to be four time higher than its neighbor and the bare aspect of its enormous height deter I from even make the attempt of ascend it when view or rather look down upon from _ garisendus _ bologna from its being of a elliptical form and surround by a wall and from have these two enormous tower in the center resemble a boat with mast from the great celebrity of its university and the eminent man it have produce bologna be consider as the most litterary city of italy galvanus be bear in bologna and study at this university and among the modern prodigy be a young lady who be professor of greek and who be by all account the most amiable _ ba bleu _ that ever exist -lrb- 82 -rrb- the bolognese be a remarkably fine intelligent and robust race of people and be renown for they republican spirit and the energy with which they at all time resist the encroachment of the holy see bologna be at one time a republic and on they coin be the word liberta the bolognese never like the papal government and be much exasperated at return under the domination of the holy father in the time of napoleon bologna form part of the _ regno d'ltalia _ and partook of all its advantage napoleon be much regret by they and so impatiently do the inhabitant bear the change on the dismemberment of the kingdom of italy and they transfer to the pontifical sceptre that on murat 's entry in they city in 1815 the student and other young man of the town fly to arm and in a few hour organise three battalion have the other city show equal energy and republican spirit the revolution would have be complete and italy free but the fact be that the italian in general tho ' discontented have no very high opinion of murat 's talent as a political character and he besides _ committed _ a great fault in not enter rome on he march and revolutionise it murat like most man be ruin by half-measure the last tune that marium louisa be here the people surround the inn where she reside and hail she with cry of _ viva i ` imperatrice _ the pope 's legate in consequence intimate to she the expediency of she immediate departure from the city with a request that she would not repeat she visit bologna be consider by the ultras _ obscuranten _ and _ éteignoirs _ as the focus and headquarters of carbonarism in the evening i visit the theater build by bibbiena and have the pleasure of hearing for the first time a italian tragedy which however be now rarely represent and scarcely ever well act this night 's performance form a exception and be satisfactory the piece be _ romeo and giulietta _ the actress who do the part of giulietta perform it with great effect particularly in the tomb scene in this scene she remind I forcibly of we own excellent actress miss o'neill this be the only part of the play that have any resemblance to the tragedy of shakespeare all the rest be on the french model i see a number of beautiful woman in the box the bolognese woman be remarkable for they fine complexion those that i saw be much incline to _ embonpoint _ -lrb- 79 -rrb- and also to napoleon after the battle at eylau -- ed -lrb- 80 -rrb- joseph forsyth -lrb- 1763-1815

tuscan idiom and custom -- monument and gallery at florence -- the cascino -- church -- theater -- popularity of the grand duke -- napoleon 's downfall not regret -- academy in florence florence 26th August the moment you leave bologna to go to florence you enter the gorge of the appennine and after journey seven mile begin to ascend the ridge the ascent begin at pianoro among these mountain the scenery be wild and romantic and tho ' not so grandiose and sublime as that of the alp be nevertheless extremely picturesque one meet occasionally with the ruin of old castle on some of the height and i be strongly remind at the sight of these antique edifice of the mystery of udolpho and the time of the condottierus the silence that reign here be only interrupt by the noise of the waterfall and the occasional scream of the eagle the wild abrupt transition of landscape would suggest the idea of haunting place for robber yet one seldom or never hear of any on this road in tuscany there be i understand so much industry and morality that a robbery be a thing unknown but in he holiness 's dominion from the idleness and poverty that prevail they be say to be frequent why it do not occur in these mountain in that part of they at least which belong to the papal government i be at a loss to conceive here the chesnut and olive tree salute the ultramontane traveller for the first time the olive tree tho ' a most useful be not a ornamental one as it resemble a willow or osier in its trunk and in the color of its leave the chesnut tree be a glorious plant for a indolent people since it furnish food without labor as the xaca or jack fruit tree do to the cingalese in ceylon on one of the height between pianoro and lojano you have in very clear weather a view of both the adriatic and tyrrhene sea we bring to the night at scarica l'asino and the next morning early we enter the tuscan territory at pietra mala where there be a _ douane _ and consequently a examination of trunk at one o'clock we arrive at a inn call _ le maschere _ about fifteen mile distance from florence it be a large mansion and be situate on a eminence command a extensive view one become soon aware of be in the tuscan territory from the number of cultivate spot to be see in this part of the appennine : for such be the industry of the inhabitant that they do wonder on they naturally sterile soil one see a number of farm every spot of ground be in cultivation between _ le maschere _ and florence in particular these spot of ground garden orchard and villa form a striking and please contrast with the wild and dreary scenery of the appennine another thing that indicate one 's arrival among the tuscan be they aspiration of the letter _ c _ before _ a _ _ o _ and _ u _ which be at first extremely puzzling to a foreigner accustom only to the roman pronunciation for instance instead of _ camera _ _ cotto _ _ curvo _ they pronounce these word _ hamera _ _ hotto _ and _ hurvo _ with a exceed strong aspiration of the _ h _ it be the same too with the _ ch _ which they aspirate _ ex gr _ instead of _ pochino _ _ chiave _ they say _ pohino _ _ hiave _ the language however which be speak be the most classical and pure italian and except the above mention aspiration it be delightful to the ear peculiarly so to those who come from the north of italy and have only hitherto hear the unpleasing nasal twang of the milanese and the exceed uncouth barbarous dialect of bologna another striking peculiarity be the smart appearance of the tuscan peasantry they be a remarkably handsome race of man the female unite with they natural beauty a grace and elegance that one be quite astonished to find among peasant they express themselves in the most correct and classical language and they have a great deal of repartee as the peasantry of tuscany enjoy a greater share of _ aisance _ than fall to the lot of those of any other country and as the female dress with taste and take great pain to appear smart on all occasion they resemble rather the shepherdess on the opera stage or those of the fabled arcadium than anything in real life the female too be remarkably industrious and will work like horse all the week to gain wherewithal to appear smart on holiday they dress be very become and they wear sometimes jewellery to a large amount on they person a very common ornament among they be a collar of gold around they neck they usual head-dress be either a white straw hat or a black round beaver hat with black ostrich feather i prefer the straw hat it be more tasteful than the round hat which always seem to I too masculine for a woman at the inn at _ le maschere _ we be wait on by three smart female the whole road from _ le maschere _ to florence be very beautiful and diversified vineyard garden farm house and villa thicken as one approach and when arrive within three mile of florence which lie in a basin surround by mountain one be quite bewildered at the sight of the quantity of beautiful villa and _ maison de plaisance _ in every direction every thing indicate life industry and comfort in this charming country we stop at a villa belong to the grand duke call _ ii pratolino _ seven mile distant from florence here be to be see the famous statue represent the genius of the appennine the villa be unfurnished and out of repair and the garden and grounds be neglect : it be a great pity for it be a fine building and in a beautiful position the celebrated bianca capello a venetian by birth and mistress of francesco ii de ' medici grand duke of tuscany use to reside here florence 27th August i be extremely well pleased with my accommodation at the hotel where i be lodge mme hembert the proprietor be once _ femme de chambre _ to the empress joséphine she be a excellent woman and a very attentive hostess and i recommend she hotel to all those traveller who visit florence and do not care to incur the expence of schneider 's there be a excellent and well serve _ table d'hôte _ at two o'clock wine at discretion for which and for my bedroom i pay seven _ paolus _ per day this hotel have the advantage of be in a very central situation it be close to the _ piazza del gran duca _ the post-office the _ palazzo vecchio _ the bureau of government the celebrated gallery of sculpture and painting and to the arno it be only 300 yard from the _ piazza del duomo _ where the cathedral stand and 600 yard from the principal theater _ della pergola _ on the one side while on the other side after cross the _ ponte vecchio _ stand the _ palazzo pittus _ the residence of the grand duke at a distance of seven or 800 yard the _ piazza del gran duca _ be very striking to the eye of the northern traveller the statue of the god in white marble in the open air would make he fancy himself in athen in the olden time the follow statue in bronze and white marble be to be see on this _ piazza _ in bronze be : a statue of perseus by cellinus judith with the head of holoferne by donatello david and goliath samson in white marble be the follow beautiful statue : a group represent hercule and cacus another represent a roman carry off a sabine woman the hercule who be in the act of strangle cacus rest on one leg nearly in the center of the _ piazza _ opposite to the post office and in front of the _ palazzo vecchio _ be the principal ornament of the _ piazza _ which consist of a group represent neptune in he car or conch -lrb- or shell -rrb- draw by sea-horse and accompany by triton the statue of neptune be of colossal size the whole group be in marble and the conch of egyptian granite this group form a fountain there be likewise on this _ piazza _ a immense equestrian statue in bronze of cosmo the first by john of bologna the _ palazzo vecchio _ be a large gothic building by arnulpho and have a very lofty square tower or _ campanile _ the gallery of florence be so close to my abode demand next my attention the building in which this invaluable museum be preserved form three side of a parallelogram two long one and one short one of which the side towards the south of the quaus of the arno be the short one on the north be a open space communicate with the _ piazza del gran duca _ the gallery occupy the whole first floor of this vast building the _ rez de chaussée _ be occupy on the west side by the bureau of government and on the south and east side by shopkeeper in whose shop be always to be see a brilliant display of merchandize as there be arcade on the three side of this parallelogram they form the favorite meridian promenade of the _ belle _ and _ beau _ of florence particularly on sunday and holiday after come out of church i ascend the step from a door on the east side of the building to visit the gallery the quantity and variety of object of art of the greatest value baffle all description and it would require month and year to attempt a analysis of all it contain i shall therefore content myself with point out those object which imprint themselves the most forcibly on my imagination and recollection in a chamber on the left hand of one wing of the gallery stand the venus de ' medicus send back last year from france in the same chamber with she be the follow statue : the extremely beautiful _ apollino _ the spotted faun the _ rémouleur _ or figure which be in the act of whet a sickle all these be in paris and be now restore to this gallery in this chamber two picture strike I in particular : the one the venus of titian a most voluptuous figure the other a portrait of the mistress of rafaello call _ la fornarina _ from she be a baker 's daughter return to the gallery i be quite bewildered at the immense number of statue picture sarcophagus bust altar etc among the piece of sculpture those that most catch my attention be : the _ venus genetrix _ -lrb- which i have see before at pari -rrb- the _ venus victrix _ the _ venus anadyomene _ hercule and nessus a superb groupe a young bacchus and a exquisitely chiselled group represent pan teaching olympus to play the syrinx tho ' the attitude of the former be rather indecorous from not be in a very quiescent state a fine statue of leda with the swan a mercury both worthy of great attention i remark also in particular a statue of marsya attach to a tree and flay it be of a pale reddish marble and tho ' i perfectly agree with forsyth that color marble be not at all adapt to statuary yet in this instance it give a wonderful effect and be strikingly suitable as the slight reddish color give a full idea of the flesh after the skin be tear off it make one shudder to look at it in one of the hall be the statue of niobe and she daughter a beautiful group then there be the celebrated copy of the group of the laocoon by bandinellus which none but the most perfect and skilful connoisseur could distinguish from the original but it be totally impossible for I to describe the immense variety of painting historical portrait and landscape the statue single or in group the sarcophagus altar bas-relief inscription bronze medal vase bath candelabrum cameo etruscan and egyptian idol with which this admirable museum be fill in a line on each side of the gallery near the ceiling be a succession of portrait in chronological order of the grand duke of tuscany the germanic emperor the king of france of england of spain of portugal of the pope and of the ottoman emperor among the antiquity i particularly notice a large steel mirror and a roman eagle in bronze of the 24th legion have pass full four hour in this museum i descend the step cross the arno and repair to the building in which be preserve the _ cabinet d'histoire naturelle _ in this museum what be most remarkable be the imitation in wax of the whole anatomy of the human body it be the first collection of its kind indeed it be unique in europe these imitation be keep in glass case and be so true and so perfectly correct as to leave nothing to desire to the student in anatomy these imitation in wax not only include all the detail of anatomy but also the progress of generation gestation and of almost every malady to which

have this peculiarity that they be all pave with large flag stone which make they mightily pleasant for pedestrian but dangerous at time for horse who be apt to slip most of the house in florence have wall of prodigious thickness one would suppose each house be mean to be a fortress in case of necessity florence 29th August on the other side of the arno a little beyond the _ cabinet physique _ and museum of natural history stand the _ palazzo pittus _ the residence of the grand duke it be a vast building and have a large and choice collection of picture but its finest ornament in my opinion be the statue of venus by canova which to I at least appear to equal the medicean venus in beauty and in grace the magnificent and spacious garden belong to the palace be call the garden of bobolus these garden form the grand promenade of the florentine on sunday and holiday the alley be well shaded by tree which effectually protect the promenader from the ray of the sun there be a great many statue in this garden but the most striking be a group which lie nearly in the center of the garden it be environ by a large circular basin or lake line with stone and plant with orange tree on the whole circumference in the center of the lake be a rock and on this rock be a colossal statue in white marble of neptune in he car the car be in the shape of a marine conch and serve as a basin and fountain

party be often form here this place be often the scene of curious adventure cicisbeism be universal at florence tho ' far from be always criminal as be generally suppose by foreigner i find the florentine woman very graceful and many very handsome but in point of beauty the female peasantry far exceed the _ noblesse _ and burgher all of they however dress with taste the handsomest woman in florence be the wife of a apothecary who live in the _ piazza del duomo _ and she have a host of admirer on the promenade _ lungo l'arno _ near the cascino be a fountain with a statue of pegasus with a inscription in italian verse purport that pegasus have stop there one day to refresh himself at this fountain find the place so pleasant that he remain there ever since this be a poetic nation _ par excellence _ _ affich _ be announce in sonnet and other metre and tho ' in other country the votary of the muse be but too apt to neglect the ordinary and vulgar concern of life yet here it by no means diminish industry and the nine lady be on the best possible term with mr mercury i shall not attempt a description of the various _ palazzo _ and church of florence tho ' i have visit thanks to the zeal and importunity of my _ cicerone _ nearly all except to remark that no one church in florence the cathedral and baptistery on the _ piazza del duomo _ except have its façade finish and they will remain probably for ever unfinished as the completion of they would cost very large sum of money and the restore government however anxious to resuscitate the _ ancient faith _ be not incline to make large disbursement from they own resource for that purpose i wish however they would finish the façade of two of these church viz that of _ santa marium novellum _ and that of _ santa croce _ _ santa marium novellum _ stand in the piazza of that name which be very large it be a beautiful edifice and can boast in the interior of it several column and pilaster of _ jaune antique _ and of white marble but they have a most barbarous custom in florence of cover these column with red cloth on _ jours de fête _ which spoil the elegant simplicity of the column and make the church itself resemble a _ théâtre des marionnettes _ but the italian be dreadfully fond of gaudy color in the church of _ santa croce _ what most engage my attention be the monument erect to vittorio alfieri sculpture by canova it be a most beautiful piece of sculpture a figure of italy crown with turret seem fully sensible of the great loss she have sustain in one who be so ardent a patriot as well as a excellent tragic poet this monument be erect at the expence of the countess of albany -lrb- queen of england have _ legitimacy _ always prevail or be as much in fashion as it now be -rrb- as a mark of esteem and affection towards one who be so tenderly attach to she and of whom in he writings alfieri speak with the endearing and affectionate appellation of _ mium donna _ the beautiful sonnet to she which accompany the dedication of he tragedy of _ mirra _ well deserve the monument there be so much feeling in it that i can not retrain from transcribe it : vergognando talor che ancor si taccium donna per I l'almo tuo nome in fronte di queste omai glà troppe a te ben conte tragedie ond ` io di folle avrommi taccia or vo ' qual d'esse meno a te dispiaccium di te fregiar benchè di tutte il fonte tu sola fosti e ' l viver mio non conte se non dal di ch ` al viver tuo si allaccia della figlia di ciniro infelice l'orrendo a un tempo ed innocente amore sempre da ' tuoi begli occhi il planto elice prova emmi questo ch ` al mio dubbio core tacitamente imperiosa dice ch ` io di mirra consacri a te il dolore in this sanctuary -lrb- church of the _ santa croce _ -rrb- be likewise the tomb and monument of other great man which italy have produce there be the monument erect to galileo which represent the earth turn round the sun with the emphatic word : _ eppur si muove _ here too repose the ash of machiavellus and michel angelo this church be in fact the westminster abbey of florence to go from the _ piazza del gran duca _ to the _ piazza del duomo _ where stand the cathedral you have only to pass thro ' a long narrow street or rather alley -lrb- for it be impervious to carriage -rrb- with shop on each side and always fill with people go to or return from the duomo this cathedral be of immense size the architecture be singular from its be a mixture of the gothic and greek it appear the most ponderous load that ever be lay on the shoulder of poor mother earth there be nothing light in its structure to relieve the massiveness of the building and in this respect it form a striking contrast to the cathedral of milan which appear the work of sylph the outside of this duomo of florence be decorate and incrust with black and white marble which increase the massiveness of its appearance the steeple or campanile stand by itself altogether separate from the cathedral and this be the case with most of the church in italy that be not of pure gothic architecture this _ campanile _ be curiously inlay and incrust on its outside with red white and black marble the baptistery be another building on the same _ piazza _ it be in the same stile of building as the duomo but inclose much less space and be formerly a separate church call the church of st john the baptist the immense bronze door or rather gate both of the duomo and battisterio attract my peculiar notice on they be figure bas-relief of exquisite and admirable workmanship represent scripture history it be the symmetry and perfection of these gate that induce michel angelo to call they in a fit of enthusiasm _ the gate of paradise _ at the door of the battisterio be the column in red granite which once adorn the gate of the city at pisa and be carry off by the florentine in one of they war chain be fasten round these column as a memorial of the conquest the cupola both of the duomo and battisterio be octangular there be a stone seat on the _ piazza del duomo _ where they pretend that dante use occasionally to sit hence it be call to this day _ il sasso di dante _ you will now no doubt expect I to give some account of the theater at the _ pergola _ which be a large and splendid theater i have see two opera the one _ l'italiana in algieri _ which i see before at milan last year the other the _ barbierus di seviglia _ by rossinus which afford to my ear the most delightful musical feast they ever enjoy the cavatina _ una voce poco fa _ give I inconceivable delight the _ ballo _ be of a very splendid description and from a subject take from the oriental history entitle _ macbet sultan of delhi _ how the mogul sultan come to have the name of macbet i know not on the _ plafond _ of the _ pergola _ be a allegorical painting represent the restore king of europe replace on they throne by valor and justice the decoration at this theater be not quite so splendid as those of the _ scalum _ at milan but live horse and military evolution seem to be annex to every historical _ ballo _ horse indeed appear to be a indispensable ingredient in the _ ballus _ in the large city of italy in the _ teatro cocomera _ comedy be perform and very generally those of the inexhaustible goldonus i see the _ bugiardo _ very fairly perform at this theater the story be nearly the same as that of we piece _ the liar _ which be i believe imitate from _ le menteur _ of corneille the actor who do the liar be a very good one the actress scream too much and be rather coarse another night at the theater i see a piece call would _ ii furioso _ a _ comédie larmoyante _ which be interesting and well give but the voice of the prompter be occasionally too loud tragedy be very seldom play the language of alfierus could never i will not say be give with effect but even conceive by the modern actor it would be like a tragedy of sophocle perform by boy at school there be another reason too why these tragedy be not give they abound too much in republican and patriotic sentiment to be grateful to the ear of the prince who reign in italy all of whom be of foreign extraction and unshackled by constitution come under the denomination of those being call by greek -lrb- greek : turannous -rrb- i use this word in its greek sense of the tuscan government it be but justice to say that from the day of leopold to the present day it be and be a mild just and paternal government more so perhaps than any in europe and the only one that can any way reconcile one altogether to those line of pope : for form of government let fool contest whate'er be best administer would be best -lrb- 83 -rrb- in the time of leopold the factious nobility be keep in check and the industrious class mercantile and agricultural encourage the peasantry be and be the most affluent in europe and this be no small incitement to the industry that prevail on the elevation of leopold to the throne of the caesar the present grand duke succeed in tuscany and he follow the same system that leopold do and be equally beloved by he subject tuscany be the only country in italy that do not desire a change at the period of the french conquest and the only state wherein the french be not hail as deliverer the tuscan exhibit a very honorable spirit on the occasion of buonaparte 's visit to the grand duke in 1797 they go together to the theater della pergola and on they enter into the grand ducal box the grand duke be hail with cry of _ viva il nostro sovrano _ : now this proof of attachment at a period when buonaparte be all-mighty in italy when the grand duke be but a inferior personage at a time too when it be doubtful whether or not he would be dethrone and in the very presence of the mighty conqueror reflect great honor and credit on the tuscan character buonaparte be much strike at this proof of disinterested attachment on the part of the florentine towards they sovereign and tell the grand duke very ingenuously that he have receive order to revolutionize the country from the french directory but that as he perceive the people be so happy and the prince so beloved he could not and would not attempt to make any change the applause give to the grand duke at this critical period be so much the more creditable to the florentine as they in general receive they prince on he present himself at the theater with no other ceremonial than rise once and bow there be no fulsome _ god save the king _ repeat even to nausea as at the english theater in fact none of the italian pay that servile adulation to they sovereign that the french and english do the change project in italy at the treaty of lunéville by napoleon then first consul and he further view on italy induce he at length to eject a austrian prince from the sovereignty of a country which he intend to annex to the french empire the grand duke be indemnify with a principality in germany where he remain until the downfall of napoleon in 1814 subsequent arrangement again restore he to the sway of the land he love so well and he return to florence as if he have only be absent on a tour finding scarcely any change in the law and custom and habit of the country for tho ' tuscany be first erect into a kingdom by the title of etrurium and afterwards annex to the french empire the institution and law lay down by leopold and follow strictly by he successor be preserved very little innovation take place and the few innovation that be effect be decide amelioration for the emperor napoleon have too much tact not to preserve and protect the good he find tho ' he abolish all old abuse the improvement introduce by the french have be preserve and confirm by the grand duke on he return for he be a man of too much good sense and have too much love of justice to think of abolish the good that have be do merely because it be do by the french tuscany have now a respectable military force of 8000 man well armed clothe and equip in the french manner tuscany be the only part of italy where the downfall of napoleon be not regret the inhabitant of leghorn indeed rejoice at it for the commerce of tuscany be chiefly maritime leghorn suffer a good deal from the continental system leghorn in fact decay in the same proportion that milan and other inland city rise into opulence the character of the tuscan people be so amiable and pacific that crime be very rare indeed murder be almost unknown and the punishment of death be banish from the penal code where the government be good the people be or soon become good i know of no country in the world more agreeable for a foreigner to settle in than tuscany i omit to remark that in the street call _ borgo d'ognissantus _ be a large house or _ palazzo _ which belong to americo vespuccus he bust be to be see in the florentine gallery it be curious to remark the different appellation give to the word _ street _ in the different city of italy in milan a street be call _ vico _ and in turin _ contrada _ in florence _ strada _ and in rome i understand _ via _ florence 1st sept i shall start in a day or two for rome be very impatient to behold the eternal city a plan which i have have in view from my earliest day and which i have not be able hitherto to effect for like the abbé delille i have swear to visit the sacred spot where so many illustrious man have speak and act and to do hommage in person to they mane i be always a great admirer of the _ popolo re _ in florence there be a great many literary society such as the _ infuocatus immobili _ and the far renowned _ la crusca _ frequent _ academy _ for so a sit of a litterary society in italy be term be hold in florence there be likewise two casino one for the nobility and the other for the merchant and burgher the wife and daughter of the member attend occasionally and card music and dancing be the amusement florence abound in artist in alabaster whose workmanship be beautiful they make model in alabaster of the most celebrated piece of sculpture and architecture on any scale you chuse : they fabricate bust too and vase in alabaster the vase make in imitation of the ancient greek vase be magnificent and some of they be of immense size foreigner generally chuse to have they bust take for almost all foreigner who arrive here be or pretend to be smite with a ardent love for the fine art and every one wish to take with he model of the fine thing he have see in italy on he return to he native country here be english traveller who at home would scarcely be able to distinguish the finest piece of ancient sculpture -- the mercury for instance in the florentine gallery from a mercury in a citizen 's garden at highgate -- who here affect to be in extacy at the sight of the venus apollino & c and they be fond of retailing on all occasion the term of art and connoisseurship they have learn by rote in the use of which they make sometimes ridiculous mistake for instance i hear a englishman one day hold forth on the merit of the vierge _ quisouse _ as he call it i could not for some time divine what he mean by the word _ quisouse _ but after some explanation i find that he mean the celebrated painting of the _ vierge qui coud _ or _ vierge couseuse _ as it be sometimes call which latter word he have transform into _ quisouse _ this affectation however of passion for the _ belle arti _ tho ' sometimes open to ridicule be very useful it generate taste encourage artist and be surely a more innocent as well as more rational mode of spend money and pass time than in

sbirri _ at rome we issue from the _ porta romana _ at 6 o'clock be the 3d September the road wind thro ' a valley and have a gentle ascent nearly the whole way to poggibonsus where we bring to the first night the soil hereabouts be far from fertile but every inch of it be put to profit the olive tree be very frequent and several farm and village be to be meet with the next day we arrive at 12 o'clock at sienna the approach to sienna be announce by a quantity of olive tree the situation of this city be on a elevation make it cold and bleak we remain here three hour so that i have time to visit some of the place worthy of remark in this venerable city which be handsome and very solidly build but have rather a sombre appearance the _ piazza grande _ lie in a bottom to which you descend from the environ street it be in the shape of a mussel shell and of very large size the cathedral be gothic and be a very majestic and venerable building inside it be of black and yellow marble the pavement of this church contain scripture history in mosaic a library be annex to the church the librarian point out to I 80 folio volume of church music with illuminate plate likewise a ancient piece of sculpture much mutilate viz a group of the three grace in one of the chapel of this cathedral be eight column of _ verd-antique _ i observe a monument of the piccolominus family who belong to this city one of which family figure a good deal in the thirty year ' war in germany i see several woman in the cathedral and at the window of the house the greater part of they be handsome the italian language be speak here in its greatest purity it be the pure tuscan dialect without the tuscan aspiration the siennese language be in fact the identical _ lingua toscana in bocca romana _ we arrive the same evening at buon convento a old dismal dirty-looking town formerly fortify but the country in the environs be please enough the inn here be very bad on the road between sienna and this place i observe a number of mulberry tree the next morning the 5th sept we arrive at radicofanus or rather at a inn or post house face radicofanus this be a very ancient city and from its be on a eminence it have a impose appearance above it tower a immense conical shaped mountain evidently a volcano in former time in fact the whole country hereabouts be volcanic which be plainly see from the immense mass of calcined stone the exhalation of sulphur and the dreary wild appearance of the country where scarce a tree be to be see i never in my life see so many calcine rock and stone of great magnitude heap together as at radicofanus it give the idea as if it be the identical field of battle between jupiter and the titan and as if the mass of rock that everywhere meet the eye have be hurl at the empyreum by the titan and have fall back on the spot from whence they be tear up it be indeed very probable that this volcano which vomit forth rock and stone in a very remote age give rise to the fable of the war between jupiter and the giant just as the volcano in sicily and strombolus give rise to the story of the cyclops with one eye -lrb- the crater -rrb- in they forehead but the mountain of radicofanus must have be a volcano anterior even to aetna it present the image of a ancient world destroy by fire at ponte centino the next morning we take we leave of _ la patria bella di vaghe donne e di dolce favella _ in plain prose we leave the tuscan territory and re-enter the dominion of he holiness after be detain half a hour at the _ douane _ we proceed to acquapendente to breakfast the country between radicofanus and acquapendente be dreary thinly populated little cultivate and volcanic steam of sulphur assail the nostril before we arrive at acquapendente we have a troublesome river to cross which at time be nearly dry and at other time the water come down in torrent from the surround mountain and precipice so as to render its passage extremely dangerous it be always necessary previous to the passage of a carriage to send on a man to ford and sound it from its meandering and form different bed cross seven time twice less than styx _ novy interfusa _ and it be a very slow operation from the number of rock and quicksand so that should the torrent come down while you be in the act of cross you and you whole equipage would be sweep away by the stream and drown or dash to piece traveller go to and return from rome be frequently detain for a day or two at ponte centino or acquapendente during the rainy season for immediately after heavy rain there be always a great risk and it be better to halt for several hour to allow the water to pass off the extent of ground that this river cover by its meandering and form so many bed nearly parallel to each other render it impossible to construct a bridge long enough and it would be always liable to be sweep away by the torrent nobody ever think of cross the river in the dark there have no rain fall for several day we pass it without difficulty within a mile of acquapendente the landscape vary and the approach to this town be exceedingly picturesque acquapendente be situate on a lofty eminence from which several magnificent cascade descend into the ravine below and which give the name to the town there be a great number of tree about this town and they afford a great relief to the eye of the traveller after so many hour ' journey thro ' volcanic waste the town of acquapendente be very ancient it be very large but ill-paved and dirty the best building in it be however modern the inhabitant appear lazy and dirty on enter into conversation with some soldier belong to the papal army who be station at this place i find that most of they have serve under napoleon they speak of he with tear of affection in they eye and i pleased they much by reciprocate they opinion of that great man to speak well of napoleon be the surest passport to civility and good treatment on the part of the soldier and _ douanier _ in the evening we arrive at bolsena the ancient volsinium a city of the volscian it be a ancient look town not very clean and inhabit by indolent people it be situate on the bank of a large lake on which there be three small island it be very aguish and unhealthy and the inhabitant appear sickly with marvellous sallow complexion the inn where we put up be a pretty good one and as this lake abound in fish we have some excellent trout and pike for supper among other dish there be one that be very gratifying to I a old east and west indian and that be the _ peveronus _ or large red and green pepper or capsicum fry in oil some excellent orvieto wine crown we repast and help to restore we from we fatigue on leave bolsena the next morning the 7th and within a very short distance from that town we enter a thick and venerable forest thro ' which the road run for several mile fine old tree of immense height cover with foliage and thickly stud together give to this forest a aweful and romantic appearance it be quite a _ lucus opaca ingen _ this forest have be hold sacred since the earliest time and be even now hold in such superstitious veneration by the people that they do not allow it to be cut the dryad and hamadryad have no doubt long ago take they flight but the wood from its length and opaqueness inspire I with some apprehension lest it might be the abode of some modern votary of mercury people have confuse idea of _ meum _ and _ tuum _ and the _ appropriative faculty _ too strongly develop in they organization and i expect every moment to hear a shot and the terrible cry of _ ferma _ but we meet with no accident nor do we fall in with a living soul on issue from this forest we perceive on a eminence before we at a short distance the town of montefiascone we stop there as almost all traveller do to taste the famous montefiascone wine or _ est _ wine as it be frequently call this wine be fine flavored _ pétillant _ and wonderfully exhilarating it be renown for have occasion the death of a german prelate in the sixteenth century who be travel in italy and who be remarkably fond of good wine the story be as follow he be accustom to send on he servant to the different town thro ' which he be to pass with direction to taste and report on the quality of the different wine to be find there and if they be good to mark the word _ est _ on the cask from which he taste they the servant on arrival at montefiascone be highly please with the flavor of the wine of which there be three cask at the inn where they put up he accordingly write the word _ est _ on each of the cask the bishop arrive soon after and take such a liking to this wine that he die in a few day of a fever bring on by continual intoxication he be bury in one of the church at montefiascone and the monk of the convent there themselves _ bons-vivan _ determine to give he a suitable epitaph they accordingly cause to be engrave on he tomb the follow latin inscription commemorative of the event : _ est est est propter nimium est dominus episcopus mortuus _ est from the above circumstance this wine be call _ vino d'est _ and it afford no small revenue to the proprietor of the _ cabaret _ on the road side who sell it we arrive at viterbo to breakfast and at ronciglione in the evening viterbo be a large and handsome city and contain several striking building it be pave with lava and contain a great variety of fountain there be some appearance of commerce and industry in this town and there be several _ maison de plaisance _ in the neighborhood from viterbo thro ' monterosus to ronciglione the road lie over a mountain of steep ascent here and there be patch of forest there be not a house to be see on this route and from there be a good deal of wood and no appearance of cultivation one fancy oneself rather in the wild of a new country like america than in so old a one as italy ronciglione be a old rubbishing town half in ruin and contain no one thing remarkable the next morning at four o'clock we start from ronciglione and reach baccano to breakfast baccano contain only two building but they be both very large and roomy the one be the inn and the other serve as a barrack for the military there be always a strong military detachment here for the security of the road against robber who occasionally infest this neighborhood the inn be of immense size traveller who arrive here late would do well to halt here the whole night as not only the road be dangerous on account of robber but because if they arrive at rome after five o'clock pm they can not release they baggage and carriage from the custom house till next day every carriage public or private that arrive in rome be bind unless a special permission to the contrary be obtain from the government to drive direct to the custom house -lrb- _ dogana _ -rrb- in the like manner on travel from rome to florence people generally prefer to start from rome at twelve o'clock and bring to the night at baccano so as to avoid the bad inn at ronciglione and sleep in preference at viterbo i here speak only of those who travel by short stage as the _ vetturinus _ do ariosto have give a celebrity to this wretched place baccano in he poem of the _ orlando furioso _ in the story of giocondo in the 28th canto as be the identical place where fausto the brother of giocondo remain to await the return of he brother from rome to which place he have go back when half way between baccano and rome to fetch the _ monile _ which he have leave behind he and find he wife not _ alone _ and _ die with grief _ as he apprehend but _ sotto la coltre _ with a servant of the family the country between baccano and rome be as unpleasing and even worse than that between the former place and ronciglione it be hilly but not a tree nor a house nor a sign of cultivation to be see except the two or three wretched hovel at la storta there be nothing at all that announce the approach to a capital city and in addition to the dismal landscape there be a sight still more dismal that salute the eye of the traveller at interval of two or three mile and which do not tend to inspire please idea and this be the sight of arm and leg of malefactor and murderer suspend on large pole on the road side for it be the custom here to cut off the arm and leg of murderer after decapitation and to suspend they _ in terrorem _ on pole erect on the very spot where they commit the murder the sight of these limb dangle in the wind be not a very comfortable one towards the close of the evening we leave the _ sepolero di nerone _ a ancient tomb so call on the right of we road and half a mile beyond it cross the tiber at the _ ponte molle -lrb- pon milvius -rrb- _ where there be a gate bridge and military post from this post to the _ porta del popolo _ the entrance into the city for those come from the north the distance be one mile there be a white wall on each side of the road the whole way and some farm house and villa near the _ ponte molle _ be the field of battle where maxentius be defeat by constantine we enter the _ porta del popolo _ cross the _ piazza _ of the same name where three street present themselves to view in the center be the street call the _ corso _ run in a direct line from the _ porta _ across the _ piazza _ we drive along the _ corso _ till we arrive at a _ piazza _ on we right hand which _ piazza _ be call _ della colonna _ from the column of antoninus which stand on it we then cross the _ piazza _ which be very large and soon reach the _ dogana _ or custom house formerly the temple of antoninus pius where vile modern wall be build to fill up the interval between eleven column of grecian marble here we baggage undergo a rigorous research this rigor be not so much direct against the fraudulent introduction of contraband or duty-bearing merchandise as against _ book _ which undergo a severe scrutiny against voltaire and rousseau implacable war be wage and they work be immediately confiscate other author too be sometimes examine to see whether they contain anything against mother church as the people employ in inspect book be not much verse in any litterature or language but they own except perhaps a little french it be not easy for they to find out the contents of book in other language i have schiller 's work with I a volume of which one of the _ douanier _ take up and look at on see the gothic letter he seem as much astonished as if he have get hold of a book of _ cabbalum _ or _ magic _ he detain the whole work but it be send to I the next day on my declare that there be nothing damnable or heretical in it for there be no person belong to the department who could read german when the _ douanier _ proceed to the examination of the book belong to one of my fellow traveller the neapolitan lady she express great repugnance to the procedure the _ douanier _ however insist and behold there be several _ livre galant _ with plate somewhat _ lubrique _ the discovery of which excited blush on she part and considerable laughter on the part of the byestander these book however not be contraband be immediately return to she as be a edition of baffo belong to my other fellow traveller return to he now this baffo be a venetian poet and he work be the most profligate that ever be pen or imagine by mortal man martial and petronius arbiter must hide they diminish head before baffo the owner of this book choose to read out loud quite unsolicited several _ choice _ sonnet of this poet for we edification during the journey and this branch of litterature seem to be the only one with which he be acquaint when the examination be over i take leave of my fellow traveller and repair to the _ german hôtel _ in the _ via de ' condotti _ where i engage a apartment and sit down to dinner at a excellent _ table d'hôte _ at five o'clock there be a profusion of everything particularly of fish and game mullet and wild boar be constant dish at a roman table the mullet at rome be small but delicious and this be a fish highly prize by the ancient roman game of all kind be very cheap here from the abundance of it that be to be meet with in wild uninhabited waste of latium and in the pontine marsh every peasant be a sportsman and go constantly arm with fire-arm not only to kill game but to defend himself against robber who infest the environs of rome and who sometimes carry they audacity so far as to push they _ reconnaissance _ close to the very wall of the city at the _ german hôtel _ the price of the dinner at _ table d'hôte _ include wine at discretion be six _ paolus _ about three frank i pay for a excellent room about three _ paolus _ per diem and my breakfast at a neighbouring _ caffé _

independent of the benefit i derive from he conversation i be curious to see whether it be true or not that the jew always avoid walk under the arch of titus which be erect in commemoration of the capture of jerusalem by the roman under titus in the reign of vespasian on step out of the _ hôtel allemand _ the first thing that meet my eye be the identical beggar describe by kotzebue in he travels in italy and he give the very same answer now as then to those who give he nothing viz _ pazienza _ we cross the _ piazza di spagna _ ascend the superb flight of step of the _ trinità de ' monti _ where there be a french church call the church of st loui : near it be the _ villa medicus _ which be the seat of the french academy of the fine art at rome we then file along the _ strada felice _ till we arrive at the church of _ santa marium maggiore _ a superb edifice the third church in rome in celebrity and the second in magnificence a immense egyptian obelisk stand before it we then turn a little to the right make the best of we way to the coliseum where we remain nearly two hour i have figure to myself the grandest idea of this stupendous building but the aspect of it far exceed the sketch even of my imagination in egypt i have see the pyramid but even these vast mass do not make such a impression on I as the coliseum have do i be so unequal to the task of description that i shall not attempt it i will give you however its dimension which my friend the jew measure it be a ellipse of which the transverse axis be 580 foot in length and its conjugate diameter 480 but it be not so much the length and breadth as the solidity of this building that strike the traveller with astonishment the arcaded passage or gallery -lrb- on the _ rez de chaussée _ between the interior and the exterior wall -rrb- which have a vaulted roof over which the seat be build be broad enough to admit three carriage abreast : and the wall on each side of this gallery be at least twenty foot thick what a magnificent spectacle it must have be in the time of the ancient roman when it be ornament gilded and full of spectator of which it could contain it be say 86000 the coliseum have be despoil by various pope and cardinal to furnish stone and marble to build they palace otherwise so solid be the building time alone would never suffice to destroy it at present strict order be give and sentry be post to prevent all further dilapidation and buttress have be make to prop up those part which have give way what a pity it be that the arena have not be leave empty instead of be fit up with tawdry niche and image represent the different station of the crucifixion in the center be a immense cross which whoever kiss be entitle to one hundred day indulgence to what reflection the sight of this vast edifice lead what combat of gladiator and wild beast what blood have be spill be it not here that the tyrannical and cowardly domitian order ulpius glabrio of consular dignity to descend into the arena and fight with a lion the christian writer mention that many of they sect suffer martyrdom here by be compel to fight with wild beast but even this be not half so bad as the conduct of the christian when they obtain possession of political power and dominion in burn alive poor jew moor and heretic some century afterwards indeed the cruelty of the pagan be much exaggerate by the above writer and be it even true to its full extent they severity be far more excusable than that of the christian in later time for the effort of the christian sect in the time of paganism be unceasingly direct towards the destruction of the whole fabric of polytheism on which be base the entire social and political order of the empire and they thus bring on themselves perhaps merit persecution by they own intolerance whereas when they get the upper hand they show no mercy to those of a different religion and orthodoxy have wallow successively in the blood of arian jew moor and protestant how many a poor jew or moor in spain and portugal have be burn alive for no other reason than _ pour n'avoir point quitté la foi de leurs ancêtres _ no no no sect or religion be ever so persecute as the catholic christian the polytheist of all time both ancient and modern be tolerant to all religion and so far from strive to make proselyte often adopt the ceremony of other worship in addition to they own witness the egyptian greek and roman of old and the hindoo and chinese of the present day the jew ferocious and prejudiced as they be never persecute other nation on the ground of religion and if they hold these nation in abhorrence as idolater and consider themselves alone as the holy people the people of god -lrb- yahoudus -rrb- they never dream of make convert the mussulman tho ' they hold it as a sacred precept of they religion to endeavor to make convert to islam do not use violent means and only compel those of a different faith to pay a higher tribute at any rate they never have or do put people to death merely for the difference of religious opinion such be the reflection i make on walk about the arena of this colossal edifice so worthy of the _ popolo re _ on leave the coliseum the first thing that meet the eye be the arch of constantine under which the roman triumphal and ovationary procession move towards the capitol the arch of constantine stand just outside the coliseum it be of immense size and extremely well preserve the ground on which it stand be much fill up and only half of the arch appear the rest remain bury in the earth it be judge adviseable to excavate all around it in order to come to the pedestal so that now there be a walled enclosure all around it and into this enclosure it be a descent of at least eighteen foot from the ground outside several statue of captive king and bas-relief represent the victory of constantine adorn the facade of this triumphal arch the inscription be perfect and the letter be formerly fill up with bronze but these have be take out at the repeat sacking that poor rome have undergo from friend and foe at a short distance from the arch of constantine be the arch of titus under which we move along on we road towards the capitol and my friend the jew be too much of a cosmopolite to feel the smallest repugnance at walk under the arch we conversation then turn on the absurd hatred and prejudice that exist between christian and jew he be very liberal on this subject and in speaking of jesus christ he say : jesus christ be a jew and a real philosopher and be therefore persecute for he philosophy interfere too much with and tend to shake the political fabric of the jewish constitution and to subvert we old custom and usage : for this reason he be put to death i seek not to defend or palliate the injustice of the act or the barbarity with which he be treat but we nation do surely no more than any other nation ancient or modern have do or would still do against reformer and innovator the arch of titus be completely deface outside but in the interior of the arch on each side be a bas relief : the one represent vespasian 's triumph over the jew and the emperor himself in a car draw by six horse the other represent the soldier and follower of the triumph bear the spoil of the conquer nation and among they the famous candlestick that adorn the temple of jerusalem be very conspicuous these figure be in tolerable preservation only that the emperor have lose he head and one of the soldier have abscond on issue from the arch of titus we find ourselves in the forum now the _ campo vaccino _ : so that cattle now low where statesman and orator harangue and lazy priest in procession tread on the sacred dust of hero où des prêtres heureux foulent d'un pie tranquille les tombeaux des catons et les cendre d'emile so sing voltaire i believe or if they be not he line they be the abbé delille 's -lrb- 84 -rrb- the imagination be quite bewilder here from the variety of ancient monument that meet the eye in every direction what vast souvenir crowd all at once on the mind look all around the _ via sacra _ the arch of severus and the capitol in front on one side of you the temple of peace that of faustina and that of the sun and moon : on the other the remain three column of the temple of jupiter stator the three also of the temple of jupiter tonan the eight column of the temple of concord and the solitary column of phoca at a short distance the temple of castor and pollux and that of romulus and remus which be a round building of great antiquity whose rusticity form a striking contrast with the elegance of the colonnaded temple and which be evidently build before the conquest of greece by the roman and the consequent introduction of the fine art and of the grecian order of architecture you may wish to know my sensation on traverse this sacred ground the _ via sacra _ recall to I horace meet the _ bavard _ who address he : _ quid agi dulcissime rerum _ -lrb- 85 -rrb- i then think of the sabine rape of brutus ' speech over the body of lucretium then i almost fancy i could see the spot where stand the butcher 's shop from whence virginius snatch the knife to immolate he daughter at the shrine of honor next the shade of regulus flit before my imagination refuse to be exchange then i figure to myself cicero thunder against catiline or the same with delicate irony ridicule the ultra-rigor of the stoic so as to force even the gravity of cato to relax into a smile then the grand the heroic act of marcus brutus in immolate the great caesar at the altar of liberty all these recollection and idea crowd on my imagination without regard to order or chronology and i remain for some time in a state of the most profound reverie from which i be only rouse by my friend the jew remind I that we have a quantity of other thing to see the first object that engage my attention on be rouse from my reverie be the arch of severus at the foot of the capitol which tower above it excavation have be make around this arch -lrb- for otherwise only half of it could be see -rrb- and a stone wall build around the excavate ground in the same manner as at the arch of constantine round several of the column of the temple i have above enumerate excavation have be also make otherwise the lower half of they would remain bury in the earth and give to the monument the appearance of a city which have be half swallow up by a earthquake by dint of digging round the column of phoca the ancient paved road which lead to the capitol have be discover and be now open to view this ancient road be at least thirty foot below the surface of the present road and the ground about it this show how the ground must have be fill up by the destruction of building at the different sacking of rome and the consequent accumulation of rubbish the french when they be here begin these excavation and the duchess of devonshire continue they -lrb- 86 -rrb- it be useful in every way it employ a number of poor people and may be the means of discover some valuable remains of antiquity and object of art at any rate it be highly gratifying to have discover the identical road to the capitol on which so many consul dictator and emperor move in triumph and so many captive king weep in chain we then ascend the step that lead to the modern capitol and mount on the _ campanile _ of the same from whence there be a superb panoramic view of rome on descend from the _ campanile _ we visit the tarpeian rock which be now of inconsiderable height the ground about it and heap of rubbish have fill up the abyss below we then enter the court yard of the capitol the capitol and build annex to it form three side of a rectangle the center or _ corps de logis _ lie north and south and the wing east and west the whole inclosing a court yard open on the south side of the rectangle from whence you descend into the street on the plain below by a most magnificent escalier or flight of step of the capitol the _ corps de logis _ or central building to which the _ campanile _ belong be reserve for the occupation and habitation of the _ senator romano _ a civil magistrate corresponding something to the mayor in france or _ oberbürgermeister _ in the german town and who be choose from among the nobility and nominate by the pope the wing contain the _ museum capitolinum _ of painting and sculpture there be a great deal to call forth the admiration of the traveller in the court yard of the capitol the most prominent object be the famous bronze equestrian statue of marcus aurelius which can not fail to rivet the attention of the least enthusiastic spectator i observe at each angle of the façade of the capitol a colossal statue of a captive king in a phrygian dress but still more striking than these be the colossal statue of castor and pollux lead horse which stand a little in front of the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius and nearer the _ escalier _ the one on the right the other on the left two lion in basalt on each side of the _ escalier _ be very striking object and the _ escalier _ itself be the most superb thing of the kind perhaps in the world this _ escalier _ and the marcus aurelius unique also in its kind be both the workmanship of michael angelo -lrb- 87 -rrb- we descend this _ escalier _ and then front it to take a view of the capitol from the bottom but the statue of marcus aurelius be so prominent and so grand that it absorb all my attention after dinner i walk a little in the garden on the pincian hill and then visit some friend belong to the french academy of painting and sculpture who be so good as to shew I they production and also a copy of the superb folio edition of denon 's work on egypt which to I who have be in that country be highly gratifying oh what a pity that the french could not keep that country what a paradise they would have make of it as it be -lrb- and to they credit be it say -rrb- they do more good for the country during three year only than we have do for we possession in indium for fifty year rome 15th septr the next morning after a early breakfast i repair to the pantheon now call _ santa marium dellum rotonda _ and appropriate to the catholic worship it be easily recognizable by its rotundity and by the simple grandeur of its façade and portico the bronze have be take out of the letter of the inscription this beautiful specimen of ancient architecture be situate in a small _ piazza _ or square call _ piazza della rotonda _ where a market of poultry game and vegetable be hold there be only now three or four step on the _ escalier _ to ascend in order to enter into the portico but as it be know that accord to the description of the pantheon in ancient time there be a immense flight of step to ascend it be a additional proof how much the ground on which modern rome stand have be fill up and consequently it be evident that the greater part of this flight of step remain still bury in the earth if i be so strike with the appearance of this interesting edifice outside how much more so should i have be on see the inside be not the niche where formerly stand the statue of the god fill with tawdry doll represent the virgin mary and _ he _ and _ she _ saint the column and pilaster in the interior of this temple be beautiful all of _ jaune antique _ and one entire stone each how much better would it have be to replace the statue of the _ dii majorum gentium _ which occupy the niche by statue in marble of the apostle instead of the doll dress in tawdry color and the frippery gilding of the altar on which they stand which disfigure this noble building the pantheon be build by agrippa as the inscription shew in the interior be sixteen column of _ jaune antique _ the bronze that formerly ornament this temple be make use of to fabricate the baldachin of st peter 's of late year it have be the fashion to erect monument affix to the wall of the interior of the pantheon to the memory of the great man and hero of poetry painting sculpture and music who be native of italy or for foreigner celebrate for they excellence in those art who have die in rome here be for instance tablet to the memory of metastasio rafael meng sacchini poussin winckelmann the phidia of modern day the illustrious canova have recommend the place in the pantheon of the bust in marble of all the great man who have flourish in italy as the most appropriate ornament to this temple he himself with a princely liberality have make a present to it of the bust of dante petrarca ariosto tasso guarinus alfierus michel angelo rafaello metastasio and various other worthy these bust be all the production either of canova himself or make by he pupil under he direction they be not the least remarkable ornament of the place in the center of the _ piazza della rotonda _ stand a obelisk bring from egypt which belong to a temple sacred to isis in that country i next repair to the _ piazza di navona _ a large and spacious square where there be a superb fountain represent a vast rock with four colossal figure one of which recline at the foot of the rock at each angle of the pedestal that support it and it be surmount by a obelisk which be bring from egypt and be find in the garden of sallust the four colossal figure represent the four river god of the four great river in europe asia africa and america viz the danube the gange the nile and the pla the statue of the nile have he head half-conceal by a cloak emblematical of the source of that river not be discover in the _ piazza _ be frequently hold fair shew of wild beast theatrical exhibition and sometimes combat of wild beast i cross the tiber on my way to st peter 's at the _ ponte di sant ' angelo _ directly on the other side of the river stand the castle of that name a immense edifice formerly the _ mole adriana _ or mausoleum of the emperor adrian it be of a circular form and be a remarkably striking object from here there be a spacious street as broad as portland place which lead to the magnificent _ piazza _ where stand the metropolitan church of the christian world the pride of christendom the triumph of modern architecture flank on each side by a semi-circular colonnaded portico which constitute one of its greatest beauty and distinguish it from all the other temple in the world on the piazza considerably in front of this wonderful edifice and nearly in the center stand a immense egyptian obelisk and at a short distance on each side of the obelisk two magnificent fountain which spout water to a great height and which contribute greatly to the ornament of the _ piazza _ now you must not expect I to give you a description of this glorious temple i never in my life possess descriptive power even for object of no great importance : how then could i attempt to delineate the innumerable beauty of this edifice yet vast as it be the proportion of the façade be so correct that they together with the semi-circular colonnaded portico serve to diminish its apparent size and to render its mass less impose but perhaps more beautiful on this account it appear at first sight of less size than the church of st paul 's in london the beauty of the architecture viz of the façade and of the colonnaded portico would require day to examine and admire what shall i say then of the wonder of the interior crowded and charge as it be with the finest piece of sculpture column of the most beautiful _ verd antique _ and of _ jaune antique _ the masterpiece of painting copy in mosaic the precious stone and marble of all sort that adorn the variety of magnificent chapel and altar the immense baldachin with its twisted column of bronze -lrb- the spoil of the pantheon and of the temple of jerusalem -rrb- the profusion of gilding and ornament of all sort and where in spite of this profusion there seem _ rien de trop _ at first entrance the eye be so dazzle with the magnificent _ tout ensemble _ as to be incapable for a long time of examine any thing in detail each chapel abound in the choicest marble and precious stone : in a word it would seem as if the whole wealth of the earth be concentrate here without impiety or exaggeration i feel on enter this majestic temple for the first time just as i conceive a resuscitate mortal would feel on be usher into the scene of the glory of heaven the masterpiece of painting be here perpetuate in mosaic and so correctly and beautifully do that unless you approach exceedingly close indeed it be impossible to distinguish they from painting what a useful as well as ornamental art be the mosaic there be a great variety of confessional where penitent and pilgrim may confess each in he own tongue for there be a confessional for the use of almost every native tongue and language in the catholic world the cupola what a astonishing sight when you look up at it from below how can i better describe it than by relate the anecdote of michel angelo its constructor who when some one make a remark on the impossibility of make a finer cupola than that of the pantheon burst out into the follow exclamation : do you think so then i will throw it in the air and he fulfil he word for the cupola of st peter 's be exactly of the size of that of the pantheon tho ' at such a elevation as to give it only the appearance of one fourth of its real size or even less the sublimity of the design can only be equal by the boldness and success of its execution till it be do it be think by every artist impossible to be do what a extraordinary genius be this michel angelo ariosto have hot at all exaggerate in he praise when he speak of he in punning on he name : _ michel _ più che mortal _ angel _ divino -lrb- 88 -rrb- michael less man than angel and divine -- trans w rise among the various splendid marble monument with which this temple abound be one erect to the memory of pope rezzonico construct by canova and reckon one of he masterpiece the pope be represent in he canonical behind and above he be a colossal statue of religion with a cross in one hand and ray in form of spike issue from she head i do not like these spike on the dexter side of this monument be a beautiful male youthful figure represent a funereal genius with a inverted torch the signal delicacy beauty and symmetry of this statue form a striking contrast with the figure of a immense lion sleep on the sinister side and this lion be a irrefragable proof that canova excel in the delineation of the terrible as well as the beautiful for it be admirably execute at another monument be a superb female figure of colossal size represent truth it be formerly naked but they have contrived to execute in color marble a vestment to cover she loin and veil she secret beauty the reason of which be that this beautiful statue make such a impression once upon a traveller -lrb- some say he be a englishman other a spaniard -rrb- that it inspire he with a sort of pygmalionic passion which he attempt to gratify one night he be discover in the attempt and since that time to prevent further scandal or attempt of the sort and to conceal from profane eye the charm of the too alluring goddess this color marble vestment be imagine and execute this story be borrow from lucian -lrb- 89 -rrb- there be also here a fine statue of pope gregory xiii and a magnificent bas-relief the subject of which be the reform of the calendar by that pope here too be a monument to christina queen of sweden and a bas-relief represent she abjuration of the lutheran faith but why should i attempt to detail all these monument while it would require folio for the purpose let I rather introduce you to the hero and tutelary saint of this sanctuary st peter a superb bronze statue something above the usual size of man be seat on a curule chair in the nave of the church on the right hand side as you approach the baldachin he hold in he hand the key of heaven he receive the adoration of all the faithful who enter into this temple and this adoration be perform by kiss he foot which from the repeat kissing be become of a bright polish and be visibly wear away the statue be formerly a statue of jupiter capitolinus but on the grand revolution among the inhabitant of olympus and the downfall of jupiter it be break to piece melt down and fabricate into a image of st peter so that this statue have lose little of its former sovereignty and still rule heaven and earth if not with regal with at least vice-regal power tho ' under a different name in the sistine chapel be the celebrated painting al fresco of the day of judgment by michel angelo a aweful subject and nobly and awefully execute in the porch under the façade of st peter 's be two marble statue on horseback one at each end of the porch : they represent constantine the great and charlemagne the two great benefactor of the holy catholic church the one in fact its founder the other its preserver as the palace of the vatican stand close to the church of st peter 's and communicate with it by a _ escalier _ i ascend the _ escalier _ in order to behold and examine the famous museum of the vatican the first in the world and unique for the vast treasure of the fine art that it contain treasure which the unite wealth of all europe and indium to boot could not purchase at they just price here in fact it may be say be preserve the riches and plunder of the whole world which be strip of all its valuable by those illustrious brigand the ancient roman and mark in this point the good fortune of rome instead of lose they again as other nation have lose they trophy superstition come to she aid and cause they to be respect and preserve 'till a enlighten age arise which guide by philosophy humanity and science will for ever preserve they secure against all attack of barbarian in a sanctuary so worthy of they _ museum vaticanum _ -lrb- 90 -rrb- a superb flight of step lead into a hall of immense length fill on each side with statue bust sarcophagus altar urn vase and candelabrum all monument of antiquity and of the most exquisite workmanship the wall on each side of this hall be inlay with tablet bear inscription in greek latin and etruscan one be quite bewildered amongst such a profusion of god semi-gods hero i must single out a few of the most remarkable for they workmanship here be a group represent the sacrifice of mithra on ascend a few step at the other end of this hall in a small octangular room be the statue of meleager the famous torso the tomb of scipio with bas-relief on leave the chamber you come into a octangular gallery issue from which be four circular chamber each chamber contain a masterpiece of art in one be the apollo belvedere in another the laocoon -lrb- both safely arrive from pari -rrb- in the third antinous in the fourth the perseus of canova with medusa 's head and he famous group of the two pugilist description of the three first would be superfluous -- for of they mill altri han detto e con via miglior plettro and even with respect to the perseus of canova i shall content myself with remark that the sculptor have evidently the apollo belvedere in he ideal and if he have not quite equal that celebrated statue it be because it be impossible but he certainly have give the nearest possible approximation to its excellence in another hall and just at its entrance be the statue of menander and posidippus in a sit posture one on either side in this hall be innumerable fine statue but the further end of it front you as you enter be a statue which at once engage and rivet you undivided attention it at once induce you to approach and to take no notice of the statue on the right and left of the hall and how should it be otherwise since it be the identical statue of the father of the god and man the famous jupiter capitolinus which adorn the capitol in ancient rome he be sit on a throne with a sceptre in one hand and the thunderbolt in the other at he foot a eagle it be a glorious statue and in every respect characteristic such grandeur such majesty in the countenance it be impossible not to feel awe and reverence on behold it it be on contemplate this venerable statue that a englishman who be at rome some sixty year ago stand wrapt for a time in silent veneration then suddenly break silence he make a profound obeisance before the statue and exclaim : recollect o father of the god and man that i have pay my hommage to you in you adversity and do not forget I should you ever raise you head above water again in the hall of the muse be the statue of the tuneful nine which be find underground among the ruin of hadrian 's villa at tivolus in the center of a circular chamber of vast dimension be a enormous circular basin of porphyry of forty-one foot in diameter a superb mosaic adorn the floor of the center of this chamber and be inclose appropriate ornament to this immense chamber be the colossal statue of the _ dii majorum gentium _ here be juno minerva cybele jupiter serapi mar cere and other in another hall be two enormous egyptian god in yellow granite two superb sarcophagus in red marble and two immense sphinx in granite in another chamber be a antique car draw by two horse : the near one be modern the off one ancient the wheel of this car be modern both car and horse be of exquisite workmanship several fine statue adorn this chamber among which the most remarkable be a phocion a paris a antinous and a triton carry off a nereid i must not omit to mention that in one of the hall be the famous group of the nile represent by a enormous colossal river god surround by fourteen child play with young crocodile opposite to this group be another equally celebrated viz the colossal statue of the tiber with the she-wolf give suck to romulus and remus by he side the mosaic pavement in this museum surpass in richness any in the world in one of the hall among the work of modern time be two beautiful marble table richly inlay with all sort of stone of value with bas-relief on they the one represent the visit of the emperor joseph ii and the other that of gustavus iii of sweden to rome and they reception by the pope one of the hall of sculpture be appropriate to the figure of animal of all kind from the lion and eagle down to the rat and crawfish in marble of all color and of all size the best execute among they appear to I a group represent a greyhound bitch give suck to she young as for the valuable cameo coin medal and smaller remnant of antiquity in this museum they be innumerable with regard to the painting that belong to this museum there be only a small collection but it be unique here be the transfiguration and some other masterpiece of rafaello in the _ stanze di rafaello _ -lrb- so they be call -rrb- be several large fresco painting viz one represent the battle of maxentius and constantine another the school of athen and socrate sit among the other philosopher a third represent a fire besides other in one of these _ stanze _ be a work in tapestry represent jesus christ burst forth from the sepulchre but he have a visage far too rubicund and want in dignity he look like a person flush with wine issue from a tavern in the countenance there be depict -lrb- so it appear to I -rrb- a vulgar not a dignified triumph the palace of the vatican be of immense size and be say to cover as much ground as the city of turin and i be incline to think that there be not a great deal of exaggeration in this statement for the vista along the corridor and gallery appear to be endless the library of the vatican be of course very extensive and of immense value but the book as well as the manuscript be keep in press which be lock and it be rather awkward to be continually apply to the _ custode _ to take out and put back a book the museum of the vatican be open twice a week to the public viz thursday and sunday but foreigner on shew they passport may obtain admission at any time rome 17th sept my next visit be to the capitol in order to inspect the _ museum capitolinum _ this time i ascend the magnificent _ escalier _ of michel angelo have the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius in front on arrive at the courtyard i enter the building on my left -lrb- which be on the right of the façade -rrb- under the colonnaded portico of this wing be the statue of caesar and augustus here too be the naval column of the consul duilius in commemoration of the first naval victory gain over the carthaginian also a colossal statue of the rhine call marforio in one of the hall two large statue of the egyptian goddess isis and various other egyptian divinity in this museum among other thing be a altar represent claudium draw to the land the ship of cybele a magnificent sarcophagus with a bas relief on its side represent the progress of life amalthea give suck to jupiter the god anubi find among the ruin of adrian 's palace at tivolus on ascend the staircase i observe on the right hand fix in the wall a tablet with a plan of ancient rome carve on it in one of the hall above stair the most remarkable statue be that of the die gladiator -lrb- bring back from pari -rrb- this be certainly a noble piece of sculpture the bodily pain and mental anguish be singularly well express in the countenance a superb bronze statue of hercule a centaur in black marble a faun in _ rosso antico _ a group of cupid and psyche a venus in parian marble rather larger than the common size one of the hall in this museum contain the bust of all the philosopher another those of all the roman emperor there be also a colossal statue of pyrrhus a superb agrippina and the celebrated mosaic of the four pigeon in enumerate the above i have only to observe that they only constitute a thousandth part of what be to be see here after pass three hour in this wing of the building i go over across the courtyard to the other wing under the portico of this wing the follow be the most remarkable among the statue : a roman _ triumphan _ two phrygian king in black marble in one of the room above stair be a very remarkable piece of antiquity viz the bronze wolf give suck to romulus and remus which be find in the temple of romulus and which be strike by lightning during the consulate of julius : the mark make by the lightning be quite distinct there be in this wing a small but excellent collection of painting and a great variety of statue bust sarcophagus candelabrum and antiquity of all sort the front part or _ corps de logis _ of the capitol be call _ il palazzo del senato conservatore _ and be the residence of the _ senator romano _ who be choose by the pope by the bye i understand this dignity be generally give to a foreigner the pontiff be rather jealous of the roman nobility this wing of the capitol employ I two hour but i must visit this museum as well as that of the vatican often again for it would require month and year to examine they duly rome 18th sept on this side of the river which be call _ transtevere _ i have a opportunity of observe the inhabitant who be call _ transteverinus _ the most of whom pretend to be the descendant of the ancient roman unmixed with any foreign blood they certainly have very much of that physiognomy that be attribute to the ancient roman for they be a tall very robust race of man have something of a ferocious dignity in they countenance which however be full of expression and the aquiline nose be a prominent feature among they they be exceedingly jealous of they woman whom they keep within door as much as they can and if a stranger on pass by they door should chance to observe they wife or daughter who may be stand there and should stop to admire they -lrb- for many of they have a air of antique beauty and majesty of countenance which be remarkably striking -rrb- they will instantly order the female to retire with a air of asperity whether they really be the pure descendant of the ancient roman be difficult to say : but it be by no means improbable since even to this day they intermarry solely with one another and refuse to give they daughter in marriage to foreigner or to those of mixed blood instance have be know of these family who be for the most part very poor refuse the most advantageous offer of marriage make to they daughter by rich foreign merchant and artist on the ground merely that the suitor be not _ romanus _ but _ barbarus _ as for the _ bourgeoisie _ of rome in general they _ have be _ for some century back and _ be _ a very mixed race compose of all the nation of europe most of the foreign artist who come here to study the fine art viz belgian dutch german french english swede danes pole and russian as well as those from other part of italy strike with the beauty of the woman and pleased with the tranquility and agreeable society that prevail in this metropolis and the total freedom from all _ gêne _ and etiquette marry roman woman and fix here for life : so that among this class you meet with more foreign name than roman and it be this sort of colonisation which keep up the population of rome which would otherwise greatly decrease as well from the celibacy of the number that become priest as from the malaria that prevail in and about the city in July and August rome 19th sept i have be employ for the last two day in visit some of the church _ palazzo _ and villa of modern rome but the number be so prodigious and there be such a variety of thing to be see in each that i shall only make mention of a few indeed there be many that i have not see and probably shall not have time to see as sacred thing should precede profane let we begin with the church the first that claim the attention of the traveller after st peter 's be the church of st john lateran which be the oldest church in christendom and be the metropolitan of rome and of the christian world before the building of st peter 's it lie very nearly in a right line with the _ piazza di spagna _ and on a prolonged line form a obtuse angle with the church of santa marium maggiore which as i first visit i shall first describe and afterwards resume what i have to remark on the subject of st john lateran santa marium maggiore be the third church in importance but the second in magnificence in rome before its façade stand a single column of granite of the corinthian order the façade of this church be beautiful but it would be far better without the _ campanile _ which i think always disfigure a church of grecian architecture besides it be not in the center of the build the church be richly adorn with mosaic and its several chapel be admirable from the execution of they architecture and sculpture and the value of the different rich marble and precious stone with which the monument therein be make and incrust among these chapel be those of sixtus v paul v the grand altar be of porphyry but the most striking beauty of this church and which eclipse all its other ornament be the forty column of beautiful grecian marble on each side of the nave the ceiling too be superb and richly gilt the gilding must have cost a immense sum and be do it be say with the first gold that be bring from america nothing can be more rich than this plafond the above forty column belong formerly to the temple of juno lucina it be singular that the ceremony of the _ accouchement _ of the virgin and the birth of christ should be perform here on the 24th December this pantomime be regularly act and crowd of all sort of people attend particularly woman at the moment that the virgin be suppose to be deliver a salve of artillery announce the good tiding this be singular i say when one recollect the peculiar attribute of juno lucina and the assistance she be suppose to give to person in the same situation you can not expect I to detail to you all the riches in precious stone and gift of pious prince that adorn the several chapel of this and other church but they appear to contain every stone and jewel mention in the arabian night as be to be find in the cave where aladdin be leave by the magician and it must be allow that the pope have be remarkably adroit inchanter in conjure to rome all the riches of the earth the church of st john lateran be larger and more striking as to its exterior and as to its architecture than that of santa marium maggiore but it be not so charge with ornament and there be scarce any gilding there be a simple elegance about it that i think far more please than the magnificence of santa marium st john lateran contain several beautiful piece of sculpture in white marble rather larger than the usual size of man of the twelve apostle six on one side of the nave and six on the other and above they be bas-relief also in marble represent the various scene from the history of the old and new testament these twelve statue be admirably well execute and they give to this temple a air of simple grandeur in this church be very few painting on mosaic but little gilding and no superfluous ornament sculpture be in my opinion far more appropriate to a place of worship than painting or dazzling ornament another very striking beauty of this noble and venerable temple be the column it contain some of which be in granite and other of the most beautiful _ verd-antique _ there be besides two superb corinthian column of bronze which adorn one of the altar among the chapel of this cathedral be one belong to the corsinus family which be probably the richest in europe and contain more precious stone and marble than any other yet as this and the other chapel be in recess and separate from the aisle of the church by large bronze gate you can not see they contents till you enter the say chapel and thus you attention be not divert by they from the contemplation of the simple grandeur of the column and statue which adorn the body of the temple the bronze column above mention be take from the temple of jupiter capitolinus on one side in front of the church of st john lateran stand a immense egyptian obelisk 115 foot in height bring from egypt to rome in the time of constantine i think the placing of these obelisk in front of the façade of the most remarkable edifice be a excellent arrangement as they be never-failing landmark to distinguish from afar off the edifice to which they belong this obelisk be find in the _ circus maximus _ from which it be remove and place on this spot by sixtus v a large orphan establishment be close to this church and close to it also the _ battisterio _ of constantine which rest on forty-eight column of porphyry say to be the finest in europe another church in the vicinity contain _ la scala santa _ or holy staircase of marble which accord to the tradition adorn pontius pilate 's palace at jerusalem and on which identical staircase jesus christ ascend to be interrogate by pilate the tradition further say that it be transport to rome by angel this staircase have twenty-eight step and no one be allow to mount it except on he knee nobody ever descend it but there be two other _ escalier _ parallel to it one on the right hand the other on the leave by which you descend in the usual manner not be aware of this ceremony i on enter the edifice begin to ascend the _ escalier _ which be nearest to I which prove to be the _ scalum santa _ for no sooner have i begin to ascend it as i would any other flight of step than two or three voice scream out : _ signora o signora a ginocchium o ' è la scala santa _ i ask what be mean and be then tell the whole story and that it be necessary to mount this staircase on one 's knee or not at all this i do not think worth the trouble be quite contented with behold it the marble of this staircase be much worn by the number of devout people who ascend it in this manner and this ceremony aid by a _ quantum suff _ of faith be no doubt of great efficacy the fourth church in estimation and i believe the next ancient in rome to st john lateran be the church of _ san paolo fuor della mura _ so call from its be situate outside the gate of the city it be of immense size but out of repair and neglect the most striking object of its architectural contents be the 120 column of parian marble which support its nave _ st pietro in vincoli _ be chiefly remarkable for its be build near the dungeon where accord to the tradition st peter be confine and from whence he be release by angel its chief ornament be the colossal statue of mose somewhere close to this place be shewn the ruin of the mamertine prison where jugurtha be incarcerate and die there be in rome about three hundred other church all of which can boast of very interesting and valuable contents one in particular call the portuguese church be uncommonly beautiful tho ' small another that of st ignazio or the jesuit ' church be vast and impose and very fine singing be occasionally to be hear there rome 21st sept the palace occupy by the pope be that of the quirinal standing on the quirinal hill which be commonly call _ monte cavallo _ from the statue of the two _ hippodamous _ or tamer of horse think to be mean for castor and pollux which stand on this hill this group be surmount by a egyptian obelisk these statue be say to be the work of phidia but there be a terrible disproportion between the man and the horse they be lead they give you the idea of brobdignagian lead shetland pony the quirinal palace be every way magnificent and worthy of the sovereign pontiff there be large grounds annex to it it stand nearly in the center of rome and from this palace be date the papal edict the pope reside here during the whole year with the exception of three or four month in the hot season when he repair to castel gandolfo near la riccium of the fountain the grandest and most striking be that of trevus which lie at the foot of quirinal hill here be a magnificent group in marble of neptune in he car in the shape of a mussel-shell draw by sea-horse and surround by nymph and triton a immense basin of white marble as large as a moderate size pond receive the water which gush from the nostril of the sea-horse and from the mouth of the triton there be a very good and just remark make on the subject of this group by stolberg viz the attention of neptune seem too much direct towards one of he horse a piece of minutiae more worthy of a charioteer endeavor to turn a difficult corner than of the god who at a word could control the wind and tranquillize the ocean the fountain termina so call from its vicinity to the therme of diocletian be the next remarkable fountain here be a colossal statue of mose strike the rock and cause the water to gush forth the grandeur and majesty of this statue would be more striking but for the incongruity of the arcade on each side of the rock and the two lion in black basalt who spout water mose and the rock would have be sufficient simplicity be in my opinion the soul of architecture and where be there in all history a subject more peculiarly adapt to a fountain than this part of the history of mose the fountain paolina be a fountain that spring from under a beautiful arcade but there be no statue nor bas-relief it be a plain neat fountain and the water be esteem the best in rome this fountain be situate on the janicule hill from which you have perhaps the best view of rome as it re-unite more than any other position at one _ coup d'oeil _ both the modern and débris of the ancient city without the view of the one interfere with or be intercept by the other from here you can distinguish rum of triumphal arch break column aqueduct etc as far as the eye can reach it demonstrate what a immense extent of ground ancient rome must have cover near the fountain be the church where st peter be say to have suffer martyrdom with he head downward the column of trajan be near the fountain trevus and it stand in a inclosure the pavement of which be seven foot lower than the _ piazza _ on which it stand the inclosure be walled round have not this excavation be make one third of the column -lrb- lower part -rrb- would not be see the _ piazza _ on which this column stand be call _ il foro trajano _ the column represent trajan 's triumph over the dacus quadus and marcomannus and be the model from whence napoleon 's column of the grand army in the _ place vendôme _ at paris be take a statue of st peter stand on this column the column of antoninus stand on the _ piazza colonna _ on it be sculpture the victory gain by that emperor round this column it have not be necessary to make excavation on this column stand the statue of st paul amongst the immense variety of edifice and ruin of edifice which most interest the antiquarian be the therme of diocletian here be four different semi-circular hall two of which be destine for philosopher one for poet and one for orator bath a building for tennis or racket three open court one for the exercise of the discus one for athlete and one for hurl the javelin of this vast building part be now a manufactory and the hall of the wrestler be a carthusian church i have now i believe visit most if not all that be to be see in rome i have visit the pyramid of cestius the tomb of metellum i have consult the nymph egerium smell at the _ cloaca maximum _ in fine i have give in to all the _ singery _ of _ pedantry _ and _ virtù _ with as much ardor as martinus scriblerus himself would have do but it yet remain for I to speak of the most interesting exhibition that modern rome can boast and of the most interesting person in it and in all italy and that be the atelier of canova and canova himself the greatest sculptor perhaps either of ancient or modern time except the mighty unknown who conceive and execute the apollo of the vatican in the atelier of canova the most remarkable statue i observe be : a group of hector and ajax of colossal size not quite finish a centaur also colossal a hebe two ballerine or dancing girl one of which rivet my attention most particularly she be recline against a tree with she cheek _ appuyéd _ on one hand one of she foot be uplift and lay along the other leg as if she be repose from a dance the extreme beauty of the leg and foot the pulpiness of the arm the expressive sweetness of the face and the resemblance of the marble to wax in point of mellowness give to this beautiful statue the appearance of a living female _ brunette _ it be a long time before i could withdraw my eye from that lovely statue the next object that engage my attention be a group represent a nymph recline on a couch _ semi-supine _ and a cupid at she foot the luxurious contour of the form of this nymph be beyond expression and remind I of the description of olympium : le partus che solea coprir la stola fur di tanta eccellenza ch ` anteporse a quante n'avea il mondo potean forse -lrb- 91 -rrb- part which be wont to be conceal by gown be such as haply should be place before whate'er this ample world contain in store -- trans w rise this group be destine for the prince regent of england another beautiful group represent the three grace this be intend for the duke of bedford be it give to I to chuse for myself among all the statue in the atelier of canova i should chuse these three viz the ballerina the nymph recline and this group of the grace canova certainly be inimitable in depict feminine beauty grace and delicacy among the other statue in this atelier the most prominent be : a statue of the princess leopoldina esterhazy in the attitude of draw on a tablet with this inscription : _ anch ` io voglio tentar l'arte del bello _ this lady be it seem a great proficient in painting here too be the mould of the different statue make by canova the statue themselves have be finish long ago and dispose of viz of the empress marium louisa of france of the mother of napoleon -lrb- _ madame mère _ as she be always call -rrb- in the costume and attitude of agrippina of a colossal statue of napoleon -lrb- the statue itself be i believe in the possession of wellington -lrb- 92 -rrb- -rrb- here too be the bust of canova by canova himself besides a great variety of bas-relief and bust of individual model of monument etc and now my friend i have give you a _ précis _ not of all that i have see but of what have most interested I and make on my mind impression that can never be efface i trust entirely to my memory for i make no note on the spot many of the thing i have see too much in a hurry to form accurate idea and judgment thereon most of what we see here be shewn to we like the figure in a _ lanterna magica _ for in the various _ palazzo _ and villa the servant who exhibit they hurry you from room to room impatient to receive you fee and to get rid of you i be about to depart for naple on my return to rome i shall not think of revisit the greater number of the _ palazzo _ villa and church but there be some thing i shall very frequently revisit and these be the two museum of the vatican and of the capitol st peter 's the coliseum and antiquity in its neighborhood the pantheon and last but not least the atelier of the incomparable canova you may perhaps be unwilling to let I depart from rome without some information as to theatricals with regard to these rome must hang down she head for the pettiest town in all the rest of italy or france be better provide with this sort of amusement than rome there be a theater call _ teatro della valle _ where there be a very indifferent set of actor and this be the only theater which be open throughout the year comedy only and farce be give the theater alibertus and argentino be open during the carnaval only opera be give at the argentino and masquerade at the alibertus but in fact the lover of opera and of the drama must not come to rome for gratification it be not consider conformable to the dignity and sanctity of a ecclesiastical government to patronize they and it be not the custom or etiquette for the pope cardinal or higher clergy ever to visit they the consequence be that no performer of any consideration or talent be engage to sing at rome except one or two by chance at the time of the carnaval in amends for this you have a good deal of music at the house of individual who hold _ conversazioni _ or assembly in which society would flag very much but for the music which prevent many a yawn and which be useful and indispensable in italy to make the evening pass as card be in england i intend to stop several day here on my return from naple for which place i shall start the day after to-morrow have engage a place in a _ vettura _ for two and half _ loui d'or _ and to be _ spesato _ i be not to be deter from my journey by the many story of robbery and assassination which be say to occur so frequently on that road by the bye talking of robbery and murder a man be execute the day before yesterday on the _ piazza del popolo _ for a triple murder i see the guillotine which be now the usual mode of punishment fix on the center of the _ piazza _ and the criminal escort there by a body of troops but i do not stop to witness the decapitation have no taste for that sort of _ pleasure _ this man richly deserve he punishment -lrb- 84 -rrb- these line

captain in the austrian service a large body of austrian troops be still at naple we issue from rome by the _ porta latina _ and reach albano -lrb- the ancient alba -rrb- sixteen mile distant at twelve o'clock we repose there two hour which give I a opportunity of visit the _ villa dorium _ where there be magnificent garden these garden form the promenade of the family who come to albano to pass the heat of the summer and to avoid the effect of the exhalation of the marshy country about rome as albano be situate on a eminence you have a fine view of the whole plain of latium and rome in perspective the country of latium however be flat dreary and monotonous it afford pasture to a immense quantity of black cattle such as buffalo etc just outside of albano on the route to naple be a curious ancient monument call _ il sepolcro deglus orazj e curiazj _ it be build of brick be extremely solid of singular appearance from its be a square monument flank at each angle by a tower in the shape of a cone it be of a uncouth rustic appearance and must certainly have be build before _ grecium capium ferum victorem cepit et artes intulit agresti latio _ -lrb- 93 -rrb- and i see no reason against its be the sepulchre of the horatius and curiatius particularly as it stand so near alba where the battle be fight but be this as it may there be nothing like faith in matter of antiquity the sceptic can have little pleasure the country on leave albano become diversified woody and picturesque near gensano be the beautiful lake of nemus and it be the spot feign by the poet as the scene of the amours of mar and rhea silvium near gensano also be the country residence of the sovereign pontiff call castel gandolfo la riccia the next place we pass thro ' be the ancient aricium mention in horace 's journey to brundusium we arrive in the evening at velletrus velletrus be a large town or rather city situate on a mountain to which you ascend by a wind road skirt a beautiful forest from the terrace of one of the _ palazzo _ here you have a superb view of all the plain below as far as the rock of circe comprehend the pontine marsh there be several very fine building at velletrus and

near it be a wretched inn where however you be always sure to find plenty of game to eat here begin the pontine marsh and the famous appian road which run in a right line for twenty-five mile across the marsh it be repair and perfectly reconstruct by pius vi and from he it bear its present appellation of _ linea pium _ this convent and church be also construct by pius vi with a view to facilitate the drain and cultivate of the marsh by afford shelter to the workman the _ linea pium _ be a very fine _ chaussée _ considerably raise above the level of the marsh well pave line with tree and a canal sink on one side to carry off the water the pontine marsh extend all the way from torre tre pontus to terracina on the left hand side on travel from rome to naple you have two mile or thereabout of plain bound by lofty mountain on the right a vast marshy plain bound by the sea at a distance of seven or eight mile nothing can be more monotonous than this strait road twenty-five mile in length and the same landscape the whole way the air be extremely damp aguish and unhealthy those who travel late in the evening or early in the morning be recommend not to let down the glass of the carriage in order to avoid inhale the pestilential miasma from the marsh which even the canal have not be able to drain sufficiently no one can find amusement in this desolate region but the sportsman and he may live in continual enjoyment and slay wild duck and snipe in abundance a number of buffalo be to be see grazing on the marsh they be not to be meet with to the north of rome they resemble entirely the buffalo of egypt and indium be black and they be very terrific look animal to the northern traveller who behold they here for the first time these marsh supply rome abundantly with waterfowl and other game of all kind every _ vetturino _ who be return to rome on pass by buy a quantity for a mere trifle from the peasantry who employ themselves much _ à la chasse _ and he be certain to sell they again at rome for three or four time the price he pay and even then it appear marvellous cheap to a englishman accustom as he be to pay a high price for game in he own country we arrive a little before six at terracina which be on the bank of the mediterranean and may be distinguish at a great distance by its white building the chain of mountain on the left of we road hither form a sort of arch to the chord of the _ linea pium _ and terminate one end of the arch by meet the _ linea pium _ at terracina which form what the sailor call a bluff point terracina stand on the situation of the ancient anxur and the description of it by horace in he brundusian journey impositum saxi late candentibus anxur -lrb- 94 -rrb- be perfectly applicable even now it be a handsome look city and be the last town in the pope 's territory : part of it be situate on the mountain and part on the plain at its foot close to the sea the fine white building on the height the temple of jupiter anxurus -lrb- of which the façade and many column remain entire -rrb- tower above they the orange tree and the sea afford a view doubly please and grateful to the traveller after the dreary landscape of the pontine marsh there be but one inn at terracina but that be a very large one there be however but very indifferent fare and bad attendance the innkeeper be a sad over-reaching rascal who fleece in the most unmerciful manner the traveller who be not _ spesato _ he be oblige to furnish those who be _ spesatus _ with supper and lodging at the _ vetturino 's _ price but he always grumble at it give the worst supper he can and bestow it as if he be give alms as the road between terracina and fondus -lrb- the first neapolitan town -rrb- be say to be at time infested by robber few traveller care to

same evening have pass the river garigliano and volturno and leave the falernian hill on we leave during part of the road the landscape be very vary on this route sometimes mountainous sometimes thro ' a rich plain in full cultivation capua be a fortified town situate in a flat country and marshy withal it be a gloomy dirty look city and whatever may have be its splendor and allurement in ancient time it at present offer nothing invite or remarkable the lower class of the people of this town be such thief that we _ vetturino _ recommend we to remove every thing from the carriage into we bed room so that we have the trouble of repack every thing next morning capua be the only place on the whole route where it be necessary to take the trunk from the carriage from capua to naple be twenty mile a little beyond capua be the remains of a large amphitheatre and this be all that exist to attest the splendor of ancient capua the road between capua and naple present on each side one of the richest and most fruitful country i ever behold it be a perfect garden the whole way the _ chaussée _ be line with fruit tree halfway be the town or _ borgo _ of aversa which be large well-built opulent and populous we enter naple at one o'clock drive thro ' the _ strada di toledo _ and from thence to the _ largo di medina _ where we put up at the inn call the _ aquilum nera _ a cordon of austrian troops line the whole high road from fondus to the gate of naple and there be double sentry at a distance of one mile from each other the whole way naple octr 5th in naple the square or _

papyrus find in pompeius and herculaneum and the method of unroll they the work to unroll which they be now employ at this museum be a greek treatise on philosophy by epicurus it be a most delicate operation to unroll these leaf and with the utmost possible care it be impossible to avoid efface many of the letter and even sentence in the act of unroll it must require also considerable learning and skill in the greek language combine with a good deal of practice to supply the deficiency of the word efface when these manuscript be put in print the letter that remain on the papyrus be put in black type and the word guess at be supply in red so that you see at one glance what letter have be preserve and what be supply to replace those efface by the operation of unrolling and in this manner be all the papyrus manuscript ' print _ visit to pompeius and ascent of vesuvius _ _ 11th oct _ we return mr r -- d -- and i from we visit to vesuvius half dead with fatigue from have have little or no rest the whole night about three o'clock to naple we leave naple in a _ calèche _ yesterday after breakfast and drive to portici portici resina and torre del greco be beautiful little town on the sea-shore of the bay of naple or rather they may be term a continuation of the city as they be close together in succession and the interval fill up with villa the distance from the gate of naple to porticus be three mile the road run through the court yard of the royal palace at porticus which have a large archway at its entrance and sortie we proceed to resina and alight in order to descend under ground to herculaneum resina be build on the spot where herculaneum stand there be always guide on this road on the look out for traveller one address we and conduct we to a house where we alight and enter we guide then prepare a flambeau and have unlock and lift up a trap door invite we to descend a wind _ rampe _ under ground lead to herculaneum we discover a large theater with its proscenium seat corridor vomitory etc and we be enable have two light torch with we to read the inscription some statue that be find here have be remove to the museum at porticus this be the only part of herculaneum that have be excavate for if any further excavation be attempt the whole town of resina which be build over it would fall in herculaneum no doubt contain many thing of value but it would be rather too desperate a stake to expose the town of resina to certain ruin for the sake of what _ might _ be find at pompeius the case be very different there be nothing build over its site after have satisfy we curiosity here we regain the light of heaven in resina and proceed to pompeii which be seven mile further the total distance from naple to pompeii be ten mile the part of pompeius already discover look like a town with the house unroofed situate in a deep gravel or sand pit the depth of which be considerably greater than the height of the building stand in it you descend into it from the brink which be on a level with the rest of the country pompeius be consequently expose to the open air and you have neither to go under ground nor to use _ flambeau _ as at herculaneum but simply to descend as into a pit there be always a guard station at pompeius to protect the place from delapidation and theft of antiquarian from its resemble as i have already say a town in the center of a deep gravel pit you come upon it abruptly and on look down you be surprize to see a city newly bring to day the street and house here remain entire the roof of the house except which fall in by the effect of the excavation so that you here behold a roman city nearly in the exact state it be hi when it be bury under the ash of vesuvius during its first eruption in the year 79 of the christian era it do not appear to I that the catastrophe of pompeius could have be occasion by a earthquake for if so the street and house would not be find upright and entire : it appear rather to have be cause by the shower of ash and _ écroulement _ of the mountain which cover it up and bury it for ever from the sight of day the first place we guide take we to see be a superb amphitheatre about half as large as the coliseum : the arena and seat be perfect and all the interior be perfectly clear out : so be the den where the wild beast be keep so that you look down into this amphitheatre as into a vast basin standing on its brink which be on a level with the rest of the ground around it and by means of the seat and passage you may descend into the _ arena _ this amphitheatre be at a short distance from the rest of the town what be at present discover of this city consist of a long street with several off-set of street issue from it : a temple two theater a praetorium a large barrack and a peculiarly large house or villa belong probably to some eminent person but no doubt when the excavation shall be recommence many more street will be discover as from the circumstance of there be a amphitheatre two other theater and a number of sepulchral monument outside the gate it must have be a city of great consequence most of the house seem to have have two story the roof fall in of course by the act of excavation but the column remain entire i observe that the general style of building in pompeius in most of the house be as follow : that in each building there be a court yard in the center something like the court yard of a convent which be sometimes pave in mosaic and generally surround by column in the middle of this court be a fountain or basin : the court have no roof and the wing of the house form a quadrangle environ it the window and door of the room be make in the interior side of the quadrangle look into the court yard on the exterior there appear to be only a small latticed window near the top of the room to admit light i have see in egypt and in indium similarly build house and it be the general style of building in andalusium and barbary in the room be niche in the wall for lamp precisely in the style of the moorish building in indium in many of the chamber of the house at pompeius be painting _ al fresco _ and arabesque on the wall which on be wash with water appear perfectly fresh the subject of these painting be generally from the mythology in some of the room be painting _ al fresco _ of fish flesh fowl and fruit in other venus and the grace at they toilette from which we may infer that the former be dine room and the latter boudoir a large villa -lrb- so i deem it as it stand without the gate -rrb- have a number of room two story entire and three court yard with fountain many beautiful fresco painting on the wall of the chamber annex to this villa be a garden arrange in terrace and a fish pond a covered gallery support by pillar on one of the side of the garden serve probably as a promenade in wet weather in the cellar of this villa be a number of _ amphora _ with narrow neck have the ancient use cork instead of oil to stop they _ amphora _ wine eighteen hundred year old might have be find here it be not the custom even of the modern italian to use cork for the wine they keep for they own use : a spoonful of oil be pour on the top of the wine in the flask and when they mean to drink it they extract the oil by means of a lump of cotton fasten to a stick or long pin which enter the neck of the flask and absorb and extract the oil among the building discover in pompeius be a large temple of isis here you behold the altar and the pillar to which the beast of sacrifice be fasten in this temple at the time of the first excavation be find all the instrument of sacrifice and other thing appertain to the worship of that goddess these and other valuable such as statue coin utensil of all sort be remove to portici where they be now to be see in the museum of that place the _ praetorium _ at pompeius be the next remarkable thing it be a vast enclosure : a great number of column be stand upright here and the most of they entire the step form the ascent to the elevated seat where the praetor usually sit remain entire there be a large building and court yard near one of the gate of the city suppose to have be a barrack for soldier three skeleton be find here with they leg in a machine similar to we stock the scribble and caricature on the wall of this barrack be perfectly visible and legible when one wander thro ' the street of this singularly interesting city one be tempt to think that the inhabitant have just walk out what a dreadful linger death must have befall these inhabitant who could not escape from pompeius at the time of the eruption of vesuvius which cover it with ash the air could only be exhaust by degree so that a prolonged suffocation or a death by hunger must have be they lot four skeleton be find upright in the street have in they hand box contain jewellery and thing of value as if in the act of endeavor to make they escape : these must soon have perish but the skeleton of a woman find in one of the room of the house close to a bath shew that she death must have be one of prolonged suffer what a fine subject pompeius would furnish for the pen of a byron as i have before remark all the valuable and utensil of all sort find here have be remove to portici it be a great pity that everything could not be leave in pompeius in the exact situation in which it be find on its first discovery at the excavation what a light it would have throw -lrb- which no description can give -rrb- on the melancholy catastrophe as well as on the private life and manners of the ancient but if they have be leave here they would even tho ' a guard of soldier be station here to protect they have be by degree all steal there be some magnificent tomb just outside the gate which must have be no small ornament to the city we return to resina to dinner at six o'clock we have make a arrangement with one of the guide of vesuvius call salvatore that he should be ready for we at resina at seven o'clock with a mule and driver for each of we to ascend the mountain and we find he very punctual at the door of the inn at that hour the term of the journey be as follow one _ scudo _ for salvatore and one _ scudo _ for each mule and driver for which they be to forward we to the mountain remain the whole night and reconduct we to resina the follow morning the object in ascend at night and remain until morning be to combine the night view of the eruption with the visit -lrb- if possible -rrb- to the crater which can not with safety be undertake by night and to enjoy likewise the noble view at sunrise of the whole bay and city of naple and the adjacent island we start therefore at a quarter past seven and arrive at half past nine at a small house and chapel call the hermitage of vesuvius which be generally consider as half-way up the mountain in this house dwell a old ecclesiastic who receive traveller and furnish they with a couch and frugal repast we dismount here and we worthy host provide we with some mortadellum and a omelette and we do not fail to do justice to he excellent _ lacrima christus _ of which he have always a large provision we then betake ourselves to rest leave order to be awaken at two o'clock in order to proceed further up the mountain there be a pretty decent eruption of the mountain which vomit fire stone and ash at a interval of twenty-five minute so that we enjoy this spectacle during we ascent a violent noise like thunder accompany each eruption which increase the awefulness and grandeur of the sight at two o'clock we guide and muleteer be very punctual we bid adieu to the hermit promising he to come to breakfast with he the next morning we then mount we mule and after a hour 's march arrive at the spot where the ash and cinder combine with the steepness of the mountain prevent the possibility of go any further except on foot we dismount therefore at this place and send back we mule to the hermitage to wait for we there we now begin to climb among the ash and tho ' the ascent to the position of the ancient crater be not more than probably eighty yard in height we be at least one hour before we reach it from its excessive steepness and from glide back two foot out of three at every step we make we at length reach the old crater and sit ourselves down to repose till day-break tho ' it be exceed cold the exhalation from the vein of fire and hot ash keep we as warm as we could wish : for here every step be literally _ per igne supposito cineri doloso _ -lrb- 97 -rrb- we remain on this spot till broad daylight and witness several eruption at a interval of twenty or twenty-five minute i remark that the mountain toward the summit form two cone one of which vomit fire and smoke and the other calcined stone and ash accompany by a rumble noise like thunder the stone come clatter down the flank of the mountain and some of they roll very near we have we be within the radius form by the erupt stone we probably should have be kill at daylight mr r -- d -- propose to ascend the two cone in spite of the remonstrance of we guide salvatore who tell we that no person have yet be there and that we must expect to be crush to death by the stone should a eruption take place and that it be almost as much madness to attempt it as it would be to walk before a battery of cannon in the act of be fire tho ' i do not admit all the force of this comparison yet i begin to think there be a little too much risk in the attempt my french friend however be deaf to all remonstrance and say to I _ as-tu peur _ i reply : no that i be at all time very indifferent as to life or death but that i do not like pain and be not at all desirous to have a arm or leg break the former accident have happen to a german a few day before nevertheless i add if you persist in go i will accompany you we accordingly start to ascend the cone which vomit fire and smoke take care to place ourselves on the windward side in ascend and after much fatigue we arrive in about fifteen minute close to the apex of the cone after grope amidst the ash and stumble on a vein of red hot cinder my shoe be sadly burnt my stocking singe and my foot scorch my friend be less fortunate for he tumble down with he hand on a vein of red hot cinder and burn they terribly my great and principal apprehension in make this ascent be of stumble upon hole slightly encrust with ash and that the whole might give way and precipitate I into some _ gouffre _ on arrival at the summit of the cone we have just time to look down and perceive that there be a hole or _ gouffre _ but whether it be very deep or not we could not ascertain for a blast of fire and smoke issue from it at this moment nearly suffocate we we immediately lose no time in glide down the ash on the side of the cone on we breech and reach its base in a few seconds where we wait till a eruption take place from the other cone in order to profit of the interval to ascend it also it require four minute ' walk to reach the base of the other cone and about twelve to ascend to its apex on arrival at the brink where we remain about two minute we have just sufficient time to observe that there be no deep hole or bottomless _ gouffre _ as we expect but that it form a crater with a sort of slant and not exceed thirty foot in depth to the bottom which look exactly like a lime-kiln being of a dirty white appearance and in continual agitation as it be of limestone boil so that a person descend to the bottom of this crater would probably be scorch to death or suffocate in a few minute but would infallibly be eject and throw into the air at the first eruption i mean by this that he would not disappear or fall into a bottomless pit -lrb- as i should have suppose before i view the crater -rrb- but that he friend would be sure of find he body either yet live or dead outside the brink of the crater within the radius make by the erupt stone and ash we guide now beg we for god 's sake to descend as a eruption might be expect every minute we accordingly glide down the exterior surface of the cone among the ash on we breech for it be impossible to descend in any other way and in a few seconds we reach its base find ourselves on a little level ground we begin to run or rather wade thro ' the ash in order to get out of reach of the eruption but we have not go thirty yard when one take place the stone clatter down with a frightful noise and we receive a shower of ash on we head the dust of which get into we eye and nearly blind we on reach the brink of the old crater we stop half a hour to enjoy the fine view of parthenope in all she glory at sunrise we then descend rapidly sometimes plunge down the ash on we foot and sometimes glide on we breech till we arrive at the place where we have descend from we mule and this distance which require one hour to ascend cost we in its descent not more than seven minute we then walk to the hermitage in about a hour and a quarter and arrive there with no other accident than have we shoe and stocking totally spoil we foot a little singe the hand of mr rd severely burn and both begrime with ash like blacksmith the ecclesiastic give we a breakfast of coffee and egg and a glass of maraschino and we give he two _ scudus _ each before we depart he present to we he album which he usually do to all traveller invite they to write something i take up the pen and feel a little inspiration write the follow line : anch ` io salito son sul gran vesuvio mentre cadsa di cineri un diluvio questo cammin mi piace d'aver fatto ma plù mi piace il ritornare intatto which please the old man very much to see a foreigner write italian verse i pleased he still more by let he know that i be a enthusiastic admirer and humble cultivator of the tuscan muse and that have read and study most of they poet particularly _ il divino ariosto _ i now and then catch a _ scintilletta _ from he verse we now take a cordial farewell of we worthy old host mount we mule and descend the mountain on arrival at porticus we dismiss we guide salvatore with a _ scudo pour boire _ besides the stipulate price salvatore ask I to give he a write certificate of he service which he generally sollicit from all those whom he conduct to the volcano i ask he for he certificate book and beg to know whether he would have it in prose or verse he laugh and say : _ vostra excellenza è padrone _ i take out my pencil and write the follow quatrain : dal monte ignivomo tornati siam stanchissimi e del buon salvator siam tutti contentissimi felice il pellogrin che a salvator si fida che di lui non si può trovare un miglior guida i never see any body so delighted as salvatore appear when i read to he what i have write in he book i have another observation to make before i take leave of this celebrated mountain which be that the liquid lava which it eject be far more dangerous and destructive than the eruption of stone and ash the lava flow from the flank of the mountain in a liquid stream sometimes there will be a eruption and no lava flow : at other tune the lava flow from the flank of the mountain without any eruption from the crater at other time and then it be most alarming the eruption take place accompany by the flow of the lava all this demonstrate that the volcano be the effect of the effort of the subterraneous fire to get some vent and escape from its confinement this time i do not observe any lava flow except a slight vein of it on the spot where mr rd fall down and burn he hand but it be easy to observe on the side of the mountain the course and route take at different time by the lava which have become hardened and be very plainly to be distinguish as it resemble a _ river _ -lrb- if i may use the word -rrb- of slate meander between the green sward of the mountain and descend toward the sea you can plainly distinguish the course and direction of the lava which destroy part of torre del greco and sweep it into the sea at porticus have wash ourselves at the inn from head to foot in order to get rid of we blacksmith 's appearance and have purchase a new pair of shoe and stocking each we visit the royal palace and museum with a view principally of examine the object of art and valuable discover in pompeius the royal palace be call _ la favorita _ its architecture be beautiful the garden or rather lawn which be ornament by statue and enrich by orange grove extend to the sea the first thing that present itself to the view of the visitor at the museum of porticus be the two equestrian statue of marcus balbus proconsul and procurator and of he son which statue be find in herculaneum i forget to mention that there be a inscription with that name on the side of the proscenium of the theater easily legible by the light of _ flambeau _ to return to the museum at porticus we be then shewn into a room contain curious _ morceaux _ of antiquity discover at pompeius : a tripod in bronze and various other article of the same metal table various lamp in bronze resemble exactly those use in hindostan wooden pen dice grain of corn quite black and scorch a skeleton of a woman with the ash incrust round it -lrb- the form of she breast be see on the crust of ash golden armlet be find on she which be shewn to we -rrb- steel mirror comb utensil for culinary purpose such as _ casserole _ fry pan spoon fork pestle and mortar instrument of sacrifice weight and measure coin a _ carcan _ or _ stock _ & c in the upper room be to be see the painting and _ fresque _ find in the same place the painting be poor thing and in they landscape the roman seem to have have little more idea of perspective than the chinese but the _ fresque _ be beautiful : the female figure belong thereto be delineate with the utmost grace and delicacy they consist of subject chiefly from the mythology i notice the follow in particular viz chiron teach the young achille to draw the bow the discovery of oreste theseus and the minotaur -lrb- he have just slay the minotaur and a boy be in the act of kiss he hand as if to thank he for he deliverance the minotaur be here represent as a monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull -rrb- a centaur carry off a nymph a car draw by a parrot and drive by a cricket : a woman offer to another little love for sale -lrb- she be pull out the little cupid from a basket and hold they by they wing as if they be fowl -rrb- a beautiful female figure seat on a monster something like the chimaera of the ancient and hold a cup before the monster 's mouth -lrb- emblematical of hope nourish a chimaera -rrb- the arabesque take from pompeius and preserve here be very beautiful here also be two statue find in pompeius : the one represent a drunken faun the other a sit mercury we meet two polish lady here who be amusing themselves in copy the _ fresque _ we return to naple at five o'clock and dine at the _ villa di napoli _ in the evening we go to the _ teatro de ' fiorentinus _ the piece perform be pamelum or _ la virtû premiata _ which i understand be quite a stock piece in italy it be write by goldonus it be very badly perform the actor be not perfect in they part and the prompter 's voice be as loud as usual the costume be appropriate enough which be far from be always the case at this theater naple 13 octr we start on the 12th at six o'clock in the morning -lrb- mr r ----- d and myself -rrb- in a _ calèche _ in order to visit puzzuoli baius and all the classical ground in that direction we of course pass through the grotto of pausilippo this grotto be thirty foot high and about five hundred foot long in fact it be a vast rock undermine and a high road run thro ' it the breadth of which be sufficient for three carriage to go abreast from its great length it be of course exceed dark in order therefore to obviate this inconvenience lamp constantly light be suspend from the roof and on the side of the grotto and hole pierce towards the top to admit a little daylight the road pierce thro ' this rock and call the grotto of pausilippo abridge the journey to puzzuoli very considerably as otherwise you would be oblige to go round by cape margelina which would increase the distance ten mile on issue from the grotto on the other side you arrive in a few minute on the seashore on the bay form between cape margelina and puzzuolus we stop at the lake agnano which be strongly impregnate with sulfur on the bank of this lake be the _ thermae _ or vapor bath and here be also the famous _ grotto del cane _ the pestilential vapor arise from which rise about three inch from the ground and have the appearance of a spider 's web a unfortunate dog perform the miracle of the resurrection to all those who visit this natural curiosity and we also be curious to see its effect the guardian of the therme seize the poor animal and hold he nose close to the place from whence the vapor exhale the dog be seize with strong convulsion and in two minute he be perfectly senseless and to all appearance dead but on be place in the open air he soon recover the poor beast shew evident repugnance to the experiment and i wonder he do not endeavor to make he escape for he have sometimes to perform this feat four or five time a day i should suppose that he will not be very long live for the repeat dose of this mephitic vapor must surely accelerate he dissolution the heat of the _ thermae _ and steam of the sulphur be almost insupportable but it have a most beneficial effect on malady of the nerve and cutaneous complaint we then proceed on we journey to puzzuoli the ancient puteolus where be the remains of the famous mole -lrb- or bridge as other call it -rrb- of caligulum intend to embrace or unite the two extreme of the bay of baiae form on one side by puzzuolus and on the other by cape misenus we alight to take a _ déjeuner à la fourchette _ at puzzuolus and then go to visit the temple of jupiter serapi which be a vast edifice and tho ' in ruin very impose on wander thro ' the enceinte of this famous temple i thought of apollonius of tyana and he sudden appearance to he friend dami at the porch of this very temple when he escape from the fang of domitian and when it be believe that by means of magic art he have be able at once to transport himself from the praetorium at rome to puteoli as i say before the bay include by cape misenus and puzzuolus be what be call baiae the land be low and marshy from puzzuolus to a little beyond the lake avernus but from monte nuovo it begin to rise and form high cliff nearly all way to cape misenus it be on these high cliff that the opulent roman build they villa and they must have be as much crowd together as the villa at ramsgate and broadstair we embark in a boat at puzzuolus to cross over to baiae -lrb- ie the place where the villa begin -rrb- but we stop on we way thither at a landing place nearly in the center of the bay in order to visit the lake avernus and the cave of the cumaean sybil describe by virgil as the entrance into the realm of pluto the lake avernus in spite of its be invest by the poet with all that be terrible in the mythology as a river of hell look very like any other lake and tho ' it be impregnate with sulphur and emit a most unpleasant smell bird do not drop down dead on fly over it as formerly the ground about it be marshy and unwholesome the silence and melancholy appearance of this lake and its environ grove of wood be not calculate to inspire exhilarating idea full of classic souvenir we go to descend into the cave of the sybil and as we descend i could not refrain from repeat aloud virgil 's line : _ di quibus imperium est animarum umbrasque silente _ -lrb- 98 -rrb- etc this descent really be fit to give one a idea of the descent to the shades below and what add to the illusion be that when we arrive at the bottom of the descent and just at the entrance of the cave where the sybil hold she oracle we discover four fierce look fellow with light torch in they hand stand at the entrance my friend cry out _ voilà les furies _ and these prove to be we boatman who while we be contemplate the _ bolge d'averno _ have run on before to provide torch to shew we the interior of the grotto of the sybil as this grotto be nearly knee-deep fill with water we get on the back of the boatman to enter it it be about twenty-five foot long fifteen broad and the height about thirteen foot as we be neither devour by cerberus nor hustle by old charon into he boat we return from the _ shade below _ to the light of heaven triumphant like ulyss or aenea consider ourselves now among the _ paucus quo aequus amavit jupiter _ -lrb- 99 -rrb- acheron the dreadful acheron be not far from avernus and be likewise a lake tho ' call would a river in the mythology it be also sulfuric and the ground about it be woody low marshy and consequently aguish we next ascend the cliff of baia and we be show the remains of the villa of cicero caesar syllum and other great name we then go to the bath of nero -lrb- so call -rrb- here it be the fashion to descend under ground in order to feel the effect of the sulfuric heat which be intense and my friend who descend soon return drip with perspiration and call out : _ quus n ' a pas vu celum n ' a rien vu _ but i do not chuse to descend as i could feel no pleasure in be half stifled and the _ grotto del cane _ have already give I a full idea of the force of the vapor of the _ therme _ we then descend from the cliff of baiae on the other side and visit the remains of three celebrated temple of antiquity situate on the beach nearly and very close to each other viz the temple of diana of venus and of mercury all striking object and majestic tho ' in a state of dilapidation each of these temple have cupola we then ascend the slope of ground lead towards cape misensus to visit the _ cento camarelle _ and _ piscina mirabile _ both vast edifice under ground serve as cellar or appendage to a palace that stand on this spot we then visit the lake call the _ mare morto _ or styx and then go round to the other side of it to visit those beautiful _ coteaux _ plant in vine and they summit crown with grove which have obtain the name of the elysian field this styx and these elysian field look like any other lake and _ coteaux _ and be entirely indebted to the lyre of maro for they celebrity from thence we go to the extremity of cape misenus and embark in we boat -lrb- which we have send on there to wait for we -rrb- to return to puzzuoli by cross the bay at once in this bay and near cape misenus a roman fleet be usually station and pliny 's uncle i believe command one there at the time of the first eruption of vesuvius which cost he he life there be a singular phenomenon in this bay of a mountain that in one of the later eruption and earthquake be form in twenty-four hour near the seashore and be name _ monte nuovo _ the small salt water lake call _ lacus lucrinus _ be also on this bay it appear to I to be a artificial lake make probably by the opulent roman who reside at baia to hold they mullet and other sea fish which they wish to fatten near puzzuoli likewise be the famous _ solfaterra _ the bed of a ancient volcano it be well worth examine it have be long since extinguish but you meet with vast bed of sulphur and calcined stone and the smell be at time almost insupportable we return to naple by half-past seven o'clock not a little tired but highly gratify by we excursion naple 14th oct at the _ teatro nuovo _ i have see another italian tragedy perform the piece be _ tito manlio torquato _ take from the well know anecdote in the roman history the scenery decoration and _ costume _ be good and appropriate not so the act for the actor as usual be imperfect in they part i fully agree with alfierus that italy must be unite and enjoy a free popular government before one can expect to see tragedy well perform it be very divert to see the puppet show at naple and to hear the witticism and various artifice of the showman of pulcinello to secure payment in advance from he audience who would otherwise go away without pay as soon as the performance be over this performance be much attend by the _ lazzaronus _ and _ fainéans _ of the lower order of naple and the puppet showman be oblige to have recourse to various stratagem and ingenious sally to induce a handsome contribution to be make sometimes he will say with a very grave face -lrb- the curtain be draw up and no pulcinello appear -rrb- that he be very sorry there can be no performance this day for that poor signor pulcinello be sick and have no money to pay the doctor : but that if a _ quête _ be make for he he will get himself cure and make he appearance as usual all the while that one of the showman go about collect the _ granus _ the other hold a dialogue with pulcinello -lrb- still invisible -rrb- pulcinello groan and be very miserable at length the collection be make pulcinello take medicine say he be well again make he appearance and begin at another time the audience be inform that there can be no performance as pulcinello be arrest for debt and put in prison where he must remain unless a subscription of money be make for he to pay he debt and take he out of gaol then follow a absurd dialogue between pulcinello -lrb- suppose to answer from the prison -rrb- and the showman the showman scold he for be a spendthrift and lead a profligate life call he a _ briccone _ a _ birbante _ and pulcinello only groan out in reply _ povero I povero pulcinello che disgrazium sventurato di I di non aver denarus _ these stroke of wit never fail to bring in many a _ grano _ at another time the curtain be draw up and discover a gibbet and pulcinello standing on a ladder affix to it with a rope round he neck the showman with the utmost gravity and assume melancholy inform the audience that a most serious calamity be about to happen to naple : that signor pulcinello be condemn to be hang for a robbery and that unless he can procure _ moltus denari _ to bribe the officer of justice to let he escape he will inevitably be hang and the people will never more behold they unhappy friend pulcinello the showman now implore the commiseration of the audience and now reproach pulcinello with he profligacy and nefarious prank which have bring he to a untimely end pulcinello sob cry promise to reform and to attend mass regularly in future what neapolitan heart can resist such a appeal the _ granus _ be collect pulcinello give money to the puppet represent the executioner down go the gibbet and pulcinello be himself again i shall return in a day or two to rome have see nearly all that naple afford i have now full liberty to die when i chuse accord to the proverb : _ veder napolus e poí morire _ naple certainly be take it all in all the most interesting city in europe for it unite every thing that be conducive to the _ agrémens _ of life a beautiful city a noble bay a vast commerce provision of the best sort abundant and cheap a pleasant society a delicious climate music opera _ ballus _ library museum of painting and sculpture in its neighborhood two subterraneous city a volcano in full play and every spot of ground convey the most interesting _ souvenir _ and immortalize

and perfectly conversant in english litterature reside with he he sister also be settle at pescium be marry to a tuscan gentleman of the name of fortus the sister have a full share of the talent and amiable quality of she mother and brother with a family of such resource as this you may suppose we conversation do not flag for a moment nor do i recollect in the course of my whole life have pass such a pleasant time and i only wish that the three day could be prolong to three year politics the occurrence of the day live character classical reminiscence french english italian and german litterature afford we a inexhaustible variety of topic for conversation : and the profound local knowledge that mr sismondus possess of italy of its history and antiquity render he communication of the utmost value to the traveller we supper be prolong to a late hour and i question if the supper and conversation of scipio and atticus those _ node caenaeque deum _ -lrb- 100 -rrb- be more piquant or afford more variety than ours shakespeare schiller voltaire ariosto dante filangierus michel angelo washington napoleon all furnished anecdote and reflexion in abundance the last evening that i pass here two family of pescium come in one of the gentleman be a great reader of voyage and travels and indium suddenly become the subject of discourse as i have pass six year in that country during which time i have visit the three presidency of calcutta madra and bombay have ascend the gange as far as benare have visit the mysore country and nizam 's territory have sojourn three week among the splendid and magnificent ruin of bijanagur or bisnagar have travel thro ' the whole of the deccan from pondicherry to cape comorin besides have traverse on horseback the whole circumference of ceylon and across the whole island from east to west by the wanny i be enable to furnish they with many a anecdote from the eastern world which to they be a great treat and i dare say at time my narration appear almost as marvellous as a story in the arabian night particularly when i related the various religious ceremony the grim idol of juggernaut the swing to _ recover cast _ the exposure of old people to the holy death in the gange by stop up they nose mouth and ear with mud and place they on the water 's edge at low tide in order that they should be sweep off at the high water the holy city of benare the magnificent remains of bisnagar the splendid pagoda of ramisseram the policy of the bramin the appalling voluntary penance of the _ jogui _ or _ fakir _ as the european call they the bed of spike the arm hold up in the air for fifteen year the tiger hunt the method of catch the elephant in ceylon the pearl fishery sepoy establishment in short i must have appear to they a ulyss or a sindbad and i dare say that they think i add from time to time a little embellishment from my imagination tho ' i can safely and solemnly aver that i do not extenuate nor exaggerate any thing but simply related what i have myself see and witness mr sismondus be under a sort of banishment from he native country geneva in consequence of the side of the question he take in he writings on the return of the emperor napoleon from elba it be indeed natural for the restore government -lrb- the bourbon -rrb- to desire the removal from france of a man of talent who have expose they past and might scrutinize they future conduct and wilful fault but why the government of geneva should espouse they quarrel and visit one of they most estimable citizen with banishment for opinion not at all connect with nor influential upon geneva appear to I not only absurd and anomalous but unjust in the highest degree but such be the state of degradation to which europe be reduce by the triumph of the old _ régime _ and the swiss government be compel to become the instrument of the vengeance of the coalition but i shall dwell no more on this subject at present let we hope that in a short time a more liberal spirit will arise and the genevese will be eager to recall in triumph the illustrious citizen of whom they have so much reason to be proud we spend we morning mr sismondus and i in promenade towards the most striking point of the country immediately environ pescium and as i have at this time some idea of come to settle in tuscany he be so kind as to conduct I to look at several villa that be to let and i inspect three very beautiful one well furnished and each capable of hold a large family that be to be let for 18 20 and 24 _ loui d'or _ per annum wine and every article of life be of prodigious cheapness here and the inhabitant be so respectable and there be such a absence of all crime that pescia must be a very desirable and economical residence for any foreign family possess a sufficient knowledge of italian to mix with the society of the native there be several ancient and noble family in the neighborhood highly respectable in point of moral character and manners but rather in _ décadence _ in point of fortune it be with the greatest regret that i bade adieu to the amiable sismondus he mother and sister but i hope for a time only as i have some idea of remove my domicile from lausanne to this part of the world i start at 10 o'clock be on the 11th of November and after two hour ' journey in a cabriolet arrive at lucca a distance of ten mile and put up at the _ hôtel del pelicano _ the road run thro ' a highly cultivate country lucca be a large fortified city situate hi a beautifully luxuriant plain or basin surround on all side by hill and mountain of

whole territory of this little _ ci-devant _ republic be a perfect paradise the city itself from the massiveness and solidity of the edifice have more of a solemn than a lively appearance but there be a delightful walk on the rampart which be line with tree the street be well pave the extreme antiquity of the city and style of its edifice make it appear less _ rianus _ than the other city in tuscany the cathedral be gothic and there be in it the statue of the four evangelist this and the _ palazzo pubblico _ be the most conspicuous edifice tho ' the republic be annihilate the word _ liberta _ still remain on a escutcheon on the gate of the city lucca tho ' no longer a republic and enclavée in tuscany be for the present a independent state and belong to a infanta of spain -lrb- formerly princess of parma -rrb- who take the title of duchess of lucca it be generally suppose however that on the demise of marium louisa ex-empress of the french and now duchess of parma this family viz the duchess of lucca and she son will resume they ancient possession in the parmesan and that lucca will then be incorporate with tuscany before the fall of napoleon the princess elisa baciocchus he sister be sovereign of lucca and she it be who have embellish the outside of the city with some beautiful promenade she devote she whole time talent and resource to the good of she subject and be highly esteem and much regret by they the present duchess of lucca have no other character but that which seem common to the royal family of france spain and naple viz of be very weak and priest-ridden lucca furnish excellent female servant who be remarkable for they industry and probity they only solace be they lover or _ amoroso _ as they term he and when they enter into the service of any family they always stipulate for one day in the week on which they must have liberty to visit they _ amoroso _ or the _ amoroso _ must be allow to come to the house to visit they this be a ancient custom among they and have no pernicious consequence nor do it interfere with they other good quality at the back of lucca be a immense mountain which stand between it and pisa and intercept the reciprocal view of the two city which be only ten mile distant from each other this mountain and its peculiarity be the very one mention by dante in he _ inferno _ in the _ episode _ of ugolino : _ cacciando il lupo e i lupicini _ al monte per che i pisan veder lucca non ponno -lrb- 101 -rrb- i start from lucca in a cabriolet and in two hour arrive at pisa put up at the _ tre donzelle _ on the quaus of the arno between lucca and pisa be the _ bagnus di lucca _ a favorite resort for the purpose of bathing and drink the mineral water pisa be one of the most beautiful city i have see in italy the extreme elegance and comfort of the house the spacious quaus on the arno which furnish a most agreeable promenade the splendid style of architecture of the _ palazzo _ and public building the cleanliness of the street the salubrity of the climate the mildness of the winter the profusion and cheapness of all the necessaries of life and above all the amenity and simplicity of the inhabitant combine to make pisa a agreeable and favorite residence yet the population have much decrease there appear a air of melancholy stillness about the city and grass may be see in some of the street this decay in population cause lodgings to be very cheap the most striking object in pisa be the lean tower _ -lrb- torre cadente -rrb- _ and after that the cathedral baptistery and _ campo santo _ which be all close to the tower and to each other imagine two fine gothic church in a square or place like lincoln 's inn field a large oblong building nearly at right angle with the church and inclose a green grass plot in its quadrangle and a lean tower of cylindrical form face the church : and then you will have a complete idea of this part of pisa i must not omit to mention that there be a breed of camel here belong to the grand duke i believe it be the only part of europe except turkey where the breed of camel be attempt to be propagate leghorn 17 novr i leave pisa for leghorn on the morning of the 15th November and after a drive of two hour in a cabriolet i arrive at the latter place and put up at the _ aquilum nera _ the distance between pisa and leghorn be only 10 or 11 mile and a plain with few tree either plant in corn or in pasturage form the landscape between the two city leghorn -lrb- livorno -rrb- be a modern city do not offer anything remarkably interesting to the classical traveller either from its locality or its history found under the auspices of the medicus it have rise rapidly to grandeur and opulence and have eclipse genoa in commerce

piazza grande _ to the port the port and mole be striking object and considerable commercial bustle prevail there among the few thing worthy of particular notice be the jewish synagogue decorate with costly lamp and inscription in gold in the hebrew and spanish language many of which allude to the hospitality and protection afford to the hebrew nation by the sovereign of tuscany there be a great number of hebrew family here : they all speak spanish be the descendant of those unfortunate jew who be expel from spain at the time of the expulsion of the moor in the reign of don felipe iii surname

die of despair at be exile from they native land in return for this what have spain gain the inquisition -- despotism in its worst form -- poverty -- rag -- louse -- a overbearing insolent and sanguinary priesthood of whom the monarch be either the puppet or the slave a degraded nobility a half savage grossly ignorant lazy and brutal people a proper judgment on the spanish nation for its cruelty and fanaticism my guide at leghorn conduct I to see the bury ground belong to the english factory which be interesting enough from the variety of tomb monument and inscription here all protestant to whatever nation they belong be bury i notice smollett 's tomb it be on the whole a interesting spot tho ' not quite so much so as the cemetery of père la chaise at paris i return to florence from leghorn _ tout d'une traite _ in the diligence we stop at fornacettus -lrb- half way -rrb- to dine there be a good _ table d'hôte -lrb- ordinario -rrb- _ there florence 22nd novr i have become acquaint with lord dillon -lrb- 102 -rrb- and he family who be reside here and from whom i have receive much civility i meet at he house the marchese giulianus one of the adherent of king joachim a very amiable and clever man who speak english fluently lord dillon be a man of much reading and information and he conversation be at all time a great treat he lady too be very amiable and accomplished i go one day with a friend of mine to a _ pique-nique _ party at the cascino where a laughable adventure occur perfectly in the stile of the _ novella _ of boccacio as it be not the custom in florence that husband and wife should go together to place of public amusement the lady be generally accompany by she _ cavalier servente : _ but it by no means follow that the _ cavalier servente _ be the favored lover : one be often adopt as a cover to another who enjoy the peculiar favor of the lady a gentleman who arrive at the hall where the supper table be lay out somewhat earlier than the rest of the company and before the chamber be light observe a gentleman and lady ascend the staircase turn aside by a corridor and enter a chamber together it be dark and he could not distinguish they person he wait fifteen or twenty minute and observe they leave the chamber together pass along the corridor and disappear he have the curiosity to go into the chamber they have just leave and find on the bed a lady 's glove he take up the glove and put it in he pocket determine that this incident should afford he some amusement at supper and the company also by put some fair one to the blush accordingly when the supper be nearly over he hold up the glove and ask with a loud voice if any lady have lose a glove when he own wife who be sit at the same table at some distance from he call out with the utmost _ sangfroid : e il mio dammelo : l'ho lasciato cadere _ you may conceive what a laugh there be against he for he have relate the circumstance of he find it to several of the company before they sit down to supper this remind I of a anecdote mention by brantôme as have occur at milan in he time a glove be in this case also the cause of the _ désagrément _ a married lady have be much court by a spanish cavalier of the name of leon : one day think he have make sure of she he follow she into she bedroom but meet with a severe and decide repulse and be compel to leave she _ re infectà _ in he confusion he leave one of he glove on the bed which remain there unperceived by the lady the husband of the lady arrive shortly afterwards and as he be aware of the attention of the spaniard to he wife and have notice he go into the house he go directly to he wife 's chamber where the first thing that captivate he attention be a man 's military glove on the bed he however say nothing but from that moment abstain from all conjugal duty the lady finding herself thus neglect by a husband who have be formerly tender and attentive be at a loss to know the reason and determine to come to a _ éclaircissement _ with he in as delicate a manner as she could she therefore take a slip of paper write the follow line thereon and place it on he table : _ vigna era vigna son era podada or più non son e non sò per qual cagion non mi poda il mio patron _ -lrb- 103 -rrb- the husband on read these line write the follow in answer : _ vigna erus vigna seus erus podada e più non seus per la gran fa del leon non ti poda il tuo patron _ the lady on read these line perceive at once the cause of she husband 's estrangement and succeed in explain the matter satisfactorily to he which be facilitate by the ingenuous declaration of leon himself that he have try to succeed but have be repulse the husband and wife be perfectly reconcile live happily and no doubt the vine be cultivate as usual i leave florence the 27th November and arrive at turin 5th December in a evil hour i engage myself to accompany a old swiss baroness with whom i become acquaint at the hotel of mine hembert to accompany she to turin she have with she she son a fine boy of thirteen year of age but very much spoil we engage a _ vetturino _ to conduct we to turin stop one day at milan the baroness do not speak italian and generally send for I to interpret for she when any dispute occur between she and the people at the inn and these dispute be tolerably frequent as she always give the servant wherever she stop a good deal of trouble and on depart generally forget to give they the _ buona grazia _ i sometimes pay they for she myself in order to avoid noise and tumult at other time we depart under volly of abuse and imprecation such as _ brutta vecchia maladetta carogna _ and so forth the baroness have strong aristocratic prejudice and be a bitter enemy of the french revolution to which she attribute collectively all the _ désagrémens _ she have experience during life and all the inconvenience she meet with during we present journey the negligence and impertinence of the servant in italy be invariably attribute by she to the revolutionary principle and she tell I that the servant in she native canton bern be the best in the world but that even in they the french revolution have make a great deal of difference and that they be not so submissive as they use to be as she send for I to be she dragoman in all she dispute on the road you may conceive how glad i be to arrive at turin to be rid of she she put I in mind of gabrina in the _ orlando furioso _ we stop one day at milan but we be very near be detain two or three day at fiacenza owing to a informality in the baroness 's passport which have not be visé by the austrian legation at florence in vain she plead that she be tell at the inn at florence that such _ visa _ be not necessary the police officer at the austrian _ douane _ at a short distance beyond piacenza be inexorable and refuse to _ viser _ she passport to allow she to proceed she be in a sad dilemma and it be think we should be oblige to remain at piacenza i however recommend she to be guide by I and not to talk with or scold anybody and that i would ensure she arrival at milan without difficulty for i have observe that she scolding the officer at the _ douane _ only serve to make he more obstinate i recommend she therefore that when we should arrive within sixty or seventy pace of the gate at milan she should get out of the carriage with she son and walk thro ' the gate on foot with the utmost unconcern as if she belong to the town and be return from a promenade and that while they stop we who be in the carriage to examine we passport she should walk direct to the inn where we be to lodge then write to the consul of she nation to explain the business she follow my advice and pass unobserved and unmolested into milan on the precede evening at castel-puster-lengo at supper i ask whether she think the rigor of the austrian government be also the offspring of the french revolution the baroness have bring up she son in all these feeling and particularly in a determine hatred of the canton de vaud for in the evening when we arrive at the inn and be sit round the fire he would shake the burning faggot about and say : _ voilà la ville de lausanne en cendre _ if he grow up with these idea and act upon they he stand a good chance of be shoot in a duel by some vaudois it be a pity to see a child so spoil for he be a very fine boy tho ' very violent in he temper which probably he inherit from he mother somebody at the _ pension surpe _ at milan who know she tell I that the baroness be of a aristocratic family and have marry a rich _ bourgeois _ of bern whom she treat rather too much _ de haut en bas _ in short that it be a marriage quite _ à la george dandin _ till the poor man take it into he head to die one day at turin we part company she for genoa and i for lausanne _ from turin to lausanne _ i feel the cold very sensibly in the journey from florence to milan and turin there be not a colder country in europe than lombardy in the winter the vicinity of the alp contribute much to this and the house be exceedingly large and have no stove it be quite impossible that the fireplace can give heat sufficient to warm the room i start from turin on the morning of the 9th December in the french diligence bind to lyon but take my place only as far as chambéry in the diligence be a piedmontese colonel who have serve under napoleon and a young scotchman a relation of lord minto the latter be fond of excursion in ice and snow and on we arrival at suza he propose to I to start from there two or three hour before the diligence and to ascend mont ceni on foot as far as the _ hospice _ and i be mad enough to accede to the proposal for it certainly be little less than madness in a person of my chilly habit and susceptibility of cold and who have pass several year within the tropics to scale the alp on foot in the middle of December and to walk 24 mile in snow and ice at one o'clock in the morning which be the hour at which we start i be well clad in flannel and i go thro ' the journey valiantly and in high spirit and without suffer much from the cold till within five mile of the hospice when a heavy snow storm come on it then begin to look a little ugly and but for napoleon 's grand _ chaussès _ we be lose we struggle on three mile further in the snow before we fall in with a _ maison de refuge _ we knock there and nobody answer we then determine _ coûte que coûte _ to push on to the _ hospice _ which we know could not be more than two mile distant indeed it be much more advisable so to do than to run the risk of be freeze by remain two or three hour in the cold air till the diligence should come up in standing still i begin to feel the cold bitterly so in spite of the snow storm we push on and arrive at the inn at mont-ceni at five in the morning we rub we hand and face well with snow and take care not to approach the fire for several minute fortify ourselves in the interim with a glass of brandy we then have some coffee make and lay ourselves down to sleep by the side of a enormous fire until the diligence arrive which make its appearance at eight o'clock the passenger stop to breakfast and the scotchman propose to I to make the descent of lans-le-bourg also on foot but i be quite satisfied with the prowess i have already exhibit and decline the challenge he however set off alone and thus perform the entire passage of mont ceni on foot as for the rest of we we be carry down on a _ traineau _ that be to say the diligence be unloaded and its wheel take off the baggage and wheel be put on one _ traineau _ and the diligence with the passenger in it on another and in this manner we descend to lans-le-bourg

spaniard term those secretion -rrb- into the small street that lie at the back of the house the consequence be that they be clog up with filth and there be always a most abominable stench one must be careful how one walk thro ' these street at night from the liability of be salute by a golden shower the lower class of the auvergnat have the reputation of be dirty slovenly and idle here be a church build by the english in the time of edward iii when the black prince command in this country and it be in a chapel in this city the remains of which still exist that peter the hermit preach the first crusade these be almost the only thing worthy of remark in the town itself except that there be a good deal of commerce carry on manufacture of crockery cloth and silk stocking but in the natural curiosity of the environs of clermont there be a great deal to interest the botanist and mineralogist and above all there be a remarkable petrify well very near the town where by leave piece of wood shell-fish and other article expose to the drop of the water they become petrified in a short time this water have the same effect on dead animal and rapidly convert they into stone i have myself see a small basket fill with plover ' egg become in eight day a perfect petrifaction clermont April 2d i be arrive here at rather a dull season : the carnaval be just over and all the young lady be take to they _ livre d'heure _ to atone for any levity or indiscretion they may have be guilty of during the hey day of the carnaval the wardle family have a very pleasant acquaintance here chiefly among the _ libéraux _ or moderate royalist but there be some most inveterate _ ultra _ in this city who keep aloof from any person of liberal principle as they would of a person infect with the plague the noblesse of auvergne have the reputation of be in general ignorant and despotic there be but little _ agrément _ or instruction to be derive from they society for they have not the idea of the age in general the noble of auvergne tho ' great stickler for feudality and for they privilege and tho ' they dislike the revolution have the good sense not to emigrate there be a swiss regiment of two battalion quarter here it bear the name of its colonel de sali as there be a number of officer of the old army here on half pay about three hundred in number it be say frequent dispute occur between they and the swiss officer the swiss be look upon by the people at large as the satellite of despotism and not without reason it be i think degrade for any country to have foreign troops in pay in time of peace several attempt have be make in the chamber of deputy to obtain they removal or _ licencíement _ but without success as it be suppose that the song of the _ ranz des vaches _ affect the sensibility of the swiss very much and make they long to return to they native mountain a wag have recommend to all the young lady in france who be musician to play and sing the _ ranz des vaches _ with all they might in order to induce the swiss to betake themselves to they native country there have be a great deal of denunciation go forward here but the general de v -- -lrb- 104 -rrb- who command the troops in clermont determine to put a stop to it he have the good sense to see that such a system if encourage would be destructive of all society prejudicial to the government and vexatious to himself as he would be thereby keep continually in hot water accordingly on a delator present himself and accuse another of not be well affect to the present order of thing and of have speak disrespectfully of the king m de v -- say to he : i have no doubt sir that you denunciation proceed from pure motive and i give you full credit for you zeal and attachment to the royal cause but i can not take any step against the person whom you accuse unless you be willing to give I leave to publish you name and consent to be confront with he so that i may examine fairly the state of the case and render justice to both party the accuser decline accede to this proposition the general desire he to withdraw and shortly after intimate publicly that he would listen to no denunciation unless the denouncer give up he name and consent to be confront with the accuse the consequence of this intimation be that all denunciation cease the late prefect however be not so prudent and choose rather to encourage delation but mark the consequence he arrest several person wrongfully be oblige to release they afterwards be in continual hot water and it end by the government be oblige to displace he to avoid the merit vengeance of many individual whom he have ill-treat he be oblige on give up he prefecture to make a precipitate retreat from clermont the delator attempt the same system with the new prefect and col wardle have invite some of the swiss officer to a ball to which be likewise invite people of all opinion a information be lodge against he purport that he want to corrupt the swiss officer from they allegiance the prefect send the letter to col wardle and say that it have not make the slightest impression on he mind and that he treat it as a malicious report the new prefect adopt the same system as the general and tranquillity be since perfectly restore thing have be take a better turn since the dissolution of the _ chambre introuvable _ decaze the present minister be a able man and if he be not _ contrarié _ by the _ libéraux _ he will keep the fanatical _ ultra _ in good order the bishop of clermont be a liberal man also and as it seem the wish of the present public functionary here to conciliate it be to be hope that they example will not be lose on the _ bon vieux gentilshomme _ of auvergne i find a inexhaustible fund of entertainment from the conversation of m c -- he have so many interesting anecdote to relate respect the french revolution with regard to he present occupation which be direct towards rural economy he tell I that he have succeed in a plan of cleanse the town from its augean filth and make it very profitable to himself and that he calculate to obtain a revenue thereby of twenty thousand frank annually he have in short undertake to be the grand _ scavenger _ of the town and the government in addition to a salary of 2500 franc per annum which they give he for he trouble give to he the exclusive privilege of remove all the dung he can collect in the precinct of the city and of convert it to he own advantage he begin by fitting up a large enclosure wall on each side and in which he deposit all the filth he can collect in the stable yard and street of clermont he send he cart round the town every morning to get they load all they contents be bring to this repository and shoot out there straw be then place over this dung and then earth or soil collect from gully and ravine and this arrange _ stratum super stratum _ till it form a immense compact cake of rich compost and when it have fill one of the yard and have complete a thickness of five foot he sell it to the farmer who send they cart to carry it off he have divide this enclosure or repository into three or four compartment the compost therefore be prepared and ready to be carry off in one yard while the other be fill in this he have render a great benefit to the public for the auvergnat be incurable in they custom of empty they _ pot de chambre _ out of the window so that the street every morning be in a terrible state : but thanks to the industry of c -- he car go round to collect the precious material and all be clear away by twelve o'clock he collect bone too and offal to add to the compost he conduct I to see he premise but the odour be too strong i return to lausanne by the same route leave clermont on the 6th April stay four day at lyon and as many at geneva young wardle accompany I we meet with no other adventure on the road than have a young catholic priest fresh from the seminary for we travel companion from thier to roanne this young man wish to convert wardle and myself to catholicism among many argument that he make use of be that most silly one which have be so often sport by the catholic theologian viz : that it be much safer to be a catholic than a protestant inasmuch as the catholic do not allow that any person can be save out of the pale of they church whereas the protestant do allow that a catholic may be save i answer he that this very argument make more against catholicism than any other and that this intolerant spirit would ever prevent I -lrb- even have such a idea enter into my head -rrb- of embrace such a religion i then tell he that once for all i do not wish to enter into any theological dispute that i have fully make up my mind on these subject and that i would rather take the opinion of a voltaire or a franklin on these matter than all the opinion of all the theologian and churchman that ever sit in council from the council of nicsea to the present day this silence he effectually such be the absurd line of conduct pursue by the catholic priest of the present day in france instead of reform the discipline and dogma of they church and adapt it to the enlighten idea of the present age they be sedulously employd in preach intolerant doctrine and revive absurd legend and pretend miracle which have be long ago consign to contempt and oblivion by all rational catholic and by this they hope to re-establish the ecclesiastical power in its former glory and preponderance vain hope by the american and french revolution a great light be go up to the _ gentile _ catholicism be on its last leg and they might as soon attempt to replace we old friend and school acquaintance jupiter on the throne of heaven as to re-establish the papal power in its pristine splendor to borrow the language of the _ pilgrim 's progress _ the giant _ pope _ will be soon as dead as the giant _ pagan _ on arrival at lyon we put up at the _ hôtel du parc _ where i

it be a very pretty neat little city in a romantic position its government be a complete anomaly neufchâtel form a component part of the helvetic confederacy and yet the inhabitant be vassal of the king of prussium and the aristocracy be proud of this badge of servitude the king of prussium however do not at all interfere with its internal government and he supremacy be in no other respects useful to he than in give he a slight revenue french be the language speak in the canton there be a marked distinction of rank all over switzerland except in geneva vaud and the small democratic canton such as zug and schwytz where it be merely nominal in short tranquillity be the order of the day each rank respect the privilege of the other and the peasant however rich be not at all disposed to vary from he usual mode of life or to ape the noble and hence tho ' sumptuary law be no longer in force they continue so virtually and the peasantry in all the german canton adhere strictly to the national costume bern 14 July i put myself in the diligence that ply between neufchatel and bern at nine pm on the 12 July and the follow morning put up at the _ crown inn _ in the city of bern in the _ pay allemand _ whereas the french canton be term the _ pay romand _ bern be a remarkably elegant city as much so as any in italy and much cleaner withal the street be broad and in most of they be _ trottoir _ under arcade there be a great number of book-seller here and the best edition of the german author be to be procure very cheap bern be situate on a eminence form almost a island as it be in the middle of the river aar steep ravine be on all side of it and there be a bridge over the aar to keep up the communication and as the border of the island on which the city stand be very steep a zig-zag road wind along the ravine bring you to the city gate these gate be very superb on each side of the gate be two enormous white stone bear the emblem of the tutelary genius of this city the house be very lofty and solidly build the promenade in the environs of bern be the finest i have see anywhere and the grounds allot to this purpose be very tastefully lay out these promenade be pave with gravel and cut thro ' the forest that lie on the _ coteaux _ and ravine on the other side of the aar there be several neat villa in the neighborhood of these promenade and there be _ cafés _ and _ restaurant _ for those who chuse to refresh themselves such be the beauty of these walk that one feel inclined to pass the whole day among they they be lay out in such variety and be so multiply that you often lose you way you be sure however to be bring up by a _ point de vue _ at one or other of the angle of the zig-zag and this serve as a guide _ pour vous orienter _ as the french say another favorite promenade be a garden in the town itself that environ the whole city from which and from the superb terrace of the cathedral you have a magnificent view of the glacier that tower above the grindelwald and lauterbrunn the immense forest that be in the neighborhood of bern form a striking contrast with the cornfield in the vally and on the _ coteaw _ there be but few vineyard in the neighborhood of bern bern 16 July the diet be hold this year in bern and it be now sit i have meet with the two deputy of the canton de vaud mm p ----- and m ----- i be glad to hear from they that the animosity exist between the two canton of bern and vaud be begin to subside m p ------ have make a most able and conciliate speech at the diet still there be a good deal of jealousy rankle in the breast of the bern _ noblesse _ and the _ avulsumimperium _ be a very sore subject with they i recollect once at lausanne meeting with a young man of one of the principal family of bern who have be hi the english service the conversation happen to turn on the emancipation of the canton de vaud from the domination of bern when the young man become perfectly furious and insist that the vaudoi have no right whatever to they liberty for that the canton of bern have purchase the province of vaud from the duke of savoy _ en un mot -lrb- say he -rrb- ils sont nos esclaves nos ilotes et ils sont aussi clairement notre propriété que les nègres de la jamaïque le sont de leurs maîtres _ a very harsh measure have lately be pass in the diet evidently suggest by the aristocracy of bern which tend to fine and punish those swiss officer who remain in prance to serve under napoleon after he return from elba and who do not obey the order of the diet which recall they a very able objection have be make to this measure in a _ brochure _ wherein it be state that many of these officer have no means of live out of france and that on a former occasion when a number of swiss officer be serve the english government and be employ in america in the war against the united state in 1812 and 1818 the diet then under napoleon 's influence issue a decree recall they and command they to quit the english service forthwith this they refuse to do and continue to serve no notice whatever be take of this act of disobedience when they return to they native country on be disband in 1814 and they be very favourably receive why then say the author of this pamphlet be a similar act of disobedience to pass unnoticed in one instance and to be so severely punish in another or do you wish to prove that you vengeance be direct only against those who remain in france to fight for its liberty when invade by a foreign foe while those who remain in america to fight against the liberty and existence of the american republic you have receive with applause and congratulation be such conduct worthy of republican o fie such a argument be in my opinion convincing for all the world except for a english tory a french _ ultra _ or a bern oligarch the arsenal here be well worth see here be a superb collection of ancient armor much of which be the spoil of the austrian and burgundian chivalry who fall in they attempt to crush helvetic liberty by way of shew how fond the bernoi be of old institution and custom they have be at the trouble to catch three or four bear and keep they in a walled pit in the city where they be well feed and take care of the popular superstition be that the bear entertain in this manner contribute to the safety of the commonwealth and this establishment continue ever in full force until the dissolution of the old confederacy take place and the establishment in its place of the helvetic republic under the influence of the french directorial government the custom then appear absurd and useless be abolish and the bear be sell but since the peace of 1814 other bear have be catch and be nourishd as the former one be at the expence of the state bern derive its name from _ büren _ the german word for _ bear _ -lrb- plural number -rrb- only the french spell _ berne _ with a _ e _ at the end of it there be no theatrical amusement go forward here card and now and

arrive at naple on the 29th October without accident a _ buona grazia _ of a _ scudo _ at the frontier obviate the delay which would otherwise have occur in examine we baggage by the _ douanier _ i put up at no 1 _ largo st anna di palazzo _ near the _ strada di toledo _ at the house of one berlier who have be a domestic of poor murat 's the austrian troops be now withdraw the military cordon of sentinel from the frontier to naple be keep up by the neapolitan troops but what a contrast between the vigilance of the austrian sentinel and the negligence of the neapolitan the last time i travel on this road i never fail after dusk to hear the shout of _ wer da _ of the austrian sentry long before i come up to they and i always find they alert now that the cordon be neapolitan i always find the sentry either asleep or play at card with they companion -lrb- the sentry be double -rrb- both have leave they arm at the place where they be post at night i have no doubt they all fall asleep so that three or four active _ bandit _ might come and cut the throat of the whole chain of sentry in detail 30th October 1818 i have begin my course of water drinking at the fountain of sta lucium since i be here the last time the theater of st carlo have be finish and i go to visit it the second night after my arrival it be a noble theater and of immense size larger it be say than the _ scalum _ at milan tho ' it do not appear so the profusion of ornament and gilding serve to diminish the appearance of its magnitude it be probably now the most magnificent theater in europe the performance be _ il babiere di siviglia _ by rossinus and afterwards a superb _ ballo _ take closely from coleman 's _ blue-beard _ and arrange as a _ ballo _ by vestri the only difference lie in the costume and the scenery for here the _ barbe bleue _ instead of be a turkish pacha as in coleman 's piece be a chinese mandarin and the decoration be all chinese a great deal of scotch music be introduce in this _ ballo _ and seem to give great satisfaction at the little theater of san carlino i witness the representation of rossinus 's _ cenerentolum _ a most delightful piece the young actress who do the part of cenerentolum act it to perfection and sing so sweetly and correctly that it would seem as if the _ rôle _ be compose on purpose for she the part of don magnifico be extremely well play and those of the sister very fairly and appropriately the three actress who do the part of cenerentolum and she sister be all handsome but she who do cenerentolum surpass they all she be a perfect beauty and a grace i think the music of this opera would please the public taste in england rossinus seem to have banish every other musical composer from the stage i have see at the theater of san carlo the _ don giovannus _ of mozart but certainly after be accustom to the extreme vivacity of rossinus 's style the music even of the divine mozart appear to go off heavily there be too much of what the french call _ musique de fanfare _ in the opera of _ don giovannus _ and i believe most of the italian be of my way of think we have just hear of the death of the poor princess charlotte i be no great admirer of king and queen and yet i must own i could not help feeling regret for the death of this princess i have form a very high opinion of she from many trait in she character and i fancy and hope that she be destine to redeem england from the degradation and bad odour into which she have be plunge by the borough-monger and bureaucrat engender by the pitt system she have liberal idea and a independent spirit i really almost catch myself shed tear at this event and have she be bury here i should have go to scatter flower upon she tomb : he saltem accumulem doni et fungar inani munere -lrb- 108 -rrb- have no royalist or ministerial poet be find to do hommage to she _ mane _ have she live to be queen of england she would have find a thousand venal pen to give she every virtue under heaven there be a professor of natural philosophy now at naple of the name of amicus from modena who have invent a microscope of immense power the circulation of the blood in the thigh of a frog -lrb- the coldest animal in nature -rrb- when view thro ' this microscope appear to take place with the rapidity of a swiss torrent since i have be here i have once more ascended vesuvius there be no eruption at all this time but i witness the sight of a stream of red-hot liquid lava flow slowly down the flank of the mountain it be about two and a half foot broad in my letter from naple the last time i be there i give you some idea of the state of society among the upper class gaming be reduce to a science and be almost exclusively the order of the day there be little or no taste for litterature among any part of the native society the upper class be sensualist the middling ignorant and superstitious with regard to the _ lazzaronus _ i do not think that they at all deserve the ill name that have be give to they they always seem good humor and willing to work when employment be give to they and they do not appear at all disposed to disturb the public peace which from they be so numerous and formidable a body they could easily do the neapolitan dialect have a far greater affinity to the spanish than to the tuscan and there be likewise a great many greek word in it when one take into consideration the extreme ignorance that prevail among the neapolitan in general one be astonish that such a prodigy of genius as filangierus could have spring up among they what talent application deep research and judgment be unite in that illustrious man and yet there be many neapolitan of rank who have never hear of he would you believe that on my ask one of the principal bookseller in naple for filangierus 's work on legislation -lrb- a immortal work which have call forth the admiration and eulogy of the greatest genius of the age of which benjamin franklin and sir wm jone speak in the most unqualified term of approbation a work which have be translate into all the language of europe -rrb- i be tell by the bookseller that he have never hear either of the author or of he work a very curious thing at naple be the number of public writer who compose letter and memorial in booth fit up in the street as the great majority of the people be so ignorant as to be unable to read or write it follow that when they receive letter they must find somebody to read they for they and to write the answer require they accordingly on the receipt of a letter bring it to one of these public scribe ask he to read it for they and to write a answer for which trouble he receive a fixed pay these writer be thus let into the secret of family affair of more than half of the city and as some-of they be in the pay of the government for communicate intelligence you may guess how formidable they may become to liberty and how dangerous a engine in the hand of a despotic government it appear that the theater of san carlo be principally keep up by gaming that be to say the manager and proprietor would not undertake the direction of it without the gaming bank be annex to it for otherwise they would lose money the expence of the opera on account of the magnificent decoration of the ballet be very great which the receipt of the theater be insufficient to meet but the profit of the casino cover all and amply reimburse the proprietor with regard to political opinion here there be a great stagnation it cost the neapolitan too much trouble to think and reflect m ----- the principal minister be however no favorite neither be n ----- who have quit the austrian service and be nominate captain-general of the neapolitan army -lrb- 109 -rrb- there be a great talk about the increase of carbonarism you will probably ask I what carbonarism mean i be not initiate in the secret of the carbonarus but as far as i can understand this sect or secret society have its mystery like modern free-masonry or like the orphic of old and several progressive degree of initiation be require its secret object be say to be the emancipation of italy from a foreign despotism and the form of a government purely national this be the reason why this sect be regard with as much jealousy by the different government of italy as the early christian use to be by the pagan emperor great proof of courage constancy and self denial be require from the initiate and very many fail or do not rise beyond the lower degree of initiation for it be very difficult for a italian to withstand sensuality but the leader of this sect be perfectly in the right to require such proof for no man be fit to be trust with any political design whatever who have not obtain the greatest mastery over he passion the word _ carbonarus _ i need not tell you mean _ coalman _ the italian history present many example of secret society take they appellation from some mechanical profession i have now be nearly two month in naple and the _ zampogne _ or bag-pipe which play about the street at night announce the speedy approach of christmas so that i shall soon take my departure for rome \* \* \* \* \* i leave naple on the 18th of December and arrive at rome on the 22d i be settle in my old lodgings no 29 _ piazza di spagna _ nothing worth mention occur during the journey the fete of the birth of christ hold at santa marium maggiore on the evening of the 24th December be of the most splendid description and attend by a immense crowd of woman gun be fire on the moment that the birth of the savior be announce and this event occur precisely at midnight the roman seem to rejoice as much at the anniversary of this event as if it happen for the first time and as if immediate temporal advantage be to be derive from it i have mix a good deal in society in rome since my return from naple among other acquaintance i must particularly distinguish mme dionigus a very celebrated lady possess universality of talent -lrb- 110 -rrb- she be well know all over italy for the extent of she litterary attainment but more particularly for she proficiency in the fine art above all in painting of which she be a adept she also possess the most amiable quality of the heart and be universally beloved and respect for the worth of she private character and for she generous disposition she have all the vivacity of intellect belong to youth tho ' now nearly eighty-six year of age -lrb- 111 -rrb- and of a very delicate physical constitution in short she afford and i often tell she so the most striking proof of the immortality of the soul there be a _ conversazione _ at she house twice a week where you meet with foreign as well as italian _ litteratus _ and person of distinction of all nation tongue and language she eldest daughter mme d'orfeus be a excellent _ improvisatrice _ and have frequently give we very favourable specimen of the inspiration which breathe itself in she soul i have likewise witness the talent of two very extraordinary _ improvisatorus _ the one a young girl of eighteen year of age by name rosa taddeus she be the daughter of the proprietor of the _ teatro della valle _ at rome and sometimes perform herself in dramatic piece yet strange to say tho ' she be a admirable _ improvisatrice _ and possess a thorough classic and historical knowledge she be but a indifferent actress it be a great shame that she father oblige she to act on the stage in very inferior part when she ought only to exhibit on the tripod i assist at a _ accademia _ give by she one evening at the _ teatro della valle _ when she improvise on the following subject which be propose by various member of the audience : 1st _ la morte d'egeo _ 2dy _ la madre ebrea _ 3rd _ coriolano alle mura di roma _ 4th _ ugolino _ 5th _ saffo e faone _ 6th in the carnaval with the follow _ intercalario : maschera ti conosco tieni la benda al cor _ which _ intercalario _ compel a rhyme in _ osco _ a most difficult one the _ madre ebrea _ and _ coriolano _ be give in _ ottava rima _ with a _ rima obbliga _ for each stanza the _ morte d'egeo _ be give in _ terza rima _ she versification appear to be excellent nor could i detect the absence or superabundance of a single syllable she require the aid of music chus the melody the audience propose the subject and _ rima obbliga _ and the _ intercalario _ where it be require in she gesture particularly before she begin to recite she remind I of the description give of the priestess of delphus she walk along the stage for four or five minute in silent meditation on the subject propose then suddenly stop call to the musician to play a certain symphony and then begin as if inspire among the different rhime in _ osco _ a gentleman who sit next to I propose to she _ cimosco _ i ask he what _ cimosco _ he mean he reply a tuscan poet of that name for my part i have never hear of any other of that name than the king _ cimosco _ in the _ orlando furioso _ who make use of fire-arm and rosa taddeus be it appear of my opinion since this be the _ cimosco _ she choose to characterise and she make thereby a very neat and happy comparison between the gun of cimosco and the arrow of cupid this talent of the _ improvisatorus _ be certainly wonderful and one for which there be no accounting it appear peculiar to the italian nation alone among the modern but probably be in vogue among the ancient greek also it be certain that rosa taddeus give as fine thought as be to be meet with in most poet and i be very much tempt to incline to forsyth 's opinion that homer himself be neither more nor less than a _ improvisatore _ the greek language afford nearly as many poetic licence as the italian and the faculty of heap epithet on epithet be common in both language the other genius in this wonderful art be signer sgriccus he be so far superior to rosa taddeus in be five or six year older in be a very good latinist and hi _ improvise _ whole tragedy on any subject choose by the audience when the subject be choose he develop he plan fix he _ dramati persona _ and then strike off in _ versus scioltus _ he at time introduce a chorus with lyric poetry i be present one evening at a _ accademia _ give by he in the palazzo chigi the subject choose be _ sophonisba _ and it be wonderful the manner in which he vary he plot from that of every other dramatic author on the same subject he _ act _ the drama as well as compose it and pourtray the different character with the happiest effect the ardent passion and impetuosity of massinissa the study calm philosophy and stoicism of scipio the romantic yet dignified attachment of sophonisba and the plain soldierlike honorable behavior of syphax be give in a very superior style i recollect particularly a line he put in the mouth of scipio when he be endeavor to persuade massinissa to resist the allurement and blandishments of love : chè cor di donne è laberinto in quale facil si perde l'intelletto umano this drama he divide into three act and on its termination he improvise a poem in _ terza rima _ on the subject of the contest of ajax and ulyss for the armor of achille wonderful however as this act of improvise may appear it be not perhaps so much so as the mathematical faculty of a youth of eight year of age yorkshireman by birth who have lately exhibit he talent for arithmetical calculation _ improvise _ in england and who in a few seconds from mental calculation could give the cube root of a number contain fifteen or sixteen figure be not all this a confirmation of doctor gall 's theory on craniology viz that we faculty depend on the organization of the scull i think i have see this frequently exemplify at eton i have know a boy who could not compose a verse make a considerable figure in arithmetic and geometry and another who could write latin verse with almost ovidian elegance and yet could not work the simplest question in vulgar fraction indeed i think there seem little doubt that we be bear with disposition and propensity which may be develop and encourage or damp and check altogether by education i have become acquaint with several family at rome so that i be at no loss where to spend my evening music be the never fail resource for those with whom the spirit of conversation fail the society at rome be perfectly free from etiquette or _ gêne _ when once present to a family you may enter they house every evening without invitation make you bow to the master and mistress of the house enter into conversation or not as you please you may absent yourself for week together from these _ conversazionus _ and nobody will on you re-appearance enquire where you have be or what you have be do in short in the intercourse with roman society you meet with great affability sometimes a little _ ennui _ but no _ commérage _ the _ avvocatus _ may be say to form almost exclusively the middling class in rome and they educate they family very respectably this class be much caress by the french government during the time that rome be annex to the french empire and most of the employés of the government at that time be take from this class i have meet with several sensible well-informed people who have be accurate observer of the time and have derive profit in point of instruction from the scene they have witness the papal government begin as most of the restore government do by displace many of these gentleman for no other fault than because they have serve under the ex-government and replace they by ecclesiastic as in the olden time but the papal government very soon discover that the whole political machine would be very soon at a stand by such a _ épuration _ and the most of they have be since reinstate consalvus the secretary of state be a very sensible man he have hard battle to fight with the _ ultra _ of rome in order to maintain in force the useful regulation introduce by the french government particularly the organization of a vigilant police and the put a stop to the murder and robbery which use formerly to be commit with impunity the french check the system of grant asylum to these vagabond altogether but on the restoration of the papal government a strong interest be make to allow asylum as formerly to criminal many of these gentry begin to think that the good old time be come again wherein they could commit with impunity the most atrocious crime and no less than eighty person be in prison at one time for murder this open the eye of the government and consalvus insist on the execution of these man and carry he point of establish a vigilant police the army too have be put on a better footing the papal troops be now clothe and discipline in the french manner and make a most respectable appearance the infantry be clothe in white the cavalry in green the cockade be white and yellow no greater proof can be give of the merit and utility of the french institution in italy than the circumstance of all the restore government be oblige by they interest -lrb- tho ' contrary to they wish and prejudice -rrb- to adopt and enforce they there be still require however a severer law for the punishment of post office defalcation simple dismissal be by no means adequate when it be consider how much mischief may ensue from such offence a very serious offence of this nature and which have make a great sensation have lately occur as all foreign letter must be frank and as the postage to england be very high one of the clerk at the post office have be in the habit of receive money for the franking of letter appropriate it to he own use and never forward the letter this create great inconvenience a number of family have never receive answer to they letter and be without the expect remittance begin to be uneasy and to complain a enquiry be institute and it be discover that the clerk above mention have be carry on this game to a great extent he use to tear the letter and throw the fragment into a closet several scrap of letter be thus discover and on be examine he make a ample confession of he practise he be merely discharge and no other punishment be indict on he i be no advocate for the punishment of death for any other crime but wilful murder but surely this fellow be worse than a robber and deserve a greater severity of punishment rome 10th February 1818 the carnaval have long since begin and this be the heaven of the roman lady on my remark to a lady that i be soon tired of it and after a day or two find it very childish she reply : _ bisogna esser donna e donna italiana per ben godere de ' piaceri del carnevale _ when i speak of the carnaval i speak of the last ten day of it which precede lend the following be the detail of the day 's amusement during the season after dinner which be always early the mask sally out and repair to the _ corso _ the window and balcony of the house be fill with spectator in and out of mask a scaffolding contain a immense number of seat be construct in the shape of a rectangle beginning at the _ piazza del popolo _ run parallel to the _ corso _ on each side and terminate near the _ piazza di venezia _ close to which be the goal of the horse race that take place in this enclosure carriage with person in they generally mask parade up and down this space in two current the one ascend the other descend the _ corso _ they be salute as they pass with shower of white comfit from the spectator on the seat of the scaffolding or from the balcony and window on each side of the street these comfit break into a white powder and bespatter the clothes of the person on whom they fall as if hair-powder have be throw on they this seem to be the grand joke of this part of the carnival after the carriage have parade about a hour a signal be give by the firing of a gun that the horse race be about to begin the carriage on the gun be fire must immediately evacuate the _ corso _ in order to leave it clear for the race some move off and _ rendezvous _ on the _ piazza del popolo _ just behind the scaffolding from the foot of which the horse start other file off by the _ via ripetta _ and take they stand on the _ piazza colonna _ the horse-race be perform by horse without rider generally five or six at a time they be each hold with a bridle or halter by a man who stand by they in order to prevent they start before the signal be give and this require no small degree of force and dexterity as the horse be exceedingly impatient to set off the mane of the horse be dress in ribband of different color to distinguish they piece of tin small bell and other noisy material be fasten to they mane and tail in order by frightening the poor animal to make they run the faster and with this view also squib and cracker be discharge at they as they pass along a second gun be the signal for start the keeper loose they hold and off go the horse the horse that arrive the first at the goal win the grand prize and there be smaller one for the two next this race be repeat four or five time till dusk and then the company separate and return home to dress they then repair to the ball at the different casino and at the conclusion of the ball supper party be form either at _ restaurant _ or at each other 's house during the time occupy in the ball and promenade as every body go mask either in character or in _ domino _ there be a fine opportunity for pair off and it be no doubt turn to account this be a pretty accurate account of a roman carnaval a great deal of wit and repartee take place among the mask and they be in general extremely well support and indeed they ought to be for there be a great sameness of character assume at every masquerade and very little novelty be strike out except perhaps by some foreigner who chus to introduce a national character of he own which be probably but little or not at all understand by the native and very often not at all well support by the foreigner himself a american gentleman once make he appearance as a indian warrior with he war-hatchet and calumet he dance the war dance which excite great astonishment he then present he calumet to a mask who not know what the ceremony mean decline it when the mohawk flourish he hatchet and give such a dreadful shriek as to set the whole company in alarm -lrb- 112 -rrb- on the whole this character be so little understand that it be look upon as a _ mauvaise plaisanterie _ the usual character be pulcinelli arlecchinus spanish grandee turk fortune teller flower girl and devil sometimes too they go in the costume of the god and goddess of the ancient mythology i observe that the english lady here prefer to appear without mask in the costume of the swiss and italian peasantry there be a very large english society at rome and at some of the party here you could suppose yourself in grosvenor square the late political change have bring together in rome many person of the most opposite party and sentiment who have fall from the height of political power and influence into a private station but who enjoy themselves here unmolested and even protect by the government and be much court by foreigner i have see at the same masquerade in the _ teatro aliberti _ in box close to each other the queen of spam -lrb- mother of ferdinand vii -rrb- and the princess borghese napoleon 's sister in a box at a short distance from they be lucian buonaparte he wife and daughter besides these the follow ex-sovereign and person of distinction fall from they high estate reside in rome viz king charle iv of spain the ex-king of holland loui buonaparte the abdicate king of sardinium victor emanuel don manuel godoy the prince of peace cardinal fesch and madame letitia the mother of napoleon i have a opportunity of be present to lucian who bear the title of prince of canino before i leave rome for naple as on leave the pay de vaud i be charge by a swiss gentleman to deliver a letter to he the purport of which be to state that he have render service to joseph napoleon when he be resident in that canton in consequence of which he have be persecute and deprive of he employment at lausanne which be that of captain of the gendarmerie and in the letter he sollicit pecuniary assistance from the prince of canino i ride out one morning to the villa of ruffinellum where the prince reside and be very politely receive it appear however that the prince be totally unacquainted with the person who write the letter nor be he at all aware of the circumstance therein mention i tell he that i be but little acquaint with the writer of the letter but that he on hearing of my intention of go to rome ask I to deliver it personally the prince tell I he would write himself to the applicant on the subject here the negotiation end but on my take leave the prince say he should be happy to see I whenever i choose to call the prince have the character of be a excellent father and husband and seem entirely and almost exclusively devote to he family he have a remarkably fine collection of picture and statue in he house at rome i have a opportunity likewise of see the ex-king of holland loui napoleon who seem to be a most excellent and amiable man and in fact everybody agree in speaking of he with eulogy with regard to the present pontiff pius vii from the excellence of he private character and virtue and from he unassuming manners and goodness of heart there be but one opinion respect he even those who do not like the ecclesiastical government and behold in it the degradation of italy render justice to the good quality of pius vii he always display the greatest moderation and humanity in prosperity and in adversity he be firm and dignified in he moral and habit he be quite a primitive christian and if he do not possess that great political talent which have distinguish some of he predecessor he have be particularly fortunate and discriminate in the choice of he minister in whom be unite ability firmness suavity of manner and unimpeachable character i think i have thus give a faithful delineation of cardinal consalvus rome march 12th i have make a very valuable acquaintance in m k -lrb- ölle -rrb- -lrb- 113 -rrb- the envoy of the king of würtemberg to the holy see he be a enthusiastic admirer of he countryman the poet schiller and thro ' he means of procure german book i be enable to prosecute my study in that noble language a italian lady there have hear much of schiller and bürger and not be acquaint with the german language request I to make a italian translation of some of the piece of those poet chus the _ leonora _ of bürger as one and leave to myself the choice of one from schiller i represent the extreme difficulty of the task but as she have read a sonnet of mine on lord guildford 's project of establish a university in the italian language she would not hear of any excuse to work then i set and complete the translation of _ leonora _ together with one of schiller 's _ feast of eleusis _ these and my sonnet be the cause of my be recommend for admission as a member of the academy _ deglus arcadi _ in rome and i receive the pastoral name of _ galeso itaoense _ the carnaval be now over and the lady be all at they _ livre d'heure _ post mass and prayer to the credit side to counterbalance the sin and frailty commit during the carnaval in the account which they keep in the ledger of heaven dancing and masquerade be now over and _ requiem _ and the _ miserere _ the order of the day at the _ conversazionus _ at mr k -lrb- ölle -rrb- 's house i have become acquaint with thorwaldsen the famous danish sculptor who be by many consider as the successful rival of canova but they respective style be so different that a comparison can scarce be make between they canova excels in the soft and graceful in the figure of youthful female and young man thorwaldsen in the grave stern and terrible in a word do i wish to have make a hebe a venus a antinoüs a apollo i should charge canova with they execution do i wish for a ajax a hercule a neptune a jupiter i should give the preference to thorwaldsen in they private character they much resemble each other be both honorable generous unassuming and enthusiastic lover of they profession and of the fine art hi general i have be to see a remarkably fine picture by a modern french artist of the name of granet it may be consider as the _ chef d'oeuvre _ of the perspective or dioramic art this picture represent the ulterior of the convent of the capuchin near the barberinus palace the picture be by no mean a very large one but the optical deception be astonishing you fancy you be stand at the entrance of a long hall and ready to enter it on look at it thro ' a piece of paper roll hi form of a speaking trumpet -- which by hide from the sight the frame of the picture prevent the illusion from be dissipate -- you suppose you could walk into the hall and each figure of a monk therein appear a real human creature see from a long distance so skilfully have the artist dispose he light and shade this picture have excite the admiration of connoisseur as well as other and it be universally proclaim a masterpiece m granet 's house be fill every day with person come to see this picture and many repeat they visit several tune in the week he have receive several order for copy of this picture and i fancy he begin to be tire of eternally copy the same thing for he tell I that he wish that the gentleman who employ he would vary they subject and either chuse some other themselves or let he chuse for they but no such be the effect of vogue and fashion and such the despotic influence they exercise even over the polite art that everybody must have a copy of granet 's picture of the interior of the convent of capuchin _ coûte que coûte _ so that poor granet seem bind to this convent for life except in the interval of he labor he should hit off another subject with equal felicity and this alone may perhaps serve to diminish the universal desire of possess a copy of the convent the original picture be destine for the king of france -lrb- 114 -rrb- i remark in the collection of the work of this artist a small picture represent galileo in prison and a monk descend the step of the dungeon bring he he scanty meal a lamp hang suspend from the roof in the center of the dungeon and the artist have make a very happy hit in throw the whole glare of the lamp on the countenance of galileo who be seat read a book while the gaoler monk be leave completely in the shade on see this i exclaimed : _ veramente signor granet e buonissimo quel vostro concetto _ easter Tuesday i have at length see all the fine sight that rome afford during the holy week and have witness most of the religious ceremony viz the illuminate cross hi st peter 's on good Friday the high mass celebrate by the pope in person on easter Sunday the papal benediction from a window of the church above the façade on the same day the illumination of the façade of st peter 's on easter Monday and the _ girandolum _ or grand firework at the castle of st angelo on the same evening the ceremony of the pope wash the foot of twelve poor man i do not see for i could not get into the sistine chapel where the ceremony be perform : and at the mass perform by the pope in the sistine chapel i do contrive to enter but be so oppressed by the crowd and heat that i almost faint away and be very glad to get out of the chapel again before the ceremony commence why in the name of commonsense do they perform these ceremony in the sistine chapel which be small instead of do they in the church of st peter 's which would contain so many people and produce a much grander effect a great many people be deprive of see the ceremony in the sistine chapel from the difficulty of get in the pope 's swiss guard attend on that day in they ancient _ costume _ with helmet cuirass and halberd these guard the entrance of the staircase lead to the chapel and they have no small trouble and difficulty in maintain order as there be always a great scuffle to get in and they be particularly importune by german visitor who think to be favor by they in speak to they in they own language vociferate _ ich bin ihr landsmann _ and hope by this to obtain a preference on Friday evening a large cross be erect before the grand altar every part of this cross be fill with lamp and at seven in the evening the whole be illuminate it have a most brilliant appearance and give the happiest _ chiaro-oscuro _ effect to the statue column and pilaster which abound in this vast temple there be no other light on this occasion than that reflect from the cross on easter Sunday when the pope celebrate high mass in the church of st peter 's the papal noble guard compose of young man from the principal family in rome form a hedge on each side of the nave of the church from the entrance of the facade to the grand altar the street or interval form between this double line may be about thirty foot broad and behind this guard or in any other part of the church the spectator may stand but as these guard wear very large feather in they hat they intercept very much the sight of those who stand behind they the uniform of the papal noble guard be very splendid be a scarlet coat cover with gold lace white feather white breeches and long military boot the approach of the pope be announce by the thunder of cannon and he be bring into the church dress in full pontificals with the triple crown on he head on a chair bear by man _ palanquin _ fashion he be conduct thro ' the lane form by the papal guard and as he pass he make the sign of the cross several time with he finger repeat the word : _ urbus et orbi _ he be then set down with he face front the baldachin when he immediately take off the tiara and begin the ceremony that end he leave the church in the same state and then ascend the staircase in order to prepare to give the benediction which be usually give from a window above the facade of the church the pope be there seat on a chair with the triple crown on he head troops of cavalry and infantry be draw up in a semi-circle before the façade of the church and the whole vast _ arena _ of the _ piazza di san pietro _ be cover with spectator on a sudden he holiness rise extend he hand towards heaven then spread they open and seem as if he scatter something he hold in they on the crowd below a silly young frenchman who be stand next to I say : _ le voilà le voilà qui arrache la bénédiction au ciel et qui la répand sur tout le monde _ i could not refrain from laugh at this sally tho ' i be much impressed with the solemnity of the scene which i think one of the grandest and most sublime i ever behold this ceremony conclude salve of ordnance be fire the pope retire amidst cloud of smoke and seem to vanish from the earth the troops then fire a _ feu de joie _ and move off play a march in quick time and the company disperse it be the étiquette on these occasion that no person be admit either into the church of st peter or into the sistine chapel except in full toilette the lady dress generally in black with cap and feather the gentleman either in black full dress or in military uniform from the variety of foreigner of all nation that be here most of whom be military man or intitle to wear military uniform much be add to the splendor of the spectacle on the evening of easter Monday i be present at the illumination of the facade of st peter 's row of lamp be suspend the whole length of the column and pilaster and all over the cupola so that when illuminate the style of the architecture be perceptible the illumination take place almost at once how it be manage i can not say but a splendid illuminated temple seem at once to drop from the cloud like the work of a enchanter i say _ drop from the cloud _ because the illumination begin from the cross and cupola and be communicate with the rapidity of lightning to every other part of the edifice about ten o'clock the same evening the most magnificent firework perhaps in the world begin to play from the castle of st angelo all kind of shape be assume by these firework : here be castle pagoda dragon griffin etc these last about a hour and then conclude and with they conclude all the ceremony use in commemoration of the crucifixion and resurrection of jesus christ among the sight of rome i must not omit that of a famous robber of the name of barbone who be the terror of the whole surrounding country from the depredation he commit have capitulate and surrender himself to the papal government he be now confine in the castle of st angelo as a state prisoner he wife or a woman call herself so be confine there with he and she be say to be a woman of uncommon beauty it be quite the rage among the english here to go to see these _ illustrious _ captive and madame barbone superbly dress receive the hommage of the visitor the duchess of d -lrb- evonshire -rrb- be say to have visit she and make she a present of a pearl necklace i hope this be not true surely the duchess who be a woman of talent and a encourager of the fine art might have find some other object worthier of she munificence what claim the mistress or even the wife of a public robber can have on the generosity of traveller i be at a loss to conceive but such be the _ bizarrerie _ and _ inconsequence _ of the english and no doubt be this story of she grace of d -lrb- evonshire -rrb- have give a present true or not it will occasion many other present be make to the captive princess by a host of silly lord-aping english man and woman barbone have it be say make a excellent capitulation he have stipulate to be release from prison after a year and a day 's confinement and no doubt he will then resume he old trade of brigandage in the meantime he have disband he troops as he call they but will he troops obey he now that he be a captive will they not rather chuse another leader in the time of the french occupation nothing of this kind take place but the present government be weak and timid i have not be myself to see either barbone or he wife but i have hear quite enough about they they form one of the principal sight in rome and i be quite _ unfashionable _ in not have go to visit they for accord to the opinion of my english acquaintance he who have not see barbone and he wife have see nothing \* \* \* \* \* i start from rome on the second of April with a _ vetturino _ and on arrival at baccano we strike off into a road on the right hand and arrive at cività castellana at a late hour cività castellana merit no further attention except that it be suppose to stand on the site of the ancient city of veii the follow day at ten o'clock we reach the small town of narnus here be the remains of a beautiful bridge construct over the ravine thro ' which flow the river nera and which be build in the time of augustus it afford a very favorable specimen of the roman bridge architecture there be a small chapel here and it contain engrave on a stone a description of a miracle work here about four year ago by the virgin mary who save the life of a postillion he go into the river to water he horse when he be carry off by the torrent and would have be drown have not the virgin on she aid be invoke dash into the river and hale he out by the hair of he head of this story to use a phrase of old josephus -lrb- 115 -rrb- every one may believe as much as he think proper but certain it be that the postillion make oath -lrb- which oath be register -rrb- that he life be save by the virgin mary in this manner and he have put up a votive tablet at she shrine which remain to this day commemorative of the event there be also a roman aqueduct in the neighborhood eleven italian mile in length we arrive at ternus at three o'clock and immediately hire a _ calèche _ -lrb- the other traveller and myself -rrb- to visit the famous cascade of the velino about three mile distant from the town of ternus the road thither be very rugged and be a continual ascent on the flank of a ravine

verona again -- from verona to innspruck it be the custom for most traveller go to genoa to embark on board of a _ felucca _ at spezium which lie on the sea coast not far from sarzana : but i prefer to go by land and i can not conceive why anyone should expose himself to the risk inconvenience and delay of a sea passage when it be so easy to go by land thro ' the appennine i start accordingly the follow morning mount on a mule and attend by a muleteer with another mule to convey my portmanteau i find this journey neither dangerous nor difficult but on the contrary agreeable and romantic the road be only a bridle road i pay forty-eight frank for my two mule and driver and start at seven in the morning from sarzana the wild appearance of the appennine the aweful solitude and the highly picturesque point of view that present themselves at the various sinuosity of the mountain and valley the view of the sea from the height that tower above the town of oneglium and sestrus levante render this journey one of the most interesting i have ever make i stop to dine at borghetto and bring to the night at sestrus levante breakfast the next morning at rapallo and arrive the same evening at four o'clock in genoa borghetto be a little insignificant town situate in a narrow valley surround on all side by the lofty crag of the appennine sestri levante be a long and very straggling town part of it be situate on the sea shore and the other part on the gorge of the mountain descend towards the sea beach so that the former part of the town lie nearly at right angle with the latter with a considerable space intervene the road for the last four mile between borghetto and sestrus levante be a continual descent the inn be very comfortable and good at sestri levante the beginning of the road between sestrus and rapallo be on the beach till near rapallo when it strike again into the mountain and be of considerable ascent rapallo be a very neat pretty place situate on a eminence command a fine view of the sea the greater part of the road between rapallo and genoa be on the sea-coast but cut along the mountain which here form a bluff with the sea villa garden and vineyard line the whole of this route and nothing can be more beautiful the neatness of the villa and the abundance of the population form a striking contrast to the wild solitude between sarzana and sesto where -lrb- except at borghetto -rrb- there be not a house to be see and scarce a human creature to be meet and where the eagle seem to reign alone the uncontrolled lord of the creation genoa 23rd April the view of genoa from the sea be indisputably the best for on enter by land from the eastern side the rampart be so lofty as to intercept the fine view the city would otherwise afford from the sea side it rise in the shape of a amphitheatre a view therefore take from the sea give the best idea of its grandeur and of the magnificence of its building for everybody on behold this grand spectacle must allow that this city well deserve its epithet of _ superba _ i observe in my daily walk on the _ esplanade _ a number of beautiful woman the genoese woman be remarkable for they beauty and fine complexion they dress generally in white and they style of dress be spanish they wear the _ mezzara _ or veil in the management of which they display much grace and not a little coquetry instead of the fan exercise recommend to woman by the _ spectator _ the art of handle the _ mezzara _ might be reduce to a manual and teach to the lady by word of command i put up at the house of a spanish lady on the _ piazza st siro _ and here for four _ livre _ a day i be sumptuously board and lodge there be three principal street in genoa viz _ strada nuova _ _ balbus _ and _ nuovissima _ yet these three street may be properly say to form but one inasmuch as they lie very nearly in a right line these street be broad and align with the finest building in genoa this street or street be the only one that can be properly call so accord to the idea we usually attach to the word the other deserve rather the name of lane and alley tho ' exceedingly well paved and align with excellent house and shop in fact the street _ nuova _ _ nuovissima _ and _ balbus _ be the only one thro ' which carriage can pass the other be far too narrow to admit of the passage of carriage the house on each side of they be of immense height being of six or seven story which form such a shade as effectually to protect those who walk thro ' these alley from the ray of the sun the house diminish in height in proportion as they be build on the slant of the mountain from the bottom to the top those at the bottom be the loftiest carriage be scarcely of any use in the city of genoa except to drive from one end of the town to another thro ' the street _ nuova _ _ balbus _ and _ nuovissima _ and accordingly a carriage with four wheel or even with two be a rare conveyance in genoa the general mode of conveyance be on a sedan chair carry by porter or on the back of mule or ass genoa be distinguish by the beauty of the palace of its patrician which be more numerous and more magnificent than those of any other city probably in the world the ducal palace or palace of government where the doge use to reside claim my first attention yet tho ' much larger it be far less splendid than many of the palace of individual patrician in fact the ducal palace be build in the gothic taste and resemble a gothic fortress have round tower at each angle the hall where the grand council use to sit be superb and be adorn with column of _ jaune antique _ on the _ plafond _ be a painting represent the discovery of america by columbus for the genoese duly appreciate and never can forget they illustrious countryman the line of tasso _ un uom della liguria avrà ardimento _ etc and the follow stanza _ tu spiegherai colombo a urn nuovo polo _ etc be in the mouth of everyone -lrb- 117 -rrb- the hall of the petty council be neat but it be the recollection of the history of this once famous republic that render the examination of this palace so interesting but now genoa 's glory be go she have be basely betray into the hand of a government she most detest the king of sardinium be nowhere and he be not a little proud of be the possessor of such a noble sea port which enable he to rank as a maritime power the genoese be laborious and make excellent sailor but now there be nothing to animate they and they will never exert themselves in the service of a domination which be so little congenial to they they sigh for they ancient government of whose glory they have so often hear and whose brilliant exploit have be hand down to the present day not merely by historical writer and poet but by _ improvisatorus _ from mouth to mouth the genoese noble those merchant king whose riches exceed at one time those of the most powerful monarch of europe who be the pawn-broker to those sovereign be now in a state of decay commerce can only flourish on the soil of liberty and take wing at the sight of military and sacerdotal chain and tho ' the present sovereign affect to caress the genoese _ noblesse _ they return he civility with sullen indifference and half conceal contempt and aversion the commerce of genoa be transfer to leghorn which increase in prosperity as the former decay the climate of genoa be say to be exceedingly mild during the winter be protect on the north by the appennine which tower above it to a immense height beautiful villa and grounds tastefully lay out in plantation of orange tree pomegranate etc abound in the environs of this city and everything announce the extreme industry of the inhabitant for the soil be proverbially barren this shew what they have do and what they could still do be they free but now they have nothing to animate they exertion the public promenade be on the bastion and curtain of the fortification on the _ esplanade _ and in the street _ balbus _ _ nuova _ and _ nuovissima _ there be also another very delightful promenade tho ' not much use by the lady viz on the molum or pier envelop the harbor one of the most remarkable construction in genoa be the bridge of carignano which be build over a immense ravine and unite the hill fengano and carignano it be so high that house of six story stand under its arch in the valley below no water except in time of flood run under this bridge and it much resemble tho ' somewhat larger the bridge at edinburgh which unite the old and new town the principal church be : first the cathedral which be not far from the ducal palace it be richly ornamented and incrust with black marble the church of the annunzia and that of st sire they be all in the gothic style of architecture and load with that variety of ornament and diversity of beautiful marble which distinguish the church of italy from those of any other country near the bridge of carignano be a church of the same name wherein be four marble colossal statue on the west of the city and run two mile along the sea-beach be the _ faubourg _ of st pietro d'arena which present a front of well build house the whole way these house be principally use as magazine and store house florence 5 may i leave genoa on the 30th April return on mule-back from genoa to sarzana stop the first night at sestrus the second evening when near sarzana it be very dark i somehow or other get out of the road and my mule fall with I into a very deep ditch but i be only slightly bruise by the fall my clothes however be cover with dirt and wet the road from genoa to sarzana might with very little expense be make fit for carriage by widen it at present it be only a bridle road and on some part of it on the side of ravine it be i think a little ticklish to trust entirely to the discretion of one 's _ monture _ at least i think so and dismount twice to pass such place on foot a wind stream be to be ford in two or three place but it be not deep except after rain and then i think it must be sometimes dangerous to pass till the water run off those who be fond of mountain scenery will like myself be highly gratify in make this journey for it be thro ' the loftiest wildest and most romantic part of the appennine from sarzana i hire a cabriolet to return to pisa and from thence i take the diligence to florence ferrara on the 9th of may i set out from florence on my journey hither two day ' journey bring I to bologna where i stop one day and the follow day i reach this place -lrb- ferrara -rrb- six mile distant from bologna the country between these two city be a perfect plain and very fertile at malalbergo -lrb- half-way -rrb- we cross the reno in a boat i put up at the _ tre morus _ in ferrara have remain two and half day here i have have time to inspect and examine almost everything of consequence that the city afford the city itself have a impose venerable appearance and can boast of some fine building yet with all this there be a air of melancholy about it it be not people in proportion to its size and grass be see grow in several of the street i believe the unhealthiness of the environ country be the cause of the decrease of population for ferrara lie on a marshy plain very liable to inundation in the center of the city stand the ancient palace of the duke of ferrara a vast gothic edifice square and flank with round tower and a large court-yard in the center it be in this court-yard that hugo and parisina be decapitate from the top of this palace a noble view of the plain of the po represent itself and you see the meanderings of that king of river as the italian poet term it as the po run thro ' a perfectly flat country and be encrease and swollen by the torrent from the alp and appennine that fall into the smaller river which unite they tributary stream with the po and accompany he as he _ seguacus _ to the adriatic this country be liable to the most dreadful inundation : flock and herd farm-house and sometimes whole village be sweep away dyke dam and canal innumerable be in consequence construct throughout this part of the country to preserve it as much as possible from such calamity ariosto 's description of a over-flowing of this river be very striking and i here transcribe it : con quel furor che il re de ' fiumi altero quando rompe tal volta argine e sponda e che ne ' campi ocnei si apre il sentiero e i grassi solchi e le biade feconde e con le sue capanne il gregge intero e co ' cani i pastor porta neil ' onde etc -lrb- 118 -rrb- even with that rage wherewith the stream that reign the king of river -- when he break he mound and make himself a way through mantuan plain -- the greasy furrow and glad harvest round and with the sheepcote nock and dog and swain bear off in he o'erwhelm water drown -- trans w rise the next place i go to see be the lyceum or university where there be a very fair cabinet of natural history in all its branch the library be very remarkable and possess a great number of valuable manuscript but my principal object in visit this museum be to see the monument erect in honor of ariosto which have be transfer here from the benedictine church the inkstand and chair of this illustrious bard be carefully preserved and exhibit they exactly resemble the print of they that accompany the first edition of hoole 's translation of the _ orlando furioso _ among the manuscript what gratify I most be the manuscript of the _ gerusalemme libera _ of tasso but few correction appear in this manuscript tho from the extreme polish and harmony of the versification one would expect a great many it be write in a extremely legible hand i also inspect the original manuscript of the _ pastor fido _ of guarinus and of the _ suppositus _ of ariosto i then go to visit the hospital of st anna for the sake of see the dungeon where poor tasso be confine and treat as mad for several year when one behold this wretched place where a man can scarce stand upright one only wonder how he could survive such treatment or how he could escape become insane altogether the old wooden door of this cell will soon be entirely cut away by amateur as almost everyone who visit the dungeon chop off a piece of wood from the door to keep as a relic the door be in consequence piece and repair with new wood and in a short time will be in the state of sir john cutter 's worsted stocking which be darned so often with silk that they become finally all silk ferrara have a strong citadel which be still garrison by austrian troops and they will probably not easily be induce to evacuate it the austrian eagle seldom loose he hold venice 18th may on the 16th may at six o'clock in the morning i leave ferrara in a _ cabriolet _ to go to the _ ponte di lago oscuro _ which be a large village on the south bank of the po three mile distant from ferrara a fly bridge waft I across the river which be exceedingly broad and rapid to the north bank where a barge be in wait to receive passenger for venice this barge be well fit up and supply with _ comestible _ of all sort and couch to recline on the price be twelve franc for the passage and you pay extra for refreshment the bark get under weigh at seven o'clock and descend rapidly this majestic river which however from its great breadth and from the country on each side of it be perfectly flat do not offer any interesting point of view plain and cattle grazing thereon be the only object for they take care to build the farm and house at a considerable distance from the bank on account of the inundation after have descend the po for a considerable distance we enter a canal which unite the po with the adige we then descend the adige for a short distance and enter another canal which unite the adige with the brenta here we stop to change barge and it require a hour and half to unload and reload the baggage we then enter the brenta and from thence into the lagoon and pass by the island of malamocco and chiozzo enter venice by the _ canale grande _ at three o'clock in the morning the whole night be so dark as totally to deprive we of the view of the approach of venice the barge anchor near the post office and i hire a gondola to convey I to the inn call _ le regina d'ungherium _ venice 26th may i be much strike as everyone must be who see it for the first time at the singular appearance of venice a immense city in the midst of the ocean five mile distant from any land canal instead of street gondola in lieu of carriage and horse yet it must not be infer from this that you be necessarily oblige to use a gondola in order to visit the various part of the city for its structure be as follow it be build in compartment on pile on various mud bank always cover indeed by water but very shallow and separate from each other -lrb- the mud bank i mean -rrb- by deep water on each of these compartment be build row of house each row give front to a canal the space between the back of the row of house form a narrow street or alley pave with flag stone very like cranborn alley for instance and these compartment be unite to each other -lrb- at the crossing as we should say -rrb- by means of stone bridge so that there be a series of alley connect by a series of bridge which form the _ tout ensemble _ of this city and you may thus go on foot thro ' every part of it to go on horseback would be dangerous and almost impracticable for each bridge have a flight of step for ascent and descent all this form such a perfect labyrinth from the multiplicity and similarity of the alley and bridge that it be impossible for any stranger to find he way without a guide i lose my way regularly every time that i go from my inn to the _ piazza di san marco _ which form the general rendezvous of the promenader and be the fashionable lounge of venice and every time i be oblige to hire a boy to reconduct I to my inn on this account in order to avoid this perplexity and the expence of hire a gondola every time i wish to go to the _ piazza di san marco _ i remove to another inn close to it call _ l'osterium della luna _ which stand on the bank of the _ canale grande _ and be not twenty yard from the _ piazza _ i then hire a gondola for four day successively and visit every canal and every part of the city almost every family of respectability keep a gondola which be anchor at the step of the front door of the house after the _ piazza di san marco _ of which i shall speak presently the finest building and palace of the nobility be on the bank of the _ canale grande _ which from its wind in the shape of a s have all the appearance of a river the _ rialto _ be the only bridge which connect the opposite bank of the _ canale grande _ but there be four hundred smaller bridge in venice to connect the other canal the _ rialto _ the resort of the money changer and jew be a very singular and picturesque construction being of one arch a very bold one on each side of this bridge be a range of jeweller ' shop a narrow quaus run along the bank of the _ canale grande _ i have visit several of the _ palazzo _ particularly those of the family morosinus cornaro pisanus grimanus which be very rich in marble of _ vert _ and _ jaune antique _ but they be now nearly strip of all they furniture uninhabited by they owner or let to individual mostly shopkeeper for since the extinction of the venetian republic almost all the nobility have retire to they estate on the _ terra firma _ or to they villa on the bank of the brenta so that venice be now inhabit chiefly by merchant shopkeeper chiefly jeweller and silk mercer seafaring people the constitute authority and the garrison of the place tho ' venice have fall very much into decay since the subversion of the republic as might naturally be expect and still more so since it have be under the austrian domination yet it be still a place of great wealth particularly in jewellery silk and all article of dress and luxury in the _ mercerium _ you may see as much wealth display as in cheapside or in the rue st honoré i have have the pleasure of witness a superb regatta or water _ féte _ give in honor of the visit of the archduke rainier to this city in he quality of viceroy of the lombardo-venetian kingdom there be about one hundred and fifty barge each fit up by some department of trade and commerce with allegorical device and statue richly ornamented emblematical of the trade or profession to which the barge belong each barge bear a appropriate ensign and the dress of the crew be all tasteful and thoroughly analogous to the profession they represent these barge be richly gilded and from the variety of the costume and streamer i think it one of the most beautiful sight i ever behold here be the banker ' barge the jeweller ' the mercer ' the tailor ' the shoe-maker ' and to crown all the printer ' barge which shower down from the masthead sonnet in honor of the _ féte _ print on board of the barge itself every trade or profession in short have a barge and appropriate flag and costume a quantity of private barge and gondola follow this procession the archduke and he staff occupy the government barge which be very magnificent and make in imitation of the bucentaur musician be on board of many of the barge and the house on both bank of the _ canale grande _ be fill with beautiful woman and other spectator wave they handkerchief gun be fire on the embarkation of the viceroy from the _ piazzetta di san marco _ and on he return the _ piazza _ itself be splendidly illuminate and the _ cafés _ which abound there and which constitute one half of the whole quadrangle be superbly and tastefully decorate the _ piazza di san marco _ be certainly the most beautiful thing of the kind in the world it be a good deal in the style of the _ palai royal _ at pari and tho ' not so large be far more striking from the very tasteful and even sumptuous manner in which the _ cafés _ be fit up both internally and externally they have spacious room with mirror on all side some in the shape of turkish tent other in that of egyptian temple the _ piazza _ form a oblong rectangle be arcade on the two long side and of the two short one one present a superb modern palace build by napoleon and richly adorn with the statue of all the heathen god on the top which palace be usually occupy by eugene napoléon the other present the church of st marco and the old palace of government where in the time of the republic the doge use to reside the church of st mark be unique as a temple in europe for it be neither grecian nor gothic but in a style completely oriental from the singularity of its structure its many gilded cupola and the variety of its exterior ornament at _ first sight _ it appear a more striking object than either st peter 's in rome or st paul 's in london on the top of the façade which be singularly picturesque stand the four bronze horse which have be bring back from pari to they old residence i ascend the top of the façade in order to examine they they be beautifully form in very good cast and have not at all be damage by the journey the _ piazza _ be pave with broad flagged stone the doge 's palace be a vast building very picturesque withal and seem a _ mélange _ of gothic and moorish architecture at right angle to it and face the _ piazzetta _ which issue from the _ piazza _ and form a quaus to the _ canale grande _ stand the famous state prison and _ ponte de ` sospirus _ on the _ piazzetta _ and front the landing place stand two column of white marble on one of which stand the winged lion of st marco and on the other a crocodile emblematical of the foreign commerce and possession of the republic the space between these two column be allot for the execution of state criminal not far from the church of st marco and near to that angle of the _ piazza _ which connect it with the _ piazzetta _ stand the famous _ campanile _ or steeple of san marco it be a square building 800 foot in height from the top of which one have the best view of venice and its adjacent isle the distant alp and the _ marina dive il po discende _ a quaus if quaus it may be call which have a row of house on each side one row of which be on the water 's edge lead from the _ piazzetta _ to some garden which terminate on a point of land this quaus be very broad and well paved and be the only thing that can be call a street in all venice the _ piazza di san marco _ therefore this quaus and the garden before mention form the only promenade in venice this garden moreover have tree and these be the only tree that be to be meet with in this city in this garden be two _ cafés _ the variety of costume be another very agreeable spectacle at venice here you meet with albanian greek turk moor sclavonian and armenian all in they respective national costume the first armenian i meet with here be sit on a stone bench on the _ piazza di san marco _ and this bring forcibly to my recollection the armenian in schiller 's _ ghost-seer _ these _ cafés _ and _ casino _ on the _ piazza _ be open day and night ice and coffee superiorly make and other refreshment of all kind at very low price be to be have some of these _ casino _ be devote to gaming the first family in venice repair to the _ piazza _ in the evening after the opera female as well as male they promenade up and down the _ piazza _ or sit down and converse in the _ cafés _ and _ casino _ till a late hour few go to bed in venice in the summer time before six in the morning so that sleep seem for ever banish from the _ piazza _ music and singing go forward in these _ casino _ and the ear be often charm with the sound of those delightful venetian air whose simple melody ravish the soul the venetian dialect be very please and scarcely yield in harmony to the tuscan it contain a great many sclavonic word it be the only dialect of italy that be at all please to my ear for i do not at all relish the nasal twang and truncate termination of the piedmontese and lombard dialect nor the semi-barbarous jargon of the genoese and the neapolitan and least of all the execrable cacophony of the bolognese i visit of course the arsenal and the doge 's palace the apartment in the latter be very spacious and ornamented in the gothic taste of grandeur the chamber of the council be peculiarly magnificent there be a good deal of tapestry and some fine painting and statue : among the former i particularly notice a allegorical picture represent the triumph of venice over the league of cambray venice be represent by the winged lion and the power of the coalition be pourtray by various other beast among the latter be a beautiful group in marble represent ganymede and the eagle the terror depict in the countenance of the beautiful boy and the passion that seem to agitate the eagle be surprizingly well pourtray the principal theater at venice the _ teatro fenice _ be not open but i have visit the other theater and among other thing witness the representation of a new opera call would _ il lupo d'ostende _ the piece itself be rather interesting but the music be feeble and do not seem to give general satisfaction the singing be in general very good at venice but in scenery dress and decoration the theater here be far inferior to those of milan and naple i find the air of venice very hot and unpleasant arise from the exhalation from the canal and it appear to I as if i be on board of a enormous ship i begin to pant for _ terra firma _ and green field i have visit in a gondola some of the island viz malamocco and st lazare where there be a convent of armenian monk why be the gondola hang with black it give to they such a dismal funereal appearance they always resemble the body of hearse place on boat i be not fond of gaudy color in general yet i do think a gondola should have a somewhat livelier color than black padua 8th June padua be not above ten mile distant from fusina as i start from venice at six in the morning i have a fine recede view of the ocean queen with she steeple and turret rise from the sea venice have no fortification and need they not she insular position protect she from land attack and the shoal prevent the approach of ship of war float battery therefore and gunboat be she best defense the road from fusina to padua be on the bank of the brenta the whole way and be line with tree there be a great number of villa on the bank of the brenta well build in the best style of architecture the most of they after the design of palladio the prince of modern architect padua be a exceedingly large city : but its arcade and the narrowness of the street give it a gloomy appearance there be however some beautiful promenade in the suburb there be also the remains of a ancient arena padua be famous for its seminario or university which be a superb edifice the church of st anthony of padua be of vast size have six cupola there be four organ in this church in the chapel of the saint himself be a great many ornament among which be a crucifix in bronze and fresque represent the different action and miracle of this patron saint of the padovanus probably as this city be found by the trojan antenor they have transform he name into that of a christian saint and call he st anthony just as virgil have be transform into a magician at naple there be a fine view from the steeple of this immense edifice there be another magnificent church also in this city that of st justine build after the design of palladio the principal ornament of which be a painting of the martyrdom of the saint by paul veronese but one of the greatest curiosity in this ancient city be the immense saloon in the _ palazzo della giustizia _ it be i presume the loftiest and largest hall in the world that be support by nothing but its wall it be three hundred foot long one hundred foot broad and one hundred foot high in the saloon be the tomb of livy the historian who be a native of padua the inhabitant of padua dress much in black seem a quiet staid sort of people and be very industrious i put up at the _ stellum d'oro _ a good inn vicenza 10th June i arrive at this beautiful _ bijou _ of a town on the morning of the 9th June at eight o'clock i call it a _ bijou _ from its exceed neatness and the extreme beauty of the architecture of its edifice which be almost all after the design of palladio of white stone and in the greek taste palladio be a native of vicenza the _ piazza _ and _ palazzo pubblico _ perfectly correspond with the beauty of the rest of the city and the promenade about it be tastefully lay out but the two most striking object in point of edifice in vicenza and both construct by palladio be the covered portico and the _ teatro olimpico _ the covered portico be two mile in length and lead to the chapel of the _ madonna del monte _ situate on a eminence at that distance from the city a magnificent triumphal arch stand before it and there be a extensive view of the surrounding country the _ teatro olimpico _ be a small but beautiful theater build strictly after the model of the ancient greek theater it be peculiarly precious as be the only one of the kind in europe how admirably adapt both for see and hear be such theater it have for scenery the model of a palacé curiously carve in wood which represent a royal palace for the ancient never shift they scene and this may account for they adhering so strictly to the unity statue and bas-relief adorn this beautiful little theater many year ago on particular occasion it be the custom to act play here either translate from the greek or take strictly from the greek model this theater be esteem palladio 's _ chef d'oeuvre _ the _ campo di marie _ be a vast _ place _ outside the town the place and its gate be well worth inspect so be the famous villa with the rotonda belong to the marchese di capra the original after which the villa belong to the duke of

12th June i start yesterday morning from vicenza and arrive here in about three hour the distance be nearly the same as between vicenza and padua we cross the adige which divide the city into two unequal part and drive to the _ due torrus _ a large and comfortable inn with excellent room and accommodation verona be a very handsome city for here also palladio be the designer or builder of many edifice it have a very cheerful and gay appearance tho ' not quite so much so as vicenza the reason of this difference be that in verona the greater part of the building be in the gothic style which always appear heavy and melancholy whereas in vicenza all be grecian the amphitheatre of course claim my first notice it yield only to the coliseum in size and grandeur and be in much better preservation the whole of the ellipse and its wall be entire whereas in the coliseum part of the wall have be pull down indeed the amphitheatre of verona may be say to be almost perfectly entire _ tempus edax rerum _ have be its only enemy whereas avarice and religious fanaticism have contribute much more than time to the dilapidation of the coliseum the amphitheatre of verona can contain 24000 person in it be construct a temporary theater of wood where they perform play and farce in the open air verona be much embellish by several _ palazzo _ build by palladio which form a curious contrast with the other building and church which be in the gothic style verona can boast among its antiquity of three triumphal arch the first _ porta de ' bursari _ erect in the year 252 in the reign of the emperor gallienus the second call _ porta del foro _ and the third build by vitruvius himself in honor of the family gavium the church here be richly ornamented and the _ palazzo del consiglio _ have

pretty woman in they the theater be by palladio be exquisitely beautiful and very tastefully fit up i assist at the representation of _ la gazza ladra _ one of rossinus 's best opera i should think verona would be a very delightful séjour everything be very cheap a fine country highly cultivate a remarkably healthy climate a society which unite much urbanity and a love of amusement with a taste for the fine art and for the graver science and a general appearance of opulence and comfort the shop in verona appear very splendid and the _ bra _ when light up in the evening be a very lively and animating scene mantua 15 June i could not go to milan without step a little out of my road to visit this ancient and redoubtable fortress so celebrated in the early campaign of buonaparte besides the other claim it have on the traveller 's attention as the birth place of virgil this place be of immense strength as a military post be situate on a small isthmus of land separate two lake and communicate with the rest of the country by a exceed narrow causeway this position add to the strength of the fortification render the fortress impregnable if well garrison and provision the city be however unhealthy from the lake and marshy land about it and there be but a scanty population grass grow in the street and it be the dullest and indeed the only dull town in all italy everything in this city announce decay and melancholy and i meet with several man look full as halfstarved and deplorable as shakespeare 's apothecary in romeo and juliet yet the city be by no mean a ugly one the building be impose the street broad and well paved and there be a fine circular promenade in the center of which be a monument erect in honor of virgil by the french general miolli who have a great veneration for all poet the _ palazzo pubblico _ and the cathedral be the most striking building the latter contain the tomb and monument of the gonzaga family the whilom sovereign of mantua there be also several monument in honor of some french officer who be kill in the campaign of italy under buonaparte and erect to they memory by he direction outside the town at a short distance from the causeway and _ tête de pont _ be the celebrated palace call the t from its be in the form of that letter which be the usual residence of the duke of mantua it be a noble edifice and its garden be well lay out these garden have this peculiarity that at the entrance of each of the grand avenue be a figure of a man on horseback caparizon in armor like the knight of old this be all i have to say about mantua the mincio beset with osier dank flow into the lake cremona 16th June from mantua i direct my course to this city which be large and fortified situate on the po which form many little island in the environs this city be of great antiquity and have a number of gothic building you do not find here the specimen and imitation of grecian architecture as at vicenza and verona the _ campanile _ of the cathedral be of immense height but one be repay for the fatigue of ascend by the extensive view from its summit there be 498 step i put up at the _ colombina _ a very good inn the cremonese seem to be a industrious people there be a great deal of pasture land in the environs of this city and much cheese be make here and in the lodesan several ricefield be also to be meet with between this place and lodus milan 25 June i have be on a visit to the ancient and venerable city of pavium which be about eighteen mile distant from milan thro ' a rich highly cultivate plain the road lie in a right line the whole way about three mile distant from pavium on the milan side stand the celebrated _ certosa _ which we stop to visit the church of the _ certosa _ contain the greatest quantity of riches in marble and precious stone of any building in the world probably the architecture be gothic and the workmanship of the exterior exquisite but the ulterior be most dazzling and at the sight of the rich marble and innumerable precious stone of all kind with which it abound i be remind of aladdin and begin to fancy myself in the cavern of the wonderful lamp this church be build by galeazzo viscontus whose coffin be here and he statue also in white marble there be several bas-relief of exquisite workmanship there be no fewer than seventeen altar here and of the most beautiful structure you can conceive be inlay in mosaic with jasper onyx and lapis-lazuli besides these precious marble of every color and quantity under heaven here be abundance of ruby emerald amethyst aquamarine and topaze incrust in the different chapel and altar here again be a proof of the falsehood and injustice of the aspersion cast on the french army as be the plunderer of church for if they be so how come it that the _ certosa _ the richest of all be spare mr eustace -lrb- 119 -rrb- in he admiration of church splendor should at least have give the french no small degree of credit for they abstinence from so rich a prize a canal run parallel to the road the whole way from milan to pavia where it join the tessino the bank of the canal and each side of the road be line with poplar pavium be one of the most ancient city in italy and have something very antique and solemn in its appearance it be quite gothic and be the capital city of the lombard king the street be broad and the _ piazza _ be large i could not find any trace of the ancient palace of the lombard king which i should like much to have do for then i should have endeavor to make out the chamber into which jocondo peep and discover what cure he of he melancholy and where the impatient queen receive the petulant answer from she beloved nano convey by one of she wait maid who tell she : e per non stare in perdita d'un soldo a vous nega venire fl manigoldo -lrb- 120 -rrb- nor lest he lose a doit he paltry stake will that discourteous churl he game forsake -- _ trans _ w rise milan 28th June i have be to the _ scalum _ theater to see the _ ballet of the vestal _ one of the most interesting ballet i ever behold oh what a mighty magician be the ballet master vigano and as for the prima ballerina pallerinus what praise can equal she merit then the delightful soul soothing music so harmonious so pathetic and the decoration so truly tasteful and classical i can never forget the impression this fascinating ballet make on I it be call _ la vestale _ it open with a view of the circus in ancient rome and various gymnastic exercise combat of gladiator of athlete and end with a chariot race with real horse the roman consul be present in all they pomp surround by lictor with axis and fasce the vestal virgin assist at this spectacle and from one of they the victor in the game receive a garland as the recompense of he prowess the victor be the son of one of the consul and the hero of the piece the heroine be the vestal virgin who crown he with the garland the young victor become desperately enamor of the vestale and she appear also to feel a incipient flame after the game be over the victor return to he father 's house and meeting there one of he friend disclose to he he love for the vestale and he idea of enter by stealth into the temple of vesta where he beloved be appoint to watch the sacred fire he friend endeavor but in vain to dissuade he from so rash a attempt which can only end in the destruction both of he beloved and himself all the remonstrance however of the friend be vain and the hero fix in he resolve watch for the opportunity when it be the turn of he beloved to officiate in the temple of vesta and enter therein the vestale be terrify and supplicate he to retire : in vain and after a long but ineffectual struggle she sink into he arm at the foot of the altar suddenly the sacred flame become extinguish a noise be hear the vestal enter the unfortunate fair be rouse from she stupor by the noise of footstep and have just time to oblige she lover to retire which he reluctantly do but not unperceived by the vestal the matron of the vestal reproach she with the crime she have commit and order she to be place in a dungeon she be bring out to be examine by the high priest find guilty and condemn by he to the usual punishment of the vestal for a breach of they vow viz the be bury alive outside the gate of rome the moment the sentence be pronounce a black veil be throw over she the scene then change to the place of execution the funeral procession take place the vault be dig and a man stand by with a pitcher of water and loaf of bread to deliver to she when she should descend the consul be present attend by the lictor and aedile all the other vestal be present of whom the culprit take a affectionate leave and be about to descend into the vault suddenly a noise of arm and shout be hear it be she lover who have collect a few follower come rush forward with arm in they hand to arrest the execution he force he way into the presence of the consul but the sight of he father inspire he with awe he stagger back at this moment a lictor at the command of the other consul plunge a spear into he breast the vestal be hurry to the brink of the vault into which she be force to descend to the accompaniment of mournful music while she die lover vainly endeavor to crawl towards she the curtain fall the exquisite acting of la pallerinus draw tear from my eye : it be indeed too horrible a subject for a _ ballo _ which in my opinion ought to end happily the scenery be the finest of the kind i think i ever witness the first scene represent the _ circus maximus _ the interior of the temple of vesta and the place of execution outside the wall of rome be most classically correct and appropriate : the music be beyond all praise and singularly affect this ballet have excite such a enthusiastic approbation that vigano the ballet master pallerinus who act the vestal and the young man who perform the hero of the piece be summon every evening after the termination of the ballet to appear on the stage and receive applause which seem to increase at every representation i have be to see this ballet six or seven time and always with increase delight i be there on the last night of its representation when some amateur and people connect with the theater put in practice what appear to mean ill-judged _ concetto _ however well merit the compliment it mean to convey when the vestal be about to descend into the vault a genius with wing rise from it and repeat a few line begin _ tu non morraus _ and tell she that the suffrage of the insubrian people have decree to she immortality and print sonnet be shower down on the stage from all part of the house i think it would have be much better to let the piece finish in the usual way and then at its termination call for la pallerinus to advance and receive the garland and hommage so justly she due i be in the _ loge _ belong to my friend mme l ----- there be three or four _ litteratus _ with she and they be all unanimous that it be a absurd and pedantic _ concetto _ in a day or two i shall start from milan for munich thro ' brescium and verona and the tyrol chapter xvi

traveller they be go to pass the summer month at a small _ campagne _ they possess in the tyrol we stop the first night at roveredo the road from verona to roveredo be on the bank of the adige -lrb- call in german the etsch -rrb- in a narrow and deep valley shut up on both side by mountain almost immediately on leave verona we find the weather extremely hot in this valley roveredo seem to be a very neat clean little city and the adige flow with astonishing rapidity along this narrow valley the woman of roveredo have the reputation of be very beautiful and i recollect have see two roveredo girl at venice who be model of female beauty they have a happy mixture of german and italian blood and manners but italian be the language of the country the second morning of we journey we arrive and stop to dinner at the venerable and celebrated city of trent the country we pass thro ' be much the same as that between verona and roveredo the adige be on we left trent lie also in the valley of the

the famous council of trent there be a great many silk mill in trent german as well as italian be speak indeed the two language be equally familiar to most of the inhabitant in the evening we arrive at sabern after pass thro ' lavi one description will serve for these town and indeed for most of the town in the tyrol viz that of be neat clean and solidly build the inn be excellent and the inhabitant very civil the adige run close to the road and parallel to it nearly the whole way to bolsano or botzen where italian cease to be speak and german be the national tongue botzen be a large and flourishing place one general description will serve for the tyrol regard the town adjacent country custom inn inhabitant dress and manners first the town be fully as neat clean and well build as those in switzerland the country too be very similar tho ' not quite on so grand a scale of sublimity but you have fully as much variety in mountain and valley glacier and cascade the climate be exactly the same as that of switzerland be very hot in the valley in summer the inn be clean and good the provision excellent and well cook the wine much better than those of switzerland there be good attendance by female and all at a far cheaper rate than in switzerland the tyrolean be much more courteous in they manners than the swiss they have not that boorishness and be of more elegant figure than they helvetic neighbor the woman of the tyrol be in general remarkably beautiful exceedingly well shaped and of fine complexion in the town the bourgeoise dress well something in the french style and it be they custom to salute traveller who pass by kiss they hand to they the dress of the female peasantry however be unpleasing to the eye and so uncouth that it would make the most beautiful woman appear homely in the first place i will speak of they head dress of which there be three different kind two of which be as _ bizarre _ as can be imagine the first sort be a cap of sheepskin the fleece of which be as white as snow and the cap be of conical shape the base be exceed large in proportion to its height and resemble much the sugar loave make in egypt the second be a black scull cap with the three piece of stiff black _ gaze _ stick out like the vane of a windmill so that when put on the head one vane stand upright from the forehead and the other two from each ear the third head dress be a broad straw hat and i wish they would stick to this coiffure and discard the two other then the waist of they dress be as long as du pole antarctique a détroit de davis -lrb- 121 -rrb- they petticoat be exceedingly short scarcely reach the calf of the leg which be envelop in a pair of flame red stocking who the devil could invent such a ungraceful dress for a female the costume of the man on the contrary be become and graceful it resemble very much the costume of the andalusian the hat be exactly the same the crown be small and the rim very broad the tyrolean be a fine gallant race of man and be excellent marksman they be formerly much attach to the house of austrium but that attachment be now entirely change to dislike from the ingratitude they have meet with since they have be replace under that scepter the only fault i find in the tyrolean be that they be rather too devout and consequently too much under the influence of the clergy yet in they devotion there be not the smallest tinge of hypocrisy and they be esteem a highly moral people if you arrive at a inn in the evening while the family be at prayer neither master nor servant will come to wait on you till prayer be over and then you will be serve with sufficient alacrity but the prayer be rather long i believe the priest extort a good deal of money from these good people the road thro ' the tyrol be make by the roman in the time of septimus severus a immense number of crucifix on the road attest and command the devotion of the people how kotzebue can call innspruck a dirty town i be at a loss to conceive he must have visit it during very rainy weather for to I it appear one of the cleanest and most chearful town i have ever see there be several very fine building for instance the jesuit ' college and the franciscan monastery nothing can be more picturesque than the situation of this city in the valley of the inn and its romantic winding the suburb be very extensive and can boast several fine house the cupola of the government house be gilded which give it a splendid appearance in the _ hofkirche _ or church of the court there be a number of statue large as life in bronze among which my guide point out to I those of clovis godfrey of bouillon albert the wise charle v philip ii of spain rudolph of hapsburgh and to my great astonishment the british king arthur there be twenty-eight statue altogether but on my return to my inn i find that my guide have make a great error respect king arthur and that the say statue represent prince arthur son of henry vii king of england and not the old hero of romance and my hostess ' book further inform I that these statue be those of the king and prince belong to family connect by descent and blood with maximilian i in the same _ hofkirche _ be a fine monument erect to maximilian and a statue of bronze of this emperor be figure kneel between four bronze figure represent four virtue in the garden of the palace of the archduke ferdinand in this city be a fine equestrian statue which rest entirely on the hind foot of the horse from innspruck there be a water passage by the river inn all the way to vienna as the inn flow into the danube at passau the bank of the inn be so romantic and picturesque that i would willingly prolong my _ séjour _ at innspruck but as i mean to take the journey from mittenwald to munich by the river isar i must take advantage of the raft which start from that place the day after to-morrow munich 20th July i leave innspruck in a _ chaise de poste _ on the 16th and arrive the same evening at five o'clock at mittenwald at a short distance before i arrive at mittenwald i enter the bavarian territory which announce itself by a turnpike gate paint white and blue the color and _ feldzeichen _ of bavarium in the austrian territory the barrier be paint black and yellow these be the characteristic color of austrium mittenwald be a small neat town offering nothing remarkable but a church yard or _ ruhe-garten _ -lrb- garden of repose -rrb- as it be call where there be a number of quaint inscription on the tombstone at mittenwald i have some trouble about my passport as it be not _ visé _ by a bavarian authority but i explain to the officer that i have never fall in with any bavarian authority since i leave rome and that while at rome i have no intention of go thro ' bavarium that at milan the austrian authority have _ visé _ my passport for vienna and that i should only pass thro ' munich without make a longer stay than one week he acquiesce in my argument but insert my explanation on the passport at half a quarter of a mile beyond mittenwald i meet the raft just about to get under weigh at eleven o'clock be this raft be about as long as the length of a thirty-six gun frigate and form of spar fasten together on this be a platform about one and a half foot high the isar begin its course close to mittenwald and the place on which the raft stand previous to departure be very shallow but water be quickly let in from sluice to float the raft and off we set with a cargo of peasant male and female and merchandise bind for munich as the river isar rush between immense mountain and form a continual descent until the plain of bavarium open to view you may conceive with what rapidity we go we encounter several fall of water of two three four and sometimes five foot which we have to _ shoot _ which no boat could possibly do without be upset the lower part of the raft be frequently under water in make these _ shoot _ and we be oblige to hold on fast to we seat to prevent be jerk off nothing can be more romantic and picturesque than this journey and there be something aweful in _ shooting _ these fall these raft be however so solidly construct that there be no danger whatever they can neither sink nor upset we arrive and halt the evening at tölz a large village or town on the right bank of the isar what give to tölz a remarkably singular appearance be that on a height at a short distance from the town and hang abruptly over the river you perceive several figure in wood larger than the life which figure form group represent the whole history of the passion of jesus christ at a short distance if you be not prepare for this you suppose that they be real man and that a procession or execution be go forward on landing i immediately ascend this hill in order to

bavaria as the latter be a flat country and have not much wood with which on the contrary the tyrol abound a sensible difference of climate be now feel and the air be keener than in the tyrol the price of a place on the raft from mittenwald to munich cost only one florin and at tölz a excellent supper bed and coffee in the morning cost I only one florin munich 23rd July munich the capital of bavarium be a ancient gothic city of venerable appearance the house be very solid in structure and the street sufficiently broad to give to the city a cheerful appearance there be some suburb add to

call _ wiener währung _ -lrb- vienna security -rrb- since neither foreign coin nor another description of austrian paper call _ conventions-münze _ -lrb- conventional currency -rrb- be current for ordinary purpose and it be necessary to get they change for the current paper _ wiener währung_to explain this matter more fully and clearly : there be two sort of paper money in the austrian dominion one be call _ conventions-münze _ -lrb- conventional currency -rrb- which be fully equivalent to gold and sliver and can not be refuse as such throughout the whole of the austrian dominion the other call _ wiener währung _ -lrb- vienna security -rrb- be current and payable in austrium proper only and bear a loss out of the archduchy the value of the _ wiener währung _ fluctuate considerably but the usual par of exchange be as 2 to 1 : that mean two hundred florin _ wiener währung _ be equal to one hundred _ convenzions-münze _ or gold and silver money even the _ convenzions-münze _ bear a loss tho ' trifle out of the imperial dominion the exchange have be know to have be at 400 per cent that be four hundred florin _ wiener währung _ be only worth one hundred florin gold and silver but just now it may be reckon a little beyond par fluctuate from 200 to 220 in fact the value of a florin _ wiener währung _ may be calculate at a frank in french money all this be exceedingly troublesome to traveller particularly to those who do not understand the german language for as they can not read the inscription it would be difficult for they to know the difference between one sort of paper money and the other and they might be seriously impose upon i advise therefore all traveller before they arrive at the austrian frontier whether come from bavarium saxony or italy to buy up the _ wiener währung _ note they may meet with and which may be purchase at great profit probably beyond the frontier whereas if they defer purchase till they arrive within the austrian frontier they can only procure the _ wiener währung _ at the common rate of exchange current at linz we find ourselves again in a wine country linz be renown for the beauty of its woman and we have a most favorable specimen in we landlord 's daughter one of the most beautiful girl i ever behold we talk to she a great deal and a scene ridiculous enough occur she have very beautiful arm which we all seem to admire and all at once by instinct as it be the two pole lift up one arm and i the other and we respective lip be fasten on either arm at the same moment as if by word of command we apologize for the liberty we take say that she arm be perfectly irresistible and that we have never see such fine one before she accept we excuse with the utmost good nature and laugh very heartily she father be a man of information and a good classical scholar a thing which be by no means uncommon among the inn-keeper of germany we stop here that night and the ensue forenoon we have a excellent supper very good wine and we drink to the health of the fair amalium the host 's daughter we host who be a friend of mr f -- 's give we the best of every thing and we expence do not amount to more than seven florin _ wiener währung _ for supper bed breakfast and dinner we pass the forenoon in visit the different part of the city and we be strike with the appearance of opulence and industry that prevail before we arrive at mölk which be the next important place we pass the town of en and beyond that the famous _ strudel _ or whirlpool which be dangerous at time for boat we raft be completely whirl round this whirlpool be cause by rock rise abruptly out of the water the popular tradition be that this whirlpool be the abode of a very malicious and spiteful _ wassernixe _ undine or water goblin who delight in drown passenger the scenery hereabouts be more wild and romantic than what we have hitherto pass and bear a great resemblance to the landscape on the rhine between mayence and coblentz mölk be a abbey and a very magnificent edifice it be situate on a eminence which form the angle with the river and rise quite _ à pio _ from the water 's edge it lie quite _ en face _ to those who approach it descend the stream so that the river seem to be terminate by it it command a noble prospect i have only time to inspect hastily the church beyond mölk be a range of rock that bear a great resemblance to a wall and jut out a great deal towards the river it be call the _ devil 's wall _ from the tradition of the devil have endeavor to make a wall to dam up the river above this wall be the famous castle and vineyard call _ spitz be platz _ and further on be the castle of dierenstein situate on a mountain on the left bank of the danube the ascent be very steep this castle now in ruin be the place where richard coeur de lion be confine the wall only of the castle and part of the chapel be all that remain we do not fail to visit a place of such celebrity a convent lie below it we bring to the night at a large village where there be a excellent inn and the next day the leopoldsberg burst forth to view announce to we the approach to vienna we anchor at nussdorf where there be a custom house and from whence the distance to vienna be about one and half mile english after have my trunk examine i hire a hackney coach and drive into vienna the barrier beyond the suburb be call _ line _ and between the suburb and the old town be a esplanade we enter the suburb by the _ währinger linie _ and the old town by the _ rothe thor _ -lrb- red gate -rrb- and from thence i repair to the inn _ zum weissen wolf _ -lrb- white wolf -rrb- in the _ altem fleischmarkt _ -lrb- old meat-market -rrb- vienna augt 4 the old town of vienna be not very large since you can walk round its circumference on the rampart in two hour it be formerly fortify but the french blow up the fortification leave only the rampart and by so do they do a thing of great utility for the viennese and give to the austrian government a excellent opportunity of join the old town to the magnificent faubourg by fill up the esplanade which separate they with street and square which would prevent the unpleasant effect of dust in dry and the mud in wet weather for this dust and mud render the esplanade almost at all time a disagreeable promenade there be a sharp wind prevalent almost the whole year at vienna which blow about the dust _ en tourbillon _ here then be a excellent opportunity afford by the blow up of the fortification of pave the whole of the esplanade and fill it up with street but no the austrian government seem determine upon restore the fortification and a considerable number of workman be employ this be very silly for these fortification be not of the least use against a foreign enemy inasmuch as the enemy can always erect he battery among the faubourg and need only make one parallel the protection and cover afford to he by the faubourg render the other two superfluous the faubourg be by far the finest part of the city and the garrison of the old town in endeavor to defend it would destroy by every shot they should fire the fine building on the faubourg of the folly of make such a defense they be make fully sensible in 1809 one of the archduke throw himself into the old town of vienna with a intention of defend it to the last and refuse to surrender napoleon cause battery to be erect on the _ rennweg _ or _ corso _ cover by the church of st charle the manege and palace of the hungarian noble guard all magnificent building in the faubourg he then summon the garrison of the old town again to surrender say : every shot fire against the besieger destroy you own most valuable property and finest edifice this argument back by the entreaty of the citizen have its effect and the capitulation be sign this show the perfect inutility of fortify the old town of vienna against a foreign enemy indeed a capital city should never be fortify it generally contain too many thing of value ever to be expose to the risk of a bombardment it would seem however that the object of the austrian government in reconstruct these work be to keep its own subject at vienna in check but in this case it would be much more advisable to construct a fortress on the height of kahlenberg or of leopoldsberg both of which command the city and the whole expanse below the turk be encamp on the kahlenberg at the famous siege of vienna vienna proper the old town be a gothic city but a very handsome one the street be in general broad and well paved but the _ place _ or square be small with the exception of the _ herrengasse _ where the nobility reside the rest of vienna be inhabit by shopkeeper and wholesale dealer and the shop be brilliant and well fit up the _ kärnthner strasse _ a long and tolerably broad street and the _ kohlmarkt _ present the greatest display of wealth indeed the _ kärnthner strasse _ may be consider as the principal street this street and the _ kohlmarkt _ have a great resemblance to the finest part of holborn the _ graben _ also present a fine display of shop and may be term the bond street of vienna the _ sanct stephan platz _ where the cathedral church of vienna call _ st stephan kirche _ stand be the largest _ place _ in vienna the cathedral be a very ancient and curious gothic edifice and the steeple be nearly 450 foot high i happen to enter the cathedral one day on the occasion of a solemn requiem celebrate for the soul of prince metternich 's father have it be for the son instead of the father many a honorable man persecute at the instigation of that most machiavelic of all minister might exclaim in make a slight alteration in a well know epitaph : cy-gît m -- ah qu'il est bien pour son repo et pour le mien among the other striking building in the old town be the _ hofburg _ or imperial palace a very extensive quadrangular building with a large court in its center a guard mount here every day at eleven o'clock it be in one of the saloon of this palace that the celebrated congress of vienna be hold a congress whose labor will be long and severely feel by europe and duly appreciate by posterity who will feel any other sentiment but that of gratitude for the arrangement enter into there the _ hofburg _ be build by leopold vii in 1200 this building from its be extremely irregular and from its have receive addition at interval in the different style of architecture have be aptly enough consider as the type of the austrian monarchy and of its growth from a markgraviate to a empire in _ this _ by the continued acquisition of foreign territory differ from each other in manners and hi speech in _ that _ by the continue addition of various specimen of architecture and style of building in its augmentation vienna aug 8th i be very well content with my abode at the _ weisser wolf _ tho ' it be not a first-rate hotel they be very civil people and i have a excellent and spacious room for two florin _ wiener whärung _ per diem lodgings be the only thing that be dear in vienna every other article be however cheaper than in any other city i have yet be in all kind of hungarian wine may be have at the most reasonable price i generally breakfast at a neighbouring _ café _ in the _ fleischmarkt _ for the sake of read the _ allgemeine zeitung _ which be take in there and which be the only journal have a shade of liberality which be permit in the austrian dominion from the hour of twelve to three dinner _ à la carte _ be serve at the _ weisser wolf _ for two and half florin _ ww _ i get a excellent dinner with a bottle of offener wine the wine of offen resemble much that of bordeaux in its quality and flavor the tariff however of the dinner and wine vary daily a few kreutzer in consequence of the eternal fluctuation of the _ ww _ so that every morning a fresh tariff be affix to the wainscot of the saloon where the dinner be serve supper serve likewise _ à la carte _ be at its full tide between the hour of eight and ten o'clock and as vienna be renown for the celebrity of its beefsteak and cutlet call here _ rostbraten _ these and a salad seem to be the favorite dish for supper my morning i have hitherto pass in lounge about the _ kärnthner gasse st stephen 's platz kohlmarkt _ etc for a hour before dinner the fashionable promenade be on the rampart in front of the palace of duke albert of saxe-teschen in the evening on the _ prater _ in a carriage on horseback or on foot the _ prater _ be of immense extent and offer a great variety of amusement and sight i generally return home at night pretty well fatigue from my ramble there be another great inconvenience at vienna result from the fluctuation of the current money and this be that a stranger dwelling at a inn be sure to be disturbed five or six time in the morning sometimes as early as five or six o'clock by jew who rap at he door to enquire if he want to exchange gold and silver against currency or _ vice versâ _ i use to lose all patience at be so disturbed in the morning and be oblige in self-defence to put a affiche on the door of my room to this effect : _ man kauft und verkauft hier nicht kein wechsler darf hereintreten _ here there be no buying and sell no money changer be allow to come in and i hereby recommend to all stranger not to treat with these jew but on they arrival or at any time they think fit to go to a banking establishment in this city where every day after eleven o'clock you can exchange you gold and silver for paper at the just rate of exchange as publish at the bourse pay only a very slight premium and on leave vienna to go to the same establishment to change you superfluous _ wiener währung _ for _ convenzion münze _ or gold and silver money for when the jew tell you the rate of exchange be so and so you conclude probably you bargain with they and on enquire at the bourse you find that the jew have make a percentage of six or eight per cent out of you _ loui d'or _ be the best foreign coin to bring into the austrian dominion next to they in utility be the dutch ducat or _ geharnischte männer _ as they be term from the figure of the man in armor upon they all other corn suffer a loss in proportion the banker in vienna pay the foreign bill of exchange in _ convenzion münze _ which you must afterwards change for _ wiener währung _ the only current money in vienna and austrium but what make it additionally troublesome be that here in vienna there be particular payment which must absolutely be pay in gold or silver or _ convenzion münze _ and _ not wiener währung _ for instance the franking of foreign letter at the post office where they do not take the _ wiener währung _ in vain you may intreat they to take the _ wiener währung _ at any rate they please no you must go elsewhere and buy from the first person you can meet with as much gold and silver as be require for the franking of the letter so bigott be they in the austrian dominion to the letter of the law this happen to I : i want to frank three letter for england and i go to the post office with _ wiener währung _ paper not be aware of this regulation and i be oblige to return to my hotel to lay hold of a jew and to buy from he as much gold and silver as be requisite for the franking of the letter at the _ wechselbank _ or bank of exchange i have before mention the crowd that attend daily be immense but the business be carry on without hurry or confusion you hand in you paper or you gold and silver coin the clerk who receive it give you a order on paper for the amount specify which paper you take into another room and therein receive the amount this establishment however remain open only two hour every day between eleven and one i believe so if you be too late for this interval of time you must apply to the broker christian or israelite vienna August 11th we leave the old town by the _ burg-thor _ and cross the esplanade direct we course to the _ rennweg _ one of the suburb in order to view the majestic edifice of st charle which be equal in the beauty of its architecture to many of the finest church in rome its façade and cupola render it one of the most striking building belong to vienna we next visit the _ manège _ and the palace call the palace of the hungarian noble guard they be both beautiful edifice the faubourg of vienna be build in the modern style and they building both public and private excellent in they way and in the best state the street of the faubourg be broad but not pave the most celebrated of these faubourg be _ marium hülf _ _ leopold-stadt _ _ landstrasse _ the _ rennweg _ the _ wühringer gasse _ and i be persuade that if the old town be unite to the faubourg by means of street and square and the esplanade fill up with building vienna would perhaps be the handsomest city in europe and the fourth in size for the best building and palace be in the faubourg viz the military college the polytechnic school st charle ' church the porcelain fabric the palace of esterhazy kaunitz stahremberg schwarzenberg palfy and the beautiful palace and ground of belvedere in which last be a noble collection of picture open to the public at the polytechnic school one of the principal professor be a friend of mr f ------ 's and he explain to we the nature of the establishment and the course of study pursue the apparatus for every branch of science be on the grandest scale after dinner we repair to the _ prater _ cross a branch of the danube which here form several island the _ prater _ require and deserve particular mention part of it be something in the style of the _ champ elysées _ at pari and it be fully equal to it in the variety of amusement and enjoyment to be meet with there but it be far larger and more beautiful on account of its landscape and the diversified manner in which the grounds be lay out the _ prater _ then be a immense park lay out on a island of considerable extent on the danube the nearest faubourg to it be the _ leopoldstadt _ which be also the most fashionable one and a bridge conduct you from that faubourg direct into the _ prater _ the _ prater _ present a mixture of garden meadow upland and forest the lofty tree arrange in avenue or in clump give a delightful protect shade on the road destine for the carriage there be every afternoon a most brilliant display of carriage another avenue be destine for equestrian and two avenue one on each side of these two for pedestrian there be besides wind footpath that conduct you all over this vast extent of ground and circular grass plot surround by tree where the pedestrian may repose and eat and drink if he will here be _ restaurant _ in plenty _ cafés _ panorama exhibition of wild beast swing tennis court place for run at the ring do for burlesque dramatic performance _ farceur _ juggler de bach 's equestrian amphitheatre in the style of franconus _ salle de danse _ bath billiard room gaming table and even house appropriate to gallantry in fact the _ prater _ be quite the paradise of the bourgeoisie of vienna who be fond of the pleasure of the table and take every opportunity of make dinner and supper party the bourgeois of vienna be far more sensual than spiritual and not at all disposed to self-denial excellent ham and sausage be to be have here and the viennese who dine and sup heartily at he own house never fail during he evening promenade to take a tolerable good portion of ham or sausage with a proportion of offen wine or maylander beer by way of stay he stomach during the tedious interval between dinner and supper i need scarce add that smoking be universal as indeed it be all over germany for i scarcely ever see a german without a pipe either in he mouth or fasten to he coat and a bag or pouch of tobacco either in he pocket or attach to he button hole in the _ prater _ dance often take place in the open air between the grisette of vienna who be in general handsome and well make and who dress well and they lover and admirer the _ prater _ be first open to the public by the emperor joseph ii the _ au-garten _ be another place of recreation and amusement but on a smaller and much more tranquil and sober scale than the _ prater _ none of the lower class think of come here tho ' it be open to every body decently dress : there be not that profuse eating and drinking go forward it be more properly speak a promenade and form a garden with alley of tree where music be often perform and there be a superb saloon where refreshment may be have the _ au-garten _ be frequent chiefly by the _ noblesse _ and _ haute bourgeoisie _ in the morning likewise it be a fashionable resort to drink the mineral water it adjoin the _ prater _ be on the same island it be the favorite lounge of joseph ii who open it to the public by affix this inscription on one of the gate : allen menschen gewidmete erlustigung von ihrem schätzer place of recreation open to all man by they esteemer vienna aug 13th there be a great number of theater at vienna two be situate in the old town viz the _ hof-theater _ and the _ burg-theater _ the _ hof-theater _ be only open when the court be at vienna and they be now at baden ten league distant the _ burg-theater _ be open all the year round and may be consider as the national theater it be much frequent by the bourgeoisie and inhabitant of the old town who do not chuse to take the trouble to go to the _ wieden-theater _ which be situate in the faubourg and which be more of a classical and fashionable theater than the other inasmuch as it be more elegantly and classically build better fit up and have a far better company of comedian at the _ burgtheater _ i see kotzebue 's _ edelsinn und armuth _ perform the wieden theater which be as i have say in the faubourg be the handsomest theater perhaps in europe for its size it be not large but it be fit up with so much taste and you see and hear so well every ornament be so chaste and there be nothing at all tawdry or superfluous it be i really think a model of what every theater ought to be there be a good deal of bronze about it which give it a classical appearance and the box be support by caryatide in bronze there be a peculiarity in all the theater at vienna which be that in the _ parterre _ you must sit in the place the number of which be mark on you ticket these place be call _ gesperrte sitze _ and each seat resemble a armchair when not occupy the seat be fold up and lock to the back of the chair until the person who hold the ticket correspond to its number come to take it so that no other but the person hold the ticket correspond to the number can take it and you be thus never likely to be shove out of you place as you be at most of the theater in europe there be man station at the door who follow you into the _ parterre _ to unlock and let down a seat for you and to they you give you ticket with a slight gratification which be however quite optional you ticket you previously pay for at the door vienna augt 20th i have be to see schönbrunn the usual residence of the young napoleon but he be now at baden with the imperial family where he mother who be lately arrive from italy be also on a visit the young napoleon be say to be a remarkable fine boy and a great favorite with he grandfather the emperor many be the anecdote relate of he i shall mention one he have hear so often talk of he father that shortly after the arrival of he mother he wish to see he father also and ask he attendant repeatedly and not in a very patient tone : _ will ist denn mein vater _ -lrb- 124 -rrb- this be tell to he grandfather the emperor and he give direction that the child should be bring to he the very next time he should put the question he then say to he : _ du möchtestwissen will dein vater ist er ist in verhaft man hat e mit ihm gut gemeint weil er aber unruhig war so hat man ihn in verhaft gestellt und dich wird man auch verhaften wenn du unruhig bist _ -lrb- 125 -rrb- so much for this anecdote but i do not hear what be the answer of the young prince the young napoleon be it appear a great favorite of the soldier who quite adore he and he will sometimes go into the kitchen to get bread and meat to give to the soldier on guard at the palace a singular event happen lately to marium louisa during she stay at schõnbrunn she _ chatouille _ with several thing of value in it _ bijouterie _ etc be steal from she she cause enquiry to be make and research to be set on foot nobody have be able to find out who take it but it be put back in the precise place from whence it be take and not a single article of the _ bijouterie _ or thing of value be miss it be suppose this theft be make for political purpose in order to discover the nature of she epistolary correspondence if any exist have it be take by a vulgar thief it be not probable that the article of value would have be restore such be the unhappy condition of that princess to be always a object of suspicion and espionnage _ journey to prague _ i leave vienna on the 28th August in a _ landkutsche _ and arrive at prague on the first of September these _ landkutsche _ be on the same plan and footing with the _ vetture _ in italy and travel in the same manner with this difference however that the _ landkutscher _ do not usually as the _ vetturinus _ do undertake to provide for the supper and bed of they passenger in a word you be not _ spesato _ and in germany there be not the least necessity for it for there be no such thing as extortion on the part of the german innkeeper who be by far the most respectable of that profession besides in most place everything be _ tariffed _ and where it be not the landlord never make a unreasonable demand or attempt to make foreigner pay more than native whereas in italy if you be not _ spesato _ there be no bound to the rapacity of the innkeeper witness mine host of terracina both italy and germany present the greatest convenience for traveller as the _ landkutsche _ or _ vetture _ be continually pass from town to town there be however this difference between they that the italian _ vetturinus _ will abate they price if they carriage be full except one place and that they must start whereas the german _ landkutscher _ never abate they price i pay for my journey from vienna to prague thirty-five florin _ wiener währung _ and we make the journey in five day we first day 's journey bring we to höllabrunn have stoppd to dinner at stockeran the road be excellent and the several town and village we past

hat ihm den korb gegeben _ -lrb- _ she have give he the basket _ -rrb- hitherto i have not meet with any one who could explain to I satisfactorily the origin of so singular a phrase but on read lately a volume of the _ volksmährchen _ -lrb- _ popular tale _ -rrb- i find not only the derivation of this phrase but also that of the name of the city of prague both be connect in the same story and both concern the history of prague the story be as follow libussa duchess of bohemia have three lover two of whom be not remarkably intelligent but the third possess a great deal of talent and be she favorite she be much importune by the rival suitor she appear before they one day with a basket fill with plum in she hand and say she would give she hand in marriage to whoever of they should guess the follow arithmetical riddle she say : one of you shall take half the plum that be in this basket and one over : another shall take half of what remain and one over : the third shall take half of what still remain and three over and then all the plum will have be take now tell I how many plum there be in the basket she favorite be the only one who could guess the number of plum which be _ thirty _ to he therefore she give she hand and the plum and to the other suitor the empty basket hence the phrase the solution of the question be as follow : a take half of the plum in the basket -lrb- 30 -rrb- and one over 15 + 1 = 16 b half of what remain -lrb- 14 -rrb- and one over 7 + 1 = 8 c half of what remain -lrb- 6 -rrb- and three over 3 + 3 = 6 -- total 30 now with regard to the origin of the city of prague the former residence be much too small and libussa direct she workman to build a town on the spot where they should find at midday a man make the _ best use of he tooth _ they begin they research and one day at that hour discover a carpenter saw a block of wood it strike they that this laborious man be make a better use of he tooth -lrb- viz tooth of he saw -rrb- than the mere feeder and they judge that this ought to be the place where the town should be build they therefore proceed to trace with a plough the circumference of the town on ask the carpenter what he be about to make with the block he be saw he say a threshold for a door which be call _ prah _ or _ praha _ in the bohemian language and libussa give to the city the name of _ praha _ or _ prag _

brandenburger thor _ in the shape of a triumphal arch ornament with a statue of peace with a olive branch in she hand standing on a car draw by four horse abreast the whole groupe being of bronze and of exquisite workmanship the four horse be imitate from the corinthian horse at venice and yield to they in nothing but antiquity indeed they have a much more pleasing and striking effect in be thus attach to a car than standing by themselves as the venetian one do on the top of the façade of a church this _ brandenburger thor _ be construct after the model of the propylaeum of athen the opera house a building in the grecian taste erect by frederic the great with the inscription _ apollinus et musis _ and after that the academy of the fine art engage my attention both these building be

street of recent construction between the former _ enceinte _ of the town and the brandenburger thor the hotel of the invalide a ponderous building bear the follow inscription : _ laesis non victi _ the bank and the arsenal next engage my attention as also a guard house of recent construction in the shape of a doric temple the royal palace be a immense building partly in the gothic and partly in the grecian style it be very heavy but impose the interior of this palace be royally fit up except the little room occupy by the great frederic which be leave in the same state as when he occupy it

from this on the _ lange brücke _ stand the colossal equestrian statue in bronze of the great elector the _ königstrasse _ be the principal street and a very fine one it be next to it in point of beauty be the _ französische _ _ strasse _ the _ wilhelm platz _ be adorn with the statue in marble of schwerin seidlitz keith winterfeld and ziethen but i can not enumerate all the splendid public establishment and fine thing to be see in this beautiful city the most striking church be that of st hedwig i call it the most striking from its resemblance to the pantheon at rome the cathedral be perhaps a finer building ` tis in this last that the electoral and royal remains be deposit the street ` here swarm with military and indeed the profession of arm seem to have too much sway in the prussian dominion the subaltern and young man of the prussian army be say to have republican sentiment and they in common with all the burgher desire a constitution it gall they to see one enjoy by the bavarian whom they affect to look upon as inferior to they in intelligence and that it should be refuse to they most of the nobility and the greater part of the general and field officer be however inveterate aristocrat you have hear i dare say of the attempt make by some officer among the nobility to exclude from the service after the peace those officer who be not noble when it be consider that they best and most zealous officer spring from the burgher and that prussium when abandon by she king and noble be save from permanent subjection only by the unparalleled exertion of she burgher and peasantry one be shock at such ingratitude and absurdity but the officer of the royal guard go so far as to draw up a petition to the king request he to dismiss all the officer of the corps who be not noble and blucher be apply to to present this petition to the king blucher read the paper and order all the officer to assemble on the parade and thus address they : gentleman i have receive you paper and read its contents with the utmost astonishment all the remark that i shall permit myself to make on the subject of this petition be that it make I ashamed of be myself a noble he then tear the petition in piece and dismiss they i have be once at the theater _ lodoiska _ be perform i see a number of fine woman in the box formerly gallantry and pleasure be the order of the day at berlin but now the court assume the exterior of rigid morality and strictly exercise religious devotion mystic cant and dullness be the order of the day the death of the queen of prussium throw a great damp over the amusement of the court at charlottenburg which be a short distance from berlin in the grounds there they point out to you she favorite spot she be a most amiable princess and unite to great personal beauty so much grace and fascination and so many good quality that she be beloved by all and the breath of calumny never venture to assail she the alley _ unter den linden _ in the evening present a great assemblage of cyprian nymph who promenade up and down they dress well and be perfectly well behave there be a superb establishment of this kind at berlin which all stranger should visit out of curiosity it be not indispensably necessary to sacrifice to the goddess whose worship be carry on there but you may limit yourself to admire the temple call for refreshment and contemplate the priestess there be the utmost moral and political freedom at berlin and tho ' the government be despotic in form freedom of speech be allow a army of 200000 man admirably discipline and arm of these a garrison of 15000 man in berlin and as many at potsdam be quite sufficient to keep in check all attempt to put political theory and speculation into practice indeed it would be very difficult to excite a revolt the various german government be carry on very paternally and the government be scarcely feel habit of obedience have take deep root among the people and a german peasant as long as he get enough to eat and drink do not conceive himself unhappy or think of a change i could not help laugh the other day at a little village near berlin when i hear some peasant talk of napoleon one of they who seem to have some partiality for he exclaim mean to blame he for leave elba : _ aber warum verliess er seine insel er hatte doch zu essen und trinken so viel er wolte _ -lrb- why do he leave elba he have surely plenty to eat and drink -rrb- this good peasant could not conceive that a man bless with these comfort should like to change he situation or run any risk to do so french as well as german be commonly speak in berlin and i be glad to see that the prejudice against the french be wear off if the french and prussian could understand one another and know they own interest or if the french have a liberal national government i mean one more identify with the interest of the people than the present one be what advantage might not rise therefrom they be natural ally and unite they might be able effectually to humble the overbearing insolence and political coxcombry of the czar shake to its center the systematic despotism and light-fearing leader of austrium and keep in check the commercial greediness monopolize spirit and tory arrogance of england the german political writer duly appreciate the illiberal policy of england towards the continental nation by which she invariably help to crush liberty on the continent in the hope of paralyse they energy and industry in order to compel they to buy english manufacture and in fine to make they dependent on england for every article of consumption england ever since the beginning of the reign of george iii to the present day have be always ready to lend a hand to crush liberty to perpetuate abuse and to rivet the fetter of monarchial feudal and ecclesiastical tyranny these be fact and can not be deny the english people have be tax to the last farthing to support a war of privilege against freedom and europe be in consequence prostrate at the foot of a unprincipled coalition thro ' england 's arm and england 's gold and then a english minister and he vile hireling journal tell you that the continental nation be not ripe for and do not deserve liberty even the pope and grand turk both so much dread by we pious ancestor have be support caress and subsidize in order to help to put down all effort make to obtain rational liberty which the courtier always affect to stigmatize with the name of jacobinism while a number of needy individual have enrich themselves by the public plunder and byaiding and abet the system all _ novus homine _ man who have there be more to gain on the other side than by espouse toryism would not have be backward man who be jacobin in the real sense of the word however they cloak themselves under the specious name of church and king man upholder of pitt and he system for which they affect a veneration they be far from really feel man in fact whose political scruple of whatever nature they be would soon melt away dresden 5th October i have be fortunate in get into very comfortable lodgings have two room and as much firing as i chuse for eight _ reichsthaler _ per month coffee be make for I at home in the morning and i generally dine and sup at a _ restaurant _ close by near the bridge the _ platz _ in the neustadt be close to my lodgings and be very large and well pave and line with tree it afford a very agreeable promenade row of elegant house line the side of this pla among which the _ stadthaus _ be particularly remarkable the famous _ japan palace _ as it be call be also in the _ neustadt _ and but a short distance from the _ platz _ the garden of count marcolinus afford also a pleasant promenade but by far the most agreeable walk in my opinion be on the _ zwinger _ a sort of terrace on the left bank of the elbe in the old town adjoining the palace and garden of count bruhl from this place you have a noble view of a long reach of the elbe it be besides the favorite promenade of the lady on the _ zwinger _ too be a building contain a fine collection of painting here be _ cafés _ likewise and a _ restaurant _ the evening

jours de fête goûters _ and supper party be form here and very good music be hear the elbe bridge be of beautiful structure and there be a good regulation with respect to those who pass over this bridge which be that one side of the bridge be reserve for those go from the new to the old town and the other side for those go from the old to the new town and if you attempt to go on the wrong side you be stop by a sentry so that there be no jostle nor lounge on this bridge a arch of this bridge be blow up by marshal davoust in order to arrest the progress of the russian and a great deal of management be necessary to effectuate it for the worthy saxon have a great veneration for this bridge and in order to inforce the execution of this resolution on the part of the marshal the personal order of the king and the employment of saxon troops be necessary it have be rebuild since and no one would know that the arch have ever be blow up but from the extreme whiteness of the new arch contrast with the darker color of the old one in the old town or dresden proper the finest building be : the catholic church standing near the bridge a edifice yielding in beauty but to few in italy and to none in other country here you hear excellent music during the church service and the king and royal family all of whom be catholic attend constantly the royal palace be very near the church and not far from it be the theater saxony be a lutheran country the public exercise of the catholic religion be not permit until napoleon 's time when he propose a arrangement to permit to the king and all other catholic the public celebration of they religion which proposition be accede to with universal approbation on the part of the protestant and now the host be frequently display in the street there be however but few catholic in dresden among the native so great be the respect for usage and custom in germany that the elector of saxony on go over to catholicism never think even of request the indulgence of exercise they religion publicly and the grant it have produce no evil consequence liberalism and the most unreserved toleration in matter of religion be the order of the day the royal palace be a very fine and extensive building and the interior be well worth see particularly the superb _ riesen-saal _ where augustus ii use to give he magnificent _ fêtes _ one of the last and most brilliant _ fêtes _ give here be that give by the king of saxony to the emperor napoleon just before the russian campaign at which the emperor and empress of austrium and most of the sovereign of germany assist to do hommage to the great conqueror the _ schloss-gasse _ or castle street lead from the palace into the _ markt platz _ where the market and fair be hold in this place in the _ schloss-gasse _ and in another street parallel to it that lead from the porcelain manufactory to the _ grosser platz _ -lrb- _ grande place _ -rrb- be the finest shop and greatest display of wealth on the _ grosser platz _ stand the _ frauen-kirche _ a superb protestant church and which may be consider as the cathedral church of dresden the _ platz _ be large there be great cleanliness in all the street of dresden and the house be well build and uniform but there be few other very prominent edifice except those i have mention on go outside the town by the gate of pirna stand almost immediately on the right on turn down a road the garden and palace of prince anthony leave this on you right and proceed along the _ chaussée _ or high road which be nearly parallel to the river at the distance of three-quarter mile from the gate stand the palace and garden call _ der grosse garten _ -lrb- grand garden -rrb- which you leave on you right if you continue you route on the _ chaussée _ towards pirna i have not yet visit the _ grosse garten _ there be likewise a fine promenade on the bank of the elbe but quite in a opposite direction to the pirna gate for to arrive at it from this gate you must traverse the pirna street and _ grosser platz _ and on arrival near the bridge direct you course to the left which will lead you out of one of the gate into a immensely long avenue of elm tree parallel to the river which form the promenade dresden oct 10th i have be to see the palace and grounds of the _ grosser garten _ the garden and park for it unite both be of great extent and beautifully lay out but a number of fine tree have be knock down and mutilate by cannon shot during the battle of dresden in 1818 when this garden be occupy by the ally troops and expose to a heavy fire of fifty piece of cannon from a battery erect by napoleon on the opposite side of the river which completely command and enfilade the whole range of the garden how the palace itself escape be knock to piece be wonderful but i suppose napoleon must have give order to spare it as much as possible this palace be of beautiful structure and in the style of a italian villa statue of the twelve caesar and bas-relief adorn the exterior the column and pilaster be of the corinthian order as for the interior it be unfurnished and have be so since the seven year ' war when it be plunder by the enemy and have never since be inhabit by the electoral family there be a superb rectangular basin of water in this garden these garden be delightfully lay out why they be not more frequented i can not conceive but i have hitherto meet with very few people there tho ' they be open to all the world they will form my morning 's promenade for i prefer solitude to a crowd in a morning walk but one of the gardener here tell I that on Sunday evening there be generally a good deal of company who come to listen to the music which be play in a building fit up for the purpose at one side of the garden wine coffee beer and other refreshment be to be have but beer be the favorite beverage smoking be universal among the young man the most ardent admirer of the fair sex never forget they pipe during the courtship the surest sign that the fair one do not intend to _ give _ she lover _ the basket _ be when she present he with a bag to hold he tobacco she consent be imply thereby during the battle of dresden the slaughter in this garden be immense and the ally be finally drive out of it the gardener related to I a affect story of a young lady of dresden whose lover be kill in this battle and bury in the _ grosser garten _ she have take it so much to heart that she come here three or four time in the week to visit this grave and strew flower over it she remain for some time absorb in silent meditation and then withdraw she have a settle melancholy but it have not yet affect she understanding dresden oct 15th i meet with my old friend sir wus who be travel to berlin with the idea of pass the winter there and of proceed in the summer to moscow thro ' the interest of my friend col d ------ and baron de f ------ i have be ballot for and admit a member of a club or society here call the _ ressource _ it be hold in a large house on the _ markt platz _ and be indeed a most agreeable resource to all foreigner for ` tis in this society that they be likely to

polite behavior and litterary requirement will ensure admittance to a candidate this society consist of member and honorary member among the honorary member be foreigner and other whose stay in dresden be short but whoever remain for more than one year must cease to be a honorary member and must be ballot for in order to become a permanent member and should he be blackball he cease to belong

the member of the society they can at its expiration exclude he for ever afterwards no enquiry be make as to the character and conduct of a person who be admit as a honorary member : it be sufficient that he be recommend by a permanent member which be deem a sufficient guarantee for he respectability in this society there be dine room billiard room card room a large reading room here too be a small but well choose library and three or four newspaper in every european language all the german newspaper and review and the principal periodical work in the german french english and italian language the english papers take in here be the _ time courier _ and _ chronicle _ of the french the _ moniteur journal des débats constitutionel journal du commerce gazette de france _ and _ gazette

useful acquaintance be make at the _ ressource _ since if a foreigner render himself agreeable to the gentleman who frequent this society they generally propose take he to they house and introduce he to they family after a introduction you may go at any hour of the evening you please : but morning visit be not much in fashion since the _ toilette _ be seldom make till after dinner which be always early in germany there be no get dinner after three o'clock in any part of dresden besides the _ ressource _ there be several other club here such as the _ harmonic _ and other the public ball be give at the _ hôtel de pologne _ twice a week viz one for the _ noblesse _ and one for the _ bourgeoisie _ none of the female _ bourgeoisie _ be admit to the ball and society of the _ noblesse _ and only such of the male as occupy post or employment at court or under government such as _ königs-rath _ _ hof-rath _ or officer of the army it be therefore usual when the sovereign wish to introduce a person of merit among the _ bourgeoisie _ into the upper circle that he give he the title of _ rath _ or counsellor but this priviledge of be presentable at court do not extend to they wife and daughter all the military officer from whatever class of life they spring have introduction _ de jure _ into the ball and society of the _ noblesse _ and be always in uniform but when they attend the ball of the _ bourgeoisie _ it be the etiquette for they to wear plain clothes : at the ball of the _ bourgeoisie _ therefore not a uniform be to be see i observe by far the prettiest woman at the ball of the _ bourgeoisie _ and very many be to be find there who in education and accomplishment fully equal those of the _ noblesse _ and this be no small merit for the woman in saxony of the higher class be extremely well educate most of they be proficient in music and be verse in french and italian litterature they seem amiable and goodnatured and by no means _ minaudières _ as lady mary wortley montague have rather unjustly term they for they appear to I to be the most frank artless creature i ever behold and to have no sort of _ minauderie _ or _ coquetterie _ about they beauty be the appanage of the saxon woman hence the proverb in rhyme : darauf bin ich gegangen nach sachsen will die schönen mädchen auf den baümen wachsen in english : behold I land now on saxon ground where lovely damsel on the tree be find a taste for litterature be indeed general throughout the whole nation and this city be consider as the athen of germany dresden nov 8th i have be at the theater and witness the representation of a tragedy call _ die schuld _ write by adolphus müllner it be a most interesting piece and the novelty of it have make a striking impression on I it be write in the eight-footed trochaic metre similar to that in which the spanish tragedy be write it hinge on a prophecy make by a gipsey in which the person to whom the prophecy be make in endeavor to avert it hasten its accomplishment the piece be full of interest and the versification harmonious i have be twice at the italian opera where i see the _ gazza ladra _ and _ il matrimonio secreto _ i come here with the idea of give myself up entirely to the study of the german language but such be the beauty of the country environ dresden that though winter have commence i employ the greatest part of the day in long walk for instance i have be to pillnitz which be on the right bank of the elbe about seven mile from dresden ascend the river the road be on the bank of the river the whole way the palace at pillnitz be vast and well build during a part of the year the royal family reside there pillnitz will remain damn have to everlasting fame as the place where the famous treaty be sign the object of which be to put down the french revolution which mr pitt and the british ministry know of and sanction tho ' they pretend ignorance of it and profess to have no desire to interfere with the affair of france every thing please I at dresden except the bed i wish it be the fashion to use blanket and _ édredons _ for the upper cover instead of the _ lit de plume _ for they be too heavy and promote rather too intense a perspiration and if you become impatient of the heat and throw they off you catch a intense cold you know how partial i be to the german and can even put up with they eternal smoking tho ' no smoker myself but to they bed i shall never be reconcile a german bed be as follow : a _ paillasse _ over that a mattress then a featherb with a sheet fasten to it and over that again another featherb with a sheet fasten to it and thus you lie between two featherbed but these be not always of sufficient length and you be often oblige to coil up you leg or be expose to have they freeze by they extend beyond the featherbed for the cold be very great during the winter the more i see of the people here the more i like they the national character of the german be integrity tho ' sometimes cloak under a rough exterior as in bavarium and austrium but here in saxony it be combine with a suavity of manners that be very striking for the saxon be the tuscan of germany in point of politeness and they be far more accomplished because they take more pain in cultivate they mind a savant in italy be a man who write a volume about a coin fill with hypothesis when with all he learning force into the service he prove nothing and this very man be probably ignorant in the extreme of modern political history and that of he own time and have more pedantry than taste such a man be often however in italy term a _ portento _ but in dresden and in most of the capital of germany where there be so many of science and deep research a man must not only be well read in antiquity but also well verse in political economy and in analysis before he can venture to give a work to the public latin quotation unsupported by reason and philosophical argument will avail he nothing for the german be a terrible _ erforscher _ and wish to know the _ what _ the _ how _ and the _ when _ of every thing besides a italian _ savant _ be seldom verse in any other tongue than he own and the latin with perhaps a slight knowledge of french whereas in germany it be not only very common to find a knowledge of french english italian latin and greek unite in the same person but very many add hebrew arabic and even sanscrit to they stock of philology as a specimen for instance of german industry i have see at the club of the _ ressource _ ode on the peace in thirty-six different language and all of they write by native saxon this show to what a extent philology be cultivate in germany indeed it be quite a passion and a very useful one it be i know that many people regard it as a loss of time and say that you acquire only new word and no new idea but i deny this i maintain that every new language learn give you new idea as it put you at once more _ au fait _ of the manners and custom of the people which can only be thoroughly learn by read popular author in they original language : for there be several author of the merit of whose style it be impossible to form a adequate idea in a translation however correct and excellent it be indeed i wonder that the study of the german language be not more attend to in england france and italy but to the english methink it be indispensable all the custom and manners of europe be take from the german all modern europe bear the teutonic stamp we be all the descendant of the teutonic horde who subjugate the roman empire and change the face of europe ` tis they who have give and lay down the grand and distinguishing feature between modern europe and ancient europe and asia : i mean the respect pay to woman to what nation i say be due the chivalrous respect to woman which be the surest sign of civilization and which be unknown to the ancient greek and roman except to the german who even in they most uncivilized state pay such veneration to they woman as to consult they as oracle on all occasion and to admit they to they council tacitus particularly mention this and speaking of the german of he time he say they have a idea that there be something divine about a woman -lrb- 126 -rrb- it be this feeling hand down to we from we teutonic ancestor that contribute mainly to make the european so superior to all the asiatic nation where woman still remain a degrade be and ` tis this feeling that give to we the palm above all greek and roman glory what be the modern european nation the english french italian switzer even spanish and portuguese but the descendant of these warlike teutonic tribe who sweep away the effeminate roman from the face of the earth and do we not see the teutonic policy and usage defective and degenerate as they sometimes be the best safeguard of liberty against the insidious interpretation of the roman law which be found on the pretended superiority of one nation the infer inferiority of all the rest with regard to theatricals i have witness the representation of a tragedy lately publish call _ sappho _ by a young poet of the name of grillparzer this tragedy be strictly on the greek model its versification in iambic be so beautiful that it be regard as the triumph of the _ classic _ over the _ romantic _ and by this piece grillparzer have prove the universality of he genius for he write a short time ago a dramatic piece in the _ romantic _ style and in the eight rhyme trochaic metre call _ die anhfrau _ -lrb- the ancestress -rrb- where supernatural agency be introduce this i have read it be a piece full of interest still it be think too _ outré _ by the _ classiker _ it be suppose that this be the peculiar style of the author and that he adopt it from inability to compose in the classic taste when behold by way of prove the contrary he have give we a drama simple in its plot where all the unity be preserved and where the subject one would think be too well know to produce much interest he have give i say to this piece -lrb- sappho -rrb- from the extreme harmony of its versification and the pathos of the sentiment express therein a effect which i doubt any tragedy of euripide or sophocle surpass the character of sappho and she passion for phaon he indifference to she and attachment to the young melitta a attendant and slave of sappho 's and sappho throw herself into the sea after unite phaon and melitta constitute the plot of the drama but simple as the plot and old as the story be it excite the greatest interest and never fail to draw tear from the audience what can be more artless and pathetic for instance than these line of the young melitta when she regret she expatriatioa : kein busen schlägt mlr bier in diesem lande und meine freunden wohnen weit von hier in english : no bosom beat for I in this strange land and far from here my friend and parent dwell i have no doubt that some of these day _ sappho _ will be translate into the idiom of modern greece and act in that country the actress who do the part of sappho give it full effect and the part of the young melitta be fairly perform but i do not approve of the acting of the performer who play phaon he overstep the modesty of nature and the intention of the author for he be in he gesture and manner grossly rude and insolent to poor sappho whereas tho ' he love to melitta be paramount he ought to have show no ordinary struggle in stifle he gratitude to he benefactress sappho i admire the german word _ gebieterinn _ -lrb- mistress -rrb- it be majestic and harmonious and the only word in any modern language that i know of poetic enough to render aptly the greek word -lrb- greek : despoina -rrb- dresden decr 1st i have be to visit the famous gallery of painting here but you must not expect from I a description i shall send you a catalogue it would be endless to describe the various _ chefs-d'oeuvre _ which be contain in this valuable collection dresden have always be consider as the florence of germany and have always be renown for its gallery of painting hence the almost innate taste of the saxon for the _ beau art _ and the great encouragement give to they at all tune by this government it be here and at meissen that the best german be think to be speak tho ' hanover dispute this prerogative with dresden i have be to see the antiquity and curiosity of the _ japanischer palast _ -lrb- palace of japan -rrb- as it be call in this palace be a quantity of ancient armor and the most superb collection of porcelain i believe in europe the collection of precious stone be also immense and i never in my life see such a profusion of diamond emerald turquoise sapphir amethyst and topaze in this museum be three statue find in herculaneum on its first discovery or excavation viz a athlete a esculapius and a venus here too and from this circumstance the palace take its name be a collection of japanese antiquity and ornament lacker work in gold and silver which be unique in the world from the royal library a foreigner on be recommend may have at he own house all such book to read as can be replace if lose or spoil but the manuscript and scarce and valuable edition be not permit to be take out of the library any person once admit on recommendation may go to read in this library at state hour and may consult any book or manuscript he please on apply to the librarian a person fond of music will be in a continual state of enjoyment at dresden besides the fine music in the royal chapel the band of the king 's guard be compose of first rate musician who attend regularly at guard mount and play for a hour together there be also a band of music every evening during the summer month that play in the garden of the _ linkischer bad _ then there be various other place of recreation and amusement at all of which musician be in attendance for a saxon can not enjoy he repast or he pipe without music and good music too to facilitate he digestion there be a custom in dresden that on the occasion of the death of a person the young chorister of the cathedral be send for to sing hymn stand in a semi-circle round the door of the house of the defunct these chorister be all dress in black and they style of singing be melodious solemn and impressive smoking be so prevalent here and in all part of germany that if you wish to denote one of the male sex _ smoker _ would be quite a synonymous word such be the passion for this enjoyment that even at the ball the young man the moment they have finish the waltz quit the hand of they partner and rush into another room in order to smoke nor would the beauty of venus nor the wit of minerva be powerful enough to restrain the young german from give way to he darling practice smoking tobacco have i think this visible effect that it serve to calm all tumultuous passion and what confirm I in this idea be that most young german in commence life as adult be full of enthusiastic and even exaggerated notion of liberty and equality they be romantic to a degree that be difficult to be conceive and seem to be restrain by no selfish or worldly idea this you would suppose would tend to render they rather turbulent subject under a autocratical government but all this _ schwärmerey _ evaporate literally in smoke : they take to they pipe and by degree the fume of tobacco cause all these lofty idea to dissipate : the pipe become more and more necessary to they existence and console they for they wrong real or imaginary and in three or four year they sit down contentedly to they several occupation as strait-forward painstaking plodding man quite satisfied to follow the routine chalk out for they and either totally forget all ambitious view or become too indolent to make any sacrifice to obtain they and this _ virtue come from tobacco _ the german hippogriff become a ox dull and domestic and tread out the corn place before he content to have he share thereof in peace and quietness the german government which be mild and paternal be fully aware of this and allow the utmost liberty of speech well know that thanks to that friend and ally of legitimacy tobacco the romantic visionary and somewhat refractory youth will subside into a tranquil _ ganz alltäglicher mann _ and become totally averse to any innovation which demand the sacrifice of repose the pipe which have this sedative effect on political effervescence have a still stronger similar effect it be say on the passion of love hence the german husband be proverbially sluggish but the lady none of whom smoke preserve they romanticity during they whole life and would if they have they choice give they hand to foreigner who be more attentive to they than they own countryman the young lady here be ` tis say extremely romantic in they idea of love and capable of the strongest attachment they think that any thing should be pardon to sincere passion it have be relate to I that some time ago a young man who be devotedly attach to a girl on the father refuse he consent to the marriage stab the girl and then himself a immense number of young lady attend they funeral to throw flower over the grave of the two lover assuredly the young man be only a noviciate in smoking everybody must i think admire the saxon woman they be in general handsome and have fine shape they be warm hearted and affectionate and they be almost universally well educate indeed the whole saxon people be so amiable that foreigner find themselves so happy here that they be unwilling to quit the country very many form matrimonial attachment in short this people fully merit the epithet a celebrated english traveller -lrb- sherlock -rrb- -lrb- 127 -rrb- have bestow on they when he call they a _ herrlich volk _ dresden jan 8d 1819 i have make a excursion to meissen which lie on the same bank of the river with the old town of dresden at a distance of twelve mile as there be no road on the left bank of the river to meissen you must cross the river twice to arrive at it viz once at neustadt and once at meissen the road be on the right bank i put up at the _ hirsch _ -lrb- stag -rrb- a very comfortable inn i go to meissen with a view of see the russian contingent pass the elbe on they return from france which have be evacuate in consequence of the arrangement at aix-la-chapelle they appear a fine body of man clothe _ à la française _ and seem in high spirit they seem to have imbibe liberal idea during they residence in france for some of the officer who dine at the inn at meissen speak very freely on pass event the return of the saxon contingent be expect in dresden in a day or two and there will no doubt be a great deal of rejoice among the military and they relation to meet they old comrade and friend and potent libation of _ doppel bier _ will no doubt be make meissen be say to be famous for the beauty of its woman and the few that i saw in the street do not contradict this reputation dresden jany 5th 1819 we have have several ball here waltz be the only sort of dance in fashion at dresden except now and then a polonaise i have witness a interesting spectacle in the _ grosser garten _ the pond or basin be completely freeze over and a russian prince gallitzin who be here have fit up a sort of _ montagne russ _ as they be call block of ice be place on a inclined plane to the top of which you mount by means of a staircase and then seat yourself in a sort of sledge you slide down the inclined plane with immense velocity the prince often persuade a lady to sit on this sleigh on he lap and descend together and this no doubt serve to _ break the ice _ of many a amorous intrigue this construction of the prince gallitzin have contribute to fill the _ grosser garten _ with the _ beau monde _ every day from twelve to two o'clock so that you see we be in no want of amusement at dresden the king frequently attend the theater he be a tall fine look man and be usually dress in the uniform of he foot-guard which be scarlet face with yellow the poor king have take much to heart the injustice with which he have be treat by the coalition and no doubt will not easily forget the ill-bred and insolent letter of castlereagh to the congress wherein he say that the king of saxony deserve to lose he dominion for adhering to napoleon but how the king of saxony could act otherwise i be at a loss to find : so little could he possibly deserve this treatment for adhering to napoleon that have he advice be take in the year 1805 the french would never have be able to extend they conquest so far nor to dictate law to germany but lord castlereagh seem to have either never know or wilfully forget the anterior political conduct of saxony have he be more verse in german affair or have study with more accuracy the event pass before he eye it would have be a check upon he arrogance but here be a genuine disciple of the pitt school -lrb- that school of ignorance and insolence -rrb- who set himself up as the moral regenerator of nation and as a distributor of province while he be grossly ignorant of the political system of the country on whose destiny he pretend to decide so peremptorily have castlereagh pay attention to what be go forward in germany in 1805 he would have see too that of all power prussium be the very _ last _ who with any _ shadow of justice _ could pretend to a indemnification at the expense of saxony in the year 1805 the king then elector of saxony strongly advise the prussian cabinet to forget its ancient rivalry and jealousy of austrium and to coalesce with the latter power in resist the encroachment of napoleon in order to prevent the latter from attempt the overthrow of the whole fabric of the constitution of the holy roman empire with the intricacy and fragility of which no prince in germany be better acquaint than the elector of saxony prussium however be still reluctant to engage in the contest and give no support whatever to austria napoleon defeat the austrian at austerlitz and dictate peace six month after the prussian cabinet excite by a patriotic but rash and ill-calculating party have recourse to arm not from any generous policy but because she see herself outwit by napoleon who refuse to cede to she hanover in perpetuity prussium begin the war and call on saxony who always move in she orbit to join she to the elector of saxony this war -lrb- in 1806 -rrb- appear then ill-timed and too late but with that good faith nevertheless which invariably characterize he he remain faithful to he engagement and furnish he quota of troops to prussia the saxon troops fight nobly at the battle of jena this battle annihilate all the power of prussium and lay saxony entirely at the mercy of the conqueror but napoleon not only treat saxony with moderation but with rare generosity he do not take from she a single village but aggrandize she and give to she the duchy of warsaw and to she sovereign the title of king saxony become in consequence a member of the confederation of the rhine and be bind to support the protector in all he war offensive and defensive the russian war in 1812 begin : every german state austrium and prussium in the number furnish its contingent of troops the campaign be unsuccessful the climate of russium have annihilate the french army and napoleon return to pari saxony be now expose to invasion and harass by the incursion of the cossack the king of saxony be perplex in what manner to act so as to ensure to he subject that protection which be ever uppermost in he thought feel however with he usual sagacity that every thing would ultimately depend on the disposition of austrium he repair himself to prague in order to have a interview with one of the austrian minister and to sound that cabinet austrium however still vacillate and decline state what she intention be napoleon return from paris defeat the prussian and russian at bautzen and re-occupy all saxony he then write to the king of saxony to desire he to return immediately to he dominion and to fulfil he engagement what be the king to do austrium still refuse to declare herself be he to sacrifice he crown and dominion uselessly to the vengeance of napoleon to please the emperor of russium and king of prussium who for aught he know might patch up a peace the next day and this be the more probable from they have be beat at bautzen which circumstance also might with equal probability induce austrium to coalesce with instead of against france all the other member of the confederation of the rhine remain staunch to napoleon and pour they contingent into saxony be he to be the only unfaithful ally and towards a monarch who have always treat he with the strongest mark of attachment and regard and when neither russium nor prussium be likely to give he the least assistance he therefore return to dresden and napoleon take up he grand position the whole length of the elbe from the mountain of bohemia to hamburgh thus cover the whole of saxony with he army austrium however at last come forward to join the coalition fortune change the saxon troops tire of behold they country the perpetual theater of war and trust to the generosity of the ally go over to they in the middle of a battle and decide thereby the fate of the day at leipzig the king of saxony be make a prisoner and then he be punish for what he could not help why be he to be punish more than any other member of the confederation of the rhine one would think that the seasonable defection of he troops at leipzig should have induce the ally to treat he with moderation the other state of the confederation do not abandon napoleon until after he be completely beat at leipzig and austrium refuse to accede to the coalition until a _ carte blanche _ be give she to help herself in italy let every impartial man therefore review the whole of this proceeding and then say whether the king of saxony so proverbial for he probity so adore by he subject deserve to be insult by such a unfeeling letter as that of castlereagh no the king of saxony better deserve to reign than any king of they all would they have even a small share of he virtue another proof and a still stronger one of the great integrity and honor of this excellent prince be that when napoleon offer to mediatize in he favor the various ducal house in saxony such as weimar gotha cobourg etc and to annex these country to he dominion he decline the offer would prussia austrium or hanover have be so scrupulous the young lady here tho ' well versed and delighting in various branch of litterature can not overcome that strong national propensity to tale and romance wherein the _ terrific and supernatural _ abound in all they romance accordingly this taste prevail strongly nay even in some of the romance where the scene be lay in later time there be some such anachronism as the story of a spectre i recollect read a novel the scene of which be lay in italy about the time of the battle of marengo wherein a ghost be introduce who contribute mainly to the unravelling of the piece a young lady here of considerable talent and of general information confess to I when i ask she what subject pleased she most in the way of reading that nothing give she so much delight as _ geistergeschichten _ lewi ' romance of _ the monk _ be a great favorite in germany -lrb- 128 -rrb- by the bye he poetical tale of _ alonzo and imogen _ be evidently take from a similar subject in the _ volks-mährchen _ the weather have set in very cold and the elbe be nearly freeze over it be impossible to go out of the house without a _ pelz _ or cloak line with fur for otherwise on leave a room heat by a stove the effect of the cold be almost instantaneous and bring on a ague fit this i attribute to the excessive heat keep up in the room and house by the stove as smoking be so prevalent here this contribute much also to keep the body in a praeternatural heat and render it still more obnoxious to cold on removal from a room to the open air it have be remark by a medical author in the russian campaign in 1812 that the soldier of the southern nation and province viz provençaux gascon italian spaniard and portuguese endure the cold much better and suffer less from it than the german and hollander the reason be sufficiently obvious : the former live in the open air even in the middle of winter and seldom make use of a fire to warm themselves whereas the german and dutch live in a atmosphere of stove-heat and smoke and seldom like to stir abroad in the open air during winter unless necessity oblige they hence they become half-baked as it be they nerve be unstring they flesh flabby and they become so chilly as to suffer from the smallest exposure to the atmosphere in the house in germany on account of the stove the cold be never feel whereas it be very severely in italy and spain where many of the house have no fireplace on this account i prefer germany as a winter residence for i think there be no sensation so disagreeable as to feel cold in the house in the open air i do not care a fig for it for my cloak line with bearskin protect I amply the climate here in winter be a dry cold which be much more salubrious and agreeable to I than the changeable humid climate of great britain where though the cold be not so great it be much more severely feel -lrb- 126 -rrb- tacitus _ germanium _ c viii -- ed -lrb- 127 -rrb- martin sherlock -lrb- d 1797 -rrb- author of _ lettre d'un voyageur anglai _ which be

there be a good inn at leipzig i put up at the _ hôtel de bavière _ and remain five day leipzig be a fine old gothic city it be as everybody know famous for its university and its fair which be hold twice a year in spring and in autumn and which be the greatest mart for book perhaps in the world the university of leipzig and indeed all the university of germany be in bad repute among the _ obscuranten _ and _ éteignoirs _ of the day on account of the liberal idea profess by the teacher and scholar in the university of leipzig every thing may be learn by those who chuse to apply but those who prefer remain idle may do so as there be less compulsion than at the english university there be however such a national enthusiasm for learn in all part of germany that the most careless and ill-disposed youth would never be about to support the ridicule of he fellow student be he backward in obtain prize but after all i have hear of the dissipation lawlessness and want of discipline at leipzig i can safely affirm that all these story be grossly exaggerated : and i fancy there be little other dissipation go forward than amours with _ stubenmädchen _ i do not hear of any drunkenness gaming or horse racing nor do the professor themselves who ought to be the best judge of what be go on complain of the insubordination of they pupil but what i principally admire in this and indeed in other german university be that there be no distinction of rank such as gold tassel etc no servile attention pay to sprig of nobility as in the university in england where the head of college and fellow be singularly condescend to the son of a peer a minister or a bishop perfect equality prevail in leipzig and the son of the proudest _ reichsgraf _ be allow no more priviledge than the son of a barber nor do the professor make the least difference between they in fact in spite of the vulgar belief in england respect the _ hauteur _ of the german _ noblesse _ and the vassalage of the other class i must say from experience that the german nobility show far less _ hauteur _ and have in general more really liberal idea than most part of we english aristocracy and a german burgher or shop-keeper would disdain to cringe before a nobleman as many shopkeeper aye and even gentry be sometimes know to do in england another circumstance too prove on how much more liberal a footing leipzig and other german university be than we english one which be that in england none but those who profess the religion of the church of england or conform to its ritual be admit but here all sect be tolerate and admit and all live in perfect harmony with each other the student be at liberty to chuse they place of worship and the sermon that be preach in the catholic as well as the protestant church be such as sensible man of whatever opinion might listen to with profit and without be shock by absurdity or intolerant idea mystery theologic sophistry and politics be carefully avoid and a pure morality a simple theosophy comprehensible to the meanest understanding pervade these simple discourse the consequence of this toleration and liberal spirit be that a union between the lutheran and calvinistic church have be effect i meet a number of mercantile people at the _ table d'hôte _ at leipzig in the _ hôtel de bavière _ and i enter a good deal into conversation with they but when they discover i be a englishman i could see a sudden coldness and restraint in they demeanor for we be very unpopular in germany owe to the conduct of we cabinet and they have a great distrust of we the saxon complain terribly of we government for sanction the dismemberment of they country and of the insolent letter of castlereagh it be singular enough that saxony be the only country where english goods be allow to be import free of duty but we great and good ally the king of prussium -lrb- as these goods must pass thro ' he territory -rrb- have impose a tolerably heavy transit duty i be glad of it this be as it should be i rejoice at any obstacle that be put to british commerce i rejoice when i hear of we merchant suffer and i quite delight to hear of a bankruptcy they the english merchant contribute with they gold to uphold the corrupt system of pitt and to carry on unjust unreasonable and liberticide war yes it be perfectly fit and proper that the despotic government they have contribute to restore should make they feel they gratitude if the french since they revolution have not always fight for liberty they have do so invariably for science and wherever they carry they victorious arm abuse be abolish amelioration of all kind follow and the art of life be improve we government since the accession of george iii have never raise its arm except in favor of old abuse to uphold despotism and unfair privilege or to establish commercial monopoly we victory so far from be of beneficial effect to the country wherein we gain they have be they curse we can interfere and be prodigal of money and blood to crush any attempt of the continental nation towards obtain they liberty but when it be necessary to intercede in favor of oppressed patriot then we be tell that we have no right to interfere with the domestic policy of other nation we can send ship to protect and carry off in safety a worthless royal family as at naple in 1799 but we can view with heartless indifference and even complacency the murder commit in spain by the infamous ferdinand and he severity against those to whom he owe he crown all of whom have the strongest daim to we protection as have fight with we in the same cause and contribute to we success the _ platz _ at leipzig be large and here it be that the fair be hold the theater be a elegant building and lie just outside one of the gate of the city innumerable shop of bookseller be here and it be astonishing at how cheap a rate printing in all language be carry forward there be some pleasant promenade in the environs of leipzig but this be not a time of the year to judge of the beauty of the country i go however to view the house occupy by napoleon on the eve of the battle of leipzig a monument be to be erect to the memory of poniatowsky in the spot where he perish i start from leipzig on 7th march at eleven o'clock i be five day en route from leipzig to frankfort tho ' the distance do not exceed forty-five german mile i travel in the diligence but have i know that the arrangement be so uncomfortable i should have prefer go in a _ landkutsche _ which would have make the journey in seven day and afford I a opportunity of stop every night to repose whereas in the diligence tho ' they go _ en poste _ they travel exceedingly slow and it be impossible to persuade the postillion to accelerate he usual pace he be far more careful of he horse than of he passenger this i however excuse but it be of the frequent stoppage and bad arrangement of they that i complain instead of stop at some town for one whole night or two whole night out of the five they stop almost at every town for three four and five hour so that these short stoppage do not give you time enough to go to bed and they be besides generally make in the day time or early in the morning and evening we pass thro ' the follow city and place of eminence viz lutzen the spot where gustavus adolphus be kill be close to the road on the left hand with a plain stone and the initial ga inscribe on it weimar be a very neat city and where i should like much to have staid but i have only time to view the outside of the palace and the _ stadthaus _ erfurt and gotha be both fine look city in gotha i have only time to see the outside of the _ residenz schloss _ or ducal palace which be agreeably situate on a eminence and to remark in the _ neumarkt kirche _ the portrait of duke bernard of saxe weimar and the monument of the prince of that family at erfurt there be the tomb of a count gleichen who be make prisoner in the holy land in the time of the crusade and be release by a mahometan princess on condition of he espouse she the count be already marry in germany and there he have leave he wife but such be he gratitude to the fair musulmane that he marry she with the full consent of he german wife and they all three live happily together fulda where we stop four hour appear a fine city and be situate on a eminence command a noble view of a very fertile and extensive plain the episcopal palace and the church be magnificent and the general appearance of the town be strike the bishopric of fulda be formerly a independent ecclesiastical state but be secularise at the treaty of lunéville and now form part of the territory of hesse-cassel the _ feld-zeichen _ of hesse-cassel be green and red after pass thro ' hanau where we halt three hour which give I a opportunity of view the field of battle there we proceed to frankfort and arrive there at twelve o'clock the 12th of march i put up at the _ swan _ inn in summer time the country about fulda and in general between fulda and frankfort must be very please from the variety of the feature of the ground we live very well and very cheap on the road the price of the diligence from leipzig to frankfort be eleven _ reichsthaler _ after remain three day to repose at frankfort i take my place to mayence and from thence to metz and pari in the diligence from mayence and indeed all the way to pari i find a very amusing society there be two physician and m l -lrb- emaître -rrb- a most entertaining man and of inexhaustible colloquial talent
