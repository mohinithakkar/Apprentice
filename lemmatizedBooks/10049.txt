it be very hard for she to make up she mind to die i be aware that this be not at all the general view but that it be believe as old age must be near death that it prepare the soul for that inevitable event it be not so however in many case in youth we be still so near the unseen out of which we come that death be rather pathetic than tragic -- a thing that touch all heart but to which in many case the young hero accommodate himself sweetly and courageously and amid the storm and burden of middle life there be many time when we would fain push open the door that stand ajar and behind which there be ease for all we pain or at least rest if nothing more but age which have go through both these phase be apt out of long custom and habit to regard the matter from a different view all thing that be violent have pass out of its life -- no more strong emotion such as rend the heart no great labor bring after they the weariness which be unto death but the calm of a existence which be enough for its need which afford the moderate amount of comfort and pleasure for which its being be now adapt and of which there seem no reason that there should ever be any end to passion to joy to anguish a end must come but mere gentle living determine by a framework of gentle rule and habit -- why should that ever be end when a soul have get to this retirement and be content in it it become very hard to die hard to accept the necessity of die and to accustom one 's self to the idea and still harder to consent to carry it out the woman who be the subject of the follow narrative be in this position she have live through almost everything that be to be find in life she have be beautiful in she youth and have enjoy all the triumph of beauty have be intoxicate with flattery and triumphant in conquest and mad with jealousy and the bitterness of defeat when it become evident that she day be over she have never be a bad woman or false or unkind but she have throw herself with all she heart into those different stage of be and have suffer as much as she enjoy accord to the unfailing usage of life many a day during these storm and victory when thing go against she when delight do not satisfy she she have throw out a cry into the wide air of the universe and wish to die and then she have come to the higher table-land of life and have bear all the spite of fortune -- have be poor and rich and happy and sorrowful have lose and win a hundred time over have sit at feast and kneel by deathbed and follow she best-beloved to the grave often often cry out to god above to liberate she to make a end of she anguish for that she strength be exhaust and she could bear no more but she have bear it and live through all and now have arrive at a time when all strong sensation be over when the soul be no longer either triumphant or miserable and when life itself and comfort and ease and the warmth of the sun and of the fireside and the mild beauty of home be enough for she and she require no more that be she require very little more a useful routine of hour and rule a play of reflect emotion a pleasant exercise of faculty make she feel herself still capable of the best thing in life -- of interest in she fellow-creature kindness to they and a little gentle intellectual occupation with book and man around she have not forget anything in she life -- not the excitement and delight of she beauty nor love nor grief nor the higher level she have touch in she day she do not forget the dark day when she first-born be lay in the grave nor that triumphant and brilliant climax of she life when every one point to she as the mother of a hero all these thing be like picture hang in the secret chamber of she mind to which she could go back in silent moment in the twilight seat by the fire or in the balmy afternoon when languor and sweet thought be over the world sometimes at such moment there would be hear from she a faint sob call forth it be quite as likely by the recollection of the triumph as by that of the deathb with these picture to go back upon at she will she be never dull but see herself move through the various scene of she life with a continual sympathy feeling for herself in all she trouble -- sometimes approve sometimes judge that woman who have be so pretty so happy so miserable and have go through everything that life can go through how much that be look back upon it -- passage so hard that the wonder be how she could survive they pang so terrible that the heart would seem at its last gasp but yet would revive and go on besides these however she have many mild pleasure she have a pretty house full of thing which form a graceful _ entourage _ suitable as she feel for such a woman as she be and in which she take pleasure for they own beauty -- soft chair and couch a fireplace and light which be the perfection of temper warmth and illumination she have a carriage very comfortable and easy in which when the weather be suitable she go out and a pretty garden and lawn in which when she prefer stay at home she could have she little walk or sit out under the tree she have book in plenty and all the newspaper and everything that be needful to keep she within the reflection of the busy life which she no longer care to encounter in she own person the post rarely bring she painful letter for all those impassioned interest which bring pain have die out and the sorrow of other when they be communicate to she give she a luxurious sense of sympathy yet exemption she be sorry for they but such catastrophe could touch she no more : and often she have pleasant letter which afford she something to talk and think about and discuss as if it concern she -- and yet do not concern she -- business which could not hurt she if it fail which would please she if it succeed she letter she papers she book each come at its appoint hour be all instrument of pleasure she come down-stair at a certain hour which she keep to as if it have be of the utmost importance although it be of no importance at all : she take just so much good wine so many cup of tea she repast be as regular as clockwork -- never too late never too early she whole life go on velvet rolling smoothly along without jar or interruption blameless pleasant kind people talk of she old age as a model of old age with no bitterness or sourness in it and indeed why should she have be sour or bitter it suit she far better to be kind she be in reality kind to everybody liking to see pleasant face about she the poor have no reason to complain of she she servant be very comfortable and the one person in she house who be nearer to she own level who be she companion and most important minister be very comfortable too this be a young woman about twenty a very distant relation with no claim everybody say upon she kind mistress and friend -- the daughter of a distant cousin how very few think anything at all of such a tie but lady mary have take she young namesake when she be a child and she have grow up as it be at she godmother 's footstool in the conviction that the measure existence of the old be the rule of life and that she own trifling personality count for nothing or next to nothing in its steady progress she name be mary too -- always call little mary as have once be little and not yet very much in the matter of size she be one of the pleasantest thing to look at of all the pretty thing in lady mary 's room and she have the most sheltered peaceful and pleasant life that could be conceive the only little thorn in she pillow be that whereas in the novel of which she read a great many the heroine all go and pay visit and have adventure she have none but live constantly at home there be something much more serious in she life have she know which be that she have nothing and no power of do anything for herself that she have all she life be accustom to a modest luxury which would make poverty very hard to she and that lady mary be over eighty and have make no will if she do not make any will she property would all go to she grandson who be so rich already that she fortune would be but as a drop in the ocean to he or to some great-grandchild of whom she know very little -- the descendant of a daughter long ago dead who have marry a austrian and who be therefore foreigner both in birth and name that she should provide for little mary be therefore a thing which nature demand and which would hurt nobody she have say so often but she defer the do of it as a thing for which there be no hurry for why should she die there seem no reason or need for it so long as she live nothing could be more sure more happy and serene than little mary 's life and why should she die she do not perhaps put this into word but the meaning of she smile and the manner in which she put aside every suggestion about the chance of the hereafter away from she say it more clearly than word it be not that she have any superstitious fear about the making of a will when the doctor or the vicar or she man of business the only person who ever talk to she on the subject venture periodically to refer to it she assent pleasantly -- yes certainly she must do it -- some time or other it be a very simple thing to do the lawyer say i will save you all trouble nothing but you signature will be want -- and that you give every day oh i should think nothing of the trouble she say and it would liberate you mind from all care and leave you free to think of thing more important still say the clergyman i think i be very free of care she reply then the doctor add bluntly and you will not die a hour the sooner for have make you will die say lady mary surprised and then she add with a smile i hope you do not think so little of I as to believe i would be keep back by that these gentleman all consult together in despair and ask each other what should be do they think she a egotist -- a cold-hearted old woman hold at arm 's length any idea of the inevitable and so she do but not because she be cold-hearted -- because she be so accustomed to live and have survive so many calamity and go on so long -- so long and because everything be so comfortably arrange about she -- all she little habit so firmly establish as if nothing could interfere with they to think of the day arrive which should begin with some other formulum than that of she maid 's entrance drawing aside the curtain light the cheerful fire bring she a report of the weather and then the little tray resplendent with snowy linen and shine silver and china with its bouquet of violet or a rose in the season the newspaper carefully dry and cut the letter -- every detail be so perfect so unchanging regular as the morning it seem impossible that it should come to a end and then when she come downstairs there be all the little article upon she table always ready to she hand a certain number of thing to do each at the appoint hour the slender refreshment it be necessary for she to take in which there be a little exquisite variety -- but never any change in the fact that at eleven and at three and so forth something have to be take have a woman want to abandon the peaceful life which be thus support and carry on the very framework itself would have resist it be impossible -lrb- almost -rrb- to contemplate the idea that at a give moment the whole machinery must stop she be neither without heart nor without religion but on the contrary a good woman to whom many gentle thought have be give at various portion of she career but the occasion seem to have pass for that as well as other kind of emotion the mere fact of living be enough for she the little exertion which it be well she be require to make produce a pleasant weariness it be a duty much enforce upon she by all around she that she should do nothing which would exhaust or fatigue i do not want you to think even the doctor would say you have do enough of think in you time and this she accept with great composure of spirit she have think and feel and do much in she day but now everything of the kind be over there be no need for she to fatigue herself and day follow day all warm and sheltered and pleasant people die it be true now and then out of door but they be mostly young people whose death might have be prevent have proper care be take -- who be seize with violent malady or catch sudden infection or be cut down by accident all which thing seem natural she own contemporary be very few and they be like herself -- live on in something of the same way at eighty-five all people under seventy be young and one 's contemporary be very very few nevertheless these man do disturb she a little about she will she have make more than one will in the former day during she active life but all those to whom she have bequeath she possession be dead she have survive they all and inherit from many of they which have be a hard thing in its time one day the lawyer have be more than ordinarily press he have tell she story of man who have die intestate and leave trouble and penury behind they to those whom they would have most wish to preserve from all trouble it would not have become mr furnival to say brutally to lady mary this be how you will leave you godchild when you die but he tell she story after story many of they piteous enough people think it be so troublesome a business he say when it be nothing at all -- the most easy matter in the world we be get so much less particular nowadays about formality so long as the testator 's intention be make quite apparent -- that be the chief matter and a very bad thing for we lawyer i dare say say lady mary it be unpleasant for a man to think of himself as ` the testator ' it be a very abstract title when you come to think of it pooh ' say mr furnival who have no sense of humor but if this great business be so very simple she go on one could do it no doubt for one 's self many people do but it be never advisable say the lawyer you will say it be natural for I to tell you that when they do it should be as simple as possible i give all my real property or my personal property or my share in so-and-so or my jewel or so forth to -- whoever it may be the fewer word the better -- so that nobody may be able to read between the line you know -- and the signature attest by two witness but they must not be witness that have any interest that be that have anything leave to they by the document they witness lady mary put up she hand defensively with a laugh it be still a most delicate hand like ivory a little yellowed with age but fine the vein stand out a little upon it the finger-tip still pink you speak she say as if you expect I to take the law in my own hand no no my old friend never fear you shall have the do of it whenever you please my dear lady -- whenever you please such a thing can not be do a hour too soon shall i take you instruction now lady mary laugh and say you be always a very keen man for business i remember you father use to say robert would never neglect a opening no he say with a peculiar look i have always look after my six-and-eightpence and in that case it be true the pound take care of themselves very good care say lady mary and then she bid she young companion bring that book she have be read where there be something she want to show mr furnival it be only a case in a novel but i be sure it be bad law give I you opinion she say he be oblige to be civil very civil nobody be rude to the lady mary of life and besides she be old enough to have a additional right to every courtesy but while he sit over the novel and try with unnecessary vehemence to make she see what very bad law it be and glance from she smile attention to the innocent sweetness of the girl beside she who be she loving attendant the good man 's heart be sore he say many hard thing of she in he own mind as he go away she will die he say bitterly she will go off in a moment when nobody be look for it and that poor child will be leave destitute it be all he could do not to go back and take she by she fragile old shoulder and force she to sign and seal at once but then he know very well that as soon as he find himself in she presence he would of necessity be oblige to subdue he impatience and be once more civil very civil and try to suggest and insinuate the duty which he dare not force upon she and it be very clear that till she please she would take no hint he suppose it must be that strange reluctance to part with they power which be say to be common to old people or else that horror of death and determination to keep it at arm 's length which be also common thus he do as spectator be so apt to do he force a meaning and motive into what have no motive at all and imagine lady mary the kindest of woman to be of purpose and intention risk the future of the girl whom she have bring up and whom she love -- not with passion indeed or anxiety but with tender benevolence a theory which be as false as anything could be that evening in she room lady mary in a very cheerful mood sit by a little bright unnecessary fire with she writing-book before she wait till she should be sleepy it be the only point in which she be a little hard upon she maid who in every other respect be the best-treated of servant lady mary as it happen have often no inclination for bed till the night be far advance she sleep little as be common enough at she age she be in she warm wadded dressing-gown a article in which she still show certain trace -lrb- which be indeed visible in all she wear -rrb- of she ancient beauty with she white hair becomingly arrange under a cap of cambric and lace at the last moment when she have be ready to step into bed she have change she mind and tell jervi that she would write a letter or two first and she have write she letter but still feel no inclination to sleep then there flutter across she memory somehow the conversation she have hold with mr furnival in the morning it would be amusing she think to cheat he out of some of those six-and-eightpence he pretend to think so much of it would be still more amusing next time the subject of she will be recur to to give he arm a little tap with she fan and say oh that be all settle month ago she laugh to herself at this and take out a fresh sheet of paper it be a little jest that please she do you think there be any one up yet jervis except you and I she say to the maid jervi hesitate a little and then say that she believe mr brown have not go to bed yet for he have be go over the cellar and be make up he account jervi be so explanatory that she mistress divine what be mean i suppose i have be spoil sport keep you here she say good-humoredly for it be well know that miss jervi and mr brown be engage and that they be only wait -lrb- everybody know but lady mary who never suspect it -rrb- the death of they mistress to set up a lodging-house in jermyn street where they fully intend to make they fortune then go lady mary say and call brown i have a little business paper to write and you must both witness my signature she laugh to herself a little as she say this think how she would steel a march on mr furnival i give and bequeath she say to herself playfully after jervi have hurry away she fully intend to leave both of these good servant something but then she recollect that people who be interested in a will can not sign as witness what do it matter she say to herself gayly if it ever should be wanted mary would see to that accordingly she dash off in she pretty old-fashioned handwriting which be very angular and point as be the fashion in she day and still very clear though slightly tremulous a few line in which remember playfully mr furnival 's recommendation of few word she leave to little mary all she possess add by the prompt of that recollection about the witness she will take care of the servant it fill one side only of the large sheet of notepaper which be what lady mary habitually use brown introduce timidly by jervi and a little overawed by the solemnity of the bedchamber come in and paint solidly he large signature after the spidery line of he mistress she have fold down the paper so that neither see what it be now i will go to bed lady mary say when brown have leave the room and jervi you must go to bed too yes my lady say jervi i do not approve of courtship at this hour no my lady jervi reply deprecate and disappointed why can not he tell he tale in daylight oh my lady there be no tale to tell cry the maid we be not of the gossip sort my lady neither I nor mr brown lady mary laugh and watch while the candle be put out the fire make a pleasant flicker in the room -- it be autumn and still warm and it be for company and cheerfulness that the little fire be light she like to see it dance and flicker upon the wall -- and then close she eye amid a exquisite softness of comfort and luxury life itself bear she up as softly fill up all the crevice as warmly as the downy pillow upon which she rest she still beautiful old head if she have die that night the little sheet of paper that mean so much lay openly innocently in she writing-book along with the letter she have write and look of as little importance as they there be nobody in the world who grudge old lady mary one of those pretty placid day of hers brown and jervi if they be sometimes a little impatient console each other that they be both sure of something in she will and that in the mean time it be a very good place and all the rest would have be very well content that lady mary should live forever but how wonderfully it would have simplify everything and how much trouble and pain it would have save to everybody herself include could she have die that night but naturally there be no question of die on that night when she be about to go downstairs next day lady mary give she letter to be post see the paper she have forget lie beside they she have forget all about it but the sight of it make she smile she fold it up and put it in a envelope while jervi go down-stair with the letter and then to carry out she joke she look round she to see where she would put it there be a old italian cabinet in the room with a secret drawer which it be a little difficult to open -- almost impossible for any one who do not know the secret lady mary look round she smile hesitate a little and then walk across the room and put the envelope in the secret drawer she be still fumble with it when jervi come back but there be no connection in jervi 's mind then or ever after between the paper she have sign and this old cabinet which be one of the old lady 's toy she arrange lady mary 's shawl which have drop off she shoulder a little in she unusual activity and take up she book and she favorite cushion and all the little paraphernalia that move with she and give she lady she arm to go down-stair where little mary have place she chair just at the right angle and arrange the little table on which there be so many little necessaries and convenience and be stand smile the prettiest object of all the climax of the gentle luxury and pleasantness to receive she godmother who have be she providence all she life but what a pity oh what a pity that she have not die that night ii life go on after this without any change there be never any change in that delightful house and if it be year or month or even day the youngest of its inhabitant could scarcely tell and lady mary could not tell at all this be one of she little imperfection -- a little mist which hang like the lace about she head over she memory she could not remember how time go or that there be any difference between one day and another there be sunday it be true which make a kind of gentle measure of the progress of time but she say with a smile that she think it be always Sunday -- they come so close upon each other and time fly on gentle wing that make no sound and leave no reminder she have she little ailment like anybody but in reality less than anybody see there be nothing to fret she nothing to disturb the even tenor of she day still there be time when she take a little cold or get a chill in spite of all precaution as she go from one room to another she come to be one of the marvel of the time -- a old lady who have see everybody worth see for generation back who remember as distinctly as if they have happen yesterday great event that have take place before the present age begin at all before the great statesman of we time be bear and in full possession of all she faculty as everybody say she mind as clear as ever she intelligence as active reading everything interested in everything and still beautiful in extreme old age everybody about she and in particular all the people who help to keep the thorn from she path and feel themselves to have a hand in she preservation be proud of lady mary and she be perhaps a little a very little delightfully charmingly proud of herself the doctor beguile by professional vanity feeling what a feather she be in he cap quite confident that she would reach she hundredth birthday and with a ecstatic hope that even by grace of he admirable treatment and she own beautiful constitution she might -lrb- almost -rrb- solve the problem and live forever give up troubling about the will which at a former period he have take so much interest in what be the use he say she will see we all out and the vicar though he do not give in to this be overawe by the old lady who know everything that could be teach she and to whom it seem a impertinence to utter commonplace about duty or even to suggest subject of thought mr furnival be the only man who do not cease he representation and whose anxiety about the young mary who be so bloom and sweet in the shadow of the old do not decrease but the recollection of the bit of paper in the secret drawer of the cabinet fortify he old client against all he attack she have intend it only as a jest with which some day or other to confound he and show how much wiser she be than he suppose it become quite a pleasant subject of think to she at which she laugh to herself some day when she have a suitable moment she would order he to come with all he formality and then produce she bit of paper and turn the laugh against he but oddly the very existence of that little document keep she indifferent even to the laugh it be too much trouble she only smile at he and take no more notice amuse to think how astonished he would be -- when if ever he find it out it happen however that one day in the early winter the wind change when lady mary be out for she drive at least they all vow the wind change it be in the south that genial quarter when she set out but turn about in some uncomfortable way and be a keen northeaster when she come back and in the moment of step from the carriage she catch a chill it be the coachman 's fault jervi say who allow the horse to make a step forward when lady mary be get out and keep she expose standing on the step of the carriage while he pull they up and it be jervi 's fault the footman say who be not clever enough to get she lady out or even to throw a shawl round she when she perceive how the weather have change it be always some one 's fault or some unforeseen unprecedented change that do it at the last lady mary be not accustom to be ill and do not bear it with she usual grace she be a little impatient at first and think they be make a unnecessary fuss but then there pass a few uncomfortable feverish day when she begin to look forward to the doctor 's visit as the only thing there be any comfort in afterwards she pass a night of a very agitating kind she doze and dream and awake and dream again she life seem all to run into dream -- a strange confusion be about she through which she could define nothing once wake up as she suppose she see a group round she bed the doctor -- with a candle in he hand -lrb- how should the doctor be there in the middle of the night -rrb- hold she hand or feel she pulse little mary at one side cry -- why should the child cry -- and jervi very anxious pour something into a glass there be other face there which she be sure must have come out of a dream -- so unlikely be it that they should be collect in she bedchamber -- and all with a sort of halo of feverish light about they a magnify and mysterious importance this strange scene which she do not understand seem to make itself visible all in a moment out of the darkness and then disappear again as suddenly as it come iii when she wake again it be morning and she first waking consciousness be that she must be much better the choke sensation in she throat be altogether go she have no desire to cough -- no difficulty in breathing she have a fancy however that she must be still dream for she feel sure that some one have call she by she name mary now all who could call she by she christian name be dead year ago therefore it must be a dream however in a short time it be repeat -- mary mary get up there be a great deal to do this voice confuse she greatly be it possible that all that be past have be mere fancy that she have but dream those long long year -- maturity and motherhood and trouble and triumph and old age at the end of all it seem to she possible that she might have dream the rest -- for she have be a girl much give to vision -- but she say to herself that she never could have dream old age and then with a smile she muse and think that it must be the voice that be a dream for how could she get up without jervi who have never appear yet to draw the curtain or make the fire jervi perhaps have sit up late she remember now to have see she that time in the middle of the night by she bedside so that it be natural enough poor thing that she should be late get up who be it that be call to she so she have not be so call to she who have always be a great lady since she be a girl by she mother 's side mary mary it be a very curious dream and what be more curious still be that by-and-by she could not keep still any longer but get up without think any more of jervi and go out of she room come all at once into the midst of a company of people all very busy whom she be much surprised to find at first but whom she soon accustom herself to find the greatest interest in they proceedings and curious to know what they be do they for they part do not seem at all surprise by she appearance nor do any one stop to explain as would have be natural but she take this with great composure somewhat astonished perhaps be use wherever she go to a great many observance and much respect but soon very soon become use to it then some one repeat what she have hear before it be time you get up -- for there be a great deal to do to do she say for I and then she look round upon they with that charming smile which have subjugate so many i be afraid she say you will find I of very little use i be too old now if ever i could have do much for work oh no you be not old -- you will do very well some one say not old -- lady mary feel a little offended in spite of herself perhaps i like flattery as well as my neighbor she say with dignity but then it must be reasonable to say i be anything but a very old woman -- here she pause a little perceive for the first time with surprise that she be stand and walk without she stick or the help of any one 's arm quite freely and at she ease and that the place in which she be have expand into a great place like a gallery in a palace instead of the room next she own into which she have walk a few minute ago but this discovery do not at all affect she mind or occupy she except with the most pass momentary surprise the fact be i feel a great deal better and stronger she say quite well mary and stronger than ever you be before who be it that call I mary i have have nobody for a long time to call I mary the friend of my youth be all dead i think that you must be right although the doctor i feel sure think I very bad last night i should have get alarm if i have not fall asleep again and then wake up well quite well : it be wonderful but quite true you seem to know a great deal about I i know everything about you you have have a very pleasant life and do you think you have make the best of it you old age have be very pleasant ah you acknowledge that i be old then cry lady mary with a smile you be old no longer and you be a great lady no longer do not you see that something have happen to you it be seldom that such a great change happen without be find out yes it be true i have get better all at once i feel a extraordinary renewal of strength i seem to have leave home without know it none of my people seem near I i feel very much as if i have just awaken from a long dream be it possible she say with a wonder look that i have dream all my life and after all be just a girl at home the idea be ludicrous and she laugh you see i be very much improve indeed she say she be still so far from perceive the real situation that some one come towards she out of the group of people about -- some one whom she recognize -- with the evident intention of explain to she how it be she start a little at the sight of he and hold out she hand and cry : you here i be very glad to see you -- doubly glad since i be tell a few day ago that you have -- die there be something in this word as she herself pronounce it that trouble she a little she have never be one of those who be afraid of death on the contrary she have always take a great interest in it and like to hear everything that could be tell she on the subject it give she now however a curious little thrill of sensation which she do not understand : she hope it be not superstition you have guess rightly he say quite right that be one of the word with a false meaning which be to we a mere symbol of something we can not understand but you see what it mean now it be a great shock it need not be conceal otherwise she have be quite pleasantly occupy with the interest of something new into which she have walk so easily out of she own bedchamber without any trouble and with the delightful new sensation of health and strength but when it flash upon she that she be not to go back to she bedroom again nor have any of those care and attention which have seem necessary to existence she be very much startle and shake die be it possible that she personally have die she have know it be a thing that happen to everybody but yet -- and it be a solemn matter to be prepare for and look forward to whereas -- if you mean that i too -- she say falter a little and then she add it be very surprising with a trouble in she mind which yet be not all trouble if that be so it be a thing well over and it be very wonderful how much disturbance people give themselves about it -- if this be all this be not all however she friend say you have a ordeal before you which you will not find pleasant you be go to think about you life and all that be imperfect in it and which might have be do better we be none of we perfect say lady mary with a little of that natural resentment with which one hear one 's self accuse -- however ready one may be to accuse one 's self permit I say he and take she hand and lead she away without further explanation the people about be so busy with they own occupation that they take very little notice neither do she pay much attention to the manner in which they be engage they look be friendly when they meet she eye and she too feel friendly with a sense of brotherhood but she have always be a kind woman she want to step aside and help on more than one occasion when it seem to she that some people in she way have a task above they power but this she conductor would not permit and she endeavor to put some question to he as they go along with still less success the change be very confusing she say one have no standard to judge by i should like to know something about -- the kind of people -- and the -- manner of life for a time he say you will have enough to do without troubling yourself about that this naturally produce a uneasy sensation in she mind i suppose she say rather timidly that we be not in -- what we have be accustom to call heaven that be a word he say which express rather a condition than a place but there must be a place -- in which that condition can exist she have always be fond of discussion of this kind and feel encouraged to find that they be still practicable it can not be the -- inferno that be clear at least she add with the sprightliness which be one of she characteristic perhaps -- purgatory since you infer i have something to endure word be interchangeable he say : that mean one thing to one of we which to another have a totally different signification there be something so like he old self in this that she laugh with a irresistible sense of amusement you be always fond of the oracular she say she be conscious that on former occasion if he make such a speech to she though she would have feel the same amusement she would not have express it so frankly but he do not take it at all amiss and she thought go on in other direction she feel herself say over to herself the word of the old north-country dirge which come to she recollection she know not how -- if hose and shoon thou gavest nane the whin shall prick thee intil the bane when she see that she companion hear she she ask be that true he shake he head a little it be too matter of fact he say as i need hardly tell you hose and shoon be good but they do not always sufficiently indicate the state of the heart lady mary have a consciousness which be pleasant to she that so far as the hose and shoon go she have abundant means of prepare herself for the prick of any road however rough but she have no time to indulge this please reflection for she be shortly introduce into a great building full of innumerable room in one of which she companion leave she iv the door open and she feel herself free to come out how long she have be there or what pass there be not for any one to say she come out tingling and smart -- if such word can be use -- with a intolerable recollection of the last act of she life so intolerable be it that all that have go before and all the rising up of old error and vision long dead be forget in the sharp and keen prick of this which be not over and do like the rest no one have accuse she or bring before she judge the thing that be against she she it be who have do it all -- she whose memory do not spare she one fault who remember everything but when she come to that last frivolity of she old age and saw for the first time how she have play with the future of the child whom she have bring up and abandon to the hardest fate -- for nothing for folly for a jest -- the horror and bitterness of the thought fill she mind to overflow in the first anguish of that recollection she have to go forth receive no word of comfort in respect to it meet only with a look of sadness and compassion which go to she very heart she come forth as if she have be drive away but not by any outward influence by the force of she own miserable sensation i will write she say to herself and tell they i will go -- and then she stop short remember that she could neither go nor write -- that all communication with the world she have leave be close be it all close be there no way in which a message could reach those who remain behind she catch the first passer-by whom she pass and address he piteously oh tell I -- you have be longer here than i -- can not one send a letter a message if it be only a single word where he say stop and listen so that it begin to seem possible to she that some such expedient might still be within she reach it be to england she say think he mean to ask as to which quarter of the world ah he say shake he head i fear that it be impossible but it be to set something right which out of mere inadvertence with no ill meaning -- no no -lrb- she repeat to herself -rrb- no ill-meaning -- none oh sir for charity tell I how i can find a way there must -- there must be some way he be greatly move by the sight of she distress i be but a stranger here he say i may be wrong there be other who can tell you better but -- and he shake he head sadly -- most of we would be so thankful if we could to send a word if it be only a single word to those we have leave behind that i fear i fear -- ah cry lady mary but that would be only for the tenderness whereas this be for justice and for pity and to do away with a great wrong which i do before i come here i be very sorry for you he say but shake he head once more as he go away she be more careful next time and choose one who have the look of much experience and knowledge of the place he listen to she very gravely and answer yes that he be one of the officer and could tell she whatever she want to know but when she tell he what she want he too shake he head i do not say it can not be do he say there be some case in which it have be successful but very few it have often be attempt there be no law against it those who do it do it at they own risk they suffer much and almost always they fail no oh no you say there be some who succeed no one can be more anxious than i i will give -- anything -- everything i have in the world he give she a smile which be very grave nevertheless and full of pity you forget he say that you have nothing to give and if you have that there be no one here to whom it would be of any value though she be no longer old and weak yet she be still a woman and she begin to weep in the terrible failure and contrariety of all thing but yet she would not yield she cry : there must be some one here who would do it for love i have have people who love I in my time i must have some here who have not forget I ah i know what you would say i live so long i forget they all and why should they remember I here she be touch on the arm and look round saw close to she the face of one whom it be very true she have forget she remember he but dimly after she have look long at he a little group have gather about she with grieve look to see she distress he who have touch she be the spokesman of they all there be nothing i would not do he say for you and for love and then they all sigh surround she and add but it be impossible -- impossible she stand and gaze at they recognize by degree face that she know and see in all that look of grief and sympathy which make all human soul brother impossible be not a word that have be often say to be in she life and to come out of a world in which everything could be change everything communicate in the twinkling of a eye and find a dead blank before she and around she through which not a word could go be more terrible than can be say in word she look piteously upon they with that anguish of helplessness which go to every heart and cry what be impossible to send a word -- only a word -- to set right what be wrong oh i understand she say lift up she hand i understand that to send message of comfort must not be that the people who love you must bear it as we all have do in we time and trust to god for consolation but i have do a wrong oh listen listen to I my friend i have leave a child a young creature unprovided for -- without any one to help she and must that be must she bear it and i bear it forever and no mean no way of set it right listen to I i be there last night -- in the middle of the night i be still there -- and here this morning so it must be easy to come -- only a short way and two word would be enough -- only two word they gather closer and closer round she full of compassion it be easy to come they say but not to go and one add it will not be forever comfort yourself when she come here or to a better place that will seem to you only as a day but to she cried lady mary -- to she it will be long year -- it will be trouble and sorrow and she will think i take no thought for she and she will be right the penitent say with a great and bitter cry it be so terrible that they be all silent and say not a word -- except the man who have love she who put he hand upon she arm and say we be here for that this be the fire that purge we -- to see at last what we have do and the true aspect of it and to know the cruel wrong yet never be able to make amends she remember then that this be a man who have neglect all lawful affection and break the heart of those who trust he for she sake and for a moment she forget she own burden in sorrow for he it be now that he who have call himself one of the officer come forward again for the little crowd have gather round she so closely that he have be shut out he say no one can carry you message for you that be not permit but there be still a possibility you may have permission to go yourself such thing have be do though they have not often be successful but if you will -- she shiver when she hear he and it become apparent to she why no one could be find to go -- for all she nature revolt from that step which it be evident must be the most terrible which could be think of she look at he with troubled beseech eye and the rest all look at she pitying and try to soothe she permission will not be refuse he say for a worthy cause upon which the other all speak together entreat she already they cry they have forget you live you be to they one who be dead they will be afraid of you if they can see you oh go not back be content to wait -- to wait it be only a little while the life of man be nothing it appear for a little time and then it vanish away and when she come here she will know -- or in a better place they sigh as they name the better place though some smile too feel perhaps more near to it lady mary listen to they all but she keep she eye upon the face of he who offer she this possibility there pass through she mind a hundred story she have hear of those who have _ go back _ but not one that speak of they as welcome as receive with joy as comforting those they love ah no be it not rather a curse upon the house to which they come the room be shut up the house abandon where they be suppose to appear those whom they have love best fear and flee they they be a vulgar wonder -- a thing that the poorest laugh at yet fear poor banish soul it be because no one would listen to they that they have to linger and wait and come and go she shiver and in spite of she longing and she repentance a cold dread and horror take possession of she she look round upon she companion for comfort and find none do not go they say do not go we have endure like you we wait till all thing be make clear and another say all will be make clear it be but for a time she turn from one to another and back again to the first speaker -- he who have authority he say it be very rarely successful it retard the course of you penitence it be a indulgence and it may bring harm and not good but if the meaning be generous and just permission will be give and you may go then all the strength of she nature rise in she she think of the child forsake and of the dark world round she where she would find so few friend and of the home shut up in which she have live she young and pleasant life and of the thought that must rise in she heart as though she be forsake and abandon of god and man then lady mary turn to the man who have authority she say if he whom i see to-day will give I he blessing i will go -- and they all press round she weep and kiss she hand he will not refuse he blessing they say but the way be terrible and you be still weak how can you encounter all the misery of it he command no one to try that dark and dreadful way i will try lady mary say v the night which lady mary have be conscious of in a momentary glimpse full of the exaggeration of fever have not indeed be so expeditious as she believe the doctor it be true have be pronounce she death-warrant when she see he hold she wrist and wonder what he do there in the middle of the night but she have be very ill before this and the conclusion of she life have be watch with many tear then there have rise up a wonderful commotion in the house of which little mary she godchild be very little sensible have she leave any will any instruction the slightest indication of what she wish to be do after she death mr furnival who have be very anxious to be allow to see she even in the last day of she illness say emphatically no she have never execute any will never make any disposition of she affair he say almost with bitterness in the tone of one who be ready to weep with vexation and distress the vicar take a more hopeful view he say it be impossible that so considerate a person could have do this and that there must he be sure be find somewhere if close examination be make a memorandum a letter -- something which should show what she wish for she must have know very well notwithstanding all flattery and compliment upon she good look that from day to day she existence be never to be calculate upon the doctor do not share this last opinion he say that there be no fathom the extraordinary view that people take of they own case and that it be quite possible though it seem incredible that lady mary might really be as little expectant of death on the way to ninety as a girl of seventeen but still he be of opinion that she might have leave a memorandum somewhere these three gentleman be in the foreground of affair because she have no relation to step in and take the management the earl she grandson be abroad and there be only he solicitor to interfere on he behalf man to whom lady mary 's fortune be quite unimportant although it be against they principle to let anything slip out of they hand that could aggrandize they client but who know nothing about the circumstance -- about little mary about the old lady 's peculiarity in any way therefore the person who have surround she in she life and mr furnival she man of business be the person who really have the management of everything they wife interfere a little too or rather the one wife who only could do so -- the wife of the vicar who come in beneficently at once and take poor little mary in she first desolation out of the melancholy house mr vicar do this without any hesitation know very well that in all probability lady mary have make no will and consequently that the poor girl be destitute a great deal be say about the hardness of the world and the small consideration that be show for a destitute dependent in such circumstance but this be not true and as a matter of fact there be never or very rarely such profound need in the world without a great deal of kindness and much pity the three gentleman all along have be entirely in mary 's interest they have not expect legacy from the old lady or any advantage to themselves it be of the girl that they have think and when now they examine everything and inquire into all she way and what she have do it be of mary they be think but mr furnival be very certain of he point he know that lady mary have make no will time after time he have press it upon she he be very sure even while he examine she writing-table and turn out all the drawer that nothing would be find the little italian cabinet have _ chiffon _ in its drawer fragment of old lace piece of ribbon little nothing of all sort nobody thought of the secret drawer and if they have think of it where could a place have be find less likely if she have ever make a will she could have have no reason for conceal it to be sure they do not reason in this way be simply unaware of any place of concealment at all and mary know nothing about this search they be make she do not know how she be herself leave when the first misery of grief be exhaust she begin indeed to have trouble thought in she own mind -- to expect that the vicar would speak to she or mr furnival send for she and tell she what she be to do but nothing be say to she the vicar 's wife have ask she to come for a long visit and the anxious people who be forever talk over this subject and consult what be best for she have come to no decision as yet as to what must be say to the person chiefly concern it be too heart-rending to have to put the real state of affair before she the doctor have no wife but he have a anxious mother who though she would not for the world have be unkind to the poor girl yet be very anxious that she should be dispose of and out of she son 's way it be true that the doctor be forty and mary only eighteen -- but what then match of that kind be see every day and he heart be so soft to the child that he mother never know from one day to another what might happen she have naturally no doubt at all that mary would seize the first hand hold out to she and as time go on hold many a anxious consultation with the vicar 's wife on the subject you can not have she with you forever she say she must know one time or another how she be leave and that she must learn to do something for herself oh say the vicar 's wife how be she to be tell it be heart-rending to look at she and to think -- nothing but luxury all she life and now in a moment destitution i be very glad to have she with I : she be a dear little thing and so nice with the child and if some good man would only step in -- the doctor 's mother tremble for that a good man should step in be exactly what she fear that be a thing that can never be depend upon she say and marriage make out of compassion be just as bad as mercenary marriage oh no my dear mrs bowyer mary have a great deal of character you should put more confidence in she than that no doubt she will be much cast down at first but when she know she will rise to the occasion and show what be in she poor little thing what be in a girl of eighteen and one that have lie on the rose and feed on the lily all she life oh i could find it in my heart to say a great deal about old lady mary that would not be pleasant why do she bring she up so if she do not mean to provide for she i think she must have be at heart a wicked old woman oh no we must not say that i dare say as my son say she always mean to do it sometime - sometime how long do she expect to live i wonder well say the doctor 's mother it be wonderful how little old one feel sometimes within one 's self even when one be well up in year she be of the faction of the old instead of be like mr bowyer who be not much over thirty of the faction of the young she could make excuse for lady mary but she think that it be unkind to bring the poor little girl here in ignorance of she real position and in the way of man who though old enough to know better be still capable of folly -- as what man be not when a girl of eighteen be concerned i hope she add that the earl will do something for she certainly he ought to when he know all that he grandmother do and what she intention must have be he ought to make she a little allowance that be the least he can do -- not to be sure such a provision as we all hope lady mary be go to make for she but enough to live upon mr furnival i believe have write to he to that effect hush cry the vicar 's wife indeed she have be make sign to the other lady who stand with she back to the door for some moment mary have come in while this conversation be go on she have not pay any attention to it and yet she ear have be catch by the name of lady mary and the earl and mr furnival for whom be it that the earl should make a allowance enough to live upon whom lady mary have not provide for and whom mr furnival have write about when she sit down to the needle-work in which she be help mr vicar it be not to be suppose that she should not ponder these word -- for some time very vaguely not perceive the meaning of they and then with a start she wake up to perceive that there must be something mean some one -- even some one she know and then the needle drop out of the girl 's hand and the pinafore she be make fall on the floor some one it must be herself they mean who but she could be the subject of that earnest conversation she begin to remember a great many conversation as earnest which have be stop when she come into the room and the look of pity which have be bent upon she she have think in she innocence that this be because she have lose she godmother she protectress -- and have be very grateful for the kindness of she friend but now another meaning come into everything mr bowyer have accompany she visitor to the door still talk and when she return she face be very grave but she smile when she meet mary 's look and say cheerfully -- how kind of you my dear to make all those pinafore for I the little one will not know themselves they never be so fine before oh mrs bowyer cry the girl i have guess something and i want you to tell I be you keep I for charity and be it i that be leave -- without any provision and that mr furnival have write -- she could not finish she sentence for it be very bitter to she as may be suppose i do not know what you mean my dear cry the vicar 's wife charity -- well i suppose that be the same as love -- at least it be so in the 13th chapter of 1st corinthian you be stay with we i hope for love if that be what you mean upon which she take the girl in she arm and kiss she and cry as woman must my dearest she say as you have guess the worst it be better to tell you lady mary -- i do not know why oh i do not wish to blame she -- have leave no will and my dear my dear you who have be bring up in luxury you have not a penny here the vicar 's wife give mary a closer hug and kiss she once more we love you all the better -- if that be possible she say how many thought will fly through a girl 's mind while she head rest on some kind shoulder and she be be console for the first calamity that have touch she life she be neither ungrateful nor unresponsive but as mr bowyer press she close to she kind breast and cry over she mary do not cry but think -- see in a moment a succession of scene and realize in a moment so complete a new world that all she pain be quell by the hurry and rush in she brain as she force rally to sustain she she withdraw from she kind support after a moment with eye tearless and shine the color mount to she face and not a sign of discouragement in she nor yet of sentiment though she grasp she kind friend 's hand with a pressure which she innocent small finger seem incapable of give one have read of such thing -- in book she say with a faint courageous smile and i suppose they happen -- in life oh my dear too often in life though how people can be so cruel so indifferent so careless of the happiness of those they love -- here mary press she friend 's hand till they hurt and cry not cruel not indifferent i can not hear a word -- well dear it be like you to feel so -- i know you would and i will not say a word oh mary if she ever think of such thing now -- i hope she will not -- i hope she can not cry the girl with once more a vehement pressure of she friend 's hand what be that mr bowyer say look round it be somebody in the next room i suppose no dear i hope so too for she would not be happy if she remember mary dry you eye my dear try not to think of this i be sure there be some one in the next room and you must try not to look wretched for all we sake -- wretched cry mary spring up i be not wretched and she turn with a countenance glowing and full of courage to the door but there be no one there -- no visitor linger in the smaller room as sometimes happen i think i hear some one come in say the vicar 's wife do not you hear something mary i suppose it be because i be so agitate with all this but i could have swear i hear some one come in there be nobody say mary who in the shock of the calamity which have so suddenly change the world to she be perfectly calm she do not feel at all disposed to cry or give way it go to she head with a thrill of pain which be excitement as well like a strong stimulant suddenly apply and she add i should like to go out a little if you do not mind just to get use to the idea my dear i will get my hat in a moment -- no please it be not unkindness but i must think it over by myself -- by myself mary cry she hurry away while mr bowyer take another survey of the outer room and call the servant to know who have be call nobody have be call the maid say but she mistress still shake she head it must have be some one who do not ring who just open the door she say to herself that be the worst of the country it might be mrs blunt or sophium blackburn or the curate or half-a-dozen people -- and they have just go away when they hear I cry how could i help cry but i wonder how much they hear whoever it be vi it be winter and snow be on the ground lady mary find herself on the road that lead through she own village go home it be like a picture of a wintry night -- like one of those picture that please the child at christmas a little snow sprinkle on the roof just enough to define they and on the edge of the road every cottage window show a ruddy glimmer in the twilight the man come home from they work the child tie up in comforter and cap steal in from the slide and from the pond where they be forbid to go and in the distance the tree of the great house stand up dark turn the twilight into night she have a curious enjoyment in it simple like that of a child and a wish to talk to some one out of the fullness of she heart she overtake she step be far lighter than he one of the man go home from he work and speak to he tell he with a smile not to be afraid but he never so much as raise he head and go plod on with he heavy step not know that she have speak to he she be startle by this but say to herself that the man be dull that they perception be confuse and that it be get dark and go on pass he quickly he breath make a cloud in the air as he walk and he heavy plodding step sound into the frosty night she perceive that she own be invisible and inaudible with a curious momentary sensation half of pleasure half of pain she feel no cold and she see through the twilight as clearly as if it have be day there be no fatigue or sense of weakness in she but she have the strange wistful feeling of a exile return after long year not know how he may find those he have leave at one of the first house in the village there be a woman standing at she door look out for she child one who know lady mary well she stop quite cheerfully to bid she good evening as she have do in she vigorous day before she grow old it be a little experiment too she think it possible that catherine would scream out and perhaps fly from she but surely would be easily reassure when she hear the voice she know and see by she one who be no ghost but she own kind mistress but catherine take no notice when she speak she do not so much as turn she head lady mary stand by she patiently with more and more of that wistful desire to be recognize she put she hand timidly upon the woman 's arm who be think of nothing but she boy and call to they strain she eye in the fading light do not be afraid they be come they be safe she say press catherine 's arm but the woman never move she take no notice she call to a neighbor who be pass to ask if she have see the child and the two stand and talk in the dim air not conscious of the third who stand between they look from one to another astonished paralyzed lady mary have not be prepare for this she could not believe it even now she repeat they name more and more anxiously and even pluck at they sleeve to call they attention she stand as a poor dependent sometimes stand wistful civil try to say something that will please while they talk and take no notice and then the neighbor pass on and catherine go into she house it be hard to be leave out in the cold when other go into they cheerful house but to be thus leave outside of life to speak and not be hear to stand unseen astounded unable to secure any attention she have think they would be frightened but it be not they who be frighten a great panic seize the woman who be no more of this world she have almost rejoice to find herself back walk so lightly so strongly find everything easy that have be so hard and yet but a few minute have pass and she know never more to be deceive that she be no longer of this world what if she should be condemn to wander forever among familiar place that know she no more appealing for a look a word to those who could no longer see she or hear she cry or know of she presence terror seize upon she a chill and pang of fear beyond description she feel a impulse to fly wildly into the dark into the night like a lose creature to find again somehow she could not tell how the door out of which she have come and beat upon it wildly with she hand and implore to be take home for a moment she stand look round she lose and alone in the wide universe no one to speak to she no one to comfort she outside of life altogether other rustic figure slow-stepping leisurely at they ease go and come one at a time but in this place where every stranger be a object of curiosity no one cast a glance at she she be as if she have never be presently she find herself enter she own house it be all shut and silent -- not a window light along the whole front of the house which use to twinkle and glitter with light it soothe she somewhat to see this as if in evidence that the place have change with she she go in silently and the darkness be as day to she she own room be all shut up yet be open to she step which no external obstacle could limit there be still the sound of life below stair and in the housekeeper 's room a cheerful party gather round the fire it be then that she turn first with some wistful human attraction towards the warmth and light rather than to the still place in which she own life have be pass mr prentiss the housekeeper have she daughter with she on a visit and the daughter 's baby lay asleep in a cradle place upon two chair outside the little circle of woman round the table one of whom be jervis lady mary 's maid jervi sit and work and cry and mix she word with little sob i never think as i should have have to take another place she say brown and I we make sure of a little something to start upon he be be here for twenty year and so have you mr prentiss and I as nobody can say i be not faithful night and day i never have that confidence in my lady to expect anything prentiss say oh

eye hold out she hand in appeal receive every word as if it have be a blow -- though she know it be useless lady mary could not help it she cry out to they have pity upon I have pity upon I i be not cruel as you think with a keen anguish in she voice which seem to be sharp enough to pierce the very air and go up to the sky and so perhaps it do but never touch the human atmosphere in which she stand a stranger jervi be thread she needle when she mistress utter that cry but she hand do not tremble nor do the thread deflect a hair 's - breadth from the straight line the young mother alone seem to be move by some faint disturbance hush she say be he wake -- look towards the cradle but as the baby make no further sound she too return to she sewing and they sit bend they head over they work round the table and continue they talk the room be very comfortable bright and warm as lady mary have like all she room to be the warm firelight dance upon the wall the woman talk in cheerful tone she stand outside they circle and look at they with a wistful face they notice would have be more sweet to she as she stand in that great humiliation than in other time the look of a queen but what be the matter with baby the mother say rise hastily it be with no servile intention of secure a look from that little prince of life that she who be not of this world have step aside forlorn and look at he in he cradle though she be not of this world she be still a woman and have nurse she child in she arm she bent over the infant by the soft impulse of nature tenderly with no interested thought but the child see she be it possible he turn he head towards she and flicker he baby hand and coo with that indescribable voice that go to every woman 's heart lady mary feel such a thrill of pleasure go through she as no incident have give she for long year she put out she arm to he as he mother snatch he from he little bed and he which be more wonderful stretch towards she in he innocence turn away from they all he want to go to some one cry the mother oh look look for god 's sake who be there that the child see there be no one there -- not a soul now dearie dearie be reasonable you can see for yourself there be not a creature say the grandmother oh my baby my baby he see something we can not see the young woman cry something have happen to he father or he be go to be take from I she say hold the child to she in a sudden passion the other woman rush to she to console she -- the mother with reason and jervi with poetry it be the angel whisper like the song say oh the pang that be in the heart of the other whom they could not hear she stand wonder how it could be -- wonder with a amazement beyond word how all that be in she heart the love and the pain and the sweetness and bitterness could all be hide -- all hide by that air in which the woman stand so clear she hold out she hand she speak to they tell who she be but no one pay any attention only the little dog fido who have be bask by the fire spring up look at she and retreat slowly backwards till he reach the wall sit down there and look at she again with now and then a little bark of inquiry the dog see she this give she a curious pang of humiliation yet pleasure she go away out of that little center of human life in a great excitement and thrill of she whole be the child have see she and the dog but oh heaven how be she to work out she purpose by such auxiliary as these she go up to she old bedchamber with unshed tear heavy about she eye and a pathetic smile quiver on she mouth it touch she beyond measure that the child should have that confidence in she then god be still with I she say to herself she room which have be so warm and bright lay desolate in the stillness of the night but she want no light for the darkness be no darkness to she she look round she for a little wonder to think how far away from she now be this scene of she old life but feeling no pain in the sight of it -- only a kind indulgence for the foolish simplicity which have take so much pride in all these infantile element of live she go to the little italian cabinet which stand against the wall feeling now at least that she could do as she would -- that here there be no blank of human unconsciousness to stand in she way but she be meet by something that baffle and vex she once more she feel the polished surface of the wood under she hand and see all the pretty ornamentation the inlaid-work the delicate carving which she know so well they swim in she eye a little as if they be part of some phantasmagoria about she exist only in she vision yet the smooth surface resist she touch and when she withdraw a step from it it stand before she solidly and square as it have stand always -- a glory to the place she put forth she hand upon it and could have trace the wave line of the exquisite work in which some artist soul have work itself out in the old time but though she thus see it and feel she could not with all she endeavor find the handle of the drawer the richly-wrought knob of ivory the little door that open into the secret place how long she stand by it attempt again and again to find what be as familiar to she as she own hand what be before she visible in every line what she feel with finger which begin to tremble she could not tell time do not count with she as with common man she do not grow weary or require refreshment or rest like those who be still of this world put at length she head grow giddy and she heart fail a cold despair take possession of she soul she could do nothing then -- nothing neither by help of man neither by use of she own faculty which be greater and clearer than ever before she sink down upon the floor at the foot of that old toy which have please she in the softness of she old age to which she have trust the fortune of another by which in wantonness and folly she have sin she have sin and she think she see stand round she companion in the land she have leave say it be impossible impossible with infinite pity in they eye and the face of he who have give she permission to come yet who have say no word to she to encourage she in what be against nature and there come into she heart a longing to fly to get home to be back in the land where she fellow be and she appoint place a child lose how pitiful that be without power to reason and divine how help will come but a soul lose outside of one method of existence withdraw from the other know no way to retrace its step nor how help can come there have be no bitterness in pass from earth to the land where she have go but now there come upon she soul in all the power of she new faculty the bitterness of death the place which be hers she have forsake and leave and the place that have be hers know she no more vii mary when she leave she kind friend in the vicarage go out and take a long walk she have receive a shock so great that it take all sensation from she and throw she into the seething and surge of a excitement altogether beyond she control she could not think until she have get familiar with the idea which indeed have be vaguely shape itself in she mind ever since she have emerge from the first profound gloom and prostration of the shadow of death she have never definitely think of she position before -- never even ask herself what be to become of she when lady mary die she do not see any more than lady mary do why she should ever die and girl who have never want anything in they life who have have no sharp experience to enlighten they be slow to think upon such subject she have not expect anything she mind have not form any idea of inheritance and it have not surprised she to hear of the earl who be lady mary 's natural heir nor to feel herself separate from the house in which all she previous life have be pass but there have be gradually dawn upon she a sense that she have come to a crisis in she life and that she must soon be tell what be to become of she it be not so urgent as that she should ask any question but it begin to appear very clearly in she mind that thing be not to be with she as they have be she have hear the complaint and astonishment of the servant to whom lady mary have leave nothing with resentment -- jervi who could not marry and take she lodging-house but must wait until she have save more money and weep to think after all she devotion of have to take another place and mr prentiss the housekeeper who be cynical and expound lady mary 's kindness to she servant to be the issue of a refined selfishness and brown who have swear subdue oath and have take the liberty of represent himself to mary as in the same box with herself mary have be angry very angry at all this and she have not by word or look give any one to understand that she feel herself in the same box but yet she have be vaguely anxious curious desire to know and she have not even begin to think what she should do that seem a sort of affront to she godmother 's memory at all event until some one have make it clear to she but now in a moment with she first consciousness of the importance of this matter in the sight of other a consciousness of what it be to herself come into she mind a change of everything -- a new life -- a new world and not only so but a severance from the old world -- a give up of everything that have be most near and pleasant to she these thought be drive through she mind like the snowflake in a storm the year have slide on since lady mary 's death winter be begin to yield to spring the snow be over and the great cold and other change have take place the great house have be let and the family who have take it have be about a week in possession they come have inflict a wound upon mary 's heart but everybody have urge upon she the idea that it be much better the house should be let for a time till everything be settle when all be settle thing would be different mr vicar do not say you can then do what you please but she do convey to mary 's mind somehow a sort of inference that she would have something to do it with and when mary have protest it shall never be let again with my will the kind woman have say tremulously well my dear and have change the subject all these thing now come to mary 's mind they have be afraid to tell she they have think it would be so much to she -- so important such a crush blow to have nothing -- to be destitute to be write about by mr furnival to the earl to have she case represent -- mary feel herself sting by such unendurable suggestion into a energy -- a determination -- of which she soft young life have know nothing no one should write about she or ask charity for she she say to herself she have go through the wood and round the park which be not large and now she could not leave these beloved precinct without go to look at the house up to this time she have not have the courage to go near the house but to the commotion and fever of she mind every violent sensation be congenial and she go up the avenue now almost gladly with a little demonstration to herself of energy and courage why not that as well as all the rest it be once more twilight and the dimness favor she design she want to go there unseen to look up at the window with they alien light and to think of the time when lady mary sit behind the curtain and there be nothing but tenderness and peace throughout the house there be a light in every window along the entire front a lavishness of firelight and lamplight which tell of a household in which there be many inhabitant mary 's mind be so deeply absorb and perhaps she eye so dim with tear that she could scarcely see what be before she when the door open suddenly and a lady come out i will go myself she say in a agitate tone to some one behind she do not get yourself laugh at say a voice from within the sound of the voice rouse the young spectator she look with a little curiosity mix with anxiety at the lady who have come out of the house and who start too with a gesture of alarm when she see mary move in the dark who be you she cry out in a tremble voice and what do you want here then mary make a step or two forward and say i must ask you pardon if i be trespassing i do not know there be any objection -- this stranger to make a objection it bring something like a tremulous laugh to mary 's lip oh there be no objection say the lady only we have be a little put out i see now you be the young lady who -- you be the young lady that -- you be the one that -- suffer most i be lady mary 's goddaughter say the girl i have live here all my life oh my dear i have hear all about you the lady cry the people who have take the house be merely rich people they have no other characteristic and in the vicarage as well as in the other house about it be say when they be speak of that it be a good thing they be not people to be visit since nobody could have have the heart to visit stranger in lady mary 's house and mary could not but feel a keen resentment to think that she story such as it be the story which she have only now hear in she own person should be discuss by such people but the speaker have a look of kindness and so far as could be see of perplexity and fret anxiety in she face and have be in a hurry but stop herself in order to show she interest i wonder she say impulsively that you can come here and look at the place again after all that have pass i never think say mary that there could be -- any objection oh how can you think i mean that -- how can you pretend to think so cry the other impatiently but after you have be treat so heartlessly so unkindly -- and leave poor thing they tell I without a penny without any provision -- i do not know you cry mary breathless with quick rise passion i do not know what right you can have to meddle with my affair the lady stare at she for a moment without speak and then she say all at once that be quite true -- but it be rude as well for though i have no right to meddle with you affair i do it in kindness because i take a interest in you from all i have hear mary be very accessible to such a reproach and argument she face flush with a sense of she own churlishness i beg you pardon she say i be sure you mean to be kind well say the stranger that be perhaps go too far on the other side for you can not even see my face to know what i mean but i do mean to be kind and i be very sorry for you and though i think you have be treat abominably all the same i like you better for not allow any one to say so and now do you know where i be go i be go to the vicarage -- where you be live i believe -- to see if the vicar or he wife or you or all of you together could do a thing for I oh i be sure mr bowyer -- say mary with a voice much less assure than she word you must not be too sure my dear i know she do not mean to call upon I because my husband be a city man that be just as she please i be not very fond of city man myself but there be no reason why i should stand on ceremony when i want something be there now my dear i want to know -- do not laugh at I i be not superstitious so far as i be aware but -- tell I in you time be there ever any disturbance any appearance you could not understand any -- well i do not like the word ghost it be disrespectful if there be anything of the sort : and it be vulgar if there be not but you know what i mean be there anything -- of that sort -- in you time in you time poor mary have scarcely realize yet that she time be over she heart refuse to allow it when it be thus so abruptly bring before she but she oblige herself to subdue these rise rebellion and to answer though with some _ hauteur _ there be nothing of the kind that i ever hear of there be no superstition or ghost in we house she think it be the vulgar desire of new people to find a conventional mystery and it seem to mary that this be a desecration of she home mr turner however -lrb- for that be she name -rrb- do not receive the intimation as the girl expect but look at she very gravely and say that make it a great deal more serious as if to herself she pause and then add you see the case be this i have a little girl who be we youngest who be just my husband 's idol she be a sweet little thing though perhaps i should not say it be you fond of child then i almost feel sure you would think so too not a mope child at all or too clever or anything to alarm one well you know little connie since ever we come in have see a old lady walk about the house a old lady say mary with a involuntary smile oh yes i laugh too the first time i say it would be old mr prentiss or perhaps the char-woman or some old lady from the village that have be in the habit of come in the former people 's time but the child get very angry she say it be a real lady she would not allow I to speak then we think perhaps it be some one who do not know the house be let and have walk in to look at it but nobody would go on come like that with all the sign of a large family in the house and now the doctor say the child must be low that the place perhaps do not agree with she and that we must send she away now i ask you how could i send little connie away the apple of she father 's eye i should have to go with she of course and how could the house get on without I naturally we be very anxious and this afternoon she have see she again and sit there cry because she say the dear old lady look so sad i just seize my hat and walk out to come to you and you friend at the vicarage to see if you could help I mrs bowyer may look down upon a city person -- i do not mind that but she be a mother and surely she would feel for a mother cry the poor lady vehemently put up she hand to she wet eye oh indeed indeed she would i be sure now that she will call directly we do not know what a -- mary stop herself in say what a nice woman you be which she think would be rude though poor mr turner would have like it but then she shake she head and add what could any of we do to help you i have never hear of any old lady there never be anything -- i know all about the house everything that have ever happen and prentiss will tell you there be nothing of that kind -- indeed there be nothing you must have -- but here mary stop again for to suggest that a new family a city family should have bring a apparition of they own with they be too ridiculous a idea to be entertain miss vivian say mr turner will you come back with I and speak to the child at this mary falter a little i have never be there -- since the -- funeral she say the good woman lay a kind hand upon she shoulder caressing and soothing you be very fond of she -- in spite of the way she have use you oh how dare you or any one to speak of she so she use I as if i have be she dearest child she be more kind to I than a mother there be no one in the world like she mary cry and yet she leave you without a penny oh you must be a good girl to feel for she like that she leave you without -- what be you go to do my dear i feel like a friend i feel like a mother to you though you do not know I you must not think it be only curiosity you can not stay with you friend for ever -- and what be you go to do there be some case in which it be more easy to speak to a stranger than to one 's dearest and oldest friend mary have feel this when she rush out not know how to tell the vicar 's wife that she must leave she and find some independence for herself it be however strange to rush into such a discussion with so little warning and mary 's pride be very sensitive she say i be not go to burden my friend with a little indignation but then she remember how forlorn she be and she voice soften i must do something -- but i do not know what i be good for she say tremble and on the verge of tear my dear i have hear a great deal about you say the stranger it be not rash though it may look so come back with I directly and see connie she be a very interesting little thing though i say it it be wonderful sometimes to hear she talk you shall be she governess my dear oh you need not teach she anything -- that be not what i mean i think i be sure you will be the saving of she miss vivian and such a lady as you be it will be everything for the other girl to live with you do not stop to think but just come with I you shall have whatever you please and always be treat like a lady oh my dear consider my feeling as a mother and come oh come to connie i know you will save she it be a inspiration come back come back with I it seem to mary too like a inspiration what it cost she to cross that threshold and walk in a stranger to the house which have be all she life as she own she never say to any one but it be independence it be deliverance from entreaty and remonstrance without end it be a kind of set right so far as could be of the balance which have get so terribly wrong no write to the earl now no appeal to friend anything in all the world -- much more honest service and kindness -- must be better than that viii tell the young lady all about it connie say she mother but connie be very reluctant to tell she be very shy and clung to she mother and hide she face in she ample dress and though presently she be beguile by mary 's voice and in a short time come to she side and clung to she as she have cling to mr turner she still keep she secret to herself they be all very kind to mary the elder girl stand round in a respectful circle look at she while they mother exhort they to take a pattern by miss vivian the novelty the awe which she inspire the real kindness about she end in overcome in mary 's young mind the first miserable impression of such a return to she home it give she a kind of pleasure to write to mr bowyer that she have find employment and have think it better to accept it at once do not be angry with I and i think you will understand I she say and then she give herself up to the strange new scene the way of the large simple-minded family homely yet kindly so transform lady mary 's graceful old room that they no longer look the same place and when mary sit down with they at the big heavy-laden table surround with the hum of so large a party it be impossible for she to believe that everything be not new about she in no way could the saddening recollection of a home from which the chief figure have disappear have be more completely break up afterwards mr turner take she aside and beg to know which be mary 's old room for i should like to put you there as if nothing have happen oh do not put I there mary cry so much have happen but this seem a refinement to the kind woman which it be far better for she young guest not to yield to the room mary have occupy have be next to she godmother 's with a door between and when it turn out that connie with a elder sister be in lady mary 's room everything seem perfectly arrange in mr turner 's eye she think it be providential -- with a simple belief in mary 's power that in other circumstance would have be amusing but there be no amusement in mary 's mind when she take possession of the old room as if nothing have happen she sit by the fire for half the night in a agony of silent recollection and think go over the last day of she godmother 's life call up everything before she and realize as she have never realize till now the lonely career on which she be set out the subjection to the will and convenience of stranger in which henceforth she life must be pass this be a kind woman who have open she door to the destitute girl but notwithstanding however great the torture to mary there be no escape this room which be haunt by the saddest recollection of she life of such thing she must no longer complain -- nay she must think of nothing but thank the mistress of the house for she thoughtfulness for the wish to be kind which so often exceed the performance the room be warm and well light the night be very calm and sweet outside nothing have be touch or change of all she little decoration the ornament which have be so delightful to she girlhood a large photograph of lady mary hold the chief place over the mantel-piece represent she in the fullness of she beauty -- a photograph which have be take from the picture paint age ago by a royal academician it fortunately be so little like lady mary in she old age that save as a thing which have always hang there and belong to she happier life it do not affect the girl but no picture be necessary to bring before she the well-remembered figure she could not realize that the little movement she hear on the other side of the door be any other than those of she mistress she friend she mother for all these name mary lavish upon she in the fullness of she heart the blame that be be cast upon lady mary from all side make this child of she bounty but more deeply she partisan more warm in she adoration she would not for all the inheritance of the world have acknowledge even to herself that lady mary be in fault mary feel that she would rather a thousand time be poor and have to gain she daily bread than that she who have nourish and cherish she should have be force in she cheerful old age to think before she choose to do so of parting and farewell and the inevitable end she think like every young creature in strange and painful circumstance that she would be unable to sleep and do indeed lie awake and weep for a hour or more thinking of all the change that have happen but sleep overtake she before she know while she mind be still full of these thought and she dream be endless confused full of misery and longing she dream a dozen time over that she hear lady mary 's soft call through the open door -- which be not open but shut closely and lock by the sister who now inhabit the next room and once she dream that lady mary come to she bedside and stand there look at she earnestly with the tear flow from she eye mary struggle in she sleep to tell she benefactress how she love she and approve of all she have do and want nothing -- but feel herself bind as by a nightmare so that she could not move or speak or even put out a hand to dry those tear which it be intolerable to she to see and wake with the struggle and the miserable sensation of see she dearest friend weep and be unable to comfort she the moon be shine into the room throw part of it into a cold full light while blackness lay in all corner the impression of she dream be so strong that mary 's eye turn instantly to the spot where in she dream she godmother have stand to be sure there be nobody there but as she consciousness return and with it the sweep of painful recollection the sense of change the miserable contrast between the present and the past -- sleep flee from she eye she fall into the vividly awake condition which be the alternative of broken sleep and gradually as she lay there come upon she that mysterious sense of another presence in the room which be so subtle and indescribable she neither see anything nor hear anything and yet she feel that some one be there she lay still for some time and hold she breath listen for a movement even for the sound of breathing -- scarcely alarmed yet sure that she be not alone after a while she raise herself on she pillow and in a low voice ask who be there be any one there there be no reply no sound of any description and yet the conviction grow upon she she heart begin to beat and the blood to mount to she head she own be make so much sound so much commotion that it seem to she she could not hear anything save those beating and pulsing yet she be not afraid after a time however the oppression become more than she could bear she get up and light she candle and search through the familiar room but she find no trace that any one have be there the furniture be all in its usual order there be no hiding-place where any human thing could find refuge when she have satisfy herself and be about to return to bed suppress a sensation which must she say to herself be altogether fantastic she be startle by a low knock at the door of communication then she hear the voice of the elder girl oh miss vivian what be it have you see anything a new sense of anger disdain humiliation sweep through mary 's mind and if she have see anything she say to herself what be that to those stranger she reply no nothing what should i see in a tone which be almost haughty in spite of herself i think it might be -- the ghost oh please do not be angry i think i hear this door open but it be lock oh perhaps it be very silly but i be so frightened miss vivian go back to bed say mary there be no -- ghost i be go to sit up and write some -- letter you will see my light under the door oh thank you cry the girl mary remember what a consolation and strength in all wakefulness have be the glimmer of the light under she godmother 's door she smile to think that she herself so desolate as she be be able to afford this innocent comfort to another girl and then sit down and weep quietly feel she solitude and the chill about she and the dark and the silence the moon have go behind a cloud there seem no light but she small miserable candle in earth and heaven and yet that poor little speck of light keep up the heart of another -- which make she smile again in the middle of she tear and by-and-by the commotion in she head and heart calm down and she too fall asleep next day she hear all the float legend that be begin to rise in the house they all arise from connie 's question about the old lady whom she have see go up-stair before she the first evening after the new family 's arrival it be in the presence of the doctor -- who have come to see the child and whose surprise at find mary there be almost ludicrous -- that she hear the story though much against he will there can be no need for troubling miss vivian about it he say in a tone which be almost rude but mr turner be not sensitive when miss vivian have just come like a dear to help we with connie the good woman cry of course she must hear it doctor for otherwise how could she know what to do be it true that you have come here -- _ here _ to help -- good heaven miss mary _ here _ why not here mary say smile as but she could i be connie 's governess doctor he burst out into that suppress roar which serve a man instead of tear and jump up from he seat clench he fist the clenched fist be to the intention of the dead woman whose fault this be and if it have ever enter the doctor 's mind as he mother suppose to marry this forlorn child and thus bestow a home upon she whether she would or no no doubt he would now have attempt to carry out that plan but as no such thing have occur to he the doctor only show he sense of the intolerable by look and gesture i must speak to the vicar i must see furnival it can not be permit he cry do you think i shall not be kind to she doctor cry mr turner oh ask she she be one that understand she know far better than that we be not fine people doctor but we be kind people i can say that for myself there be nobody in this house but will be good to she and admire she and take a example by she to have a real lady with the girl that be what i would give anything for and as she want take care of poor dear and petting and a ` ome -- mary who would not hear any more get up hastily and take the hand of she new protectress and kiss she partly out of gratitude and kindness partly to stop she mouth and prevent the say of something which it might have be still more difficult to support you be a real lady yourself dear mr turner she cry -lrb- and this notwithstanding the one deficient letter : but many people who be much more dignified than mr turner -- people who behave themselves very well in every other respect -- say ` ome -rrb- oh my dear i do not make any pretension the good woman cry but with a little shock of pleasure which bring the tear to she eye and then the story be tell connie have see the lady walk up-stair and have think no harm the child suppose it be some one belong to the house she have go into the room which be now connie 's room but as that have a second door there be no suspicion cause by the fact that she be not find there a little time after when the child tell she mother what she have see after this connie have see the same lady several time and once have meet she face to face the child declare that she be not at all afraid she be a pretty old lady with white hair and dark eye she look a little sad but smile when connie stop and stare at she -- not angry at all but rather pleased -- and look for a moment as if she would speak that be all not a word about a ghost be say in connie 's hearing she have already tell it all to the doctor and he have pretend to consider which of the old lady in the neighborhood this could be in mary 's mind occupy as it be by so many important matter there have be up to this time no great question about connie 's apparition now she begin to listen closely not so much from real interest as from a perception that the doctor who be she friend do not want she to hear this naturally arouse she attention at once she listen to the child 's description with grow eagerness all the more because the doctor oppose now that will do miss connie he say it be one of the old miss murchison who be always so fond of find out about they neighbor i have no doubt at all on that subject she want to find you out in you pet naughtiness whatever it be and tell I i be sure it be not for that cry connie oh how can you be so disagreeable i know she be not a lady who would tell besides she be not think at all about I she be either look for something she have lose or -- oh i do not know what it be -- and when she see I she just smile she be not dress like any of the people here she have get no cloak on or bonnet or anything that be common but a beautiful white shawl and a long dress and it give a little sweep when she walk -- oh no not like you rustling mamma but all soft like water -- and it look like lace upon she head tie here say connie put she hand to she chin in such a pretty large soft knot mary have gradually rise as this description go on start a little at first look up get upon she foot the color go altogether out of she face -- she eye grow to twice they natural size the doctor put out he hand without look at she and lay it on she arm with a strong emphatic pressure just like some one you have see a picture of he say oh no i never see a picture that be so pretty say the child doctor why do you ask she any more do not you see do not you see the child have see -- miss mary for god 's sake hold you tongue it be folly you know now my little girl tell I i know this old lady be the very image of that pretty old lady with the toy for good child who be in the last christmas number oh say connie pause a little yes i remember it be a very pretty picture -- mamma put it up in the nursery no she be not like that not at all much prettier and then _ my _ lady be sorry about something -- except when she smile at I she have she hair put up like this and this the child go on twist she own bright lock doctor i can not bear any more my dear you be mistaken it be all a delusion she have see a picture i think now mr turner that my little patient have better run away and play take a good run through the wood miss connie with you brother and i will send you some physic which will not be at all nasty and we shall hear no more of you old lady my dear miss vivian if you will but hear reason i have know such case a hundred time the child have see a picture and it have take possession of she imagination she be a little below par and she have a lively imagination and she have learn something from prentiss though probably she do not remember that and there it be a few dose of quinine and she will see vision no more doctor cry mary how can you speak so to I you dare not look I in the face you know you dare not : as if you do not know as well as i do oh why do that child see she and not I there it be he say with a broken laugh could anything show better that it be a mere delusion why in the name of all that be reasonable should this stranger child see she if it be anything and not you mr turner look from one to another with wonder eye you know what it be she say oh you know what it be doctor doctor be it because my connie be so delicate be it a warning be it -- oh for heaven 's sake you will drive I mad you lady be it this and be it that it be nothing i tell you the child be out of sort and she have see some picture that have catch she fancy -- and she think she see -- i 'll send she a bottle he cry jump up that will put a end to all that doctor do not go away tell I rather what i must do -- if she be look for something oh doctor think if she be unhappy if she be keep out of she sweet rest miss mary for god 's sake be reasonable you ought never to have hear a word doctor think if it should be anything we can do oh tell I tell I do not go away and leave I perhaps we can find out what it be i will have nothing to do with you finding out it be mere delusion put they both to bed mr turner put they all to bed -- as if there be not trouble enough what be it cry connie 's mother be it a warning oh for the love of god tell I be that what come before a death when they be all in this state of agitation the vicar and he wife be suddenly show into the room mr bowyer 's eye fly to mary but she be too well breed a woman not to pay she respects first to the lady of the house and there be a number of politeness exchange very breathlessly on mr turner 's part before the new-comer be free to show the real occasion of they visit oh mary what do you mean by take such a step all in a moment how could you come here of all place in the world and how could you leave I without a word the vicar 's wife say with she lip against mary 's cheek she have already perceive without dwelling upon it the excitement in which all the party be this be say while the vicar be still make he bow to he new parishioner who know very well that she visitor have not intend to call for the turner be dissenter to crown all they misdemeanor beside be city people and _ nouveaux riches _ do not ask I any question just now say mary clasp almost hysterically she friend 's hand it be providential come and hear what the child have see mr turner though she be so anxious be too polite not to make a fuss about get chair for all she visitor she postpone she own trouble to this necessity and tremble seek the most comfortable seat for mr bowyer the largest and most impose for the vicar himself when she have establish they in a little circle and do she best to draw mary too into a chair she sit down quietly she mind divide between the care of courtesy and the alarm of a anxious mother mary stand at the table and wait till the commotion be over the new-comer think she be go to explain she conduct in leave they and mr bowyer at least who be critical in point of manners shiver a little wonder if perhaps -lrb- though she could not find it in she heart to blame mary -rrb- she proceedings be in perfect taste the little girl mary say beginning abruptly she have be stand by the table she lip apart she countenance utterly pale she mind evidently too much absorb to notice anything the little girl have see several time a lady go up-stair once she meet she and see she face and the lady smile at she but she face be sorrowful and the child think she be look for something the lady be old with white hair do up upon she forehead and lace upon she head she be dress -- here mary 's voice begin to be interrupt from time to time by a brief sob -- in a long dress that make a soft sound when she walk and a white shawl and the lace tie under she chin in a large soft knot -- mary mary mr bowyer have rise and stand behind the girl in whose slender throat the climb sorrow be almost visible support she try to stop she mary mary she cry oh my darling what be you think of franci doctor make she stop make she stop why should she stop say mr turner rise too in she agitation oh be it a warning be it a warning for my child have see it -- connie have see it listen to I all of you say mary with a effort you all know -- who that be and she have see she -- the little girl -- now the other look at each other exchange a startled look my dear people cry the doctor the case be not the least unusual no no mr turner it be no warning -- it be nothing of the sort look here bowyer you 'll believe I the child be very nervous and sensitive she have evidently see a picture somewhere of we dear old friend she have hear the story somehow -- oh perhaps in some garbled version from prentiss or -- of course they have all be talk of it and the child be one of those creature with its nerve all on the surface -- and a little below par in health in need of iron and quinine and all that sort of thing i have see a hundred such case cry the doctor -- a thousand such but now of course we 'll have a fine story make of it now that it be come into the lady ' hand he be much excite with this long speech but it can not be say that any one pay much attention to he mr bowyer be hold mary in she arm utter little cry and sob over she and look anxiously at she husband the vicar sit down suddenly in he chair with the air of a man who have judgment to deliver without the least idea what to say while mary free herself unconsciously from she friend 's restrain embrace stand face they all with a sort of tremble defiance and mr turner keep on explain nervously that -- no no she connie be not excitable be not oversensitive have never know what a delusion be this be very strange the vicar say oh mr bowyer cry mary tell I what i be to do -- think if she can not rest if she be not happy she that be so good to everybody that never could bear to see any one in trouble oh tell I tell I what i be to do it be you that have disturb she with all you have be say oh what can i do what can i do to give she rest my dear mary my dear mary they all cry in different tone of consternation and for a few minute no one could speak mrs bowyer as be natural say something be unable to endure the silence but neither she nor any of the other know what it be she say when it be evident that the vicar must speak all be silent wait for he and though it now become imperative that something in the shape of a judgment must be deliver yet he be as far as ever from know what to say mary he say with a little tremulousness of voice it be quite natural that you should ask I but my dear i be not at all prepare to answer i think you know that the doctor who ought to know best about such matter -- nay not i i only know about the physical the other -- if there be another -- that be you concern who ought to know best repeat mr bowyer for every body will tell you my dear that the mind be so dependent upon the body i suppose he must be right i suppose it be just the imagination of a nervous child work upon the datum which have be give -- the picture and then as you justly remind I all we have be say -- how could the child know what we have be say franci connie have hear nothing that any one have be say and there be no picture my dear lady you hear what the doctor say if there be no picture and she have hear nothing i suppose then you premise be go and the conclusion fall to the ground what do it matter about premise cry the vicar 's wife here be something dreadful that have happen oh what nonsense that be about imagination child have no imagination a dreadful thing have happen in heaven 's name franci tell this poor child what she be to do my dear say the vicar again you be ask I to believe in purgatory -- nothing less you be ask I to contradict the church 's teaching mary you must compose yourself you must wait till this excitement have pass away i can see by she eye that she do not sleep last night the doctor say relieved we shall have she see vision too if we do not take care and my dear mary say the vicar if you will think of it it be derogatory to the dignity of -- of we dear friend who have pass away how can we suppose that one of the bless would come down from heaven and walk about she own house which she have just leave and show herself to a -- to a -- little child who have never see she before impossible say the doctor i tell you so a stranger -- that have no connection with she know nothing about she -- instead of say the vicar with a slight tremor make herself know if that be permit to -- to I for example or we friend here that sound reasonable mary say mr bowyer do not you think so my dear if she have come to one of we or to yourself my darling i should never have wonder after all that have happen but to this little child -- whereas there be nothing more likely -- more consonant with all the teaching of science -- than that the little thing should have this hallucination of which you ought never to have hear a word you be the very last person -- that be true say the vicar and all the association of the place must be overwhelming my dear we must take she away with we mr turner i be sure be very kind but it can not be good for mary to be here no no i never think so say mr bowyer i never intend -- dear mr turner we all appreciate you motive i hope you will let we see much of you and that we may become very good friend but mary -- it be she first grief do not you know say the vicar 's wife with the tear in she eye she have always be so much care for so much thought of all she life -- and then all at once you will not think that we misunderstand you kind motive but it be more than she can bear she make up she mind in a hurry without think you must not be annoy if we take she away mr turner have be look from one to another while this dialogue go on she say now a little wounded i wish only to do what be kind but perhaps i be think most of my own child miss vivian must do what she think best you be all kind -- too kind mary cry but no one must say another word please unless mr turner should send I away until i know what this all mean it be my place to stay here ix it be lady mary who have come into the vicarage that afternoon when mr bowyer suppose some one have call she wander about to a great many place in these day but always return to the scene in which she life have be pass and where alone she work could be do if it could be do at all she come in and listen while the tale of she own carelessness and heedlessness be tell and stand by while she favorite be take to another woman 's bosom for comfort and hear everything and see everything she be use to it by this time but to be nothing be hard even when you be accustom to it and though she know that they would not hear she what could she do but cry out to they as she stand there unregard oh have pity upon I lady mary say and the pang in she heart be so great that the very atmosphere be stir and the air could scarcely contain she and the passion of she endeavor to make herself know but thrill like a harp-string to she cry mr bowyer hear the jar and tingle in the inanimate world but she think only that it be some charitable visitor who have come in and go softly away again at the sound of tear and if lady mary could not make herself know to the poor cottager who have love she or to the woman who weep for she loss while they blame she how be she to reveal herself and she secret to the man who if they have see she would have think she a hallucination yes she try all and even go a long journey over land and sea to visit the earl who be she heir and awake in he a interest in she child and she linger about all these people in the silence of the night and try to move they in dream since she could not move they wake it be more easy for one who be no more of this world to be see and hear in sleep for then those who be still in the flesh stand on the border of the unseen and see and hear thing which wake they do not understand but alas when they wake this poor wanderer discover that she friend remember no more what she have say to they in they dream presently however when she find mary establish in she old home in she old room there come to she a new hope for there be nothing in the world so hard to believe or to be convince of as that no effort no device will ever make you know and visible to those you love lady mary be little altered in she character though so much in she be still believe that if she could but find the way in a moment -- in the twinkling of a eye all would be reveal and understand she go to mary 's room with this new hope strong in she heart when they be alone together in that nest of comfort which she have herself make beautiful for she child -- two heart so full of thought for each other -- what be there in earthly bond which could prevent they from meet she go into the silent room which be so familiar and dear and wait like a mother long separate from she child with a faint doubt tremble on the surface of she mind yet a quaint joyful confidence underneath in the force of nature a few word would be enough -- a moment and all would be right and then she please herself with fancy of how when that be do she would whisper to she darling what have never be tell to flesh and blood and so go home proud and satisfied and happy in the accomplishment of all she have hope mary come in with she candle in she hand and close the door between she and all external thing she look round wistful with that strange consciousness which she have already experience that some one be there the other stand so close to she that the girl could not move without touch she she hold up she hand implore to the child of she love she call to she mary mary put she hand upon she and gaze into she face with a intensity and anguish of eagerness which might have draw the star out of the sky and a strange tumult be in mary 's bosom she stand look blankly round she like one who be blind with open eye and see nothing and strain she ear like a deaf man but hear nothing all be silence vacancy a empty world about she she sit down at she little table with a heavy sigh the child can see she but she will not come to I mary say and weep then lady mary turn away with a heart full of despair she go quickly from the house out into the night the pang of she disappointment be so keen that she could not endure it she remember what have be say to she in the place from whence she come and how she have be entreat to be patient and wait oh have she but wait and be patient she sit down upon the ground a soul forlorn outside of life outside of all thing lose in a world which have no place for she the moon shone but she make no shadow in it the rain fall upon she but do not hurt she the little night breeze blow without find any resistance in she she say to herself i have fail what be i that i should do what they all say be impossible it be my pride because i have have my own way all my life but now i have no way and no place on earth and what i have to tell they will never never be know oh my little mary a servant in she own house and a word would make it right -- but never never can she hear that word i be wrong to say never she will know when she be in heaven she will not live to be old and foolish like I she will go up there early and then she will know but i what will become of I -- for i be nothing here i can not go back to my own place a little moan wind rise up suddenly in the middle of the dark night and carry a faint wail like the voice of some one lose to the window of the great house it wake the child and mary who open she eye quickly in the dark wonder if perhaps now the vision might come to she but the vision have come when she could not see it and now return no more x on the other side however vision which have nothing sacred in they begin to be hear of and connie 's ghost as it be call in the house have various vulgar effect a housemaid become hysterical and announce that she too have see the lady of whom she give a description exaggerate from connie 's which all the household be ready to swear she have never hear the lady whom connie have only see pass go to betsey 's room in the middle of the night and tell she in a hollow and terrible voice that she could not rest open a series of communication by which it be evident all the secret of the unseen world would soon be disclose and follow upon this there come a sort of panic in the house noise be hear in various place sound of footstep pacing and of a long robe sweep about the passage and lady mary 's costume and the head-dress which be so peculiar which all she friend have recognize in connie 's description grow into something portentous under the heavier hand of the foot-boy and the kitchen-maid mr prentiss who have remain as a special favor to the new people be deeply indignant and outraged by this treatment of she mistress she appeal to mary with mingled anger and tear i would have send the hussy away at a hour 's notice if i have the power in my hand she cry but miss mary it be easily see who be a real lady and who be not mrs turner interfere herself in everything though she like it to be suppose that she have a housekeeper dear prentiss you must not say mr turner be not a lady she have far more delicacy of feeling than many lady cry mary yes miss mary dear i allow that she be very nice to you but who could help that and to hear my lady 's name -- that might have she fault but who be far above anything of the sort -- in every mouth and she costume that they do not know how to describe and to think that _ she _ would go and talk to the like of betsy barne about what be on she mind i think sometimes i shall break my heart or else throw up my place miss mary prentiss say with tear oh do not do that oh do not leave I prentiss mary say with a involuntary cry of dismay not if you mind not if you mind dear the housekeeper cry and then she draw close to the young lady with a anxious look you have not see anything she say that would be only natural miss mary i could well understand she could not rest in she grave -- if she come and tell it all to you prentiss be silent cry mary that end everything between you and I if you say such a word there have be too much say already -- oh far too much as if i only love she for what she be to leave I i do not mean that dear say prentiss but -- there be no but and everything she do be right the girl cry with vehemence she shed hot and bitter tear over this wrong which all she friend do to lady mary 's memory i be glad it be so she say to herself when she be alone with youthful extravagance i be glad it be so for now no one can think that i love she for anything but herself the household however be agitate by all these rumor and invention alice connie 's elder sister decline to sleep any longer in that which begin to be call the haunted room she too begin to think she see something she could not tell what glide out of the room as it begin to get dark and to hear sigh and moan in the corridor the servant who all want to leave and the villager who avoid the grounds after nightfall spread the rumor far and near that the house be haunt xi in the meantime connie herself be silent and see no more of the lady she attachment to mary grow into one of those visionary passion which little girl so often form for young woman she follow she so-called governess wherever she go hang upon she arm when she could hold she dress when no other hold be possible -- follow she everywhere like she shadow the vicarage jealous and annoyed at first and all the neighbor indignant too to see mary transform into a dependent of the city family hold out as long as possible against the good-nature of mr turner and be revolt by the spectacle of this child claim poor mary 's attention wherever she move but by-and-by all these strong sentiment soften as be natural the only real drawback be that amid all these agitation mary lose she bloom she begin to droop and grow pale under the observation of the watchful doctor who have never be otherwise than dissatisfied with the new position of affair and betook himself to mr bowyer for sympathy and information do you ever see a girl so fall off he say fall off doctor i think she be prettier and prettier every day oh the poor man cry with a strong breathing of impatience you lady think of nothing but prettiness -- be i talking of prettiness she must have lose a stone since she go back there it be all very well to laugh the doctor add grow red with suppress anger but i can tell you that be the true test that little connie turner be as well as possible she have hand over she nerve to mary vivian i wonder now if she ever talk to you on that subject who little connie of course i mean miss vivian mr bowyer do not you know the village be all in a tremble about the ghost at the great house oh yes i know and it be very strange i can not help think doctor -- we have better not discuss that subject of course i do not put a moment 's faith in any such nonsense but girl be full of fancy i want you to find out for I whether she have begin to think she see anything she look like it and if something be not do she will soon do so if not now then you do think there be something to see say mr bowyer clasp she hand that have always be my opinion : what so natural -- as that lady mary the greatest old aristocrat in the world should come and make private revelation to betsey barne the under housemaid -- say the doctor with a sardonic grin i do not mean that doctor but if she could not rest in she grave poor old lady -- you think then my dear say the vicar that lady mary a old friend who be as young in she mind as any of we lie body and soul in that old dark hole of a vault how you talk franci what can a woman say between you horrid man i say if she could not rest -- wherever she be -- because of leave mary destitute it would be only natural -- and i should think the more of she for it mr bowyer cry the vicar have a gentle professional laugh over the confusion of he wife 's mind but the doctor take the matter more seriously lady mary be safely bury and do with i be not think of she he say but i be thinking of mary vivian 's sens which will not stand this much longer try and find out from she if she see anything : if she have come to that whatever she say we must have she out of there but mr bowyer have nothing to report when this conclave of friend meet again mary would not allow that she have see anything she grow paler every day she eye grow larger but she make no confession and connie bloom and grow and meet no more old lady upon the stair xii the day pass on and no new event occur in this little history it come to be summer -- balmy and green -- and everything around the old house be delightful and its beautiful room become more pleasant than ever in the long day and soft brief night fear of the earl 's return and of the possible end of the turner ' tenancy begin to disturb the household but no one so much as mary who feel herself to cling as she have never do before to the old house she have never get over the impression that a secret presence reveal to no one else be continually near she though she see no one and she health be greatly affect by this visionary double life this be the state of affair on a certain soft wet day when the family be all within door connie have exhaust all she means of amusement in the morning when the afternoon come with its long dull uneventful hour she have nothing better to do than to fling herself upon miss vivian upon whom she have a special claim she come to mary 's room disturb the strange quietude of that place and amuse herself look over all the trinket and ornament that be to be find there all of which be associate to mary with she godmother connie try on the bracelet and brooch which mary in she deep mourning have not worn and ask a hundred question the answer which have to be so often repeat that be give to I by my godmother at last call forth the child 's remark how fond you godmother must have be of you miss vivian she seem to have give you everything -- everything cry mary with a full heart and yet they all say she be not kind enough say little connie -- what do they mean by that for you seem to love she very much still though she be dead can one go on loving people when they be dead oh yes and better than ever say mary for often you do not know how you love they or what they be to you till they be go away connie give she governess a hug and say why do not she leave you all she money miss vivian everybody say she be wicked and unkind to die without -- my dear cry mary do not repeat what ignorant people say because it be not true but mamma say it miss vivian she do not know connie -- you must not say it i will tell you mamma she must not say it for nobody can know so well as i do -- and it be not true -- but they say cry connie that that be why she can not rest in she grave you must have hear poor old lady they say she can not rest in she grave because -- mary seize the child in she arm with a pressure that hurt connie you must not you must not she cry in a sort of panic be she afraid that some one might hear she give connie a hurry kiss and turn she face away look out into the vacant room it be not true it be not true she cry with a great excitement and horror as if to stay a wound she be always good and like a angel to I she be with the angel she be with god she can not be disturb by anything -- anything oh let we never say or think or imagine -- mary cry she cheek burn she eye be full of tear it seem to she that something of wonder and anguish and dismay be in the room round she -- as if some one unseen have hear a bitter reproach a accusation undeserved which must wind to the very heart connie struggle a little in that too tight hold be you frightened miss vivian what be you frighten for no one can hear and if you mind it so much i will never say it again you must never never say it again there be nothing i mind so much mary say oh say connie with mild surprise then as mary 's hold relax she put she arm round she beloved companion 's neck i will tell they all you do not like it i will tell they they must not -- oh cry connie again in a quick astonished voice she clutch mary round the neck return the violence of the grasp which have hurt she and with the other hand point to the door the lady the lady oh come and see where she be go connie cry mary feel as if the child in she vehemence lift she from she seat she have no sense that she own limb or she own will carry she in the impetuous rush with which connie fly the blood mount to she head she feel a heat and throbbing as if she spine be on fire connie holding by she skirt push she on go along the corridor to the other door now desert of lady mary 's room there there do not you see she she be go in the child cry and rush on cling to mary drag she on she light hair streaming she little white dress wave lady mary 's room be unoccupied and cold -- cold though it be summer with the chill that rest in uninhabited apartment the blind be draw down over the window a sort of blank whiteness greyness be in the place which no one ever enter the child rush on with eager gesture cry look look turn she lively head from side to side mary in a still and passive expectation see nothing look mechanically to where connie tell she to look move like a creature in a dream against she will follow there be nothing to be see the blank the vacancy go to she heart she no longer think of connie or she vision she feel the emptiness with a desolation such as she have never feel before she loose she arm with something like impatience from the child 's close clasp for month she have not enter the room which be associate with so much of she life connie and she cry and warning pass from she mind like the stir of a bird or a fly mary feel herself alone with she dead alone with she life with all that have be and that never could be again slowly without know what she do she sink upon she knee she raise she face in the blank of desolation about she to the unseen heaven unseen unseen whatever we may do god above we and those who have go from we and he who have take they who have redeem they who be ours and theirs we only hope -- but all unseen unseen conceal as much by the blue sky as by the dull blank of that roof she heart ache and cry into the unknown o god she cry i do not know where she be but thou art everywhere o god let she know that i have never blame she never wish it otherwise never cease to love she and thank she and bless she god god cry mary with a great and urgent cry as if it be a man 's name she kneel there for a moment before she sens fail she she eye shine as if they would burst from they socket she lip drop apart she countenance like marble xiii and _ she _ be stand there all the time say connie cry and tell she little tale after mary have be carry away -- stand with she hand upon that cabinet look and look oh as if she want to say something and could not why could not she mamma oh mr bowyer why could not she if she want so much why would not god let she speak xiv mary have a long illness and hover on the verge of death she say a great deal in she wanderings about some one who have look at she for a moment a moment she would cry only a moment and i have so much to say but as she get better nothing be say to she about this face she have see and perhaps it be only the suggestion of some feverish dream she be take away and be a long time get up she strength and in the meantime the turner insist that the chain should be thoroughly see to which be not all in a perfect state and the earl come to see the place take a fancy to it and determine to keep it in he own hand he be a friendly person and he idea of decoration be quite different from those of he grandmother he give away a great deal of she old furniture and sell the rest among the article give away be the italian cabinet which the vicar have always have a fancy for and naturally it have not be in the vicarage a day before the boy insist on find out the way of open the secret drawer and there the paper be find in the most natural way without any trouble or mystery at all xv they all gather to see the wanderer come back she be not as she have be when she go away she face which have be so easy be wear with trouble she eye be deep with thing unspeakable pity and knowledge be in the line which time have not make it be a great event in that place to see one come back who do not come by the common way she be receive by the great officer who have give she permission to go and she companion who have receive she at the first all come forward wonder to hear what she have to say because it only occur to those wanderer who have go back to earth of they own will to return when they have accomplish what they wish or it be judge above that there be nothing possible more accordingly the question be on all they lip you have set the wrong right -- you have do what you desire oh she say stretch out she hand how well one
