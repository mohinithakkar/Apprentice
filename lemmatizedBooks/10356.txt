they be -rrb- the jewess sooner forget religious difference than the jew and i be tell by a christian lady it would be a dangerous matter for a christian gentleman to make a offer of marriage to a mogador jewess unless in downright earnest as it would be sure to be accept monsieur delaport consul of france be the first official person who bring prominently forward the native and other jew into the european society of this place and since then these jew have improve in they manners and increase they respectability the principal european jew be from london gibraltar and marseille many native jew have attempt to wear european clothes and a european hat or coat be now the rage among native jewess who all aspire to get a husband wear either such be element of the progress of the jewess population in this part of the world and there be no doubt they position have be greatly ameliorate within the last half century or since the time of alus bey who thus describe they wretched condition in he day continual dispute arise between the jew and the moor when the jew be wrong the moor take he own satisfaction and if the jew be right he lodge a complaint with the judge who always decide in favor of the mussulman i have see the mahometan child amuse themselves by beat little jew who dare not defend themselves when a jew pass a mosque he be oblige to take off he slipper or shoe he must do the same when he pass the house of the kaëd the kady or any mussulman of distinction at fez and in some other town they be oblige to walk barefooted alus bey mention other vexation and oppression and add when i see the jew be so ill-treated and vex in every way i ask they why they do not go to another country they answer that they could not do so because they be slave of the sultan again he say as the jew have a particular skill in thieve they indemnify themselves for the ill-treatment they receive from the moor by cheat they daily jewess be exempt from take off they slipper or sandal when pass the mosque the late emperor muley suleiman -lrb- 1 -rrb- profess to be a rigidly exact mussulman and consider it very indecent and a great scandal that jewess some of they like most woman of this country of enormous dimension should be allow to disturb the decent frame of mind of pious mussulman whilst enter the threshold of the house of prayer by the sad exhibition of these good lady stoop down and shew they tremendous calf when in the act of take off they shoe before pass the mosque for such reason jewess be now privileged and exempt from the painful necessity of walk barefoot in the street the policy of the court in relation to the jew continually fluctuate sometimes the emperor think they ought to be treat like the rest of he subject at other time he seem anxious to renew in all its vigor the system describe by alus bey hearing that the jew of tangier on return from gibraltar would often adopt the european dress and so by disguise themselves be treat like christian and european he order all these would-be european forthwith to be undressed and to resume they black turban alas how be all these passover tabernacle and wedding festival these happy and joyous day of the jewish society of mogador change on the bombardment of that city what become of the rich and powerful merchant the imperial vassal of commerce with they gorgeous wife bend under the weight of diamond pearl and precious gem during that sad and unexpected period the newspaper of the day record the melancholy story many of the jew be massacre or bury underneath the ruin of the city they wife subject to plunder the rest be leave wander naked and starve on the desolate sandy coast of the atlantic or hide in the mountain obtain a momentary respite from the rapacious fury of the savage berber and arab it be well know that while the french bombard tangier and mogador from without the berber and arab tribe aid by the _ canaille _ of the moor plunder the city from within several of the moorish rabble declare publicly and with the greatest cowardice and villainous effrontery when the french come to destroy mogador we shall go and pillage the jew ' house strip the woman of they ornament and then escape to the mountain from the pursuit of the christian these threat they faithfully execute but by a just vengeance they be pillage in turn for the berber not only plunder the jew themselves but the moor who have escape from the city laden with they booty it be to be hope that a better day be dawn for north african jew the government of france and england can do much for they in morocco the jew of the atla form the subject of some of mr davidson 's literary labor i have make further inquiry and shall give the reader some account of they add that portion of mr davidson 's information which be bear out by further investigation the atla jew be physically if not morally superior to they brethren who reside among the moor they be disperse over the atla range and have all the characteristic of mountaineer they enjoy like they neighbor the berber and shelouh a species of quasi-independence of the imperial authority but they usually attach themselves to certain berber chieftain who protect they and whose standard they follow these be the only jew in mahometan country of whom i have hear as bear arm they have however they own sheik to whose jurisdiction all domestic matter be refer they wear the same attire as the mountaineer and be not distinguishable from they they do not address the moor by the term of respect and title sidus but in the same way as the moor and arab when they accost each other they speak the shelouh language mr davidson mention some curious circumstance about these jew and of they have a city beyond the atla where three or four thousand be live in perfect freedom and cultivate the soil which they have possess since the time of solomon the probability be that mr davidson 's informant refer to the jew of the oasis of sahara where there certainly be some family of jew live in comparative freedom and independence as to the peculiarity of the religion of the atla jew they be say not to have the pentateuch and the law in the same order as jew generally they be unacquainted with ezra or christ they do not go to babylon at the captivity but be disperse over africa at that period they be a species of caraaite or jewish protestant shadaus be the name which they apply to the supreme be when speaking of he they write law begin by state that the world be many thousand year old when the present race of man be form which curiously enough agree with the research of modern geology the present race of man be the joint offspring of different and distinct human species the deluge be not mention by they god it be say appear to ishmael in a dream and tell he he must separate from isaac and go to the desert where he would make he a great nation there would ever after be enmity between the two race as at this day there be the greatest animosity between the jew and mahometan the great nucleus of these shelouh jew be in _ jebel melge _ or the vast ridge of the atla cap with eternal snow and they hold communication with the jew of ait mousa frouga or misfuvâ they rarely descend to the plain or city of the empire and look upon the rest of the jew of this country as heretic isolation thus beget enmity and mistrust as in other case a few year ago a number come to mogador and be not at all pleased with they visit find fault with everything among they brethren these jewish mountaineer be suppose to be very numerous in they home they be inaccessible so they live in a wild independence profess a creed as free as they own mountain air god who make the hill make likewise man 's freedom to abide therein before take leave of the maroquine israelite i must say something of they personal appearance both in tangier and mogador i be fortunate enough to be acquaint with family who could boast of the most perfect and classic type of jewish female loveliness alas that these beauty should be only charming _ animal _ they mind and affection be leave uncultivated or convert into cave of unclean and torment passion the jewess in general until they become enormously stout and weigh down with obesity be of extreme beauty most of they have fair complexion they rose and jasmine face they pure wax-like delicate feature and they exceedingly expressive and bewitching eye would fascinate the most fastidious of european connoisseur of female beauty but these israelitish lady recall the fair image of rachel in the patriarchal time of holy writ and worthy to serve as model for a grecian sculptor be treat with savage disdain by the churlish moor and sometimes be oblige to walk barefoot and prostrate themselves before they ugly negress concubine the male infant of jew be engage and goodlook when young but as they grow up they become ordinary and jew of a certain age be decidedly and most disgustingly ugly it be possible that the degrading slavery in which they usually live they continued habit of cringe servility by which the countenance acquire a sinister air and fiendishly cunning smirk may cause this change in they appearance but what contrast we have of the beauty of countenance and form in the jewish society of mogador you frequently see a youthful woman nay a girl of exquisite beauty and delicacy of feature marry to a old wretched ill-looking fellow of some sixty or seventy year of age totter over the grave or a incurable invalid to render they worse-looking whilst the woman may dress in any and the gayest color the man wear a dark blue and black turban and dress and though this be prescribe as a badge of oppression they will often assume it when they may attire themselves in white and other livelier color however man get use to they misery and hug they chain the jew at time though but very rarely avail themselves of they privilege of four wife grant they in mahometan country and a nice mess they make of it i know a jew of this description in tunis he be a lively jocose fellow with a libidinous countenance singing always some catch of a song he be a silk-mercer and pretty well off he house be small and besides a common _ salle-à-manger _ divide into four compartment for he four wife each defend she room with the ferocity of a tigress two of they be of he own age about fifty and two not more than twenty the two elder one i be tell by he neighbor be entirely abandon by the husband and the two younger one be always bicker and quarrel as to which of they should have the greater favor of they common tyrant the house a scene of tumult disorder and indecency amongst the whole of the wife there be only one child a boy of course a immense pet a little surly wretch he growth smother he health nearly ruin by the overattention of the four woman whom he kick and pelt when out of humor this little imp be the fit type or interpretation of the preside genius of polygamy i once visit this happy family this bite satire on domestic bliss and the beauty of the harem of the east the woman be all sour and busy at work weave or spin cotton do you work for you husband i ask _ the woman _ -- thank rabbi no _ traveller _ -- what do you do with you money _ the woman _ -- spend it ourselves _ traveller _ -- how do you like to have only one husband among you four _ the woman _ -- pooh be it not the will of god _ traveller _ -- whose boy be that _ the woman _ -- it belong to we all _ traveller _ -- have you no other child _ the woman _ -- we husband be good for no more than that whilst i be talk to these angelic creature they beloved lord be quietly stuff capon without hear we polite discourse a european jew who know the native society of jew well represent domestic bliss to be a mere phantom and scarcely ever think of or seek after poor human nature i take a walk round the suburb one morning whilst a strong wind be bring the locust towards the coast which fall upon we like hailstone young locust frequently crowd upon the neighbouring hill in thousand and ten of thousand they be little green thing no one know whence they come and whither they go these be not destructive indeed unless swarm of locust appear darken the sky and full grown one they do not permanently damage the country the wind usually disperse they they rarely take a long flight except impel by a violent gale arab attempt to destroy locust by digging pit into which they may fall this be merely play with they jew fry they in oil and salt and sell they as we sell shrimp the taste of which they resemble on my return i pass a mooress or rather a mauritanian venus who be so stout that she have fall down and could not get up a mule be fetch to carry she home but the moor highly relish these enormous lump of fat accord to the standard beauty lay down by the taleb -- four thing in a woman should be ample the lower part of the back the thigh the calf of the leg and the knee some time ago there be discover at malta various rude statue of woman very ample in the lower part of the back suppose to be of libyan origin so that stout lady have be the choicest of the fashion for age past the fattening of woman like so many capon and turkey begin when they be betroth they then swallow three time a day regular bolus of paste and be not allow to take exercise by the time marriage take place they be in a tolerable good condition not unlike smithfield fatten heifer the lady of one of the european merchant be very thin the moor frequently ask she husband how it be and whether she have enough to eat hint broadly that he starve she on the other hand two or three of the merchant 's wife be exceedingly stout and of course great favorite with the man folk of this city the discrepancy of age in married people be most unnatural and disgusting whilst the merchant be at morocco a little girl of nine year of age be marry to a man upward of fifty ten and eleven be a common age for girl to be marry much have be say of the reverence of child for they parent in the east and tribe of people migrate therefrom and the fifth commandment embody the sentiment of the eastern world but there be little of this in mogador a european jewess who know all the respectable jewish and many of the moorish family assure I that child make they aged parent work for they as long as the poor creature can honor thy father and thy mother be quite as much neglect here as in europe however there be some difference the indigent moor and jew maintain they aged parent in they own home and we english christian shut up ours in the union bastile to continue this domestic picture the marriage settlement especially among the jew be ticklish and brittle thing as to money or other mercenary arrangement a match be often break off because a lamp of the value of four dollar have be substitute for one of the value of twenty dollar which be first promise on the happy day of betrothal indeed nearly all marriage here be matter of sale and barter love be out of the question he never flutter he purple wing over the bridal bed of mogador a jewish or moorish girl have place before she a rich old ugly man of mean and villanous character of three score year and upward and by he side a handsome youth of blameless character and amiable manners will not hesitate a moment to prefer the former as affair of intrigue and simple animal enjoyment be the great business of life the way and mean in spite of moorish and mahometan jealousy as strong as death by which these young and frail beauty indulge in forbid conversation be innumerable although the moor frequently relate romantic legend of lovely innocent bride who have never see any other than the face of they father or of married lady who never raise the veil from off they face except to receive they own husband and seem to extol such chastity and seclusion they be too frequently find indulge in obscene imagination tempting and seduce the weaker sex from the path of virtue and honor so that if woman be unchaste here or elsewhere man be the more to blame : if woman go one step wrong man drag she two more man corrupt woman and then punish she for be corrupt deprive they of they natural and unalienable rights salt in africa as in europe be a domestic superstition a jewess one morning in bidding adieu to she friend put she finger into a salt-cellar and take from it a large pinch of salt which she friend tell I afterwards be to preserve she from the evil one salt be also use for a similar important purpose when during the night a person be oblige to pass from one room into another in the dark it would be a entertaining task to collect the manifold superstition in different part of the world respect this essential ingredient of human food the habit of drinking white brandy stimulate the immorality of this maroquine society the jew be the great factor of this _ acqua ardiente _ its spanish and general name government frequently severely punish they for make it but they still persevere in produce this incentive to intoxication and crime in all part of the world the most degraded class be the factor of the means of vice for the higher order of society moor drink it under protest that it be not the juice of the grape on the sabbath the jewish family be all flush excited and tormented by this evil spirit but when the highest enjoyment of intellect be deny to man they must and will seek the lower and beastly gratification friend cohen come in one afternoon and related several anecdote of the maroquine court when dr brown be attend the sultan the vizier manage to get hold of he cocked hat and place it upon he head strut about in the royal garden whilst perform this feat before several attendant the sultan suddenly make he appearance in the midst of they the minister see he fall down in a fright and a fit he imperial highness beckon to the minister in such woful plight to pacify himself and put he cloak before he mouth to prevent any one from see he laugh at the minister which he do most immoderately cohen who be a quack be once consult on a case of the harem cohen plead ignorance god have not give he the wit he could do nothing for the patient of he imperial highness this be very politic of cohen for another quack a moor have just be consult and have have he head take off for not be successful

seventeenth century and have now wield the sword of the prophet as caliph of the west these last two hundred year i have not hear that there be anywhere a dynasty of shereef except in this country they be therefore profoundly venerate by all true mussulman it be a great error to suppose that abd-el-kader could have succeed in dethrone the emperor during the hostility of the emir against the lineal representative of the prophet abd-el-kader be a marabout warrior greatly revere and idolize by all enthusiastic mussulman throughout north africa more especially in morocco the _ terre classique _ of holy-fighting man but though the maroquine be disaffected groan under the avarice of they shereefian lord and occasionally do revolt nevertheless they would not deliberately set aside

have a right to the throne of morocco and who for that reason enjoy certain gratification pay they by the reign sultan he add that during a interregnum many of they take up arm and throw the empire into anarchy this state of thing be happily past and as to the number of the shereef at tafilett all that we know be there be a small fortified town inhabit entirely by shereef live in moderate if not impoverished circumstance the shereefian sultan of morocco be not only the successor of the arabian sovereign of spain but may justly dispute the caliphat with the osmanli or turkish sultan they right

of christian slavery in he state in former time the maroquine moor smart under the ill inflict upon they by spain and breathing revenge subject they christian captive to more cruel bondage than ever be experience by the same victim of the corsair in algerium the stronghold of this nefarious trade the shereef have be accustom to wrap themselves up in they sublime indifference as to the fate and fortune of europe during late century they diplomatic intercourse with european prince have be scarcely relieve by a single interesting event beyond they piratical war and we complaisant redemption of they prisoner but in the reign of loui xiv muley ismail have hear a extremely seductive account of the princesse de conti -lrb- mademoiselle de blois -rrb- natural daughter of the grand monarch and mademoiselle de la valliere by means of he ambassador abdullah ben aissa have the chivalrous temerity to demand she in marriage we sultan say the ambassador will marry she accord to the law of god and the prophet but she shall not be force to abandon she religion or manner of living and she will be able to find all that she heart desire in the palace of my sovereign -- if it please god this request of course could not be grant but the king of christian king reply very graciously that the difference alone of religion prevent the consummation of the happiness of the shereef of shereef this humble demand of the hand of the princess mightily amuse the court of court and its hirele poet tax they wit to the utmost in chant the praise of the royal virgin who have attack the regard -lrb- or the growl -rrb- of the numidian tiger as muley ismail be politely designate take this as a specimen -- votre beauté grande princesse porte les trait dont elle blesse jusque aux plus sauvage lieux : l'afrique avec vous capitule et les conquêtes de vos yeux vont plus loin que celle d'hercule the maroquine ambassador who be also grand admiral of the moorish navy witness all the wonder of pari at the epoch of the great monarch be dazzle with its beauty and magnificence nevertheless he remain a good mussulman he be besides a grateful man for he see we jame ii in exile who have give the admiral liberty without ransom when he have be capture by english cruiser and heartily thank the fall prince for he own freedom whilst he condole with he in he misfortune but the moorish envoy in spite of he great influence be unable to conclude the treaty of peace which be desire by france on he return to morocco the ambassador have so advance in european idea of convenience or civilization that he attempt to introduce a taste for parisian luxury among he own countryman as in many other part of the mediterranean france and england have incessantly contend for influence at the court of morocco various irregular mission to this court have be undertake by european power from the first establishment of the moorish empire of the west the french enter regularly into relation with the western moor shortly after we they flag indeed begin to appear at they port in 1555 under franci i they succeed in gain the favor of the moor whilst we occupy tangier and loui xiv encourage they in they effort to attack or harass we garrison the nature of we struggle with the moor of morocco can be at once conjecture from the title of the pamphlet publish in those time viz _ great _ and _ bloody _ news of tangier -lrb- london 1680 -rrb- and the moor _ blast _ be a discourse concern tangier especially when it be under the earl of teviot -lrb- london 1681 -rrb- but after the peace of utrecht concede gibraltar to england and which more than compensate we for the loss of tangier the influence of france in morocco begin to wane and the trade of this empire be absorb by the british during the 18th century then in the beginning of we own age the battle of trafalgar and the fall of napoleon establish the supremacy of british influence over the mind of the shereef which have not be yet entirely efface we diplomatic intercouse have be more frequent and interesting with the western moor since the french occupation of algerium and we have exert we utmost to neutralize the spirit of the war party in fez second the naturally pacific mind of muley abd errahman in order to remove every pretext of the french for invade this country how we succeed in a critical period will be mention at the close of the present work -lrb- 7 -rrb- but this port and we influence receive thereby a great shock i be happy to state that the latest account from this most interesting moorish country represent muley abd errahman as steadily pursue by the assistance of he new vizier bouseilam the most pacific policy this minister be very rich be enable to consolidate he power by frequent present to he royal master thus gratify the most darling passion of muley abd errahman and vizier and sultan amuse themselves by undertake plunder expedition against insurrectionary tribe whose sedition they first stimulate and then quell that be to say by receive from the unlucky rebel a handsome gratification the late mr hay enter into a correspondence with the shereefian court for the purpose of draw its attention to the subject of the slave-trade and i shall make a extract or two from the letter bear as they do on my present mission from three letter address by the sultan to mr hay i extract the follow passage be it know to you that the traffic in slave be a matter on which all sect and nation have agree from the time of the son of adam -lrb- on whom be the peace of god up to this day -rrb- and we be not yet aware of its be prohibit by the law of any sect and no one need ask this question the same be manifest to both high and low and require no more demonstration than the light of the day the apostle of god be quote as enforce upon the master to give he slave the same clothing as himself and not to exact more labor from he than he can perform another letter it have be prohibit to sell a muslem the sacred _ misshaf _ and a young person to a unbeliever that be to any one who do not profess the faith of islam whether christian jew or majousy to make a present or to give as in alms be hold in the same light as a sale the say sheikh khalil also say a slave be emancipate by the law if ill-treated that be whether he intend or do actually ill-treat he but whether a slave can take with he what he possess of property or no be a matter yet undecided by the doctor of the law another be it know to you that the religion of islam -- may god exalt it have a solid foundation of which the corner stone be well secure and the perfection whereof have be make know to we by god to whom belong all praise in he book the forkam -lrb- or koran -rrb- which admit neither of addition nor diminution as regard the making of slave and trading therewith it be confirm by we book as also of the _ sunnat _ -lrb- or tradition -rrb- of we prophet there be no controversy among the _ oulamma _ -lrb- doctor -rrb- on the subject no one can allow what be prohibit or prohibit that which be lawful these extract shew the _ animus _ of the shereefian correspondence to attack the shereef on this point of slavery be to besiege the citadel of they religion or that be the interpretation which they be pleased to put upon the matter but all form of bigotry and false principle will ultimately succumb to the force of truth it be necessary to persevere to persevere always and the end will be obtain i shall add a word or two on we treaty or capitulation as they be disgracefully call with the empire of morocco intimate as they do we former submission to the arrogant piratical demand of the barbary power in the day of they corsair glory we political relation with morocco officially commence in the time of elizabeth or charle i but the formal treaty of peace be not conclude until the last year of the reign of george i which be ratify in 1729 by george ii and by the sultan muley ahmed-elt-thabceby the golden then follow various other treaty for the security of person and trade and against piracy all however of any value be embody in the treaty between great britain and morocco sign at fez 14th June 1801 and confirm 19th January 1824 by the sultan muley suleiman which be consider as still in force and from which i shall extract two or three article append observation for the purpose of shew its spirit and bearing on european commerce and civilization common sense tell we that trade can only flourish where there be security for life and property we have to examine whether this security be fully guarantee to british subject reside in and trading with the empire to morocco by the treaty of 1801 and 1824 this treaty begin with consul and sufficiently provide for they honor and safety it then state the privilege of british subject and more particulary of merchant reside in and wish to engage in commercial speculation in morocco these privilege be on the whole also explicitly state afterwards follow two article on dispute which clause be amend and explain in January 1824 when the treaty be confirm these be : -- vii dispute between moorish subject and english subject shall be decide in the presence of the english consul provide the decision be comformable to the moorish law in which case the english subject shall not go before the kady or hakem as the consul 's decision shall suffice viii should any dispute occur between english subject and moor and that dispute should occasion a complaint from either of the party the emperor of morocco shall only decide the matter if the english subject be guilty he shall not be punish with more severity than a moor would be should he escape no other subject of the english nation shall be arrest in he stead and if the escape be make after the decision in order to avoid punishment he shall be sentence as a moor would be who have commit the same crime should any dispute occur in the english territory between a moor and a english subject it shall be decide by a equal number of the moor reside there and of christian accord to the custom of the place if not contrary to the moorish law in the amend clause of article viii we have for any complaint substitute serious personal injury and i can not but observe that the making of the emperor the final judge in such case be a stretch of too great confidence in moorish justice not that a sultan of morocco be necessarily bad or worse than a european sovereign but because a personage of such power and character arm with unbounded attribute of despotism over he own subject who be consider he abeed or slave whilst feebly aid by the perception of the common rights of man and imperfectly acquaint with european civilization can never unless indeed by accident or miracle justly decide upon the case of a englishman or upon a dispute between he own and a foreign subject for besides the idea and education of the emperor there be the necessity which he imperial highness feel despot as he be of exhibit himself before he people as they undoubted friend and partial judge so strongly have sultan of morocco feel this that many anecdote might be cite where the emperor have indemnify the foreigner for injury do to he by he own subject whilst he have represent to they that he have decide the case against the stranger it be surprising how a british government could surrender the settlement of the dispute of they subject to the final appeal of the court of morocco in the nineteenth century and moreover allow they to be decide accord to the maxim of the mohammedan code or comformable to the moorish law it be not long ago since indeed just before my arrival in morocco that the emperor decide a dispute in rather a summary manner without even the usual moorish form of judicial proceedure by decapitate a quasus -- european jew under french protection and who once act as the consul of france there be something singularly deficient and wrong although to person unacquainted with barbary it look sufficiently fair and just in the provision -- he -lrb- the english guilty subject -rrb- shall not be punish with more severity than a moor could be fairly make in the first place although this do not come under the idea of serious personal injury would the english people approve of they countryman suffer the same punishment as the moor for theft by cut off they right hand moor and arab have be so maim for life on be convict of steal property to the value of a single shilling who will take upon himself to enumerate the punishment which may be and be inflict for grave offence it may be reply that this stipulation of punish british subject like moorish be only on paper and we have no example of its be put into execution i rejoin without attempt to cite proof that whilst such a article exist in a treaty say to be bind on the government of england as well as morocco there can be no real security for british subject in this country for in the event of the maroquine act strictly upon the article of this treaty what mode of inculpation or what color of right can the british government adopt or shew against they and what be treaty make for if they do not bind both party in illustration of the way in which british subject have they dispute sometimes settle accord to article vii and viii i take the liberty of introduce the case of mr saferty a respectable gibraltar merchant settle at mogador a few month before my arrival in that place this gentleman be adjudge in the presence of he consul mr willshire and the governor of mogador for repel a insult offer to he by a moor and sentence to be imprison with felon and cut-throat in a horrible dungeon however mr saferty be attend by a numerous body of he friend so when the sentence be give a cry of indignation arise a scuffle ensue and the prisoner be rescue from the moorish police-officer mr willshire find the means of patch up the business with the moorish authority and the case be soon forget all 's well that end well i do not say that the moor be determinedly vindictive or seek quarrel with european on the contrary i believe the cause of the dispute frequently rest with the european and the bonâ-fide agressor some adventurer whose conduct be so bad in he own country that he seek barbary as a refuge from the pursuit of the minister of justice what i wish to lay stress on be the enormous power give to the emperor by a solemn treaty in make he the final judge and the imminent exposure of british subject to the barbarous punishment of a semi-civilized people article x be a most singular one renegade from the english nation or subject who change they religion to embrace the moorish they be of unsound mind at the time of turn moor shall not be admit as moor and may again return to they former religion but if they afterwards resolve to be moor they must abide by they own decision and they excuse will not be accept it be a wonderful discovery of we modern morale that a renegade be a madman should not be consider a renegade in earnest or responsible for he action nevertheless these unfortunate being should they have better thought or as mad-doctor have it a lucid interval and leave the profession of the mahometan faith and afterwards again relapse into madness and turn mahometan once more be doom to irretrievable slavery or if they relapse to death itself the mahometan law punish relapse renegade with death this curious clause say that though be madmen they must abide they decision -lrb- of unreason -rrb- and they excuse will not be accept this say article be confirm as late as the year 1824 by the plenipotentiary of a nation which boast of be the most free and civilized of europe and whose people spend annually million for the conversion of the heathen and the extinction of the slave-trade the last clause of article iv also demand we attention viz and if any english merchant should happen to have a vessel in or outside the port he may go on board himself or any of he people without be liable to pay anything whatever now in spite of this -lrb- but of course forget -rrb- stipulation the merchant of mogador be not permit to visit they own vessel nor those of other person which may happen to be in or outside the port it be true the authority plead the reason of they refusal to be the merchant be indebted to the emperor : neither will the authority take any security and arbitrarily and insolently prohibit under any circumstance the merchant from visit they vessel i have say enough to shew that we treaty -lrb- i beg the reader 's pardon capitulation -rrb- with the emperor of morocco require immediate revision and to be amend with article more suit to the spirit of the age and european civilization as likewise more consistent with the dignity of great britian the treaty for the supply of provision especially cattle to the garrison of gibraltar be either a verbal one or a secret arrangement for no mention be make of it in the publish state paper document it be probably a mere verbal unwritten understanding but neverthelesss be more potent in its working than the write treaty this be not the first time that the unwritten have prove stronger than the write engagement chapter iii the two different aspect by which the strength and resource of the empire of morocco may be view or estimate -- native appellation of morocco -- geographical limit of this country -- historical review of the inhabitant of north africa and the manner in which this region be successively people and conquer -- the distinct variety of the human race as find in morocco -- nature of the soil and climate of this country -- derem or the atla chain of mountain -- natural product -- the shebbel or barbary salmon different character of export of the northern and southern province -- the elæonderron argan -- various tree and plant -- mine -- the sherb-errech or desert-horse the empire of morocco may be consider under two aspect as to its extent and as to its influence it may be greatly circumscribe or expand to a almost indefinite extent accord to the feeling or imagination of the writer or speaker a resident here give I a meager _ tableau _ something like this the city of morocco 50000 soul fez 40000 mequinez 25000 ------- 115000 the maritime city contain little more than 100000 inhabitant make altogether about 220000 over the province of the south sous and wadnoun the sultan have no real power so the south be cut off as a integral portion of the empire over the rif or the northern berber province the sultan exercise a precarious sovereignty every man 's gun or knife be there he law and authority fez contain a disaffected population teem some year since with the adherent of abd-el-kader then the atla be full of quasi-independent berber tribe who detest equally the arab and the moorish government finally tafilett and the province on the eastern side of the atla be too remote to feel the influence of the central government as to military force the emperor 's standing army do not amount to more than 20 or 30000 nigritian troops and all cavalry the irregular and contingent cavalry and infantry can never be depend upon even under such a chief as abd-el-kader be they must always be feed but they will not at any summons leave the cultivation of they field or they wife and child defenceless as to the commerce of the empire with fifty ship visit mogador and other maritime city the amount per annum do not exceed forty million of franc or about a million and a half sterling include import and export such be the view of the empire on the depreciating side another resident of this country give the opposite or more favourable view the sultan be the head of the orthodox religion of the mussulman of the west and more firmly establish on he throne than the sultan of the ottoman he influence as a sovereign shereef spread throughout western barbary and central africa wherever there be a mussulman to be find in the event of a enemy appear in the shape of a christian or infidel all would unite include the most disjointed and hostile tribe against the common foe of islamism the sultan upon a emergency or insurrection in he own empire by the politic distribution of title of _ marabout _ -lrb- often use as a species of degree of dd -rrb- and other honor attach to the shereefian parasol can likewise easily excite one chief against another and consolidate he power over they intestine division he moorish majesty at any rate have always actual possession in he favor and whether he really govern the whole empire or not or to the extent which he have presume to mark out its boundary he can always proclaim to he disjointed province that he do so govern it and exercise authority and in general he do succeed in make both he own people and foreign nation believe in he pretension and acknowledge he power the truth lie perhaps between these extreme the shereef once pretend to exercise authority over all western sahara as far as timbuctoo that be to say all that region of the great desert lie west of the touarick the account of the expedition of the shereef mohamm who penetrate as far as wadnoun and which take place more than three century ago as relate by marmol leave no doubt of the ancient ambition of the sovereign of morocco and although this pretension have now be give up they still claim sovereignty over the oasis of touat a month 's journey in the sahara formerly indeed the authority of the maroquine sultan over touat and the south appear to have be more real and effective diego de torre relate that in he time the shereef maintain a force of ten thousand cavalry in the province of draha tafilett and jagurirus and monsieur mouette count touat as one of the province of the empire the sheikh haj kasem in the itinerary which he dictate to monsieur delaporte say that about forty year ago agoblus and taoudenus depend on morocco this however be what the people of ghadame tell I whilst they admit that the oasis neither do contain a single officer of the emperor nor do the people pay he shereefian highness the smallest impost the sultan 's authority be now indeed purely nominal and the french look forward to the time when these fine and centrally place oasis will form une dependance de l'algérie the only country in the south which now pay a regular impost to the emperor be tafilett limit to the valley of fez wad-draha as far as the lake ed-debaium and sous the country of sidus hashem and wadnoun nominally acknowledge the emperor and occasionally send a present but the most mountainous between sous and wad-draha which have be call guezoulum or gouzoulum and be say to be people by a berber race spring from the ancient gelulir be entirely independent in the north and west be also many quasi-independent tribe but still the emperor keep up a sort of authority over they and if nothing more be content simply with be call they sultan maroquine moor call they country el-gharb the west and sometimes mogrel-el-aksa that be the far west : -lrb- 8 -rrb- the name seem to have originate something in the same way among the saracenic conqueror as the far west with the anglo-american arise from a apprehensive feeling of indefinite extent of unexplored country among the moor generally morocco be now often call blad muley abd errahman or country of the sultan muley abd errahman the northwestern portion of morocco be first conquer morocco proper sous and tafilett be add with the progress of conquest but scarcely a century have elapse since they union under one common sultan whilst the diverse population of the four state be solely keep together by the interest and feeling of a common religion the maroquine empire with its present limit be bound on the north by the mediterranean sea and the strait of gibraltar on the west by the atlantic ocean and the canary and madeira island on the south by the desert of noun draha and the sahara on the east by algerium the atla and tafilett on the border of sahara beyond they eastern slope the greatest length from north to south be about five hundred mile with a breadth from east to west vary considerably at a average of two hundred contain a available or really _ dependent _ territory of some 137400 square mile or nearly as large as spain and the whole be situate between the 28 ° and 40 ° n latitude monsieur benou in he description géographique de l'empire de maroc say morocco comprend une superficie d'environ 5775 myriamètres carrés un peu plus grande par conséquant que celle de la france qui équivaut à 5300 this then be the available and immediate territory of morocco not comprise distant dependency where the shereef exercise a precarious or nominal sovereignty previously to particularize the population of morocco i shall take the liberty of introduce some general observation on the whole of the inhabitant of north africa and the manner in which this country be successively people and conquer greek and roman classic contain only meager and confused notion of the aborigine of north africa although they have leave we a mass of detail on the punic war and the struggle which ensue between the roman and the ancient libyan before the domination of the latin republic could be firmly establish herodotus cite the name of a number of people who inhabit north africa mostly confine himself to repeat the fable or the more interesting fact of which they be the object the nomenclature of strabo be neither so extensive nor do it contain more precise or correct information he mention the celebrated oasis of ammonium and the nation of the nasamone farther west behind carthage and the numidian he also notice the getulian and after they the garamante a people who appear to have colonize both the oasis of ghadame and the oasis of fezzan ptolemy make the whole of the mauritanium include algerium and morocco to be bound on the south by tribe call gaetulia and melanogaelutus on the south the latter evidently have contract alliance of blood with the negro accord to sallust who support himself upon the authority of heimpsal the carthaginian historian north africa be first occupy by libyan and getulian who be a barbarous people a heterogeneous mass or agglomeration of people of different race without any form of religion or government nourishing themselves on herb or devour the raw flesh of animal kill in the chase for first amongst these be find black probably some from the interior of africa and belong to the great negro family then whites issue of the semitic stock who apparently constitute even at that early period the dominant race or caste later but at a epoch absolutely unknown a new horde of asiatic say sallust of mede persian and armenian invade the country of the atla and lead on by hercule push they conquest as far as spain -lrb- 9 -rrb- the persian mix themselves with the former inhabitant of the coast form the tribe call numide or numidian -lrb- which embrace the province of tuni and constantina -rrb- whilst the mede and the armenian ally themselves with the libyan nearer to spain it be pretended give existence to a race of moor the term mede be change into that of moor -lrb- 10 -rrb- as to the getulian confine in the valley of the atla they resist all alliance with the new immigrant and form the principal nucleus of those tribe who have ever remain in north africa rebel to a foreign civilization or rather determine champion of national freedom and whom imitate the roman and arab we be pleased to call barbarian or berber -lrb- barbarus brâber -lrb- 11 -rrb- -rrb- and whence be derive the name of the barbary state but the roman likewise call the aboriginal tribe of north africa moor or maurus and some contend that moor and berber be but two different name for the aboriginal tribe the former being of greek and the latter of african origin the roman might however confound the african term berber with barbarus which latter they apply like the greek to all stranger and foreigner the revolution of africa cast a new tribe of emigrant upon the north african coast who if we be to believe the byzantine historian procopius of the sixth century be no other than canaanite expel from palestine by the victorious arm of joshua when he establish the israelite in that country procopius affirm that in he time there be a column standing at tigisis on which be this inscription : -- we be those who flee from the robber joshua son of nun -lrb- 12 -rrb- now whether tigisis be in algerium or be modern tangier as some suppose it be certain there be several tradition among the berber tribe of morocco which relate that they ancestor be drive out of palestine also the berber historian ebn-khal-doun who flourish in the fourteenth century make all the berber descend from one bar the son of mayigh son of canaan however what may be the truth of these tradition of sallust or procopius there be no difficulty in believe that north africa be people by fugitive and roving tribe and that the first settler should be expose to be plunder by succeed horde for such have be the history of the migration of all the tribe of the human race but the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend be the invasion or more properly the successive invasion of north africa by the phoenician they definite establishment on these shore take place towards the foundation of carthage about 820 year before we era yet we know little of they intercourse or relation with the aboriginal tribe when the roman a century and a half before christ receive or wrest the rule of africa from the phoenician or carthaginian they find before they a indigenous people whom they indifferently call moor berber or barbarian a part of these people be call also nudide which be perhaps consider the same term as nomade some age later the roman too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of other conqueror be subjugate by the vandal who during a century hold possession of north africa but after this time the roman again raise they head and completely expel or extirpate the vandal so that as before there be find only two people or race in africa : the roman and the moor or aborigine towards the middle of the seventh century after christ and a few year after the death of mahomet the roman in the decline of they power have to meet the shock of the victorious arm of the arabian who pour in upon they triumphant from the east but too weak to resist this new tide of invasion they oppose to they the aborigine which latter be soon oblige to continue alone the struggle the arabian historian who recount these war speak of _ roumus _ or roman -lrb- of the byzantine empire -rrb- and the brâber -- evidently the aboriginal tribe -- who promptly submit to the arab to rid themselves of the yoke of the roman but after the retreat of they ancient master they revolt and remain a long time in arm against they new conqueror -- a rule of action which all subjugate nation have be wont to follow be we english now to attempt to expel the french from algeria we undoubtedly should be join by the arab but who would most probably soon also revolt against we be we to attempt to consolidate we dominion over they in the first year of the eighth century and at the end of the first century of the hegira the conquer arab pass over to spain and inasmuch as they come from mauritanium the people of spain give they the name of moor -lrb- that of the aborigine of north africa -rrb- although they have perhaps nothing in common with they if we except they asiatic origin another and most singular name be also give to these arab warrior in france and other part of europe -- that of saracen -- whose etymology be extremely obscure -lrb- 13 -rrb- from this time the spaniard have always give the name of moor -lrb- _ lo moro _ -rrb- not only to the arab of spain but to all the arab and confound farther these two denomination they have bestow the name of _ moro _ upon the arab of morocco and those in the environs of senegal the arab who invade northern africa about 650 be all native of asia belong to various province of arabium and be divide into ismaelite amalekite koushite & c they be all warrior and it be consider a title of nobility to have belong to they first irruption of the enthusiastic son of the prophet a second invasion take place towards the end of the ninth century -- a epoch full of war -- during which the caliph kaïm transport the seat of he government from kairwan to cairo end in the complete submission of morocco to the power of yousef ben tashfin one cannnot now distinguish which tribe of arab belong to the first or the second invasion but all who can shew the slightest proof claim to belong to the first as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warrior after eight century of rule the arab be expel from spain take refuge in barbary but instead of find the hospitality and protection of they brethren the greater part of they be pillage or massacre the remnant of these wretched fugitive settle along the coast and it be to they industry and intelligence that we owe the increase or the foundation of many of the maritime city here consider as stranger and enemy by the native whom they detest the new colonist seek for and form relation with turk and renegade of all nation whilst they keep themselves separate from the arab and berber this then be the _ bonâ-fide _ origin of the people whom we now generally call moor history furnish we with a striking example of how the expel arab of spain unite with various adventurer against the berber and north african arab in the year 1500 a thousand andalusian cavalier who have emigrate to algier form a alliance with the barbarossa and they fleet of pirate and after expel the native prince build the modern city of algier and such be the origin of the algerine corsair the general result of these observation would therefore lead we to consider the moor of the roman as the berber or aborigine of north africa and the moor of the spaniard as pure arabian and if indeed these arabian cavalier marshal with they berber as auxiliary for the conquest of spain this fact do not militate against the broad assumption the so-called moor of senegal and the sahara as well as those of morocco be chiefly a mixture of berber arab and negro but the present moor locate in the northern coast of africa be rather the descendant from the various conquer nation and especially from renegade and christian slave the term moor be not know to the native themselves the people speak definitely enough of arab and of various berber tribe the population of the town and city be call generally after the name of these town and city whilst tuniseen and tripoline be apply to all the inhabitant of the great town of tuni and tripolus european resident in barbary as a general rule call all the inhabitant of town -- moor and the peasant or people resident in tent -- arab but in tripolus i find whole village inhabit by arab and these i think might be distinguish as town arab then the mountain of tripolus be cover with arab village and some few considerable town be inhabit by people who be _ bonâ-fide _ arab finally the capital of north africa be fill with every class of people find in the country the question be then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the case of nationality or can we with any degree of precision define the limit which distinguish the various race in north africa with regard to the black or negro tribe there can be no great difficulty the jew be also easily distinguish from the rest of the people as well by they national feature as by they dress and habit or custom of living but when we come to the berber arab moor and turk we can only distinguish they in they usual and ordinary occupation and manners of life whenever they be intermix or whenever they change they position that be to say whenever the arab or berber come to dwell in a town or a moor or a turk go to reside in the country adopt the arab or berber dress and mode of live it be no longer possible to distinguish the one from the other or mark the limitation of race and since it be see that the aborigine of northern africa consist with the exception of the negro tribe of the asiatic of the caucasian race or variety many of whom like the phoenician have people various city and province of europe it be therefore not astonishing we should find all the large town and city of north africa where the human be become _ police _ refine and civilized sooner than in remote and thinly-inhabited district teem with a population which at once challenge a european type and a corresponding origin with the great european family of nation north africa be wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion the people indeed have but one religion even the extraneous judaism be the same in its deism -- depression of the female -- circumcision and many of the religious custom festival and tradition and this have a surprising effect in assimilate the opposite character and sharpest peculiarity of various race of otherwise distinct and independant origin the population of morocco present five distant race and class of people berber arab moor jew and negro turk be not find in morocco and do not come so far west but son of turk by moorish woman in kourogly be include among the moor that have emigrate from algeria maroquine berber include the variety of the amayeegh -lrb- 14 -rrb- and the shelouh who mostly be located in the mountain while the arab be settle on the plain the moor be the inhabitant of town and city consist of a mixture of nearly all race a great proportion of they be of the descendant of the moor expel from spain all these race have be and will still be farther notice in the progress of the work the proximate amount of this population be six million the greater number of the town and city be situate on the coast except the three or four capital or imperial city the other town of the interior should be consider rather as fort to awe neighbouring tribe or as market village -lrb- _ souk _ -rrb- where the people collect together for the disposal and exchange of they produce numerous tribe locate in the atla escape the notice of the impost of imperial authority they variety and amount of population be equally unknown in the immense group of gibel thelge -lrb- snowy mountain -rrb- some of the tribe be say to have they face shave like christian and to wear boot we can understand why a people inhabit a cold region of rain and mist and perpetual snow should wear boot but as to they shave like christian this be rather vague but it be not impossible the atla contain the descendant of some european refugee the nature of the soil and climate of morocco be not unlike those of spain and portugal and though morocco do not materially differ from other part of barbary its greater extent of coast on the atlantic along which the tradewind of the north coast blow nine month out of twelve and its loftier ridge of the atla so temper its varied surface of hill and plain and vast declivity that together with the absence of those marshy district which in hot climate engender fatal disease this country may be pronounced excepting perhaps tuni the most healthy in all africa in the northern province the climate be nearly the same as that of spain in the southern there be less rain and more of the desert heat but this be compensate for by the greater fertility in the production of valuable staple article of commerce nevertheless morocco have its extreme of heat and cold like all the north african coast the most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe be the vast atla chain of mountain -lrb- 15 -rrb- which traverse morocco from north-east to south-west whose present ascertain culminate point miltsin be upward of 15000 foot above the level of the sea or equal to the highest peak of the pyrenee the maroquine portion of the atla contain its highest peak which stretch from the east of tripolus to the atlantic ocean at santa cruz and we find no mountain of equal height except in the tenth degree of north latitude or 18000 mile south or 30000 south south-east the rif coast have a mountainous chain of some considerable height but the atlantic coast offer chiefly ridge of hill the coast of morocco be not much indented and consequently have few port and these offer poor protection from the ocean the general surface of morocco present a large ridge or lock with two immense declivity one sloping nw to the ocean with various river and stream descend from this enormous back-bone of the atla and the other fulling towards the sahara se feed the stream and affluent of wad draha and other river which be lose in the sand of the desert this shape of the country prevent the formation of those vast _ sebhaha _ or salt lake so frequent in algerium and the south of tuni we be acquaint only with two lake of fresh or sweet water -- that of debaium traverse by wad draha -- and that of gibel-akhder which leo compare to lake bolsena the height of the mountain and the uniformity of they slope produce large and numerous river indeed the most considerable of all north africa these river of the north be shortest but have the largest volume of water those of the south be larger but be nearly dry the greater part of the year none of they be navigable far inland some abound with fish particularly the shebbel or barbary salmon it be neither so rich nor so large as we salmon and be whiteflesh it taste something like herr but be of a finer and more delicate flavor they be abundant in the market of mogudor the shebbel convert by the spaniard sabalo be find in the guadalquivir the product of the soil be nearly the same as in other part of barbary on the plain or in the open country the great cultivation be wheat and barley in suburban district vegetable and fruit be propagate in a commercial point of view the north export cattle grain bark leech and skin and the south export gum almond ostrich-feather wax wool and skin as principle staple produce when the rain cease or fail the cultivation be keep up by irrigation and a excellent variety of fruit and esculent vegetable be produce indeed nearly all the vegetable and fruit-tree of southern europe be here abundantly and successfully cultivate besides those peculiar to a african clime and soil in the south grow a tree peculiar to this country the eloeondenron argan so call from its arabic name argan this tree produce fruit resemble the olive whose egg-shaped brown smooth and very hard stone enclose a flat almond of a white color and of a very disagreeable taste which when crushed produce a rancid oil use commonly as a substitute for olive-oil the tree itself be bushy and large and sometimes grow of the size to a wide-spreading oak not far from mogador be several argan forest the level country of the north be cover with forest of dwarfish oak some bear sweet and other bitter acorn and also the cork-tree whose bark be a considerable object of commerce in the atla have be find the magnificent cedar of lebanon this tree have also be meet with in algerium but only on the mountain some forty thousand foot above the level of the sea in the south there be of course grow in all its saharan vigor the noble date-palm and by its side squat the palmetto or dwarf-palm -lrb- in arabic _ dauma _ -rrb- of tree and plant the usual tinzah and snouber or pine of aleppo be use for prepare the fine leather of morocco many plant be also deleteriously employ for exciting intoxication or inflame the passion morocco have its mine of gold silver lead iron tin sulphur mineral salt and antimony but nearly all be neglect or unworked government will not encourage the industry of the people for fear of exciting the cupidity of foreigner a frenchman a short time ago report a silver mine in the south and government immediately bribe he to make another statement that there be no such mine at elalum and stouka in the province of sous be several rich silver mine gold be find in the atla and the lower sous but this country be especially rich in copper mine a great number of ancient and modern author speak of these mine which be situate in the mountainous country comprise between aghadir morocco talda tamkrout and akka the mine most work be those of tedsus and afran at the foot of the atla near taroudant be a great quantity of sulphur in the neighborhood of morocco saltpetre be find in the province of abda be a extensive salt lake and salt have be export from this country to timbuctoo of precious stone some fine specimen of amethyst have be discover there be scarcely any animal peculiar to morocco or which be not find in other part of north africa davidson mention some curious fact relative to the desert horse _ sherb-errech _ wind-bibber or drinker of the wind a variety of this animal which be not to be meet with in the saharan region of tuni or tripolus this horse be feed only on camel 's milk and be principally use for hunting ostrich which be run down by it and then capture -lrb- 16 -rrb- the _ sherb-errech _ will continue run three or four day together without any food it be a slight and spare-formed animal mostly in wretched condition with ugly thick leg and devoid of beauty as a horse chapter iv division of morocco into kingdom or state and zone or region -- description of the town and city on the maroquine coast of the mediterranean and atlantic water -- the zafarine isle -- melillum -- alhucema -- penon de velez -- tegaza -- province of rif and garet -- tetouan -- ceuta -- arzilum -- el araish -- mehedium -- salee -- rabat -- fidallah -- dar-el-beidah -- azamor -- mazagran -- saffee -- waladium morocco have be divide into state or kingdom by european although such division scarcely exist in the administration of the native prince the ancient division mention by leo be that of two large province of morocco and fez separate by the river bouragrag which empty itself into the sea between rabat and salee and indeed for several century these district be separate and govern by independent prince tafilett always and sous occasionally be unite to morocco while fez itself form a powerful kingdom extend itself eastward as far as the gate of tlemsen the modern division adopt by several author be -- northern or the kingdom of fez central or the kingdom of morocco eastern or the province of tafilett southern or the province of sous some add to this latter the province of draha then a great number of district be enumerate as comprehend in these large and general division but the true division of all mussulman state be into tribe there be besides another which more approach to european government viz into kaidat or jurisdiction the name of a district be usually that of its chief tribe and mountain be denominate after the tribe that inhabit they there be of course a natural division sometimes call a divide into zone or specific region which have already be allude to in enumerate the natural resource of morocco and which besides correspond with the present political division i the north of the atla : come first the rif or mountainous region which border the mediterranean from the river moulwium to tangier comprise the district of hashbat west and gharet and aklaium east then the intermediate zone of plain and hill which extend from the middle course of the moulwium to tangier on one coast and to mogador on the other ii the central region or the great chain of the atla the deren -lrb- 17 -rrb- of the native from the frontier of algerium east to cape gheer on the south-west this include the various district of the gharb temsna benus hasan shawium fez todlum dukalum shragno abda haha shedma khamna morocco & c

south-east of the atla as to statistics of population i be inclined fully to admit the statement of signor balbus that the term of african statistics ought to be reject as absurd count hemo de gräberg who be a long time consul at tangier and write a statistical and geographical account of the empire of morocco state the number of the inhabitant of the town of mazagran to be two thousand mr elton who reside there several month assure I it do not contain more than one hundred another gentleman who dwell there say three hundred this case be a fair sample of the style in which the statistics of population in morocco be and have be calculate before the occupation of algerium by the french all the city be vulgarly calculate at double or treble they amount of population this have also be the case even in indium where we could obtain with care tolerably correct statistics the prejudice of oriental and africo-eastern people be wholly set against statistics or numbering the population no mother know the age of she own child it be ill-omened if not a affront to ask a man how many child he have and to demand the amount of the population of a city be either construct as a infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent creator who know how many people he create and how to take care of they or it be the question of a spy who be seek to ascertain the strength or weakness of the country european can therefore rarely obtain any correct statistical information in morocco : all be proximate and conjectural -lrb- 18 -rrb- i be anxious nevertheless to give some particulars respect the population in order that we may really have a proximate idea of the strength and resource of this important country in describe the town and city of the various province i shall divide they into 1 town and city of the coast 2 capital or royal city 3 other town and remarkable place in the interior -lrb- 19 -rrb- the town and port on the mediterranean are of considerable interest but we information be very scanty except as far as relate to the _ praesidio _ of spain or the well-known and much frequented town of tetuan and tangier near the mouth of the malwium -lrb- or fifteen mile distant -rrb- be the little town of kalat-el-wad with a castle in which the governor reside whether the river be navigable up to this place i have not be able to discover the water-communication of the interior of north africa be not worth the name zaffarind or jafarine be three isle lie off the west of the river mulweeah at a short distance or near its mouth these belong to spain and have

temple say assed ifrikus be make of the bone of whale which perish on this coast a little further on he allude to the breaking of horse and be skilful in bodily exercise for the moor and numidian have always be renown in that respect in the lesser and more remote town i have follow generally the enumeration of count gräberg but there be many other place on the map with variety of name or difference of position we geography of the interior of morocco especially in the south be still very obscure and i have only select those town and place of whose present existence there be no question my object in the above enumeration have be simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of the population and resource of this country of the strength and number of the tribe of the interior we know scarcely anything the name of the town and village of the south so frequently begin and end with t sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the berber population under the name of shelouh or amazirgh whilst the great error of writer have be to represent the arab as more numerous than this aboriginal population monsieur e renou in he geographical description of the empire of morocco -lrb- vol viii of the exploration scientifique & c -rrb- foolishly observe that there be no way of arrive at correct statistics of this empire except by compare it with algerium and then remark which be true enough malheureusement la population de l'algérie n'est pas encore bien connue when however he assert that the number of population give by jackson and gräberg be gross and almost unpardonable exaggeration give at hazard i be oblige to agree with he from the personal experience i have in morocco and these barbary country generally jackson make the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen million or nearly two third more than it probably amount to gräberg estimate it at eight million and a half but how or why or wherefore such estimate be make be not so easy to determine certain it be that the whole number of city which i have enumerate scarcely represent one million of inhabitant but for those who like to see something more definite in statistics however exaggerate may be the estimate i shall give the more moderate calculation of gräberg those of jackson be beyond all rhyme or reason gräberg thus classify and estimate the population amazirgh berber and touarick 2300000 amazirgh shelouh and arab 1450000 arab mixed moors & c 3550000 arab pure bedouin & c 740000 israelite rabbinist and caraite 339500 negro fullan and mandingo 120000 european and christian 300 renegade 200 ---------- total 8500000 if two million be deduct from this amount perhaps the reader will have something like a probable estimate of the population of morocco it be hardly correct to classify moor as mixed arab many of they be simply descendant of the aboriginal amazirgh i be quite sure there be no touarick in the empire of morocco of the maroquine sahara i have only space to mention the interesting cluster of oasis of figheegh or figuiq shaw mention they as a knot of villager note for they plantation of palm-trees supply the western province of algerium with date we have now more ample information of figheegh finding this saharan district to consist of a agglomeration of twelve village the more considerable of which be maiz count eight hundred house el-wadghir five hundred and zenega twelve hundred the other vary from one or two hundred house the village be more or less connect together never farther apart than a quarter of a league and place on the descent of wal-el-khalouf -lrb- river of the wild boar -rrb- whence water be procure for the garden contain variety of fruit-tree and abundance of date-palm all hedge round with prickly-pears madder-root and tobacco be also cultivate besides barley sufficient for consumption the wheat be bring from the telus the wad-el-khalouf be dry except in winter but its bed be bore with inexhaustible well whose water be distribute among the garden by means of a _ clepsydra _ or a vessel which drop so much water in a hour the ancient measure time by the drop of water like the fall of sand in the hour-glass some of the house in these village have two story and be well build each place have its mosque its school its kady and its sheikh and the whole agglomeration of oasis be govern by a sheikh kebir appoint by the sultan of morocco these saharan village be eternally in strife with one another and sometimes take up arm on this account they be surround by crenated wall defend by tower solidly build the immediate cause of discord here be water that precious element of all life in the desert but the imagination of the people be not satisfy with this simple reason and they be right for the cause lie deeply in the human heart they say however they ancestor be curse by a marabout to punish they for they laxity in religion and this be he anathema god make you until the day of judgment like wool-comber 's card the one gnawing the other they war in fact be most cruel for they destroy the noble and fruitful palm which by a tacit convention be spare in other part of the sahara when these quarrel proceed to bloodsh they have besides great tact in mining and they reputation as miner have be a long time established but happily they be addict to commerce and various branch of industry as well as war have commercial relation with fez tafilett and touat and the people be therefore generally prosperous chapter vii london jew-boy -- excursion to the emperor 's garden and the argan forest -- another interview with the governor of mogador on the anti-slavery address -- opinion of the moor on the abolition of slavery we have at time import into mogador a stray london jew or so of the lower lemon-selling sort these lad from the minory be highly exasperate against the moor for treat they with so much contempt indeed a high-spirited london jew-boy will not stop at mogador though the adult merchant will to get money for mankind often learn baseness with age and pass to it through a golden door one of these jew-boy be curse by a man naturally curse he again a eye for a eye a tooth for a tooth mr willshire do not think so and on the complaint of the moor the british consul throw the british jew-boy into a moorish prison where he remain for some day this be one more instance of the disadvantage of have commercial consul where everything be sacrifice to keep on good term with government authority a fire happen the other night break out in the house of one of the rich jewish merchant but it be soon extinguish the house be build chiefly of mortar and stone with very little wood the governor get up and go to the scene of conflagration he crack a few joke with the people and go home to bed the moor be sorry the fire do not extend itself want to have a opportunity of appropriate a few of the merchant 's goods i accompany mr and mr elton with other friend to spend the day in the pleasant valley of the saneeates-sultan -lrb- garden of the emperor -rrb- sometimes call gharset-es-sultan three or four hour ' ride south from mogador the small river of wad-el-kesab -lrb- overlook by the village of deeabat where watch-dog be bark apparently all day long as well as night -rrb- lay in we way and be with difficulty ford heavy rain have fall up the country though none on the coast these barbary stream be very deceptive illustrate the metaphor of the book of job deceitful as a brook to-day they bed be perfectly dry to-morrow a sheet of turbid water dashing and foam to the ocean cover they and the country round whilst the immediate cause be conceal abrupt and sudden overflowing occur in all river have they source in mountain the book of job may also refer to the disappointment of saharan traveller who on arrive weary and thirsty die for water at the stream of the desert find it dry up and so perish the country in the valley of the emperor 's garden offer nothing remarkable bush of underwood cover sandy mound a few palmetto and argan tree in which wild dove flutter and fly about be all that break the monotony of a perfect waste there be no cultivate land hereabouts and i be tell that a great part of morocco present this desolate aspect we visit however the celebrated argan tree which the people pretend be plant by the lieutenant of the prophet the mighty okba who have spur he horse in the roar rebellious surge of the atlantic weep and wail before heaven that there be no more nation in whose heart to plunge he awful scimitar -- so teach they the mercy of god alas the old hoary tree with a most peaceful patriarchal look seem to belie the honor stretch out its broad sinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the dart fire of a african sun a more noble object of inanimate nature be not to be contemplate than a large and lofty branch tree in its bough and leave endlessly vary mat together and intersect each other we see the palpable image of infinity but in the dry and hot climate of africa this tree be a luxury which can not be appreciate in europe we sit under its fresh shade awhile gaze with security at the bright fire of the sun radiate over and through all visible nature to check we enthusiasm we have strew at we foot old broken bottle and crockery the _ débris _ and classic relic of former visitor who be equally attentive to creature-comfort as to the grandeur of the argan monarch of the surround forest the emperor 's garden contain a well of water and a few fruit-tree on the trunk of one of which a fine fig-tree be carve in durable bark the name of european visitor among the rest that of a famous _ belle _ whose gallant worshipper have cut she name over all its broad trunk though they may have fail to cut they own on the plastic and india-rubber tablet of the fair one 's heart this carve on the fig-tree be the sum of all that european have do in morocco during several age we rather adopt moorish habit and descend to they animal gratification than inculcate we own or the intellectual pleasure of christian nation european female bring up in this country few excepted adopt with gusto the lascivious dance of the mooress and if this may be say of they what may we not think of the male class who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of they passion while repose under the umbrageous shade of the argan tree a moor related to we wondrous sprite and elfin tale of the forest of of these wild at one period the argan wood be full of enchantress who prevent good mussulman from say they prayer by dancing before they in all they natural charm to the sound of melodious and voluptuous music and if a poor son of the prophet perchance pass this way at the state time of prayer he find it impossible to attend to he devotions be pester to death by these naughty houry on another occasion when it be high summer and the sun burnt every leaf of the black argan foliage to a yellow red and whilst the arid earth open she mouth in horrid gap crystal spring of water be see to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth and run in rill among _ parterre _ of rose and jessamine the bough of the argan tree also suddenly change into _ jereed _ of the date-palm burden with luscious fruit but on weary traveller descend to slake they parching thirst and refresh themselves they fall headlong into the gaping hole of the ground and disappear in the abyss of the dark entrails of the world these argan forest continue under the fearful ban of the enchantress and wicked jinn until a holy man be bring from the farthest desert upon the back of a fly camel who set free the spell-bound wood by tie on each bewitch tree a small piece of cork bark on which be inscribe the sacred name of the deity the legend of these haunt argan forest remind we of the enchanted wood of tasso whose enchantment be dissolve by the gallant knight rinaldo and which enable the crusader to procure wood for the machine of war to assault and capture the holy city two quotation will shew the universality and permanence of superstition begotten of human hope and fear such be the beautiful imagery devote to superstitious musing by the illustrious bard : -- while like the rest the knight expect to hear loud peal of thunder breaking on he ear a dulcet symphony he sense invade of nymph or dryad warble through the shades soft sigh the breeze soft purl the silver rill the feathered choir the wood with music fill the tuneful swan in die note complain the mourning nightingale repeat she strain timbrel and harp and human voice join and in one concert all the sound combine then for the streamlet and floweret -- where'er he tread the earth she tribute pour in gush spring or voluntary flower here bloom the lily there the fragrant rose here spout a fountain there a riv ` let flow from every spray the liquid manna trill and honey from the soften bark distil again the strange the please sound he hear of plaint and music mingling in he ear yet naught appear that mortal voice can frame nor harp nor timbrel whence the music come i have another interview with the governor on anti-slavery subject mr treppass accompany I and assist to interpret he excellency be very condescending and even joke about he own slave ask I how much i would give he for they he then continue : -- i be happy to see you before you departure whilst you have be here i have hear nothing of you conduct but what be just and proper you be a quiet and prudent man -lrb- 28 -rrb- and i be sorry i could not assist you in you business -lrb- abolition -rrb- the sultan will be glad that you and i have not quarrel but be friend i then ask he excellency if a person be to come direct from we government with larger power and present he would have a better chance of success the governor reply not the least whatever you have do all that could have be do we look at the subject not the person the sultan will never listen to anybody on this subject you may cut off he head but can not convince he if all the christian of the world be to come and take this country then of course the mussulman would yield the question to superior force to the decree of god but not till then myself -- how be it sidus that the bey of tuni and the imaum of muscat have enter into engagement with christian for the suppression of slavery they be mussulmen the governor -- i 'll tell you we mussulman be as bad as you christian we be full of division and sect some of we people go to one mosque and will not go to another they be foolish -lrb- _ mahboul _ -rrb- so it be with the subject of slave some be with you but most be with I the bey of tuni and the imaum have a different opinion from we they think they be right and we think we be right but we be as good as they myself -- sidus do not the koran encourage the abolition of slavery and command it as a duty to all pious mussulman the governor -- no it do not command it but those who voluntarily liberate they slave be therein commend and have the blessing of god on they -lrb- 29 -rrb- myself -- sidus be it in my power to do anything for you in london the governor -- speak well of I that be all tell you friend i do all i could for you i may mention the opinion of the more respectable moor as to the mission they say if you have manage you mission well the sultan would have receive you address you consul be slack the french consul be more active because he be not the sultan 's merchant we sultan must receive every person even a beggar because god receive all you would not have obtain the liberation of we slave but the sultan would have promise you everything all that emanate from the english people be good this we be certain of but it would have be better have you come with letter from the bey of tuni shewing what have be do in that country mr treppass be also of the opinion that a deputation of several person accompany with some present for the emperor and he minister would have produce a better effect by make a appearance of shew and authority suitable to the idea of the people -lrb- 30 -rrb- if come direct from government it would have greater weight he think besides there be a good number of moor who be favourable to abolition of the connexion between the east and morocco he say all the barbary state look up to the sultan of constantinople as to a great authority and during the last few year a active correspondence on religious matter have be carry on between morocco and constantinople chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the name of yousef if the turkish sultan therefore would _ bonâ-fide _ abolish the slave-markets i have no doubt this would produce a impression in morocco favourable to abolition during the time i be in morocco i distribute some arabic tract translate from the english by professor lee of cambridge on the abolition of slavery a few arabic bible and hebrew new testament be also place at my disposal for circulation by the society i also write a anti-slavery circular to the british merchant of mogador on lord brougham 's act chapter viii el-jereed the country of date -- its hard soil -- salt lake its vast extent -- beautiful palm-tree -- the date a staple article of food -- some account of the date-palm -- make of culture -- delicious beverage -- tap the palm -- meal form from the date -- basket make of the branch of the tree -- poetry of the palm -- its irrigation -- palm-grove -- collection of tribute by the bey of the camp el-jereed or belad-el-jereed the country of date or literally the country of the palm branch be a part of the sahara or the hot dry country lie in the immediate vicinity of the great desert its principal feature of soil and climate offer nothing different from other portion of the sahara or the saharan region of algerium and morocco the belad-el-jereed therefore may be properly call the tunisian sahara shaw observe generally of jereed : -- this part of the country and indeed the whole tract of land which lie between the atlantic and egypt be by most of the modern geographer call biledulgerid a name which they seem to have borrow from bloid-el-jeridde of the arabian who merely signify the dry country though if we except the jeridde a small portion of it which be situate on this side of lesser syrti and belong to the tunisian all the rest of it be know by no other general name than the sahara or sahra among those arab at least whom i have converse with besides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branch palm whose dark depend slender leaf be depict by the arabian poet as hang gracefully like the dishevelled ringlet of a beautiful woman in distress there be the vast salt lake el-sibhah or literally the salt plain and call by some modern geographer the sibhah-el-soudeeat or lake of mark from have certain mark make of the trunk of the palm to assist the caravan in they march across its monotonous samelike surface this vast lake or salt plain be divide by the ancient into three part and denominate respectively palus tritoni palus palla and palus libya the first be derive from the river triton which accord to ptolemy and other ancient geographer be make to pass through this lake in its course to the sea but which be the present river ghob where it fall into the mediterranean the name palla be derive from the tradition of palla have accompany sesostri in he asiatic expedition with the lybian woman and she may have be a native of the jereed the lake measure from north-east to south-west about seventy english mile with a third of the breadth but it be not one collection of water there be several dry place like so many island intersperse over its surface depend however as to they number and extent upon the season of the year and upon the quantity of water in the particular season at first on cross it say a tourist the grass and bush become gradually scarcer then follow a tract of sand which some way beyond become in part cover with a thin layer of salt this as you advance be thicker and more united then we find it a compact and unbroken mass or sheet which can however be penetrate by a sword or other sharp instrument and here it be find to be eleven inch in depth and finally in the center it become so hard deep and concentrate as to baffle all attempt at break its surface except with a pickaxe the horse 's shoe in fact make no impression upon its stone-like surface the salt of the lake be considerably weaker than that of the sea and not adapt for preserve provision though its flavor be very agreeable it be not export nor make in any way a article of commerce the jereed from the existence in it of a few antiquity such as piece of granite and marble and occasionally a name or a classic inscription be prove to have be in the possession of the roman and undoubtedly of the carthaginian before they who could have have no difficulty in hold this flat and exposed country the trade and resource of this country consist principally in date the quantity export to other part of the regency as well as to foreign country where they fine quality be well know be in round number on a average from three to four thousand quintal per annum but in jereed itself twenty thousand people live six month of the year entirely on date a great number of pole say sir grenville temple be arrange across the room at the height of eight or nine foot from the ground and from these be suspend rich and large bunch of date which compose the winter store of the inhabitant and in one corner of the room be one or more large earthern jar about six or seven foot high also fill with date press close together and at the bottom of the jar be a cock from which be draw the juice in the form of a thick luscious syrup it be scarcely possible to imagine anything more palatable than this ` sweet of sweet ' as we be write of the country of date _ par excellence _ i must need give some description of the palm but it will be understand that the information be tunisian or collect in tuni and may differ in some respects from detail collect in other part of north africa the date-palm abound in the maritime as well as in the inland district of north africa they be usually propagate from shoot of full grown tree which if transplant and take care of will yield in six or seven year whilst those raise immediately from the stone require sixteen year to produce fruit the date-palm be male and female or _ dioecious _ and require communication otherwise the fruit be dry and insipid the age of the palm in its greatest vigor be about thirty year accord to the tunisian after plant and will continue in vigor for seventy year bear anually fifteen or twenty cluster of date each of they fifteen or twenty pound in weight after this long period they begin gradually to wither away but the saharan tripolitan will tell you that the date-palm do not attain its age of full vigor till it reach a hundred year and then will flourish two or or three century before it wither the only culture requisite be to be well water at the root once in four or five day and to have the lower bough cut off when they begin to droop and wither much rain however injure the date and we know that the country in which they flourish be mostly without rain in many locality in africa date-palm can never be water in the dry season it be nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm grow and thrive water may usually be obtain by bore the sap or honey of the palm be a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite fresh but if allow to remain for some hour it acquire a sharp taste something like cider and become very intoxicating it be call poetically _ leghma _ tear of the date when a tree be find not to produce much fruit the head be cut off and a bowl or cavity scoop out of the summit in which the rise sap be collect and this be drunk in its pure state without any other preparation if the tree be not exhaust by drain in five or six month it grow afresh and at the end of two or three year may again be cut or tap the palm be capable of undergo this operation five or six time and it may be easily know how often a tree have be cut by the number of ring of a narrow diameter which be see towards its summit but if the sap be allow to flow too long it will perish entirely at the end of a year this sap by distillation produce a agreeable spirit call _ arâky _ or _ arâk _ : from the fruit also the jew distil a spirit call _ bokka _ or what we should call _ toddy _ it be usual for person of distinction to entertain they friend upon a marriage or the birth of a child with this pure sap and a tree be usually tap for the purpose it would appear that tap the palm be know to the ancient for a cornelian _ intaglio _ of roman antiquity have be find in the jereed represent a tree in this state and the jar in which the juice be place date be likewise dry in the sun and reduce into a kind of meal which will keep for any length of time and which thus become a most valuable resource for traveller cross the desert who frequently make it they only food moisten a handful of it with a little water certain preparation be make of the male plant to which medicinal virtue be attribute the younger leave eat with salt vinegar and oil make a excellent salad the heart of the tree which lie at top between the fruit branch and weigh from ten to twenty pound be eat only on grand occasion as those already mention and possess a delicious flavor between that of a banana and a pine-apple the palm besides these valuable use to which it be apply supersede or supply the place of all other vegetable to the tribe of the jereed be nevertheless still useful for a great variety of other purpose the most beautiful basket and a hundred other nick-nackery of the wickery sort be make of its branch rope be make and vestment weave from the long fiber and its wood also when harden by age be use for build indeed we may say it be the all and everything of the jereed and as it be say of the camel and the desert _ the palm be make for the jereed and the jereed be make for the palm _ the mussulman make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the palm and pretend that _ they be make for the palm and the palm be make for they _ allege that as soon as the turk conquer constantinople the palm raise its graceful flowing head over the dome of the former infidel city whilst when the moor evacuate spain the palm pine away and die god add the pious mussulman have give we the palm amongst the christian it will not grow but the poetry of the palm be a inseparable appendage in the north african landscape and even town scenery the moor and the arab whose mind be naturally imbue with the great image of nature so glowingly represent also in the sacred leaf of the koran can not imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a hermitage without the dark leaf of the palm overshadow it but the serenest loveliest object on the face of the landscape be _ the lonely palm _ either throw by chance on the brow of some savage hill or plant by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth i must still give some other information which i have omit respect this extraordinary tree and after this i further refer the reader to a tour in the jereed of which some detail be give in succeed page a palm-grove be really a beautiful object and require scarcely less attention than a vineyard the tree be generally plant in a _ quincunx _ or at time without any regular order but at distance from each other of four or five yard the situation select be mostly on the bank of some stream or rivulet run from the neighbouring hill and the more abundant the supply of water the healthier the plant and the finer the fruit for this tree which love a warm climate and a sandy soil be yet wonderfully improve by frequent irrigation and singularly the _ quality _ of the water appear of little consequence be salt or sweet or impregnate with nitre as in the jereed irrigation be perform in the spring and through the whole summer the water be draw by small channel from the stream to each individual tree around the stalk and root of which a little basin be make and fence round with clay so that the water when receive be detain there until it soak into the earth -lrb- all irrigation be indeed effect in this way -rrb- as to the abundance of the plantation the fruit of one plantation alone produce fifteen hundred camel ' load of date or four thousand five hundred quintal three quintal to the load be not unfrequently sell for one thousand dollar besides the jereed tafilett in morocco be a great date-country mr jackson say we find the country cover with most magnificent plantation and extensive forest of the lofty date exhibit the most elegant and picturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the admiring eye in these forest there be no underwood so that a horseman may gallop through they without impediment we reader will see when they come to the tour that this description of the palm-groves agree entirely with that of mr reade and captain balfor i have already mention that the palm be male and female or as botanist say _ dioecious _ the moor however pretend that the palm in this respect be just like the human be the _ female _ palm alone produce fruit and be cultivate but the presence or vicinity of the _ male _ be require and in many oriental country there be a law that those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _ male _ plant in proportion in barbary they seem to trust to chance rely on the male plant which grow wild in the desert they hang and shake they over the female plant usually in February or march koempfe say that the male flower if pluck when ripe and cautiously dry will even in this state perform they office though keep to the following year the jereed be a very important portion of the tunisian territory government derive a large revenue from its inhabitant it be visit every year by the bey of the camp who administer affair in this country as a sovereign and who indeed be heir-apparent to the tunisian throne immediately on the decease of the reign bey the bey of the camp occupy the hereditary beylick and nominate he successor to the camp and the throne usually the eldest of the other member of the royal family the beylick not be transmit from father to son only on the principle of age at least this have be the general rule of succession for many year the duty of the bey of the camp be to visit with a flying-camp for the purpose of collect tribute the two circuit or division of the regency i now introduce to the reader the narrative of a tour to the jereed extract from the notebook of the

mount arab guard 300 camp follower -lrb- arab -rrb- 2000 ----- total 2660 this be certainly not a large force but in several place of the march they be join for a short time by additional arab troops a sort of honorary welcome for the bey as they proceed the force of the camp-follower increase but in return it gradually decrease the party go home to they respective tribe we may notice the total absence of any of the new corps the nithàlm this may have be to avoid exciting the prejudice of the people however the smallness of the force show that the district of the jereed be well-affected the summer camp to beja have a somewhat larger force the arab of that and other neighbouring district not be so loyal to the government besides the above-named troops there be two piece of artillery the band attendant on these troops consist of two or three flageolet kettle-drum and trumpet make of cow-horn which accord to the report of we tourist when in full play produce the most diabolical discord after a ride of about three hour we pitch we tent at beereen through the whole of the route we march on a average of about four mile per hour the horse camel & c walking at a good pace the turkish infantry always come up about two hour after the mount troops immediately on the tent be pitch we go to pay we respects to the bey accompany by giovannus guardapipa as interpreter he highness receive we very affably and bid we ask for anything we want afterwards we take some luncheon with the bey 's doctor signora nunez vaise a tuscan jew of whose kindness during we whole tour it be impossible to

with he mameluke and officer of state after they meeting and salute three gun be fire the agha be salute every day in the same manner as he come up with he infantry after we we retire for the night at about eight o'clock the form of the whole camp when pitch consist of about a dozen very large tent be as follow : -- the bey 's tent in the center which be surround at a distance of about forty foot with those of the bash-hamba -lrb- 31 -rrb- of the arab the agha of the arab the sahab-el-tabah haznadar or treasurer the bash-boab and that of the english tourist then further off be the tent of the

have two panier on its back full of water which be bring from tuni by camel there be also a story-teller who entertain the bey every night with the most extraordinary story some of they frightfully absurd the bey do not smoke -- a thing extraordinary as nearly all man smoke in tunis he highness always dine alone none of he lady ever accompany he in these expedition the tent have in they from twenty to fifty man each we tent consist of we two self a boab to guard the baggage two arab to tend the horse and camel and another moor of all work besides captain balfor 's maltese call michael we have three camel for we baggage the first night we find very cold but have abundance of clothing we sleep soundly in spite of the perpetual wild shouting of the arab sentry station round the camp the roaring and grumbling of the camel the neighing and cough of the horse all do they utmost to drive away slumber from we eyelid we halt on the morrow which give we a opportunity of get a few thing from tuni which we have neglect to bring but before return we eat some sweetmeat send we by the guarda-pipa with a cup of coffee the guarda-pipa be also a dragoman interpreter of he highness and a genoese by birth but now a renegade in this country they do not know what a good breakfast be they take a cup of coffee in the morning early and wait till twelve or one o'clock when they take a hearty meal and then sup in the evening late or early accord to the season before return to tuni we call upon he highness and tell he we object we afterwards call to see the bey every morning to pay we respects to he as be befitting on these occasion he highness enter into the most familiar conversation with we on come back again from tunis it rain hard which continue all night in the evening the welcome news be proclaim that the tent would not be strike until daylight : previously the camp be always strike at 3 o'clock about three hour before daylight which give rise to great confusion besides be without shelter during the coldest part of the night -lrb- three hour before sun-rise -rrb- be a very serious trial for the health of the man the reason however be to enable the camel to get up to the new encampment they progress though regular and continual be very slow of a morning the music play off the _ réveil _ a hour before sunrise the camp present a animated appearance with the striking of tent pack camel mount horse & c we pay we respects to he highness who be sit in a arab tent he own be down the music be incessantly grate upon we ear but be in harmony with the irregular march and movement of the arab one of they occasionally rush out of the line of march charge wheeling about firing reloading shout furiously and make the air ring with he cry the order of march be as follow : -- the bey mount and go along about one hundred yard from the spot he salute the arab guard who follow behind he then about five or six mile further overtake the turkish soldier who on he come up be draw up on each side of the road he highness salute they and then afterwards the water-carrier be salute be most important personage in the dry country of this circuit and last of all the gunner after all which the bey send forward a mameluke who return with the commander or agha of the arab to he highness this do the bey gallop off to the right or leave from the line of march on whichsoever side be most game -- the bey go every day to shoot whilst the agha take he place and march to the next halting-place one morning the bey shoot two partridge while on horseback in fact say mr rade he be the best shot on horseback i ever see -- he seldom miss he game as captain b be ride along with the doctor they remark a cannon-ball among some ruin but be tell a saint be bury there they get out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent have be discover stretch away to the left we see a portion of the remains of the carthaginian aqueduct the march be only from six to eight mile and the encampment at tfeefleeah at day-break at noon at 3 o'clock pm and at sunset the muezzen call from outside and near the door of the bey 's tent the hour of prayer a aide-de-camp also proclaim at the same place whether we should halt or march on the morrow the arab consider fat dog a great delicacy and kill and eat they whenever they can lay hand upon they captain b be fortunate in not bring he fat pointer otherwise he would have lose he the arab eat also fox and wolf and many animal of the chase not partaken of by we the french in algier kill all the fat cat and turn they into hare by dexterous cooking the morning and evening we find cold but mid-day very hot and sultry we leave tfeefleeah early and go in search of wild-boar find only they track but see plenty of partridge and hare the ground be cover with brushwood and heath we soonæ lose sight of they the arab be see on a sudden running and gallop in all direction shout and point to a hill when a huge beast be put up bristle and bellow which turn out to be a hyæna he be shoot by a mameluke si smyle and fall in a thicket wallow in he blood he be a fine fellow and have a immense bead like a bull-dog they put he on a mule and carry he in triumph to the bey when r arrive at the camp the bey send he the skin and the head as a present beg that he would not eat the brain there be a superstitious belief among the moor that if a person eat the brain of a hyæna he immediately become mad the hyæna be not the savage beast commonly represent he rarely attack any person and become untameably ferocious by be only chained up he be principally remarkable for he stupidity when at large in the wood the animal abound in the forest of the morocco atla we tourist see no lion _ en route _ or in the jereed the lion do not like the sandy and open country of the plain very thick brushwood and ground break with rock like the ravine of the atla be he haunt several arab be flog for have steal the barley of which they have charge the bastinado be inflict by two inferior mameluke stand one on each side of the culprit who have he hand and he foot tie behind he in general it may be say that bastinadoing in tuni be a matter of form many of the stroke order to be inflict be never perform and those give be so many tap or scratch it be very rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado i -lrb- the author -rrb- never do it be merely threaten as a terror whilst it be not to be overlook that the sole of the foot of arab and the lower class in this country be like iron from the constant habit of go barefoot upon the sharpest stone severe punishment of any kind be rarely inflict in tunis the country be nearly all flat desert with scarcely a inhabitant to dissipate its savage appearance the woman of a few arab horsehair tent -lrb- waterproof when in good repair -rrb- salute we as we pass with they shrill looloo there appear a great want of water we pass the ruin of several town and other remain the camel be always drive into camp at sunset and hobble along they two fore-leg be tie or one of they be tie up to the knee by which the poor animal be make to cut a more melancholy figure than with they usual awkward gait and moody character we continue we march about ten mile in nearly a southern direction and encamp at a place call heelet-el-gazlen one morning shortly after start we come to a small stream with very high and precipitous bank over which one arch of a fine bridge remain but the other be want we have to make a considerable _ détour _ before we could cross the carriage have still greater difficulty here we have a almost inexcusable instance of the disinclination of the moor to repair for have the stream be swollen the camp would have be oblige to make a round-about march by the way of hamman-el-enf of some thirty mile and all for the want of a arch which would scarcely cost a thousand piastre this stream or river be the same as that which pass near hamman-el-enf and the extensive plain through which it meander be well cultivate with douwar or circular village of the arab dot about we see hare but the ground be difficult run for the dog we catch but few bevy of partridge get up but we be unprepared for they in the evening the bey send a present of a very fine bay horse to r march about ten mile and halt at ben sayden the follow day after start we leave the line of march to shoot saw one boar plenty of fox and wolf and we put up another hyæna but the bag consist principally of partridge the red-legged partridge or _ perdix ruffa _ kill by the bey who be a dead-shot we ride lay among hill there be very little water which account for the few inhabitant after dinner go out shooting near jebanah and bag a few partridge but not return before the sun go down the bey send a dozen fellow bawl out we name fear some harm have befall we on leave the hill there lay stretch at we foot a boundless plain on which be situate kairwan extend also to susa and league around north africa be a country of hill and plain -- such be the case along we entire route we see a large herd of gazelle feed as well as several single one but they have the speed of the greyhound so we do not grace we supper with any saw several bird call kader about the size of a partridge but we shoot none a good many hare and partridge either cross we path or whir over we head pass over a run stream call zebharah where we see the remains of a ancient bridge but in the place where the baggage go over there be a fine one in good repair here be a small dome-topped chapel call sidus farhat in which be lay the ash of a saint we have see many such in the hill indeed these gubbah abound all over barbary and be place more frequently on elevation we notice particularly the 300 turkish infantry they be irregular with a vengeance though regular compare to the arab on overtake they they draw up on each side and some dozen of they keep up a run sham fight with they sword and small wooden and metal shield before the bey the officer kiss the hand of the bey and he treasurer tip they band for so we must call they tumtum and squeaking-pipe this ceremony take place every morning and they be receive in the camp with all the honor they keep guard during the night and do all they could to keep we awake by they eternal cry of alleya which mean be off or keep you distance these troops have not be recruit for eight year and will soon die off and yet we see that the bey treat these remnant of the once formidable turkish tunisian janissary with great respect of course in a affair with the arab they fidelity to the bey would be most unshaken as we journey onward we see much less vegetation and very little cultivation a immense plain lay before and around we in which however there be some undulating ground pass a good stone bridge be supply with water near a large arab encampment around which be many drove of camel turn up several hare partridge and gazelle one of the last give we a good chase but the greyhound catch he in the first half mile he certainly beat they by a good half of the instance but have take a turn which enable the dog to make a short cut and be blow they pull the swift delicate creature savagely down there be several good course after hare though she pursuer give puss no fair play firing at she before the dog and head she in every possible way ride to kairwan few christian arrive in this city prince pückler muskau be the fourth when he visit it in 1835 the town be clean but many house be in ruin the greater part of a regiment of the nitham be quarter here the famous mosque of course we be not allow to enter but many of its marble pillar and other ornament we hear from giovannus be the spoil of christian church and pagan temple the house of the kaëd be a good specimen of dwelling in this country go along a street we be greatly surprise at see we attendant among whom be si smyle -lrb- a very intelligent and learn man and who teach mr r arabic during the tour -rrb- and the bash-boab jump off they horse and run up to a old-looking moor and then seize he hand kiss it and for some time they would not leave the ragged ruffian-like saint at last have join we they say he be sidi amour abeda a man of exceed sanctity and that if the bey have meet the saint he highness must have do the same the saint accompany we to the kaëd 's house and on enter we see the old kaëd himself who be ill and weep on account of the arrival of he son the commander of a portion of the guard of the camp we go up stair and sit down to some sweetmeat which have be prepare for we together with si smyle and hamda but as we be commence the saint who be present lay hold of the sweet with he hand and bless they mumble _ bismilla _ -lrb- 33 -rrb- and other jargon we afterwards see a little house in course of erection by order of the bey where the remains of sidus amour abeda be to be deposit at he death so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure of visit he future burial-place in this city a lineal descendant of the prophet and a lucky guesser in the way of divine be the essential ingredient in the composition of a moorish saint saint of one order or another be as thick here as ordinary priest in malta whom the late facetious major wright be accustom to call _ crow _ -- from they black dress -- but better cormorant as agree with they habit of fleece the poor people sidi amour abeda 's hand ought to be lily-white for every one who meet he kiss they with devout and slavering obeisance the renegade doctor of the bey tell we that the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to see we english infidel burnt alive fanaticism seem to be the native growth of the human heart we afterwards visit the jabeah or well which they show as a curiosity as also the camel which turn round the bucket and bring up the water be all sanctify like the well of mecca and the drinking of the water form a indispensable part of the pilgrimage to all holy mohammedan city we return to the kaëd 's and sit down to a capital dinner the old governor be a great fanatic and when r run up to shake hand with he the mameluke stop r for fear he might be insult we visit the fortress which be in course of repair we _ cicerone _ be sidus reschid a artillery-officer we then return to the camp and find santa marium the french officer have arrive who during the tour employ himself in take sketch and make scientific observation he be evidently a french spy on the resource of the bey it be give out however that he be employ to draw chart of algier tuni and tripolus by he government he endeavor to make himself as unpopular as some person try to make themselves agreeable be very jealous of we and every little thing that we have he use to cry for it and beg it like a child sometimes actually go to the bey 's tent in person and ask he highness for the thing which he see have be give to we we go to see he highness administer justice which he always do morning and evening whilst at kairwan there be many plaintiff but no defendant bring up most of they be turn out in a very summary manner to some order be give which we suppose enable they to obtain redress other be refer to the kady and chief the bey be in want of camel party be send out in search of they who drive in all the finest that they could find which be then marked -lrb- tabâ -rrb- _ à la bey _ and immediately become the bey 's property it be a curious sight to see the poor animal throw over and the red-hot iron put to they leg amidst the cry and curse of they late different owner -- all which be not in the least attend to the want of the bey or government be superior on such occasion of necessity or what not to all complaint law or justice about two hundred change hand in this way the bey of tunis have a immense number of camel which he farm out he have overseer in certain district to whom he give so many camel these let they out to other person for mill and agricultural labor at so much per head the overseer annually render a account of they to government and when call upon supply the number require at this time owe to a disorder which have cause a great mortality camel have be very scarce and this be the reason of the extensive seizure just mention if a arab commit manslaughter he tribe be mulct thirty-three camel and as the crime be rather common in the bedouin district the bey 's acquisition in this way be considerable a few year ago a sicilian nobleman export from tuni to sicily some eighty camel the duty for which the bey remit the camel if ever so healthy and thriving in the island of the mediterranean could never supersede the labor of mule the camel be only useful where there be vast plain to travel as in north africa arabium persium australasium and some part of the east indy a hundred more arab join who pass in a single file before the bey for inspection : they come rush into the camp by two and three firing off they long gun we cross large plain over which run troops of gazelle and have many gallop after they but they go much faster than the greyhound and unless head and bully there be little chance of take they except find asleep on come on a troop unaware r shot one which the dog catch r go up afterwards to cut its throat _ à la moresque _ when he be insult by a arab r notice the fellow and afterwards tell the bey who instantly order he to receive two hundred bastinado and to be put in chain but just as they have begin to whip he r go up and generously beg he off this be the end of most bastinado in the country we pass a stream which they say have swallow up some person and be very dangerous a muddy stream they add be often very fatal to traveller the bey surprise captain b by send he a handsome black horse as a present he also send a gray one to the frenchman who when complain of it say that it be a bad one to the bey 's mameluke he highness send for it and give he another under such circumstance saint mary ought to have look very foolish the bey shoot a kader a handsome bird rather larger than a partridge with black wing and fly like a plover we have a large hawking-establishment with we some twenty bird very fine falconry which sometimes carry off hare and even attack young goat-kid march to a place call gilma near which the road pass through a ancient town shaw say gilma the ancient cilma or oppidum chilmanenense be six league to the east-south-east of spaitlum we have here the remains of a large city with the area of a temple and some other fragment of large building accord to the tradition of the arab this place receive its name in consequence of a miracle pretend to have be work by one of they marabout in bring hither the river of spaitlum after it be lose underground for ja elma signify in they language ` the water come ' a expression we be to imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream during we tour the morning be generally cold we proceed about twenty mile and encamp near a place call wady tuckah this river come from the hill about three or four mile off and when the camp arrive at kairwan the bey send a order to the arab of the district to let the water run down to the place where the tent be pitch when we arrive the water have just come we see warren of hare and catch many with the dog troops of gazelle be also surprised one be fire at and go off scamper on three leg the hawk catch a beautiful bird call hobara or habary -lrb- 34 -rrb- about the size of the small hen-turkey lily white on the back light brown brindle tuft of long white feather on its head and ruffle of long black feather which they stretch out at pleasure with a large gray eye a curious prickly plant grow about here something like a dwarf broom if its leaf be sharp thorn it be call kardert the bey make r a present of the hobara one day three gazelle be catch and also a fox by r 's greyhound which behave extremely well and leave the other dog in the rear every now and then attack he in the hind-quarter see seven or eight hobara but too windy for the hawk to be fly captain b chase a gazelle himself and have the good fortune to catch he as soon as a arab secure a animal he immediately cut its throat repeat bismillah allah akbar in the name -lrb- of god -rrb- god be great we march seventeen mile to a place call aly ben own the name of the saint bury close by the plain we cross must have be once thickly inhabit as there be many remains we be join by more arab and we force continue to augment the bey be in want of horse the same system of seize they be adopt as with the camel one splendid morning that break over we encampment we have a opportunity of witness africa 's most gorgeous scenery -lrb- 35 -rrb- plenty of hobara they fly like a goose the hawk take two or three of they also some hare the poor hare do not know what to make of the hawk after a little run it give itself up for death only first dodge out of the bird 's pounce or hide itself in a tuft of grass or a bush but which it be not long allow to do for the arab soon drive it out from its vain retreat the hawk when he seize the hare with one claw catch hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the other a strong leather strap be also fasten from one leg to the other to prevent they from be pull open or strained we come upon a herd of small deer call ebba which be a little larger than the gazelle but they soon bound beyond we pursuit leave we scarcely time to admire they delicate make and unapproachable speed we cross a range of hill into another plain at the extremity of which lie ghafsa the surface be naked with the exception of tuft of strong rushy grass almost a sure indication of hare and of which we start a great number we see another description of bird call rhaad -lrb- 36 -rrb- with white wing which fly like a pigeon but more swiftly near we tract be the remains of a large tank of ancient roman construction the bey shoot a fox march fourteen or fifteen mile to zwaneah which mean little garden though there be no sign of such thing unless it be the few orange date and pomegranate which they find here we have water from a tank of modern construction some remains be close to the camp the ancient cistern and stone duct lead from the hill we have two thousand camel with the camp and follow it for which not a single atom of provender be carry the camel subsist scantily upon the coarse grass weed or thorn which the soil barely afford the camel be very fond of sharp prickly thorn you look upon the animal with its apparently most tender mouth chop the sharpest thorn it can find full of amazement some of the chief who have lately join we have bring they wife with they ride on camel in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine these palanquin have a kind of mast and shroud from which a bell be sling tinkle with the swing motion of the camel this rude contrivance make the camel more than ever the ship of the desert several fine horse be bring in as present to the bey one a very fine mare we next march be towards ghafsa about twenty mile off we be join by a considerable number of fresh arab who play at powder and keep firing and gallop before the bey the whole day some of they manage themselves and they arm and horse with great address balance the firelock on they head firing it twist it round throw it into the air and catch it again and all without once lose the command of they horse a accident happen amidst the fun two of the party come in contact and one of they receive a dreadful gash on the forehead the dress of some of they be very rich and look very graceful on horseback a ride over sand-hill bring we in view of the town embed in olive and date-tree look fresh and green after we hot and dusty march it lay stretch at the foot of a range of hill which form the boundary of another extensive plain we halt at ghafsa -lrb- 37 -rrb- which be almost a mass of rubbish fill with dirty people although there be plenty of spring about principally hot and mineral water although the moor by they religion be enjoin the constant use of the bath yet because they do not change they linen and other clothes they be always very dirty they do not however exceed the maltese and sicilian and many other people of the neighborhood in filth and perhaps the moor be cleaner in they hahit than they the arab be extremely disgusting and they woman be often see in a cold winter 's evening standing with they leg extend over a smoky wood fire hold up they petticoat and continue in this indelicate position for hour together in these thermæ or hot sulphurous and other mineral spring be the phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snake these be observe by we tourist but i shall give three other authority besides they shaw say : ` the ouri-el-nout ' _ ie _ ` well of fish ' and the spring of ghasa and toser nourish a number of small fish of the mullet and perch kind and be of a easy digestion of the like quality be the other water of the jereed all of they after they become cold be the common drink of the inhabitant sir grenville temple remark : the thermometer in the water marked ninety-five degree and what be curious a considerable number of fish be find in this stream which measure from four to six inch in length and resemble in some degree the gudgeon have a delicate flavor bruce mention a similar fact but he say he see it in the spring of feriana part of the ancient structure of these bath still exist and piece of inscription be observe in different place mr honneger have make a sketch of this fish the wood-cut represent it one half the natural size : -lrb- illustration -rrb- the snake not notice by former tourist have be observe by mr honneger which nourish itself entirely upon the fish the wood-cut represent the snake half its natural size : -lrb- illustration -rrb- the fish and the snake live together though not very amicably in the hot-spring prince pükler muskau who travel in tunis narrate that near the ruin of utica be a warm spring in whose almost hot water we find several turtle _ which seem to inhabit this basin _ however perhaps there be no such extraordinary difficulty in the apprehension of this phenomenon for the gulf stream on leave the gulf of mexico have a temperature of more than 27 ° -lrb- centigrade -rrb- or 80-6\/10 degree of fahrenheit -lrb- 38 -rrb- many a fish must pass through and live in this stream and after all since water be the element of fish and be hotter or colder in all region like the air the element of man which he breathe warmer or cooler accord to clime and local circumstance -- there appear to be no physical objection in the way of give implicit credence to we tourist water be so abundant that the adjoining plain might be easily irrigated and plant with ten thousand palm and forest of olive god be bountiful in the desert but man wilfully neglect these aqueous riches spring up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning simoum in one of the grove we meet a dervish who immediately set about charming we boab he begin by a incantation then seize he round the middle and stoop a little lift he on he shoulder continue the while the incantation he then put he on he foot again and after several attempt appear to succeed in bring off he stomach something in the shape of leaden bullet which he then with a air of holy swagger present to the astonished guard of the bey the dervish next spat on he patient 's hand close they in he own then smooth he down the back like a mountebank smooth he pony and stroke also he head and beard and after further gentle and comely ceremony of this sort the charming of the charmer finish and the boab present the holy man with he fee we dine at the kaëd 's house this functionary be a very venerable man a perfect picture of a patriarch of the olden scriptural time of abraham isaac and jacob there be not a single article of furniture in the room except a humble sofa upon which he sit we inspect the old kasbah at ghafsa which be in nearly a state of ruin and look as if it would soon be down about we ear it be a irregular square and build chiefly of the remains of ancient edifice it be guard by fifty turk whose broken-down appearance be in perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabit the square in a building be the favorite form of the moor and mohammedan generally the kaaba of mecca the _ sanctum sanctorum _ be a square the moor endeavor to imitate the sacred object of they religion in every way even in the commonest affair of human existence whilst likewise they troops of wife and concubine be only a earthly foretaste and a earnest of the celestial lady they expect to meet hereafter we see they make oil which be in a very primitive fashion the oil-maker be nearly all woman the olive be first ground between stone work by the hand until they become of the consistence of paste which be then take down to the stream and put into a wooden tub with water on be stir up the oil rise to the top which they skim off with they hand and put into skin or jar when thus skim they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve the water run off the stone and pulp be then save for firing but in this way much of the oil be lose as may be see by the greasy surface of the water below where this rude process be go on among the oil-woman we notice a girl who would have be very pretty and fascinating have she wash herself instead of the olive we enter a arab house inhabit by some twenty person chiefly woman who forthwith unceremoniously take off we cap examine very minutely all we clothes with a excited curiosity laugh heartily when we put we hand in we pocket and wish to do the same and then pull we hair look under we face with amorous glance on the hill overlook the town we also meet two woman scream frightfully and tear they face we learn that one of they have lose she child the woman make the best blanket here with handloom and do the principal heavy work we see some hobara also a bird call getah smaller than a partridge something like a ptarmigan with its summer feather and head shape like a quail the bey send two live one to r besides a couple of large jerboah of this part call here _ gundy _ they be much like the guinea-pig but of a sandy color and very soft and fine like a young hare the jerboah in the neighborhood of tuni be certainly more like the rat the other day near the south-west gate we fall in with a whole colony of they -- which however be the lesser animal or jerd species -- who occupy a entire eminence to themselves the sovereignty of which seem to have be concede to they by the bey of tuni they look upon we as intruder and come very near to we as if ask we why we have the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of they republic the ground here in many place be cover with a substance like the rime of a frosty morning it taste like salt and from it they get nitre captain b think it be salt the water which we drink be bring from ghafsa : the bey drink water bring from tunis we march across a vast plain cover with the salt just mention which be congeal in shine heap around bush or tuft of grass and among which also scamper a few hare we encamp at a place call ghorbatah close to the camp be a small shallow stream on each side of which grow many cane we bath in the stream and feel much refresh the evening be pleasantly cool like a summer evening in england and remind we of the dear land of we birth numerous plain in north africa be cover with saline and nitrous efflorescence to the presence of these mineral be owe the inexhaustible fertility of the soil which hardly ever receive any manure only a little stubble be occasionally burnt we see flight of the getah and of another bird call the gedur nearly the same but rather lighter in color when they rise from the ground they make a curious noise something like a partridge we be unusually surprise by a flight of locust not unlike grasshopper of about two inch long and of a reddish color saw also gazelle halt by the dry bed of a river call furfouwy a pool supply the camp : in the mountain at a distance there be however a delicious spring a stream of liquid pearl in these thirsty land a bird call mokha appear now and then it be about the size of a nightingale and of a white light-brown color we seldom hear such sweet note as this bird possess its flying be beautifully novel and curious it run on the ground and now and then stop and rise about fifteen foot from the surface give as it ascend two or three short slow whistle when it open its graceful tail and dart down to the ground utter another series of melodious whistle but much quicker than when it rise we continue we march over nearly the same sort of country but all be now flat as far as the eye could see the hill be leave behind we about eight mile from furfouwy we come to a large patch of date-trees water by many spring but all of they hot under the grateful shade of the lofty palm be flower and fruit in commingled sweetness and beauty here be the village of dra-el-hammah surround like all the town of the jereed with date-grove and garden the house be most humbly build of mud and brick after a scorching march we encamp just beyond have make only ten mile see quantity of bright soft spar call talc here also the ground be cover with a saline effloresence near we be put up about a dozen blue crane the only bird see to-day a gazelle be catch and other chase we particularly observe huge patch of ground cover

around as far as the eye could wander be a immeasurable waste -- a ocean of sand -- a great part of which we could have swear be water unless tell to the contrary we be meet before enter toser with some five or six hundred arab who gallop before the bey and fire as usual the people stare at we christian with open mouth we dress apparently astonish they at toser the bey leave he tent and enter he palace so call in courtesy to he highness but a large barn of a house without any pretension we have also a room allot to we in this palace which be the best to be find in the town though a small dark affair toser be a miserable assemblage of mud and brick hut of very small dimension the beam and the door be all of date-wood the garden however under the date-tree be beautiful and abundantly water with copious stream all of which be warm and in one of which we bath ourselves and feel new vigor run through we vein we take a walk in the garden and be surprise at the quantity of dove flutter among the date-tree they be the common blue or barbary dove in the environs of mogador these dove be the principal bird shoot toser or touzer the _ tisurus _ of ancient geography be a considerable town of about six thousand soul with several village in its neighborhood the impression of toser make upon we tourist agree with that of the traveller desfontaine who write of it in 1784 : -- the bey pitch he tent on the right side of the city if such can be call a mass of _ mud-house _ the description correspond also with that of dr shaw who say that the village of the jereed be build of mud-wall and rafter of palm-trees evidently however some improvement have be make of late year the arab of toser on the contrary and which very natural protest to the french scientific commission that toser be the finest city in el-jereed they pretend that it have a area as large as algier surround with a mud wall twelve or fifteen foot high and crenate in the center be a vast open space which serve for a market-place toser have mosque school moorish bath -- a luxury rare on the confines of the desert fondouk or inn & c the house have flat terrace and be generally well-constructed the greater part build from the ruin of a roman town but many be now dilapidated from the common superstitious cause of not repair or rebuild old house the choice material for building be brick mostly unbaked or sun-dried most of these house stand detach toser situate in a plain be command from the north-west by a little rocky mountain whence a abundant spring take its source call _ meshra _ run along the wall of the city southward divide itself afterwards in three branch water the garden and after have irrigate the plantation of several other village lose itself in the sand at a short distance the well within the city of toser be insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitant who fetch water from wad meshra the neighbouring village be belad-el-ader zin abbus and the sacred village be zaouweeat of tounseea sidus alus bou lifu and taliraouee the arab of the open country and who deposit they grain in and trade with these village be oulad sidus sheikh oulad sidus abeed and hammanium the date of toser be esteem of the finest quality walk about the town several of the inhabitant be very wealthy the dead saint be however here and perhaps everywhere else in tuni more decently lodge and they marabet be real whitewashed sepulchre they make many burnouse at toser and every house present the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly move we taste the leghma or tear of the date for the first time and rather like it on go to shoot dove we to we astonishment put up a snipe the weather be very hot go to shoot dove in the cool of the evening the bey administer justice morning and evening whilst in the jereed a arab make a present of a fine young ostrich to the bey which he highness after he arrival in tunis send to r the great man here be the sheikh tahid who be imprison for not have the tribute ready for the bey the tax impose be equivalent to two bunch for each date-tree the sheikh have to collect they pay a certain yearly sum when the bey arrive a species of farming-out it be say that he be very rich and could well find the money the date be almost the only food here and the street be literally gravel with they stone santa marium again return he horse to the bey and get another in its stead he be certainly a man of _ delicate _ feeling this gentleman carry he impudence so far that he even threaten some of the bey 's officer with the supreme wrath of the french government unless they attend better to he order a new sheikh be install a good thing for the bey 's officer as many of they get present on the occasion we bless we star that a roof be over we head to shield we from the burning sun we blow a ostrich-egg have the contents cook and find it very good eating they be sell for fourpence each and it be pretend that one make a ample meal for twelve person we be supply with leghma every morning it taste not unlike cocoa-nut milk but with more body and flavor r very unwell attribute it to he take copious draught of the leghma ride out of a evening there be a large encampment of arab outside the town thoroughly sun-burnt hardy-looking fellow some of they as black as negro many people in toser have sore eye and several with the loss of one eye or nearly so opthalmia indeed be the most prevalent disease in all barbary the neighborhood of the desert where the greater part of the year the air be fill with hot particle of sand be very unfavourable to the sight the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed house also greatly injure the eye but the moor pretend that lime-washing be necessary to the preservation of the house from the weather as well as from filth of all sort we think really it be useful by prevent dirty people in many case from be eat up by they own filth and vermin particularly the jew the tunisian jew be the dirtiest person in the regency the lime-wash be the grand _ sanitary _ instrument in north africa there be little bird that frequent the house that might be call jereed sparrow and which the arab name boo-habeeba or friend of my father but they dress and language be very different have reddish breast be of a small size and singing prettily shaw mention they under the name of the capsa-sparrow but he be quite wrong in make they as large as the common house-sparrow he add : it be all over of a lark-colour except the breast which be somewhat lighter and shineth like that of a pigeon the boo-habeeba have a note infinitely preferable to that of the canary or nightingale he say that all attempt to preserve they alive out of the district of the jereed have fail r have bring several home from that country which be alive whilst i be in tuni there be also many at the bardo in cage that live in this way as long as other bird go to see the house of the inhabitant : they be nearly all the same the furniture consist of a burnouse-loom a couple of millstone and a quantity of basin plate and dish hang upon the wall for effect seldom be use there be also some skin of grain the beam across the room which be very high be hang with onion date and pomegranate the house be nearly all of one story some of the woman be pretty with large long black eye and lash they color the lower lid black which do not add to they beauty though it show the bewitching orb more fully and boldly they be exceedingly dirty and ragged wear nevertheless a profusion of ear-ring armlet anclet bracelet and all sort of _ let _ with a thousand talismanic charm hang from they neck upon they ample bosom which latter from the habit of not wear stay reach as low down as they waist they wrap up the child in swaddling-clothes and carry they behind they back when they go out two man be bastinado for steal a horse and not tell where they put he every morning they be to be flog until they divulge they hiding-place a man bring in about a foot of horse 's skin on which be the bey 's mark for which he receive another horse this be always do when any animal die belong to the bey the man in whose hand the animal be receive a new one on produce the part of the skin mark the bey and he minister and mameluke amuse themselves with shooting at a mark the bey make some good hit the bey and he mameluke also take diversion in spoil the appearance of a very nice young horse they daub hieroglyphic upon he shoulder and loin and dye the back where the saddle be place and the three leg below the knee with henna make the other leg look as white as possible another gray horse a very fine one be also crib we may remark here that there be very few fine horse to be meet with all the animal look poor and miserable whilst these few fine one fall into the hand of the bey it be probable however that the arab keep they best and most beautiful horse out of the way while the camp be move among they the old sheikh still continue in prison the bastinado with which he have be treat be inflict on he bare person cold water be apply thereto which make the punishment more severe after receive one hundred he say he would shew he hiding-place and some people be send with he dig a hole where he point out but without come to anything this be do several time but with the same effect he be then lock up in chain till the follow morning million of dollar lie bury by the arab at this moment in different part of barbary especially in morocco perhaps the half of which will never be find the owner of they have die before they could point out they hoard treasure to they relative as but a single person be usually in the secret money be in this way bury by tribe who have nothing whatever to fear from they sovereign and they sheikh they do it from immemorial custom it be for this reason the arab consider that under all ancient ruin heap of money be bury place there by man or demon who hold the shine hoard under they invincible spell they can not comprehend how european tourist can undertake such long journey merely for the purpose of examine old heap of stone and make plan and picture of such rubbish when any person attempt to convince the arab that this be the sole object they only laugh with incredulity go to nefta a ride of about fourteen mile lie somewhat nearer the sahara than toser the country on the right be undulating sand on the leave a apparently boundless ocean where lie as a vast sheet of liquid fire when the sun shine on it the now long celebrated palus libya in this so-called lake no water be visible except a small marsh like the one near toser where we go duck-shooting we party be very respectable consist of the agha of the arab two or three of the bey 's mameluke the kaëd of the jereed whose name be braun and fifty or sixty arab guard besides ourselves on enter nefta the escort immediately enter accord to custom a marabet -lrb- that of sidus bou aly -rrb- captain b and r meanwhile stand outside there be two famous saint here one of whom be a hundred year of age the other sidus mustapha azouz have the character of be a very clever and good man which also he intelligent and benevolent appearance betoken and not a fanatic like amour abeda of kairwan there be at the time of we visit to he about two hundred people in he courtyard who all subsist on he charity we be offer date kouskousou -lrb- 39 -rrb- and a seed which they call sgougou and which have the appearance of dry apple-seed the arab eat it with honey first dip they finger into the honey and then into the seed which deliciously stick to the honey the sheikh 's saint also distribute bead and rosary he give r a bag of sgougou-seed as well as some bead these two sheikh be object of most religious veneration amongst all true believer and there be nothing which would not be do at they bidding nefta the negeta of the ancient be the frontier town of the tunisian territory from the south be five day ' journey or about thirty-five or forty league from the oasis of souf and fifteen day ' from ghadume nefta be not so much a town as a agglomeration of village separate from one another by garden and occupy a extent of surface twice the size that of the city of algier these village be hal guema mesâba zebda oul sherif benus zeid benus alus sherfa and zaouweeah sidus ahm the position of nefta and its environs be very picturesque water be here abundant the principal source which under the name of wad nefta take its rise at the north of the city in the midst of a movement of earth enter the village of sherfa and sidus ahm divide they in two and fecundate its garden plant with orange-tree pomegranate and fig-tree the same spring by the means of duct of earth water a forest of date-tree which extend some league a regulator of the water -lrb- kaëd-el-ma -rrb- distribute it to each proprietor of the plantation the house of nefta be build generally of brick some with taste and luxury the interior be ornament with dutch tile bring from tunis each quarter have its mosque and school and in the center of the group of village be a place call rebot on the bank of wad nefta which serve for a common market here be quarter specially devote to the aristocratic land proprietor and other to the busy merchant the shereef be the genuine noble or seigneur of nefta from among whom the bey be wont to choose the governor of the city the complexion of the population be dark from its alliance with negress slave like most town advance in the desert the manners of the people be pure they be strict observer of the law and very hospitable to stranger captain b however think that have he not be under the protection of the bey he head would not have be worth much in these district every traveller almost form a different opinion and frequently the very opposite estimate respect the stranger amongst whom he be sojourn a few jewish artizan have always be tolerate here on condition of wear a black handkerchief round they head and not mount a horse & c recently the bey however by solemn decree have place the jew exactly on the same footing of rights and privilege as the rest of he subject nefta be the intermediate _ entrepôt _ of commerce which tuni pour towards the sahara and for this reason be call by the arab the gate of tuni but the restrictive system establish by the turk during late year at ghadume have greatly damage the trade between the jereed and the desert the movement of the market and caravan take place at the beginning of spring and at the end of summer only a portion of the inhabitant be devote to commerce the rich land proprietory and the shereef represent the aristocracy lead the tranquil life of noble the most void of care and perhaps the happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dream the oasis of nefta indeed be say to be the most poetic of the desert its garden be delicious its orange and lemon sweet its date the finest fruit in the land of date nearly all the woman be pretty of that beauty peculiar to the oriental race and the lady who do not expose themselves to the fierce sun of the day be as fair as mooress santa marium leave for ghab to which place there be not a correct route lay down in any chart there be three route but the well of one be only know to traveller a knowledge which can not be dispense with in these dry region the well of the other two route be know to the border tribe alone who when they have take a supply of water cover they up with sand previously lay a camel-skin over the well-mouth to prevent the sand fall into the water so that while die with thirst you might be stand on a well and be none the wiser the frenchman have take with he a escort of twelve man the weather be cooler with a great deal of wind raising and darken the sky with sand even among the dategrove we eye and nose be like so many sand-quarry sheikh tahib have be twice subject to corporal punishment in the same way as before mention with the addition of fifty but they can not make he bleed as they wish he declare he have not get the money and that he can not pay they though they cut he to piece as he have collect a great portion of the tribute of the people one can not much pity the lie rogue we be amuse with the snake-charmer these gentry be a company under the protection of they great saint sidus aysa who have long go upward but also be now profitably employ in help the juggling of these snake-mountebank these fellow take they snake about in small bag or box which be perfectly harmless they tooth and poison-bag be extract they carry they in they bosom put they in they mouth stuff a long one in of some foot in length twist they around they arm use they as a whip to frighten the people in the meanwhile scream out and cry unto they heavenly protector for help the bystander devoutly join in they prayer the snake-charmer usually perform other trick such as swallow nail and stick a iron bar in they eye and they wear they hair long like woman which give they a very wild maniacal look three of the mameluke and ourselves go to wedyen a town and date-wood about eight mile from toser to the leave the date-grove be extensive and there be seven village in it of the same name we sleep in the house of the sheikh who complain that the frenchman in pass that way have allow he escort to plunder and actually bind the poor sheikh threaten he on he remonstrate what conduct for christian to teach these people one morning before daylight we be on horseback and _ en route _ towards the hill for the purpose of shooting lote as they call a species of deer find here the ground in the neighborhood of wedyen be toss about like a hay-field and volcanic look about four mile off we strike into the rock on each side of we path rise perpendicularly in fantastic shape on reach the highest ground the view be exceedingly wild much of the rock appear as if it have only just be cool from a state of fusion there be also a quantity of tuffo rock similar to that in the neighborhood of naple the first animal we see be a wolf which standing on the sky-line of the opposite hill look gigantic the deep valley between however prevent we nearer approach we soon after come on a lote who take to he heel turn round a mass of rock but soon after he almost meet as and we have a view of he within forty yard several shot be fire at he without effect and he at last make he escape with a speed which defy all we attempt at follow he dismount the sheikh alus of the arab tribe hammama who be with we and who be the greatest deer-stalker in the country precede we a little distance to look out for deer the mark of which be here very numerous after a short time a arab bring information of a herd of some thirty with a good many young one but we endeavor to have a shot at they be fruitless though one of the arab get near enough to loose the dog at they and a greyhound be kick over for he pain we see no more of they but we want of success be not surprising silence not be in the least attend to and we party be far too large the arab have such a horrible habit of vociferation that it be a wonder they ever take any game at all about the hill be scatter a great variety of aromatic plant quantity of shell and whole oyster-bed look almost as fresh as if they have be find by the sea-side on we return from toser we have a extensive view of the sahara a ocean as far as the eye could see of what one would have take he oath be water the shore inlet and bay be clearly define but in reality nothing but salt scatter on the surface several islet be apparently break its watery expanse but these also be only heap of sand raise from the surround flat the whole country hill plain and desert give we a idea as if the material have be throw together for manufacture and have never be complete nevertheless these savage desert of boundless extent be as complete in they kind as the smile meadow and fertile corn-field of england each be perfect in itself necessary to the grand whole of creation and form a essential portion of the work of divine providence the sheikh tahib 's garden be sell for 15000 piastre he wife also add to this 1000 and he be set at liberty the date have be come in to a great amount there be many different kind the principal be : -- degalah the most esteemed which be very sweet and almost transparent captain b prefer the trungah another first-rate sort which be plum-shaped and taste something like a plum there be also the monachah which be larger than the other two dryer and more mealy and not so sweet as degalah and other sort the date be very fine though in no very great abundance the superior state of ripeness be attribute to there only be a single day of rain during the past year in the jereed rain be bad for the date but the root of the tree can not have too much water the tent-pitcher of the camp go round and perform in mask action of the most revolting description some be dress as woman and dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner one fellow go up to r who be just on the point of knock he down when see the treasurer of the bey crack he side with laughter he allow the brute to go off under such high patronage it be even say that these fellow be patronize by he highness but on all moorish feastday lascivious action of man and woman be a indispensable part of they entertainment this be the worst side of the character of the moor the moorish woman be never so profligate as since the arrival of the french in algerium one of the greatest chief sultan kaëd of the hammama have just die he be a extremely old man and it be certain that people live to a good old age in this burning clime during he life he have often distinguished himself and lastly against the french before constantina whilst in the hill one day we come suddenly upon a set of arab about nine in number who take to they heel on see we a man have just be kill near this place probably by the same gang for robbery and murder no hill could be better fit the pass be so intricate and the wind and turn so sudden and sharp the sheikh alus bring in two loted a female and its young one which he have shoot the head of the lote be like a deer 's but the eye be further up : it be about a fallowdeer 's size the female have not the beard like a goat but long hair reach from the head to the bottom of the chest and over the fore-leg these loted be take in consequence of a order from the bey that they should not return without some on we march back to tuni we encamp for two day by the foot of a range of hill at sheesheeah about ten mile off the water bring from some distance be bad and salt we proceed to ghortabah we old place two of the prisoner -lrb- about twelve of whom we have with we -rrb- and one of the turk die from the excessive heat the two courier that be send with despatch for the government be attack near this place by the arab and the horse of one be so injured that it be necessary to kill he the man who ride the horse be also shoot through the leg this be probably in revenge for the exaction of the bey of the camp on the tribe on we return to ghafsa we have rain hail and high wind and exceedingly cold -- a siberian winter 's day on the verge of the scorching desert the ground where there be clay very slippery the camel reel about as if intoxicate the consequence be it be long before the tent come up and we endure much from this sudden change of the weather we suffering be however nothing as compare to other for during the day ten man be bring in dead from the cold -lrb- three die four day before from heat -rrb- principally turk and have there be no change in the temperature we can not tell how many would have share the same fate many of the camel struggle against the clayey soil could not come up eight more man be shortly bury and three be miss the sudden transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of the next probably give the latter a treble power produce these disastrous effect the poor people be sadly ill-clad and quite unprepared for such extreme rigor besides on we arrival at the camp all the money in europe could not have purchase we the require comfort or rather necessaries to preserve we health cold make everybody very selfish we be exceedingly touch on hearing of the death of a little girl whom we see drive out of a kitchen in which the poor helpless little thing have take refuge from the inclemency of the weather santa marium arrive from ghab without accident have scarcely see a soul the whole of the way he certainly be a enterprize fellow worthy of imitation he calculate the distance from ghab to toser at 200 mile there be a number of town in the district of ghab better build than those of nefta and toser ghab river be also full of water and the soil of the country be very fertile the date be not so good as those of the jereed ghab be about 130 mile from ghafsa we here take we farewell of santa marium he go to beja the head-quarter of the summer-camp : thence of course he would proceed to algier to give a account of he _ espionage _ next season he say he would go to tripolus and ghadame he have be many year in north africa and speak arabic fluently we next march to byrlafee about twenty mile and ninety-one from toser where there be the ruin of a old town the weather continue cold and most wintry here be a very ancient well still in use fragment of cornice and pillar be strew about the foundation of house and some massive stone tower which from they have a pipe up the center must have have something to do with regulate the water be all that remain we have now much wind but no rain a great many camel and horse perish altogether the number of camel that die on the return of the camp be 550 the price of a camel vary from 60 to 200 piastre many good one be sell at the camp for eighty piastre each or about two pound ten shilling english money a good sheep be dispose of for four or five piastre or about three shilling there be also some ludicrous sale a horse in the extremity of nature or near to the _ articulo morti _ be sell for a piastre eight penny a camel in a like situation be sell for a piastre and a half a tolerably good horse in tunis sell at from 800 to 1000 piastre there be the remains of a aqueduct at gilma and several other building the capital of the pillar be elaborately work it be see that nearly the entire surface of tuni be cover with remains of aqueduct roman christian and moorish if railway be apply to this country -- the french be already talk about form one from algier to blidah across the mitidjah -- unquestionably along the line will be construct duct for water which could thus be distribute over the whole country instead of the camel of the bey of the camp carry water from tuni to the jereed the railway would take from zazwan the best and most delicious water in the regency to the dry desert of the jereed with the greatest facility as to railway pay in this country the resource of tuni if develop could pay anything march onward about eighteen mile we encamp two or three beyond a old place call sidi-ben-habeeba a man murder a woman from jealousy in the camp but make he escape almost every eminence we pass be occupy with the remains of some ancient fort or temple there be a good deal of corn in small detach patch but it must be remember the north-western province be the corn-district in the course of the follow three day we reach sidi-mahammedeah where be the magnificent remains of udina after about a hour 's halt and when all the tent have be comfortably pitch the bey astonish we with a order to continue we march and we pursue we way to momakeeah about thirty mile which we do not reach until after dark we pass for some three or four hour through a flight of locust the air be darken and the ground load with they at a little distance a flight of locust have the appearance of a heavy snow-storm these insect rarely visit the capital but since the appearance of those near momakeeah they have be collect in the neighborhood of the city cook and sell among the people momakeeah be a countryhouse belong to the bey to whom also belong a great portion of the land around there be a large garden lay out in the italian style attach to this country-seat on arrive at tuni we call at the bardo as we pass and see the guard mount there be rather a fine band of military music moorish musician but play after the european style italian and moorish air we must give here some account of we boab 's domestic concern he boast that he have have twenty-seven wife he religion allow four at once which he have bad several time he be himself of somewhat advanced year accord to he if a man quarrel with he wife he can put she in prison but must at the same time support she a certain quantity of provision be lay down by law and he must give she two suit or change of clothes a year but he must also visit she once a week and the day fix be Friday if the wife wish to be separate and to return to she parent she must first pay the money which he may demand and must also have he permission although he himself may send she to she parent whenever he choose without assign any reason he retain the child and he may marry again the woman be generally expect to bring she husband a considerable sum in the way of dowry but on separation she get nothing back this be the boab 's account but i think he have overdo the harshness and injustice of the mohammedan law of marriage in relate it to we tourist it may be observe that the strict law be rarely act upon and many respectable moor have tell I that they have but one wife and find that quite enough it be true that many moor especially learn man divorce they wife when they get old feeling the woman a embarrassment to they and no wonder when we consider these poor creature have no education and in they old age neither afford connubial pleasure nor society to they husband with respect to divorce a woman can demand by law and right to be separate from she husband or divorce whenever he ill-treat she or estrange himself from she eunuch who have the charge of the woman be allow to marry although they can not have any family the chief eunuch of the bardo have the most revolting countenance we tourist bring home a variety of curious jereed thing : small date-baskets full of date woollen article skin of all sort and a few live animal sidus mohammed also make they many handsome present some deer jereed goat a ostrich & c be send to mr r after he return and both captain b and mr r have have every reason to be extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attention of the bey of the camp it be very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collect in the jereed some of which however be not get in owe to various impediment we tourist say
