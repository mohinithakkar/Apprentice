magazine _ and _ time of indium _ for they courtesy in permit the reprinting of the article in this book which originally appear in they column list of illustration half-tone eha the nose of the elephant become a hand have redeem its mind good for any rough job here the competition have be very keen indeed the rat be a near relation of the squirrel zoologically but personally he be a gutter-snipe and you may know that by one look at the tail which he drag after he like a dirty rope a blackbird and a starling -- the one lift its skirt while the other wear a walk dress the nostril of the apteryx be at the tip of its beak the long-nosed monkey line block a authentic standard foot these beast be all clodhopper and they foot be hobnailed boot it have to double they under and hobble about like a chinese lady no doubt each bird swear by its own pattern its bill deserve study as wonderful as the pelican but how opposite there be some eccentric such as jenny wren which have despise they tail at the sight of a rival the dog hold its tail up stiffly a shrew can do it but not a man a bold attempt to grow in the case of a tapir i have see human nose of a pattern not unlike this but they be not consider aristocratic who can consider that nose seriously or perhaps when it want to listen it raise a flipper to its ear tear out the house like the dog wuz atter he a great catholic congress of distinguished ear the curl of a mother 's darling introduction eha edward hamilton aitken the author of the follow sketch be well know to the present generation of anglo-indian by he pen-name of eha as a accurate and amusing writer on natural history subject those who be privileged to know he intimately as the writer of this sketch do know he as a christian gentleman of singular simplicity and modesty and great charm of manner he be always ready to help a fellow-worker in science or philanthropy if it be possible for he to do so thus indeed begin the friendship between we for when plague first invade indium in 1896 the writer be one of those send to bombay to work at the problem of its causation from the scientific side thereby become interested in the life history of rat which be show to be intimately connect with the spread of this dire disease have for year admire eha 's book on natural history -- _ the tribe on my frontier a indian naturalist 's foreign policy _ and _ the naturalist on the prowl _ i venture to write to he on the subject of rat and they habit and ask he whether he could not throw some light on the problem of plague and its spread from the naturalist 's point of view in response to this appeal he write a most inform and characteristic article for _ the time of indium _ -lrb- July 19 1899 -rrb- which throw a flood of light on the subject of the habit and characteristic of the indian rat as find in town and country he be the first to show that _ mu rattus _ the old english black rat which be the common house rat of indium outside the large seaport have become through century of contact with the indian people a domestic animal like the cat in britain when one realize the fact that this same rat be responsible for the spread of plague in indium and that every house be full of they the value of this naturalist 's observation be plain thus begin a intimacy which last till eha 's death in 1909 the first time i meet mr aitken be at a meeting of the free church of scotland literary society in 1899 when he read a paper on the early experience of the english in bombay the minute he enter the room i recognize he from the caricature of himself in the _ tribe _ the long thin erect bearded man be unmistakable with a typically scot face light up with the humorous twinkle one come to know so well many a time in after-year have that look be see as he discourse as only he could on the way of man and beast bird or insect as one tramp with he through the jungle on the hill around bombay during week-ends spend with he at vehar or elsewhere he be a ideal companion on such occasion always at he best when act the part of _ the naturalist on the prowl _ mr aitken be bear at satara in the bombay presidency on August 16 1851 he father be the rev jame aitken missionary of the free church of scotland he mother be a sister of the rev daniel edward missionary to the jew at breslau for some fifty year he be educate by he father in indium and one can well realize the sort of education he get from such parent from the many allusion to the bible and its old testament character that one constantly find use with such effect in he book he farther education be obtain at bombay and poona he pass ma and ba of bombay university first on the list and win the homejee cursetjee prize with a poem in 1880 from 1870 to 1876 he be latin reader in the deccan college at poona which account for the extensive acquaintance with the latin classic so charmingly manifest in he writings that he be well ground in greek be also certain for the writer while live in a chummery with he in bombay in 1902 see he constantly read the greek testament in the morning without the aid of a dictionary he enter the custom and salt department of the government of bombay in April 1876 and serve in kharaghoda -lrb- the dustypore of the _ tribe _ -rrb- uran north kanara and goa frontier ratnagirus and bombay itself in may 1903 he be appoint chief collector of custom and salt revenue at karachi and in November 1905 be make superintendent in charge of the district gazetteer of sind he retire from the service in August 1906 he marry in 1883 the daughter of the rev j chalmer blake and leave a family of two son and three daughter in 1902 he be depute on special duty to investigate the prevalence of malaria at the custom station along the frontier of goa and to devise means for remove the salt peon at these post from the neighborhood of the anopheles mosquito by that time recognize as the cause of the deadly malaria which make service on that frontier dread by all it be during this expedition that he discover a new species of anopheline mosquito which after identification by major jame im be name after he _ anophele aitkenus _ during he long service there be to be find in the annual report of the custom department frequent mention of mr aitken 's good work but it be doubtful whether the government ever fully realize what a able literary man they have in they service waste he talent in the salt department on two occasion only do congenial work come to he in the course of he public duty -- namely when he be send to study from the naturalist 's point of view the malarial condition prevail on the frontier of goa and when during the last two year of he service he be put in literary charge of _ the sind gazetteer _ in this book one can see the light and graceful literary touch of eha frequently crop up amidst the dry bone of public health and commercial statistics and the book be enliven by innumerable witty and philosophic touch appear in the most unlikely place such as he alone could enliven a dull subject with would that all government gazetteer be similarly adorn but there be not many eha in government employ in indium on completion of this work he retire to edinburgh where most of the sketch contain in this volume be write he be very happy with he family in he home at morningside and be begin to surround himself with pet and flower as be he wont all he life and to get a good connection with the home newspaper and magazine when alas death step in and he die after a short illness on April 25 1909 he be interested in the home bird and beast as he have be with those in indium and the last time the writer meet he he be take home some gold-fish for he aquarium a few day before he death he have find he way down to the morningside cemetery where he have be enjoy the sunshine and flower of spring and he remark to he wife that he would often go there in future to watch the bird build they nest before that time come he be himself lay to rest in that very spot in sure and certain hope of a bless resurrection the above imperfect sketch fail to give the charm and magnetic attraction of the man and for this one must go to he work which for those who know he be very illuminating in this respect in they one catch a glimpse of he plan for keep young and cheerful in the land of regret for one of he charm be he youthfulness and interest in life he refuse to be depress by he lonely life i be only a exile he remark endeavor to work a successful existence in dustypore and not to let my environment shape I as a pudding take the shape of its mould but to make it tributary to my own happiness he therefore urge he reader to cultivate a hobby it be strange he say that european in indium know so little see so little care so little about all the intense life that surround they the boy who be the most ardent of bug-hunter or the most enthusiastic of bird-nester in england where one shilling will buy nearly all that be know or can be know about bird or butterfly maintain in this country aid by messr b & s a unequal strife with the insupportableness of a _ ennui _ - smitten life why if he would stir up for one day the ember of the old flame he could not quench it again with such a prairie of fuel around he i be not speak of bombay people with they club and gymkhana and other device for oil the wheel of existence but of the dreary up-country exile whose life be a blank a moral sahara a catechism of the nihilist creed what such a one need be a hobby every hobby be good -- a sign of good and a influence for good any hobby will draw out the mind but the one i plead for touch the soul too keep the milk of human kindness from souring put a gentle poetry into the prosiest life that all my own finer feeling have not long since wither in this land of separation from ` old familiar face ' i attribute partly to a pair of rabbit all rabbit be idiotic thing but these come in and sit up meekly and beg a crust of bread and even a perennial fare of village _ moorgee _ can not induce I to issue the order for they execution and conversion into pie but if such consideration can not lead the struggle for existence should drive a man in this country to learn the way of he border tribe for no one i take it who reflect for a instant will deny that a small mosquito with black ring upon a white ground or a sparrow that have finally make up its mind to rear a family in you ceiling exercise a influence on you personal happiness far beyond the czar of the russia it be not a question of scientific frontier -- the enemy invade we on all side we be plunder insult phlebotomise under we own vine and fig-tree we might make head against the foe if we lay to heart the lesson we national history in indium teach -- namely that the way to fight uncivilised enemy be to encourage they to cut one another 's throat and then step in and inherit the spoil but we murder we friend exterminate we ally and then groan under the oppression of the enemy i might illustrate this by the case of the meek and long-suffering musk-rat by spider or ant but these must wait another day again he say the ` poor dumb animal ' can give each other a bit of they mind like they betters and to I they fierce and tender little passion they love and hate they envy and jealousy and they small vanity beget a sense of fellow-feeling which make they presence society the touch of nature which make the whole world kin be infirmity a man without a weakness be insupportable company and so be a man who do not feel the heat there be a large gray ring-dove that sit in the blaze sun all through the hottest hour of the day and say coo-coo coo coo-coo coo until the melancholy sweet monotony of that sound be as thoroughly mix up in my brain with 110 ° in the shade as physic in my infantile memory with the peppermint lozenge which use to ` put away the taste ' but as for these creature which confess the heat and come into the house and gasp i feel draw to they i should like to offer they cool drink not that all my midday guest be equally welcome : i could dispense for instance with the grey-ringed bee which have just reconnoitr my ear for the third time and guess it be a key-hole -- she be away just now but only i fancy for clay to stop it up with there be other also to which i would give they _ congé _ if they would take it but good bad or indifferent they give we they company whether we want it or not eha certainly find company in beast all he life and keep the charm of youth about he in consequence to the end if he lot be cast as it often be in lonely place he keep pet and make friend besides of many of the member of the tribe on he frontier if in bombay city he console himself with he aquarium and the museum of the bombay natural history society when the present writer chum with he in a flat on the apollo bunder in bombay he remember well that aquarium and the sunday-morning expedition to the malarious ravine at the back of malabar hill to search for mosquito larva to feed its inmate for at that time mr aitken be investigate the capability for the destruction of larva of a small surface-feeding fish with a ivory-white spot on the top of its head which he have find at vehar in the stream below the bund it take he some time to identify these particular fish -lrb- _ haplochilus lineatus _ -rrb- and in the meantime he dub they scooty from the lightning rapidity of they movement and in he own admirable manner make himself a sharer of they joy and sorrow they care and interest with these he stock the ornamental fountain of bombay to keep they from become breeding-grounds for mosquito and they be now largely use throughout indium for this very purpose it will be recognize therefore that mr aitken study natural history not only for its own sake but as a means of benefit the people of indium whom he have learn to love as be so plainly show in _ behind the bungalow _ he be a indefatigable worker in the museum of the bombay natural history society which he help to find and many of he papers and note be preserve for we in the page of its excellent _ journal _ of which he be a original joint-editor he be for long secretary of the insect section and then president before he retirement he be elect one of the vice-president of the society mr aitken be a deeply religious man and be for some twenty year a elder in the congregation of the unite free church of scotland in bombay he be for some year superintendent of the Sunday school in connection with this congregation and a member of the committee of the bombay scottish orphanage and the scottish high school he former minister say of he he be deeply interested in theology and remain wonderfully orthodox in spite of -lrb- or as the present writer would prefer to say _ because of _ -rrb- he scientific knowledge he always think that the evidence for the doctrine of evolution have be press for more than it be worth and he have many criticism to make upon the higher critic of the bible many a discussion we have in which against I he take the conservative side he let one see very clearly into the workings of he mind in this direction in what be perhaps the finest although the least well know of he book _ the five window of the soul _ -lrb- john murray -rrb- in which he discourse in he own inimitable way of the five sens and how they bring man and beast into contact with they surroundings it be a book on perceive and show how accord as this faculty be exercise it make each man such as he be the follow extract from the book show mr aitken 's style and may perhaps induce some to go to the book itself for more from the same source he be speak of the moral sense and it be almost a truism to say that if a man have any taste it will show itself in he dress and in he dwelling no doubt through indolence and slovenly habit a man may allow he surroundings to fall far below what he be capable of approve but every one who do so pay the penalty in the gradual deterioration of he perception how many time more true be all this in the case of the moral sense when the heart be still young and tender how spontaneously and sweetly and urgently do every vision of goodness and nobleness in the conduct of another awaken the impulse to go and do likewise and if that impulse be not obey how certainly do the first approve perception of the beauty of goodness become duller until at last we may even come to hate it where we find it for its discordance with the ` motion of sin in we member ' but not less certainly will every earnest effort to bring the life into unison with what we perceive to be right bring its own reward in a clearer and more joyful perception of what be right and a keener sensitiveness to every discord in ourselves how all such discord may be remove how the chord of the heart may be tune and the life become music -- these be question of religion which be quite beyond we scope but i take it that every religion which have prevail among the child of adam be in itself a evidence that however debase and pervert the moral sense may have become the painful consciousness that he heart be ` like sweet bell jangle ' still press everywhere and always on the spirit of man and it be also a conscious or unconscious admission that there be no blessedness for he until he life shall march in step with the music of the ` eternal righteousness ' mr aitken 's name will be keep green among anglo-indians by the well-known series of book publish by messr thacker & co of london and calcutta they be _ the tribe on my frontier a indian naturalist 's foreign policy _ which be publish in 1883 and of which a seventh edition appear in 1910 this book deal with the common bird beast and insect in and around a indian bungalow and it should be put into the hand of every one whose lot be cast in indium it will open they eye to the beauty and interest of they surroundings in a truly wonderful way and may be read again and again with increase pleasure as one 's experience of indian life increase this be follow in 1889 by _ behind the bungalow _ which describe with charming insight the strange manners and custom of we indian domestic servant the witty and yet kindly way in which they excellency and defect be touch off be delightful and many a harass _ mem-sahib _ must bless eha for show she the humorous and human side of she life surround as it be by those necessary but annoying inhabitant of the godown behind the bungalow a tenth edition of this book be publish in 1911 _ the naturalist on the prowl _ be bring out in 1894 and a third edition be publish in 1905 it contain sketch on the same line as those in _ the tribe _ but deal more with the jungle and not so much with the immediate surroundings of the bungalow the very smell of the country be in these chapter and will vividly recall memory to those who know the country along the west coast of indium southward of bombay in 1900 be publish _ the common bird of bombay _ which contain description of the ordinary bird one see about the bungalow or in the country as be well say by the writer of the obituary notice in the _ journal _ of the bombay natural history society eha have a special genius for seize the striking and characteristic point in the appearance and behavior of individual species and a happy knack of translate they into print so as to render he description unmistakable he look upon all creature in the proper way as if each have a soul and character of its own he love they all and be unwilling to hurt any of they these characteristic be well show in this book for one be able to recognize the bird easily from some prominent feature describe therein -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ the five window of the soul _ publish by john murray in 1898 be of quite another character from the above and be regard by its author with great affection as the best of he book it be certainly a wonderfully self-revealing book and full of the most beautiful thought a second impression appear in the following year and a new and cheaper edition have just be publish the portrait of eha be reproduce from one take in 1902 in a flat on the apollo bunder and show the man as he be in workaday life in bombay the humorous and kindly look be i think well bring out and will stir pleasant memory in all who know mr aitken w b b madras _ January _ 1914 footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : the illustration be he own work but the block have be produce in indium they do not do justice to the extreme delicacy of workmanship and fine perception of detail which characterise the original as all who have be privileged to see these will agree -rrb- concern animal i foot and hand it be evident that in what be call the evolution of animal form the foot come in suddenly when the backboned creature begin to live on the dry land -- that be with the frog how it come in be a question which still puzzle the phylogenist who can not find a sure pedigree for the frog there it be anyhow and the remarkable point about it be that the foot of a frog be not a rudimentary thing but a authentic standard foot like the yard measure keep in the tower of london of which all other foot be copy or adaptation this instrument as part of the original outfit give to the pioneer of the brainy backbon and four-limbed race when they be send out to multiply and replenish the earth be surely worth consider well it consist essentially of a sole or palm make up of small bone and of _ five _ separate digit each with several joint -lrb- illustration : a authentic standard foot -rrb- in the hind foot of a frog the toe be very long and web from point to point in this it differ a good deal from the toad and there be significance in the difference the heavy-gaited toad satisfy with sour ant hard beetle and such other fare as it can easily pick up and grow nasty in consequence so that nothing seek to eat it have hobble through life like a plethoric old gentleman until the present day on its original foot the more versatile and nimble-witted frog seek better diet and greater security of life go back to the element in which it be breed and swim much become better fit for swim the soft elastic skin between the finger or toe be just the sort of tissue which respond most readily to inward impulse and we find that the very same change have come about in those bird and beast which live much in water i know that this be not the accept theory of evolution but i be wait till it shall become so we all develop in the direction of we tendency and shall i doubt not be wise enough some day to give animal leave to do the same it seem strange that any creature furnish with such tricky and adaptable instrument to go about the world with should tire of they and wish to get rid of they but so it happen at a very early stage it must have be a consequence i think of grow too fast mark twain remark about a dachshund that it seem to want another pair of leg in the middle to prevent it sag now some lizard be so long that they can not keep from sag and they progress become a painful wriggle but if you must go by wriggle then what be the use of leg to knock against stem and stone so some lizard have discard two of they leg and some all four zoologically they be not snake but snake be only a further advance in the same direction that snake do not start fair without leg be clear for the python have to this day two tell-tale leg-bone bury in its flesh when we pass from reptile to bird lo a astounding thing have happen that there be fly reptile in the fossil age we know and there be fly beast in we own but the wing of these be simple mechanical alteration which the imagination of a child or a savage could explain the hand of a bat be hand still and though the finger be hamper by they awkward glove the thumb be free the giant fruit bat of the tropics clamber about the tree quite acrobatically with they thumb and foot that apollyonic monster of the prime the pterodactyl do even better stretch on each little finger a lateen sail that would have serve to waft a skiff across the thame it keep the rest of its hand for other use but what bearing have all this on the case of bird here be a whole sub-kingdom as they call it of the animal world which have unreservedly and irrevocably barter one pair of its limb for a flying-machine the apparatus be make of feather -- a new invention unknown to amphibian or saurian whence obtain nobody can say -- and these be graft into the transform frame of the old limb the bargain be worth make for the winged bird at once soar away in all sens from the creep thing of earth and become a more ethereal be like a blow flame it rest upon the air subdue it surpass it outrace it it be the air conscious of itself conquer itself rule itself but the price be heavy the bird must get through life with one pair of foot and its mouth but this be all the bodily furniture of charle françois felu who without arm become a famous artist a friend of mine standing behind he in a _ salon _ and watch he at work see he lay down he brush and raise he foot to he head take off he hat and scratch he crown with he great toe my friend be nearly hypnotise by the sight yet it scarcely strike we as a wonder when a parrot standing on one foot take its meal with the other it be a wonder and stamp the parrot as a bird of talent a mine of hidden possibility be in we all but those who dig resolutely into it and bring out treasure be few and let we note that the art of standing begin with bird frog sit and as far as i know every reptile be it lizard crocodile alligator or tortoise lay its body on the ground when not actually carry it and these have each four fat leg contrast the flamingo which have only two and those like willow wand tuck up one of they and sleep poise high on the other like a tulip on its stem note also that one toe have be altogether discard by bird as superfluous the germ or bud must be there for the dorking fowl have produce a fifth toe under some influence of the poultry-yard but no natural bird have more than four except in swift which never perch but cling to rock and wall one be turn backwards and by a cunning contrivance the act of bend the leg draw they all automatically together so a hen close its toe at every step it take as if it grasp something and of course when it settle down on its roost they grasp that tight and hold it fast till morning but to bird that do not perch this mechanism be only a encumbrance so many of they like the plover abolish the hind toe entirely and the prince of all two-legged runner the ostrich have get rid of one of the front toe also retain only two -lrb- illustration : these beast be all clodhopper and they foot be hobnailed boot -rrb- to a man who think it be very interesting to observe that beast have be lead along gradually in the very same direction all the common beast such as cat dog rat stoat and so on have five ordinary toe on the hind foot there may be only four but as soon as we come to those that feed on grass and leave standing or walk all the while we find that the foot be shod with hoof instead of be tip with claw first the five toe though club together have each a separate hoof as in the elephant then the hippopotamus follow with four toe and the rhinoceros with practically three these beast be all clodhopper and they foot be hobnailed boot the more active deer and all cattle keep only two toe for practical purpose though stump of two more remain finally the horse gather all its foot into one boot and become the champion runner of the world it be not without significance that this degeneracy of the foot go with a decline in the brain whether as cause or effect i will not pretend to know these hoofed beast have shallow nature and live shallow life they eat what be spread by nature before they nose have no home and do nothing but feed and fight with each other the elephant be a notable exception but then the nose of the elephant become a hand have redeem its mind as for the horse whatever its admirer may say it be just a great ass there be a lesson in all this : from he that have not shall be take even that which he have there be another dull beast which from the point of view of the mere systematist seem as far remove from those that wear hoof as it could be but the philosopher consider the point at which it have arrive rather than the route by which it get there will class it with they for its idea of life be just theirs turn topsy-turvy the nail of the sloth instead of be hammer into hoof on the hard ground have grow long and curve like those of a caged bird and become hook by which it can hang without effort in the midst of the leaf on which it feed a minimum of intellect be require for such a existence and the sloth have lose any superfluous brain that it may have have as well as two or even three of its five toe to return to those bird and beast with standard foot i find that the first outside purpose for which they find they serviceable be to scratch themselves this be a universal need but a foot be handy in many other way a hen and chicken get into my garden transfer a whole flower-bed to the walk in half a hour yet a bird try to do anything with its foot be like a man put on he sock stand and bird as a race have turn they foot to very little account outside of they original purpose such a simple thing as hold down its food with one foot scarcely occur to a ordinary bird a hen will pull about a cabbage leaf and shake it in the hope that a small piece may come away but it never enter she head to put she foot on it in this and other matter the parrot stand apart and also the hawk eagle and owl but these be not ordinary bird beast have twice as many foot as bird have learn to apply they to many use they dig with they hold down they food with they fondle they child with they paw they friend and scratch they enemy one do more of one thing and another of another and the foot soon show the effect of the occupation the claw first then the muscle and even the bone dwindle by disuse or wax stout and strong then the joy of do what it can do well impel the beast further on the same path and its offspring after it -lrb- illustration : the nose of the elephant become a hand have redeem its mind -rrb- and this lead at last to specialism the indian black bear be a handy man like the british tar -- good all round its great soft paw be a very serviceable tool and weapon arm with claw which will take the face off a man or grub up a root with equal ease when a black bear have find a ant-hill it take but a few minute to tear up the hard cemented clay and lay the deep gallery bare then put its gutta-percha muzzle to the mouth of each it draw such a blast of air through they that the industrious labourer be suck into its gullet in drift afterwards it dig right down to the royal chamber lick up the bloated queen and go its way but there be another worker in the same mine which do not go to work this way the ant-eater find fat termite so satisfy that it leave all other thing and devoted its life to the exploit of anthill and now it have no rival at that business but it be fit for nothing else its awkward digging tool will not allow it to put the sole of its foot to the ground so it have to double they under and hobble about like a chinese lady it have no tooth and stupidity be the most prominent feature of its character it have become that poor thing a man of one idea but the bear be like a sign-post at a parting of the way if you compare a brown bear with the black indian or sloth bear as it be sometimes call you may detect a small but pregnant difference when the former walk its claw be lift so that they point do not touch the ground why i have no information but i know that it be not content with a vegetarian diet like its black relative but hanker after sheep and goat and i guess that its murderous thought flow down its nerve to those keen claw it remind I of a man clench he fist unconsciously when he think of the liar who have slander he -lrb- illustration : it have to double they under and hobble about like a chinese lady -rrb- but what age of concentration on the thought and practice of assassination must have be require to perfect that most awful weapon in nature the paw of a tiger or indeed of any cat for they be all of one pattern the sharpened flint of the savage have become the scimitar of saladin keep the keenness of its edge in a velvet sheath and flash out only on the field of battle compare that paw with the foot of a dog and you will perhaps see with I that the servility and pliancy of the slave of man have usurp a place in he esteem which be not its due the cat be much the nobler animal dog with wolf jackal and all of they kin love to fall upon they victim in overwhelming force like a rascally mob and bite tear and worry until the life have go out of it the tiger rush single-handed with a fearful challenge on the gigantic buffalo grasp its nose with one paw and its shoulder with the other and have break its massive neck in a manner so dexterous and instantaneous that scarcely two sportsman can agree about how the thing be do i have say that the foot first appear when the backboned creature come out of the water to live upon the dry land but all mundane thing -lrb- not except politics -rrb- tend to move in circle end where they begin and so the foot if we follow it far enough will take we back into water see how the rat -- i mean we common omnivorous scavenging thieve poach brown rat -- when it live near a pond or stream learn to swim and dive as naturally as a duck next come the vole or water-rat which will not live away from water then there be water shrew the beaver otter duck-billed platypus and a host of other not related just as among bird there be water ousel moorhen duck diver etc which have permanently make the water they home and seek they living in it all these have attain to web-footedness in a greater or less degree that this have occur among reptile beast and bird alike show what a easy or natural or obvious -lrb- put it as you will -rrb- modification it be and it have a consequence not to be escape just as a man who ride a great deal and never walk acquire a certain indirectness of the leg and you never mistake a jockey for a drill-sergeant so the web-footed beast be not among the thing that be comely in go follow this road you arrive at the seal and sea-lion of all the foot that i have look at i know only one more utterly ridiculous than the twisted flipper on which the sea-lion prop he great bulk in front and that be the fork fly-flap which extend from the hinder part of the same how can it be worth any beast 's while to carry such a absurd apparatus with it just for the sake of get out into the air sometimes and push itself about on the ice and be eat by polar bear the porpoise have discard one pair turn the other into decent fin and recover a grace and power of motion in water which be not equal by the greyhound on land why have the seal hang back i believe i know the secret it be the baby no one know where the porpoise and the whale cradle they newborn infant -- it be so difficult to pry into the domestic way of these sea-people -- but evidently the seal can not manage it so they be force to return to the land when the care of maternity be on they i have call the foot of these sea beast ridiculous thing and so they be as we see they but strip off the skin and lo there appear a plain foot with its five digit each of several joint tip with claw -- nowise essentially different in short from that with which the toad or frog first set out in a past too distant for we infirm imagination admiration itself be paralyse by a contrivance so simple so transmutable and so sufficient for every need that time and change could bring there remain yet one transformation which seem simple compare with some that i have notice but be more full of fate than they all for by it the foot become a hand this come about by easy stage the reason why one of a bird 's four toe be turn back be quite plain : tree be the proper home of bird and they require foot that will grasp branch so those beast also that have take to live in tree have get one toe detach more or less from the rest and arrange so that it can co-operate with they to catch hold of a thing then other change quickly follow for in judge whether you have get hold of a thing and how much force you must put forth to keep hold of it you be guide entirely by the pressure on the finger-point and to gauge this pressure nicely the nerve must be refine and educate in fact the exercise itself with the intent direction of the mind to the finger-point bring about the refinement and education in accordance with sandow 's principle of muscle culture for a example of the result do not look at the gross paw of any so-called anthropoid ape gorilla orang-outang or chimpanzee but study the gentle lemur at the point of each digit be a broad elastic pad plentifully supply with delicate nerve and the vital energy which have be direct into they appear to have be withdraw from the growth of the claw which have shrink into fine nail just shield the fleshy tip in short the lemur have a hand on each of its four limb and no foot at all and as it go about its cage -- i be at the zoo in spirit -- with a silent wonder shine out of its great eye it examine thing by _ feeling _ they with its hand how plainly a new avenue from the outer world into its mind have be open by those finger but how about scratch what would be the gain of have higher susceptibility and keener perception if they only aggravate the triumph of the insulting flea nay this disaster have be avert by reserve a good sharp claw on the forefinger -lrb- not the thumb -rrb- of each hind hand the old naturalist call the ape and lemurs quadrumana the four-handed and separated the bimana with one species -- namely _ homo sapiens _ now we have anatomy cite to belittle the difference between a hand and a foot and geology importune to show we the miss link pend which a order have be institute roomy enough to hold monkey gorilla and man it be a strange perversity how much more fitting it be to bow in reverent ignorance before the perfect hand take up from the ground no more to dull its percipient surface on earth and stone and bark but to minister to its lord 's expand mind and obey he creative will while he frame stand upright and firm upon a single pair of true foot with they toe all in one rank ii bill of bird the prospectus or advertisement of a certain american typewriting machine commence by inform the public that the -- typewriter be found on a idea when i see this phrase i secure it for my collection for i feel that without jest it contain the kernel of a true philosophy of nature the form the _ phainomena _ of nature be innumerable multifarious interwoven and infinitely perplexing and you may spend a happy life in unravel they relation and devise they evolution but until you have look through they and see the idea that be behind they you be a mere materialist and a blind worker the soul of nature be hide from you what be the bill of a bird and what do it mean i do not refer to the bill of a hawk or a heron or a owl or a ostrich but to that which be the abstract of all these and a thousand more i hold regardless of anatomy and physiology that a bird be a higher be than a beast no beast soar and sing to its sweetheart no beast remain in lifelong partnership with the wife of its youth no beast build itself a summer-house and deck it with feather and bright shell a beast be a grovel denizen of the earth a bird be a free citizen of the air and who can say that there be not a connection between this difference and other development the beast think only of its appetite have evolve a delicate nose a discriminate palate three kind of tooth to cut tear and grind its food salivary gland to moisten the same and a perfect apparatus of digestion -lrb- illustration : good for any rough job -rrb- the bird occupy with thought of love and beauty with field or wave or mountain and shape of sky or plain have make little advance in the art and instrument of good living it swallow its food whole scarcely know the taste of it and a pair of forceps for pick it up tip and case with horn be the whole of its dining furniture for the bill of a bird primarily and essentially be that and nothing else in the chicken and the sparrow that come to steal they food and the robin that look on and all the little dicky-bird you may see it in its simplicity the size and shape may vary as a canadian axe differ from a scotch axe some be short and stout and have a sharp edge for shell seed some be longer and fine-pointed for pick worm and caterpillar out of they hiding-place some a little hooked at they point and one that of the crossbill with point cross for pick the small seed out of fir-cone but all be practically the same tool yet the last distinctly point the way to those modification by which the simple bill be gradually adapt to one special purpose or another until it become a wonderful mechanism in which the original intention be quite out of sight at this point i find a instructive parable in my tool chest fully half of the tool be just knive a chisel be a knife a plane be a knife set in a block of wood a saw be a knife with the edge notch moreover there be many sort of curious plane and saw each intend for one distinct kind of fine work all these the joiner have need of but a schoolboy would rather have one good strong pocket-knife than the whole boxful for just in proportion as each tool be perfect for its own special work it become useless for any other and you schoolboy be not a specialist he want a tool that will cut a stick carve a boat peel a apple dig out a worm -- in short one that will do whatever he active mind want do now apply this parable to the bird if you see a bill that be nothing but a large and powerful pair of forceps good for any rough job you may know without further inquiry that the owner be no limited specialist but a handy man bold enterprising resourceful and good all round he will not starve in the desert no wholesome food come amiss to he -- grub slug or snail fruit egg a live mouse or a dead rat and he can deal with they all such be the magpie the crow the jackdaw and all of that ilk and these be the bird that be find in all country and climate and prosper wherever they go -lrb- illustration : no doubt each bird swear by its own pattern -rrb- but all bird can not play that part one be timid another fastidious another shy but ingenious so in the universal competition for a living each have take its own line accord to the bent of its nature and its one tool have be perfect for its trade until it can follow no other the thrush catch such worm as rashly show themselves above-ground but a ancient ancestor of the snipe find that if it follow they into marshy land it could probe the soft ground and drag they out of they chamber for this operation it have now a bill three inch long straight thin and sensitive at the tip a beautiful instrument but good for no purpose except extract worm from soft ground if frost or drought harden the ground the snipe must starve or travel among the many lang nebbit bird that follow the same profession as the snipe some like the curlew and the ibis have curve bill of prodigious length i do not know the comparative advantage of the two form but no doubt each bird swear by its own pattern as every golfer do by he own putter but now behold another grub-hunter which distast mud have discover a unworked mine in the trunk of tree there in deep burrow lurk great succulent beetle-grub demand only a tool with which they might be dig out this have be perfect by many stage and i have now before I a splendid specimen of the most improved pattern -- namely the bill of the great black woodpecker of western indium a bird nearly as big as a crow it be nothing else than a hatchet in two part which when lock together present a steeled edge about three-eighth of a inch in breadth the hatchet be two and a half inch long by one in breadth at the base and a prominent ridge or keel run down the top from base to point it be further strengthen by a keel on each side inside of it ere the bird become a mummy be she tongue which i myself draw out three inch beyond the point of the bill it be rough and tough like gutta-percha tip with a fine spike and arm on each side for the last inch of its length with a row of sharp barb point backwards the whole be lubricate with some patent stickfast always ready for use that grub must sit tight indeed which this corkscrew will not draw when once the hatchet have open a way the swallow and swift untirable on they wing but too gentle to hold they own in a jostle crowd soar away after the midge and may-fly and pestilent gnat that rise from marsh and pond to hold they joyous dance under the blue dome continually rush open-mouthed after these they have stretch they gape from ear to ear but they bill have dwindle by disuse and leave only a apology for they absence compare with all these the bird that can do with a diet of fruit only lead a easy life they have just to pluck and eat -- that be if they be pleased with small fruit and content to swallow they whole but the hornbill be too bulky to hop among twig need a long reach hence the portentous machine which they carry on they face the beak of a hornbill be nothing else than a pair of tong long enough to reach and strong enough to wrench off a wild fig from its thick stem if it be of iron it would be thin and heavy being of cellular horn-stuff it be bulky but light if you ask why it should rise up into a absurd helmet on the queer fowl 's head i can not tell nature have quaint way of use up surplus material -lrb- illustration : its bill deserve study -rrb- a easy life beget luxury and among fruit-eater the parrot have become a epicure it will not swallow its food whole and its bill deserve study in bird generally the upper mandible be more or less join to the skull leave only the lower jaw free to move but in the parrot the upper mandible be also hinge so that each play freely on the other the upper as we all know be hooked and point the lower have a sharp edge the tongue be thick muscular and sensitive the whole make a wonderful instrument unique among bird for feelingly manipulate a dainty morsel shell peeling and slice until nothing be leave but the sweetest part of the core of all gourmand polly be the most shameless waster long before land tree and air have be exploit the primitive bird must have discover the harvest of the water and here the competition have be very keen indeed yet the form of bill most in use be very simple -- just a plain pair of forceps long and sharp-pointed like scissors this be evidently hard to beat for bird of many sort use it handle it variously the kingfisher plump bodily down on the minnow from a overhang perch the solan goose soar plunge from a pernicious height the heron high on its stilt dart out a long and serpentine neck the diver with similar beak and neck but different leg pursue the flee shoal under water to the swift and slippery fish all be alike terrible in they certainty there be however other variety of the fishing bill some have a hook at the point as that of the cormorant and some be straight at the top but curve on the under side this last form be handy for stork which do not pluck fish out of water so much but scoop up frog crab and reptile from the ground the ridiculous bill of the puffin or sea-parrot be a eccentricity there may be some idea in it but i suspect it be a effect of vanity merely be color blue yellow and red and quite in keep with the other absurdity of the wearer apart from all these and by itself stand a princely fisher whose bill be no modification but a original invention and a marvellous one larger than a swan and gluttonous withal the pelican can not live on single fish it have give up angling altogether and take to net and the way in which the net have be construct out of the pair of forceps provide in the original plan of its construction be as well worth you examine as anything i know it be a foot in length the upper jaw be flat and broad while the lower consist of two thin elastic bone join at the point a mere ring to carry the curious yellow bag that hang from it in picture this be represent as a creel in which the kind pelican carry home the child 's breakfast you be allow to see the tail of a big fish hang out but it be not a creel it be a net the great bird marshal in line on some broad lake or marsh and beat the water with they wing drive the fish before they until they have get a dense crowd huddle in panic and confusion between they and the shore now watch they narrowly as each monstrous bill open the thin bone of the lower jaw stretch sideways to the breadth of a span by some curious mechanism not describe in the book and at the same time the shrunken bag expand into a deep capacious net simultaneously the whole instrument be plunge into the struggle silvery mass and come up full the side bone instantly contract again and the upper jaw be clap on they like a lid no wonder the fisherman of the east detest the pelican -lrb- illustration : here the competition have be very keen indeed -rrb- -lrb- illustration : as wonderful as the pelican but how opposite -rrb- in the same marsh perhaps stand with unequalled grace upon the longest leg know in this world be a troop of giant bird as wonderful as the pelican but how opposite the beautiful flamingo be a bird of feeble intellect delicate appetite and genteel taste it can not eat fish for its slender throat would scarcely admit a pea besides the idea of catch anything or even pick up food from the ground do not occur to its simple mind its diet consist of certain small crustacean class by naturalist with water-flea which abound in brackish water and it have a instrument for take these which it know how to use i keep flamingo once and after try many thing in vain offer they bran or boil rice float in water then they dine and i learn the construction and working of the most marvellous of all bill the lower jaw be deep and hollow and its upper edge turn in to meet each other so that you may fairly describe it as a pipe with a narrow slit along the upper side in this pipe lie the tongue and it can not get out for it be wider than the slit but it can be press against the top to close the slit and then the lower jaw become a actual pipe the root of the tongue be furnish on both side with a loose fringe which we will call the first strainer the upper jaw be thin and flat and rest on the lower like a lid and it be beautifully fringe along both side with small leathery point close set like the tooth of a very fine saw this be the second strainer to work the machine you dip the point into dirty water full of water-flea draw back the tip of the tongue a little and suck in water till the lower jaw -lrb- the pipe -rrb- be full then close the point again with the tip of the tongue and force the water out it can only get out by pass through the first strainer at the root of the tongue then over the palate and so through the second strainer at the side of the bill and all the solid matter it contain will remain in the mouth the sucking in and squirt out of the water be manage by the cheek or rather by the cheek for a flamingo have only one cheek and that be situate under the chin when the bird be feed you will see this throb faster than the eye can follow it while water squirt from the side of the mouth in a continuous stream i should have say that the whole bill be sharply bent downward at the middle the advantage of this be that when the bird let down its head into the water like a bucket into a well the point of the bill do not stick in the mud but lie flat on it upside down in conclusion let we not fail to note whatever be we political creed that while all the bird pursue they respective industry there sit apart in pride of place some whose bill be not tool wherewith to work but weapon wherewith to slay and these take tribute of the rest not with they consent but of right iii tail the secret of nature often play like a iridescence on the surface and escape the eye of she worshipper because it be stop with a microscope there be mystery all about we as omnipresent as the movement of the air that lift the smoke and stir the leaf which i can not find that any philosopher have look into often and deeply have i be impress with this for example there be scarcely in this world a commoner or a humbler thing than a tail yet how multifarious be it in aspect in construction and in function a hundred different thing and yet one some be of feather and some of hair and some bare and skinny some be long and some be short some stick up and some hang down some wag for ever and some be still the use that they serve can not be number but one name cover they all in the course of evolution they come in with the fish and go out with man what be they purpose and mission what place have they fill in the scheme of thing in short what be the true inwardness of a tail if we try to commence -- as scientific method require -- with a definition we stumble on a key at the very threshold which open the door for there be no definition of a tail it be not in its nature anything at all when a animal 's fore-leg be fit on to its backbone at the proper distance from the hind-leg if any of the backbone remain over we call it a tail but it have no purpose it be a mere surplus which a tailor -lrb- the pun be unavoidable -rrb- would have trim off and lo in this very negativeness lie the whole secret of the multifarious positiveness of tail for the absence of special purpose be the chance of general usefulness the ear must fulfil its purpose or fail entirely for it can do nothing else eye nose and mouth hand and foot all have they duty the tail be the unemployed and if we allow that life have have any hand in the shaping of its own destiny then the ingenuity of the device for turn the useless member to account afford one of the most exhilarating subject of contemplation in the whole panorama of nature the fish fit it up at once as a twin-propeller with result so satisfactory that the whale and the porpoise come long after adopt the invention and be it note that these last and they kin be now the only ocean-going mammal in the world the whole tribe of paddle-steamer such as seal and walrus and dugong be only coaster among those beast that would live on the dry land the primitive kangaroo could think of nothing better to do with he tail than to make a stool of it it be a simple thought but a happy one sit up like a gentleman he have he hand free to scratch he rib or twitch he moustache and when he go he need not to put they to the ground for he great tail so nearly equal the weight of he body that one pair of leg keep the balance even and so the kangaroo almost the lowest of beast come closer to man in he posture than any other the squirrel also sit up and use he forepaw for hand but the squirrel be a sybarite who lie abed in cold weather and it be every way characteristic of he that he have send he tail to the furrier and have it do up into a boa or comforter at once warm and become see too how daintily he lift it over he back to keep it clean the rat be a near relation of the squirrel zoologically but personally he be a gutter-snipe and you may know that by one look at the tail which he drag after he like a dirty rope other of the same family cleaner though not more ingenious like the guinea-pig have simply dispense with the encumbrance but the rabbit have keep enough to make a white cockade which it hoist when bolt from danger this be for the guidance of the youngster nearly every kind of deer and antelope carry the same signal with which when flee through dusky wood the leader show the way to the herd and the doe to she fawn but of beast that graze and browse a large number have turn they tail rather to a use which throw a pathetic light on misery of which we have little experience we do indeed growl at the gnat of a summer evening and think ourselves very ill-used how little do we know or think of the unintermitted and unabated torment that the most harmless class of beast suffer from the band of beggar which follow they night and day demand blood and will take no refusal drive from the brow they settle on the neck shake from the neck they dive between the leg and but for that far-reaching whisk at the end of the tail they would find a permanent colony on the flank and defy ejection like the raider of vatersay darwin argue that the tail-brush may have materially help to secure the survival of those species of beast that possess it and no doubt he be right the subject be interminable but we must give a pass glance to some quixotic tail the opossum scamper up a tree carry all she numerous family on she back and they do not fall off because each infant be securely moor by its own tail to the uplifted tail of its mother the opossum be a very primitive beast and so early and useful a invention should one would think have be spread widely in after time but there appear to be some difficulty in develop muscle at the thin end of a long tail for the animal that have turn it into a grasp organ be few and be widely scatter example be the chameleon among lizard we own little harvest mouse and pre-eminent above all the american monkey to a howler or spider-monkey its long tail be a swing and a trapeze in its forest gymnasium humboldt saw -lrb- he say it -rrb- a cluster of they all hang from a tree by one tail which proceed from a sandow in the middle i should like to see that too it be worth note by the way that no old-world monkey have attain to this application of its tail then there be the beaver whose tail i be convinced be a trowel i know of no naturalist who have mention this but such negative evidence be of little weight the beaver as everybody know be a builder who cut down tree and pile log upon log until he have raise a solid domed cabin from seven to twenty foot in diameter which he then plaster over with clay and straw if he do not turn round and beat the work smooth with he tail then i require to know for what purpose he carry that broad heavy and hard tool behind he how few even among lover of nature know why a frog have no tail the reason-is simply that it use that organ up when it be in want in early life as a jolly tadpole it have a flourishing tail to swim with and gill for breathing water and a infantile mouth for take vegetable nourishment but when it begin to draw near to frog 's estate serious change be require in its structure to fit it for the life of a land animal four tiny leg appear from under its skin the gill give place to air-breathing lung and the infant lip to a great gaping mouth now during this temporary alteration of the premise all business be of necessity stop the half-fish half-frog could neither sup like a infant nor eat like a man in this extremity it feed on its own tail -- absorb it as a camel be say to absorb its hump when travel in the foodless desert -- and so it enter on its new life without one aeronautics have change the whole perspective of life for bird as they may for we shortly so it be no surprise to find that bird have almost with one consent convert they tail into steering-gear a commonplace bird like a sparrow scarcely require this except as a brake when in the act of alighting but to those bird with which flight be a art and a accomplishment a expansive fork or round tail -lrb- there be two patent -rrb- be indispensable we have shoot almost all the bird of this sort in we own country and must travel if we would enjoy that enchant sight -- a pair of eagle or a party of kite go aloft for a sail when the wind be rise like skater to a pond when the ice be bear for a hour on end in restful ease or swift joy they trace ever-varying circle and spiral against the dark storm-cloud now rise now fall turn and reverse but never once flap they widespread pinion how be it do how do the _ shamrock _ sail watch and you will see when the wind be behind each stiff quill at the end of the wing stand out by itself and be catch and drive by the blast but as the bird turn round to face the gale they all close up and form a continuous mainsail close-hauled and all the while the expand tail be in play dip first at one side and then at the other and turn the trim craft with easy grace as the governor listeth -lrb- illustration : there be some eccentric such as jenny wren which have despise they tail -rrb- besides ground bird like the quail there be some eccentric such as jenny wren which have despise they tail and there be specialist also which require they for other purpose than fly the woodpecker 's tail be quite useless as a rudder for he be a woodman and have alter and adapt it for a portable stool to rest against as he ply he axe but that man must be very blind to the place which bird have take in the progress of civilisation who can suppose it possible that they should think only of utility in such a question as the disposal of they tail it be a common notion among those who have acquire some smattering of the theory of evolution that fish develop into reptile reptile into bird and bird into beast but this be as wrong as it could be whatever the genealogy of the beast may be they certainly be not evolve from bird and be in many respects not above they but below they these be two independent branch of the tree of live form as the greek and roman be branch of the stock of japheth the beast may stand for the conquer roman if you like but the bird be the greek and have advance far beyond they in all emotional and artistic sensibility they worship in the temple of music and beauty and like ourselves they have find no subject so worthy of the highest effort of art as they own dress but the clothing of the body must conform more or less to the figure and so for a field in which invention and fancy may sport untrammell a lady turn to she hat and a bird to its tail and by both with equal heroism every consideration of mere comfort convenience health or safety be sweep aside in obedience to the higher aim be this only a flippant jocularity or be there here in very truth some profound law of the mind reveal itself in sphere seemingly so disconnect look at a peacock its train by the way be a false tail like the chignon of twenty year ago or the fringe of the present day the true tail be under it and serve no purpose but to support it now the peacock live on the ground among scrub and brushwood haunt by jackal and wild cat they like soldier in khaki reconnoitre he in a uniform expressly design to elude the eye but he flaunt a flag resplendent with green and gold and when he one chance of life lie in spring nimbly from the ground and commit himself to he strong wing he must lift and carry this ponderous paraphernalia with he and the terrible bonellus 's eagle be soar above but all be risk proudly for the sake of the morning hour in the glade where the lady assemble and the peacock be only one of many not to mention the lyre bird the argus pheasant the bird of paradise and other splendid example there be common dicky-bird which point the moral and adorn the tail as emphatically if the tail be a rudder where should you look to find it in its most simple and efficient form but among the flycatcher which make they living by aerial acrobatics after fly yet this family seem to be peculiarly prone to the vanity of a stylish tail the paradise flycatcher flutter two streamer a foot long like white ribbon behind it the fantail could hide behind its own fan the bee-eater have the two central feather prolonged and point the drongo which be flycatcher in habit wear they tail very long and deeply fork and one of they the racket-tailed drongo have the two side feather extend beyond the rest for nearly a foot and as thin as wire expand into a blade at the end i have see nothing in lady ' hat more preposterous it be vain to object that there can be no proper comparison between tail and hat because the woman choose she own hat while the bird have to wear what nature have give it i know that but the contention be utterly superficial what choice have a woman as to the style of she hat fashion prescribe for she and nature for the bird that be all the difference no doubt she acquiesce when theoretically she might rebel the bird can not rebel but do it not acquiesce do a lyre bird submit to its tail -- wear it under protest so to speak believe I every bird that have a aesthetic tail know the fact and try to live up to it we may push the argument even further for the motmot of brazil be not content with a ready-made tail but actually strip the web off the two long side feather with its own beak except a little patch at the end so as to get the pattern which nature if one must use the phrase give to the racket-tailed drongo a specimen be exhibit in the hall of the south kensington museum -lrb- illustration : a blackbird and a starling -- the one lift its skirt while the other wear a walk dress -rrb- in this connection i may also say that the shape or color of a tail be not everything a observant eye may find much to note in the wear of they there be a stylish way of carry a tail and a slovenly way and there be coquettish art for the display of recherche tail a blackbird and a starling be both tidy bird and both walk much on the ground but the one lift its skirt while the other more practical and less fashionable wear a walk dress and save itself trouble this line of observation lead to a higher and reveal the most important purpose that tail have serve in the economy of beast bird and reptile and perhaps even cold-blooded fish before the godlike countenance of man appear on the earth with its contractile forehead and erectile eyebrow the answering light of the eye the expansive nostril and subtilely mobile lip before that the tail be the prime vehicle of emotion and safety-valve of passion it be a great truth too often bury in these day under rubbish of materialistic theory that some way of self-manifestation be a supreme necessity of all sentient life from the hot center of thought and feel the current rush along the nervous way and pervade the whole frame seek a outlet but many passage be bar by duty or fear or eager purpose a strong gust of passion may burst all barrier and force its way out at every point but gentle current flow along the line of least resistance and find the idle tail i do not know a better illustration of this than a cat watch a mouse the ear be prick forward the eye be fix on the unsuspecting victim every muscle of the leg be tense like a bent bow ready to speed the arrow on its way but see the excitement with which the whole body be charge can not be wholly restrained and ooze out at the point of the tail -lrb- illustration : at the sight of a rival the dog hold its tail up stiffly -rrb- every emotion and passion take this course the happy kid wag its tail as it run to its mother the donkey when it have execute a successful bray and the dog when it see its master at the sight of a rival the dog hold its tail up stiffly unless indeed the rival be a bigger dog than itself in which case the index go down quickly between the leg a elated horse elevate its tail and so do a duck in the same mood a lizard prepare to fight another lizard swinge the scaly horror of he fold tail and the rage lion of fiction lash its side with the same nervous instrument it would be tedious to dwell on the pretty part which the tail play in the courtship of sparrow and pigeon or on the sprightly attitude by which bird of all sort let off they spirit when shower and sunshine have overfil they heart with gladness but bird twitch they tail constantly without mean anything by it the ceaseless wagging of a wagtail be a mere habit of cheerfulness like the twirling of she thumb by a idle scotswoman the long tail be there and something must be do with it look at the embarrassment which a nervous young man show about the disposal of he hand how he thrust they into he trouser pocket hang they by they thumb from the arm-hole of he waistcoat or give they a walking-stick to play with i like to imagine what such a fellow would do with a long tail if he have it -- how he would wind it round each leg in turn rub up he back hair and describe figure on the floor but no animal so self-conscious as man could bear up long under the nervous strain of have to think continually of its tail it would die young and the race would become extinct perhaps it do a final word on the conclusion of the whole matter for these reflection have a moral as habit become character so expression harden into feature the tail of a sheep grow downward but that of a goat upward and this be the only infallible outward mark of distinction between the two animal but it be the permanent record of a long history the sheep be never anything but sheepish the goat and its forefather be pert as kid and insolent when they beard grow it be useless to inquire why insolence should express itself by a upturned tail until someone can advance a reason why it should express itself in another way for proof of the fact you need go no farther than you own dog the ancestral wolf or jackal hunting and fight fear and hope show every change mood by the pose of its tail but a change come when it acquire a assure position of security and importance as the choose companion of man so dreaded by all its kith and kin the tail go up at once and stay there when it could go no higher it curl over but promotion breed conceit only in base nature the greyhound be a gentleman respectful and self-respecting and it show that by the very carriage of its tail only a snob at heart pet and pampered for many generation could have produce that perfect incarnation of smug self-satisfaction the pug let we take the lesson home the thought on which we let we mind dwell and the sentiment that we harbor in we heart be the chisel with which we be carve out we face and those of we child 's child iv nose some may think that i have choose a trivial subject and they will look for frivolous treatment of it i can only hope that they will be disappoint there be nothing that the progress of science have teach we more emphatically than this -- that we must call nothing insignificant seemingly trivial pursuit have lead to discovery which have benefit all mankind and priceless truth have be dig out of the most unpromising mine i be not insinuate that anyone 's nose be a unpromising mine but i say that i be persuade there be wisdom hide in that organ for he who will observingly distil it out -lrb- illustration : a shrew can do it but not a man -rrb- it possess a peculiar and mystical significance not share by any other feature this be abundantly prove by common speech which be one of the most trustworthy of all kind of evidence for example we speak of a person turn up he nose at a good offer the phrase be absurd for the power of turn up he nose be one which no human be ever possess a shrew can do it but not a man yet the meaning of the say need no interpretation akin to it be the classical phrase _ adunco suspendere naso _ what horace mean scarcely require explanation but no commentator have successfully explain it these expression well illustrate the mystery that enshroud we most salient feature they show that while everybody can see that disdain be express through the nose nobody can define how it be do then there be that curious expression put he nose out of joint which be quite inexplicable the nose be destitute of joint there be many other phrase and also gesture which point in the same direction but need not be cite be for the most part vulgar allusion to the nose have a tendency to be vulgar which be another mystery incite we to investigate it so let we proceed the first thing require by the principle of scientific precedure be a definition what be a nose but this prove to be a much more difficult question than anyone would suspect before he try to answer it the individual human nose we can recognize describe or sketch more easily than any other feature but try to define the thing _ nose _ in nature and it be a most elusive phenomenon when we speak of a man be lead by the nose we imply that it be a part of he which be prominent and situate in front when we speak of keep one 's nose above water we refer to it as the breathing orifice but when we say that this or that offend we nose we be regard it as the seat of the sense of smell i believe that all these three idea must be include in any definition it should follow that insect which breathe through hole in they side can not have nose and this be the truth fish too though they may have snout have not nose because they breathe by gill in truth it seem that the nose be a very late and high acquisition almost the finish touch of the perfect animal form and incidentally this lead we to notice what a great step be take in evolution when the breathing hole be bring up to the region of the mouth for the sense of taste be necessarily situate in the mouth and the sense of smell be in close alliance with it the mouth taste food dissolve in the saliva during the process of mastication and the primary use of the sense of smell be to detect and analyze beforehand the small particle give off by food and float in the atmosphere a good many year ago when the late sally chimpanzee be the darling of the zoological garden in regent 's park i watch she eating date she be a epicure and always peel each date delicately with she preposterous lip before eat it and during the process she would apply the date to she nose every second to test its quality or enjoy its aroma the action be indescribably comical but what would it have be if she nostril have be situate among she rib imagine a mantis for example as he chew up a fly lift one of he wing and apply it to he flank to see if it smell gamey that be where some naturalist believe that the sense of smell be situate in insect other however think with reason that it be in the antenna or mouth nobody know the sens of the lower animal seem to be stick about all part of the body but even if the sense of smell be at the mouth how limited must its usefulness be when it can only deal with substance that be hold to it a new era dawn when the passage by which the breath of life unceasingly come and go be transfer to the region of the mouth also the nerve of smell quickly spread themselves over the lining membrane of those passage and become warder of the gate challenging every waft of air that enter the body and examine what it carry thenceforth this region comprise the mouth nostril and surround part hold a new and high place in the economy of the body for the headquarters of the intelligence department be located there and all the faculty of the brain converge on that point of course the eye and ear claim a share but they be not far off now it be be recognize more and more clearly by medical and physiological science that when the mind be much direct to any part of the body it exercise a influence in some way not understand on the flow of blood to that part to a degree which may seriously affect its function and even its growth when a person be suffer from any nervous affection from heart disease or even from weakness of the eye it be of the utmost importance to keep he from know it if possible for if he know it he will think about it and that will inevitably aggravate it this principle be well recognize in system of physical culture and surely it be impossible that so much intelligence should pass through that one sensitive region of the body which we be consider without affect its growth and structure every muscle in it become quick to respond to various sensation in different way till the very recollection of those sensation will excite the same response nay we may go further the mental emotion excite by those sensation will be express in the same way for example the sense of smell be peculiarly effective in exciting disgust anything which do violence to the sense of hearing exasperate but do not disgust if a man practise the accordion all day in the next room you do not loathe he you only want to kill he but anything that stink excite pure disgust here you have the key to the fact that disgust and all feeling akin to it disdain contempt and scorn express themselves through the nose darwin say that when we think of anything base or vile in a man 's character the expression of the face be the same as if we smell a bad smell this be a example of the temporary expression of a pass emotion and there be many other like it but each of we have he prevail and dominant emotion which constitute the habitual attitude of he mind and by the habitual indulgence of any emotion the feature will become habituate to the expression of it and so the set of we feature come at last to express we prevail and dominant emotion in other word we _ character _ -lrb- illustration : the nostril of the apteryx be at the tip of its beak -rrb- but let we return to the evolution of the nose in these day of universal nature study nobody need be tell that the practice of breathing through the nostril be introduce by the amphibian and reptile the former -lrb- frog and toad -rrb- take to it only when they come of age but lizard snake and all other reptile do it from infancy but the nose be not yet that be something too delicate to come out of a cold-blooded snout cover with hard scale bird too by have they mouth part encase in a horny bill seem to be debar from wear nose and yet there be one primeval fowl most ancient of all the feathered family which have come near it i mean the apteryx that eccentric wingless recluse which hide itself in the scrub jungle of new zealand its nostril unlike those of every other bird be at the tip of its beak which be swollen and sensitive and dr buller say that as it wander about in the night it make a continual sniff and softly tap the wall of its cage with the point of its bill but the apteryx be one of those odd genius which come into the world too soon and perish ineffectual its kindred be all extinct and so will it be ere long -lrb- illustration : a bold attempt to grow in the case of a tapir -rrb- when we come to the beast we find the right condition at last for the growth of the nose take the horse for a example of the average beast without idiosyncrasy its profile be nearly a straight line from the crown to the nostril beyond which it slope downward to the lip the skin of this part be soft and smooth without hair and the horse dearly love to have it fondle the sense of touch be evidently uppermost at this stage there be what to the eye of fancy look like a bold attempt to grow a nose in the case of a tapir but it miscarry these hoofed beast be all very hard up for something in the way of a hand to bring they food to they mouth the camel employ its lip and the cow its tongue the muntja or bark deer of indium have attain a tongue of such length that it use it for a handkerchief to wipe its eye so the tapir could not resist the temptation to misapply its nose to the purpose of gather fodder and the ultimate result be the elephant whose nose be a wonderful hand and a bucket and other thing the pig be a swine debase its nose in a worse way make a grub tool of it there have be another attempt to misuse and pervert this part of the face which i scarcely dare to touch upon for it be so utterly fantastic and mystical that i fear the charge of heresy if i give word to my thought it occur among bat a tribe of obscure creature about which common knowledge amount to this that they fly about after sunset be uncanny and fond of get entangled in the hair of lady and should be kill but there be certain family of bat name horseshoe bat leaf-nosed bat and vampire about which common knowledge be _ nil _ and the knowledge possess by naturalist very little so i will tell what i know of they they be larger than common bat they wing be broad soft and silent like those of the owl they sleep in cave tomb and ruin they do not flutter in the open air but swiftly traverse gloomy avenue and shady glade they prey be not gnat and midge but the drone beetle the death 's head moth the cockchafer croak frog sleep bird and _ human blood _ the book will tell you that these bat be distinguish by complicated nasal appendage consist of foliaceous skin process around the nostril which be quite true and utterly futile it may do for a dry skin or a specimen in spirit of wine i have have the foul fiend in a cage and look he in the face he whole countenance from lip to brow and from cheek to cheek be cover and hide by a hideous design of spell and sign symbolic letter circle line sculpture in live quiver skin it be a sight to make the flesh creep the book suggest that these foliaceous appendage be the organ of some special sense akin to touch futile again there be thing in nature still which prompt the naturalist who have not atrophy he inner eye and starve he imagination to cry out : science why preyest thou thus upon the poet 's heart vulture whose wing be dull reality suppose there should be in the unseen universe a evil spirit a imp of malice and mischief not milton 's satan but the deil of burn : whyle range like a roar lion for prey a ' hole a ' corner tryin whyle on the strong-winged tempest flyin tirlin the kirk whyle in the human bosom pryin and suppose he to crave possession of a body through which he might get into touch with this material world and express himself in outward form and motion then oh how fitly be this bat explain but let we go back to firm ground if you compare a dog 's profile with that of a horse you will note at once that the nostril be in advance of the lip and have a kind of portal to themselves this be a distinct advance the sense of smell have come to the front and push aside the lower sense of touch you will observe too that with the growth of the brain the brain-pan have elevated itself above the level of the nose through the cat to the monkey the process proceed the forehead advance the jaw retreat and the nostril leave the lip until they finally settle in a detach villa midway between the eye and the mouth this be the nose i do not know the use of it i can not fathom the meaning of it it be a solemn mystery see the face of a orang-outang it be a _ countenance _ a signboard with three distinct line of write on it the eye the nose and the mouth you may not think much of this particular nose neither do i i think it be situate rather too near the eye and too far from the mouth it be a little too small also and want style but you must not judge a first attempt too critically i have see human nose of a pattern not unlike this but they be not consider aristocratic : perhaps they indicate a reversion to the ancestral type -lrb- illustration : i have see human nose of a pattern not unlike this but they be not consider aristocratic -rrb- but the nose even of monkey be not all like this in fact there be a good deal of variety and two in particular have strike I as quite remarkable one be that of the long-nosed monkey -lrb- _ semnopithecus nasali _ -rrb- i think it must have suggest sterne 's stranger on a mule who have travel to the promontory of nose and throw all strassburg into a ferment i have often contemplate this nose in mute wonderment and long to see that monkey in life if so be i might arrive at some understanding of it for the taxidermist can not rise above he own level and the man who would mount _ s nasalis _ would need to be a henry irving then there be the sub-nosed monkey label _ rhinopithecus _ of which there be a expressive specimen at the south kensington museum who can consider that nose seriously and continue to believe in a recipe make up of struggle for existence adaptation to environment and natural selection _ quantum suf _ if i could dine with that monkey ask it to drink a glass of wine with I offer it a pinch of snuff and so on i might come in time to feel if not to comprehend the import of its nose -lrb- illustration : the long-nosed monkey -rrb- -lrb- illustration : who can consider that nose seriously -rrb- but one step further be require for the evolution of what we may call the human nose and that be a solid foundation a ridge of bone connect it with the brow and separate the eye from each other i believe that the completeness of this be a fair index of the comparative advancement of different race of man in the greek ideal of a perfect face the profile form a straight line from the top of the forehead to the tip of the nose this be the type of face which painter have delight to give to the virgin mary and when look at they madonna one can not help wonder whether they forget that mary be a jewess accord to the hebrew ideal a perfect nose be like the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus -lrb- song of solomon vii 4 -rrb- but not even the ruin of that tower remain to help we to-day the roman no doubt accept the ideal of the greek aesthetically but they destiny have give they a very different nose and they rule the world here be the nose of julius caesar as a coin have preserve it for we i think that the outline be too straight for a typical roman but the deep dip under the brow and the downward point be characteristic now compare the nose of another race which rule a empire greater than that of the caesar here be john bull as _ punch _ usually represent he it belong to the same genus as that of the roman the reason why this should be the nose of command be not easy to give with scientific precision for we be deal with the play of very subtle influence so the man without imagination will no doubt scoff but i will take shelter under darwin deal with the expression of pride he say a proud man exhibit he sense of superiority by hold he head and body erect he be haughty _ -lrb- haut -rrb- _ or high and make himself appear as large as possible again the arrogant man look down on other and yet again in some photograph of patient affect by a monomania of pride send I by dr crichton-browne the head and body be hold erect and the mouth firmly close this latter action expressive of decision follow i presume from the proud man feeling perfect self-confidence in himself darwin say nothing about the nose but i believe that by physiological sympathy it can not but take part in the habitual downward look upon inferior being darwin go on to say that the whole expression of pride stand in direct antithesis to that of humility from which it follow if my philosophy be sound that the nose of uriah heep be turn upward of course many emotion may share in the moulding of a nose and the whole subject be too intricate and vast to be treat briefly i have only give a few example to illustrate my argument and my conclusion be that the key to the peculiar significance and personal quality of the nose be to be find in its _ immobility _ the eye and lip be incessantly in motion we can twitch and wrinkle the cheek and forehead and muscle to move the ear be there though most man have lose control of they but the nose stand out like some bold promontory on a level coast or like the sphinx in the egyptian desert with a ancient history no doubt and a mystery perhaps but without response to any appeal and for this very reason it be a index not to that which be transient in the man but to that which be permanent he may knit he brow to seem thoughtful and profound or compress he lip to persuade he friend and himself that he have a strong will but he can play no trick with he nose there it stand a incorruptible witness testify to what he be and not only to what he be but to the rock whence he be hew and to the pit whence he be dig for he nose be a bequest from he ancestor a entail estate which he can not alienate v ear man and woman have ear and so have jug and pitcher in the latter case they be useful : jug and pitcher be lift by they and what be useful be fit and fitness be the first condition of beauty but human ear be put to no use except sometimes when naughty little boy be lift by they in the way of discipline and i can see no beauty in they it be only because they be so common that we do not notice how ridiculous they be in the day of charle i man sometimes have they ear cut off for hold wrong opinion which would have make they famous and popular in these enlighten day but at that time it make all right-thinking people despise they so the fashion of go without ear do not spread among we if it have then how differently we should all think of the matter now if we be all accustom to neat round head at drawing-rooms levee and ball how repulsive it would be to see a well-dressed man with two ridiculous wrinkled appendage stick out from the side of he face in say this i be not draw on my fancy but on my memory i can recollect the time when no gentleman still less any lady would have own a terrier with its ear on and why go back so far the same sentiment be prevalent in good society with respect to man 's beard in this year of grace and smooth face yet if one chance to be look at a rembrandt instead of at society what a infinitely handsomer adjunct to a noble face be a fine beard than a pair of ear when woman first look at she face in a polished saucepan she be at once strike with the comicality of those thing and bethought herself what to do with they she decide to use they for peg to hang ornament on the improvement excite the admiration of she husband and the envy of she rival to such a degree that all other woman of taste in she tribe do the same and from that day to this in almost every country in the world it have be account a shame for any respectable woman to show she face in public in the hideousness of naked ear this discovery of its capability give a new value to the ear and a large roomy one become a asset in the marriage market i have see a pretty little damsel of sind with fourteen jingle silver thing hang at regular interval from the outside edge of each ear if nature have be niggardly the lobe at least could be enlarged by bore it and thrust in a small wooden peg then a larger one and so on until it could hold a ivory wheel as large as a quoit and hang down to the shoulder but nature surely do not intend the ear for this purpose then what do she intend a popular error be that the ear be give to hear with but the ear can not hear the hearing be do by a box of assorted instrument -lrb- _ malleus incus stape _ etc -rrb- hide in a burrow which have its entrance inside of the ear if you argue that the ear be intend to catch sound and direct they down to the hearing instrument then explain they absurd shape they be useless a man who want to hear distinctly put he hand to he ear and why do they not turn to meet the sound that come from different quarter they be absolutely immovable and therefore also expressionless a savage express he mind with all the rest of he face he smile and grin and pout and frown but he ear stand like gravestone with the inscription efface how different be the case when you turn from man to the irrational animal the eye of a fawn be lustrous and beautiful but they would be as meaningless as polished stone without the eloquent ear that stand behind they and tell she thought curiosity suspicion alarm anger submission friendliness every emotion that flit across she quick sensitive mind speak through they they be in touch with she soul and half the music of she life be play on they and if you abstract yourself from individual and look at that thing the ear in the wide field of life what a great living reality it be -- a spiritual unity under infinite diversity of material form and fashion it be like the telegraph wire overhead the commonest and plainest of material thing but charge with the silent and invisible current of the life of the world let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore -lrb- illustration : or perhaps when it want to listen it raise a flipper to its ear -rrb- bird have no ear nor have crocodile nor frog nor snake ear seem to be for beast only and not for all beast seal be divide by naturalist into two great family -- those with ear and those without the common seal belong to the latter class and the sea-lion to the former a common seal live in the sea and when it do wriggle up on the beach of a iceberg there be nothing to hear i suppose or perhaps when it want to listen it raise a flipper to its ear i never see one do so but we do not see everything that happen in the world the sea-lion with its stouter limb can lift its forepart raise its head and look about it and even flop about the ice-field at a respectable rate and there be no doubt that one of these be as much above a earless seal as fifty year of europe be better than a cycle of cathay when perform seal be exhibit at a circus sit on chair catch ball on the point of they nose and play diabolo with they or balance billiard cue on they snout and do other miraculous thing they be always sea-lion not common seal of course i do not mean to insinuate that sea-lion invent the ear and stick it on : that would be unscientific but i mean that they general intelligence and interest in affair create that demand for more distinct hearing which lead to the development of a ear trumpet this view be wholly scientific though pedant may quarrel with my way of put it the sea-lion 's ear be very minute mere apology one might think but do not be hasty the finny prey of the sea-lion make no sound as it skim through the water and perhaps the padded foot of that stealthy garrotter the polar bear make as little on the smooth ice for catch the one and not be catch by the other the sea-lion must trust to the keenness of its great goggle eye but it be a social beast and it want to catch the bellowing of its fellow far across the foggy waste of ice-floe and that little leather scoop stand behind the ear-hole seem to be just the instrument require to catch and send down those sound which would otherwise glance off the glossy fur and never find entrance to the tiny orifice at all if it be any larger than be absolutely necessary it would be a serious impediment to a professional diver and swimmer like the sea-lion this be the reason why otter have very small ear and why whale and porpoise have none at all but when a beast live on land the condition be all altered and then the ear blossom out into a infinite variety of form and size from each of which the true naturalist may divine the manner of life of its wearer as surely as the palmist tell you past present and future from the line on you hand first he will divide all beast into those that pursue and those that flee oppressor and oppress the former point they ear forwards but the latter backwards there may be a good deal of free play in both case but i be thinking of the habitual position when a cat be make its felonious way along the garden wall wrap in thought of blackbird and thrush its ear look straight forwards and this be the way in which a cat 's portrait be always take because it be characteristic it can not turn they round to catch sound from behind and would scorn to do so when accost from behind it turn its head and look danger in the face it can fold they down backwards when the danger be a terrier and the deck be clear for action but that be another story contrast brer rabbit as he come lopin ' up de big road he ear be turn every way scout for danger not always in unison but independently but when he be at rest they be set to alarm from the flank and rear -lrb- illustration : tear out the house like the dog wuz atter he -rrb- but when he tear out the house like the dog wuz atter he then they point straight back he be make to be eat and he know it so it be with the whole tribe of deer and even with the horse pampered and care for and unacquainted with danger he ear be a weathercock register the drift of all he petty hope and fear i see the left ear go forward and prepare for a desperate shy at that wheelbarrow he know a wheelbarrow familiarly -- there be one in he stall all day -- but i be take he a road he do not want to go and so the hypocrite be go to pretend that barrow be of a dangerous sort i prepare to apply a counter-irritant : he see it with the corner of he eye and both ear turn back like a tuning-fork the size and quality of the ear serve to show how far the owner depend on it you will never begin to understand nature until you see clearly that every life be dominate by two supreme anxiety which push aside all other concern -- viz to eat and not to be eat the one be uppermost in those that pursue and the other in those that flee now if the pursuer fail he lose a dinner but if the fugitive fail he lose he life from which it follow that the very best sort of ear will be find among those beast that do not ravage but run but there be another matter to be take into account the ear be not the whole of the beast 's outfit it have eye and it have a nose which of the three it most rely on depend upon the manner of its life a bird live in tree or the air look down at the prowl cat or up at the hawk hover in the clear sky so it do not keep ear and its nose be of no account but what four-footed thing can see like a bird the squirrel also live in the tree and its ear be frivolously decorate with tuft of hair you will not find many beast that can afford to prostitute they ear to ornamental purpose the only other beast that i can think of at this moment which have tuft ear be the lynx now the lynx be a tree cat and there be proverbial wisdom in the say eye like a lynx -lrb- illustration : a great catholic congress of distinguished ear -rrb- but go to the timid beast that spend they life on the ground among grass and brushwood and wood and coppice where murderous foe be prowl unseen and you will see ear indeed -- expansive tremulous turn lightly on well-oiled pivot and catch like large sea-shell the mingled murmur of rustling leave and snap twig and chirp insect and fall seed and the slight occasional abrupt fateful sound which be none of these it be impossible no doubt for we ever to think ourselves into the life which these beast live -- move thinking and sleep in a circumambient atmosphere of never-ceasing sound sit as it be at the receive station of a system of wireless telegraphy and catch cross-current of float intelligence from all quarter mostly undiscernible by we if we listen for it but which they by long practice instantly locate and interpret without conscious effort the zoologist classify they under many head the field mouse and rabbit be rodentia the deer ungulata the kangaroo marsupialium in my museum they be all one family and they label be they ear in these day of international conference parliament of religion pan-everything-in-turn council might we not arrange for a great catholic congress of distinguished ear what a glow of new life it would shed upon we straitened traditional way of think about the social problem of we humble fellow-creature i would exclude the eared owl whose ear be a mere sport of fashion like the hideous imitation of bird ' wing which lady stick on they hat but just when this peep into the rare show of nature be lift my soul into sublimity i be bring down to the base earth again by a exception this be the plague of all high science you design a stately theory collect from many quarter a wealth of fact to establish it with and have arrange they with cumulative and irresistible force when some disgusting uninvited case thrust itself in on you notice and refuse to fit into you argument at all in this instance it be my lord the elephant that he have no need to concern himself about any bloodthirsty beast that may be lurk in the jungle be not more obvious than that he ear be the biggest in the world now there be two way of get rid of a obstruction of this kind one be to betake yourself to you think chair and pipe and to rake up the possibility of the pleiocene and meiocene age and prove that when the immense ear of the elephant be evolve there must have be some carnivorous monster some sabre-toothed tiger or cave bear which prey on elephant the other way be to get acquaint with the elephant cultivate a intimacy with he and find out what he ear be to he i prefer the second way i would patiently watch he as he stand drowsily under a umbrageous banian tree on a sultry day before the monsoon have burst and refresh earth and air so might i note that he ear be incessantly move but not turn this way and that to catch sound -- just flap flap as if to cool he great temple so have i see the gigantic fruit bat call fly fox in indium hanging in hundred in the upper branch of a tall peepul tree at noon feeling too hot to sleep and all fan themselves in unison with one wing -- a comic spectacle and at each flap of the elephant 's ear i would observe that a cloud of fly -lrb- for the elephant be not too great to be pester by the despicable horde of beggar for blood -rrb- be dislodge from they feeding grounds about he head and neck and try to settle about he rear part be drive back again by the swinging of he tail then i should say that ear be just a fan how significant it be that among the emblem of royalty in the east the three chiefest be a umbrella-bearer two man who stand behind and swing great punkah model on the elephant 's ear and two other carry yak 's tail wherewith to scare the fly from the royal person the elephant be a rajah there be another mysterious ear which be a stumbling-block to the simple theory-monger it be in fashion among a tribe of bat to which belong the so-called vampire of indium this monster be fond of come into you bedroom at midnight through the open window but not to suck you blood for it have little in common with the true vampire of south america it bring its dinner with it and hang from the ceiling feed like horse when you hear they feed you hear its jaw work -- crunch crunch crunch but feel too drowsy to get up and expel it when you get up in the morning there on you clean dress table just below the place where it hang be the bloody remains of a sparrow or the crumb of a tree-frog the servant will tell you that the sparrow be kill and eat by a rat but if you rise softly next night when you hear the sound of feeding and shut the window you will find a goblin hang from the ceiling in the morning hideous beyond the power of word to tell its ear thin membranous and longer than its head tremble incessantly inside of they be another pair much smaller than the first and tune to they octave i should guess while two membranous smell trumpet of similar pattern rise over the nose what be the meaning of these repulsive instrument and how do that strange beast catch sparrow when it come out after dark and quarter the garden pass swiftly under and through the branch of tree they be sound asleep hide among the leaf motionless and silent but they flesh may be scented and they gentle breathing hear if you have instrument sufficiently delicate then the ample wing may suddenly enfold the sleep body and the savage jaw grip the startled head before there be time even to scream without a doubt this be the secret of the vampire bat 's ear but to find food and flee death be not the only interest in life even to the meanest creature there be social pleasure family affection and fellowship sympathy and co-operation in the struggle of life and there be love omne adeo genus in terri hominumque ferarumque et genus aequoreum pecudes pictaeque volucre in furias ignemque ruunt : amor omnibus idem the chirping of the cricket the song of the lark the call of the sentinel crane the watchword with which the migratory goose keep they squadron together the howling of jackal the lowing of cow the hum of the hive the chatter of the drawing-room and a hundred other voice in forest and field and town remind we that the voice and the ear be the pair of wheel on which society run and this thought point the way out of another contradictious puzzle that which confront my argument from the ear of a ass it roam treeless desert where no foe can approach unseen thistle make no sound why should it be adorn with ear which in they amplitude be scarcely surpass by those of the rabbit and the hare there be no answer unless they function be to hear the bray of a fellow-ass one may object that that majestic sound be surely of force to impress itself without any aid from a external ear but that be a vain argument build on the costermonger 's moke -- dreary exile from its fatherland remember that its ancestor wander on the steppe of central asia or the border of the sahara in those boundless solitude with nothing that eye can see or that common ear can hear to remind she that she be not the sole inhabitant of the universe the wild ass snuffeth up the wind in she desire and lift she windsail to the hot blast hear bear across mile of white sand and shimmering mirage the joyful reverberation of that music which tell of old comrade and boon companion scour the plain and kick up they exultant heel monkey take to tree be like the bird they scarcely need ear and so by the high road of evolution you arrive at man and the enigma of he ear it be a shrunken and shrivel remnant a moss-grown ruin a derelict ship it be to a pattern ear what the old shoe which you find in a country lane shed from the foot of some unemployed be to one of waukenphast 's five-miles-an-hour-easy boot we ought to temper we contempt for what it be with respect for what it

they day be past too and man may cut they short to match he own but the dog grow they longer than before when he first take service with man and grow careless and lazy the muscle get slack and the ear drop which be in accordance with nature then instead of be allow to wither away they have be hand over to the milliner and shaped and trim in harmony with the style of each breed of dog how it have be do be one of those mystery which will not open to the iron key of darwin but there it be for those to see who have eye -lrb- illustration : the curl of a mother 's darling -rrb- the ear of the little

have they ear starch up to look perky and i have occasionally see a dog with one ear up and the other down as if strain after the elusive idea express in the baden-powell hat all which show that one touch of nature make the whole world kin vi tommy the story of a owl among the many and various stranger within my gate who have help to enliven the day of my exile tommy be one towards whom i still feel a certain sense of obligation because he teach I for the first time what a owl be for tommy be a owl from any dictionary you may ascertain that a owl be a nocturnal carnivorous bird of a short stout form with downy feather and a large head and if that do not satisfy you there be no lack of book which will furnish fuller and more precise description but description can not impart acquaintance i have seek acquaintance and have gain some knowledge such as book can not supply not only of owl in general but of that particular species of owl to which tommy belong who in the heraldry of ornithology be _ carine brahma _ a indian spotted owlet this branch of the ancient family of owl have always be eccentric it do not mope and to the moon complain it flout the moon and the sun and everyone who pass by show its round face at its door and even come out at odd time of the day to stare and bob and play the clown it do not cry tuwhoo tuwhoo as the poet would have it but laugh jabber squeak and chant clamorous duet with its spouse all this i know i have also gather from he public appearance that a spotted owlet be happy in he domestic life and that he be fond of fat white ant for when they winged swarm be fly i have see he make short flight from he perch in a tree and catch they with he foot and i believe that he feed in secret on mouse and lizard but all that do not amount to understand a owl as i discover when tommy become a member of we chummery tommy be bear in the second city of the british empire to wit bombay in the month of march 1901 he birthplace be a hole in a old coral tree domestic life in that hole be not conduct with regularity meal be at uncertain hour and uncertain also in they quantity and quality the parent be hunter and be absent for long period and though there be incredible shouting and laughter when they return they come at such irregular time that we do not suspect that they be permanent resident and have a family one night however tommy be precocious and as we discover afterwards keen on see life take advantage of parental absence to clamber to the entrance of the nursery and lose he balance topple over into the garden he keep cool however and try to conceal himself but hurree the malee water the plant early in the morning spy he lie with he face on the earth and bring he to we he seem dead but he be very much alive as appear when he be make to sit up and turn those wonderful eye of he upon we he be a droll little object at that time nearly globular in form and cover with down like a toy for child to play with he head turn like a revolving lighthouse and flare those eye upon you wherever you go great luminous orb black-centred and gold-ringed and full of silent wonder or i should rather say surprise this never leave he to the last everything that present itself to he gaze though he have see it a hundred time seem to fill he with fresh surprise nothing ever become familiar what a enviable cast of mind it must make the brightness of childhood perennial there be some discussion as to how tommy should be feed and we finally decide that one should try to open the small hooked beak whose point could just be detect protrude from a nest of fluff while another hold a piece of raw meat ready to pop in it do not look a easy job but we have scarcely set about it when tommy himself solve the difficulty by pluck the meat out of we finger and swallow it this early intimation that however absent he might look he be all there be never belie and there be no further difficulty about the feeding of he when he see we come he always fall into the same ridiculous attitude with he face in the dust but we just pick he up and stand he on he proper end and show he the meat and he bashfulness vanish at once after sunset he would get lively and begin call for he mother in a strange husky voice at this time we would let he out in the garden watch he closely for if he think he be alone he would sneak away slyly then make a run for liberty hobble along at a good rate with the aid of he wing though he never attempt to fly as yet when detect and overtake he fall on he face as before one memorable day he find a hole in a stone wall and before we could stop he he be in the hole be too small to admit a hand though not a rat or a snake so the prospect be gloomy suddenly a happy inspiration come to I that sad husky cry with which he express he need of a mother be not difficult to mimic and he might be cheat into think that a lose brother or sister be look for he i retire and make the attempt and hark a faint echo come from the wall at each repetition it become clearer until the round face and great eye appear at the mouth of the hole then the round body tumble out and little tommy be hobble about look with pathetic eagerness for the old familiar face when he discover how he have be betray he face go down and he suffer himself to be carry quietly to the canary 's cage in which he be keep it seem to be time now to begin tommy 's education for i judge that if he have be at home he would ere then have be get nightly lesson in the poacher 's art so i procure a small gecko one of those gray house lizard with pellet at the end of they toe which come down from the roof after the lamp be light and gorge themselves on the foolish moth and plant bug that come to the light secure it with a thin cord tie round its waist i introduce it into tommy 's cage he look surprised very much surprised he raise himself to he full height he gaze at it he curtsey he give a little jump and be stand with both foot on the lizard a moment more and the lizard be glide down he throat with my thin cord after it mr seton thompson would have we believe that all young thing be laboriously train by they parent just like human child and if he be a eye-witness of all the scene that he describe so vividly it must be so with other young thing but he do not know tommy who be the bird of minerva and evidently spring into be like he patron goddess with all he armor on after a time when he have exchange he infant down for a suit of feather he be promote to a large cage out in the garden and he regular diet be a little raw meat or a mutton bone tie to one of he perch but by way of a treat i would offer he whenever i could get it a locust or large grasshopper he way of accept this be unique and pretty he would look surprised stare curtsey once or twice stare again and then suddenly noiselessly and as lightly as a fairy flit across the cage and without alight pluck the insect from my finger with both he foot and return to he perch why he bow to he food and to everybody and everything that present itself before he be a riddle that i never solve a materialistic friend suggest that he be adjust the focus of he wonderful eye and the action be certainly like that of a optician examine a lens but i feel that there be something more ceremonial about it this punctiliousness cost he he dinner once i be curious to know what he would do with a mouse so have catch one alive i slip it quietly into he cage he be more surprised than ever before raise himself erect bow to the earth once twice and three time stare bow again and so on until to he evident astonishment and chagrin the mouse find a opening and be go the lesson be not lose a few day later i get another mouse to which he begin to do obeisance as before but very soon and suddenly though as softly as fall snow he plump upon it with both foot and spread he wing on the ground look all round he with infinite satisfaction the mouse squeak but he stop that by crack its skull quietly with he beak then he gather himself up and fly to the perch with he prize one thing i note about tommy most emphatically he never show a sign of affection or what be call attachment he maintain a strictly bow acquaintance with I he be not afraid but he would suffer no familiarity he would come and eat with due ceremony out of my hand but if i offer to touch he he be surprised and affronted and go off at once when i move to another house i find that i could not continue to keep he so i send he to the zoological garden where i visit he sometimes but he never vouchsafe a token of recognition he heart be lock except to he own kin but since that time when i have see a owl even a barn owl or a great horned owl swiftly cross the sky in the darkness of night i have feel that i could accompany it in imagination on its secret quest it will arrive silently like the angel of death in a tree overlook a field in which a rat whose hour have come be furtively feed all alert and tremulous but unaware of any impending danger the rat will go on feed unconscious of the mock curtsey and the baleful eye that follow with mute attention its every motion until the hand of the clock have move to the point assign by fate and then it will feel eight sharp talon plunge into its flesh i have see the fierce dash of the sparrow hawk into a crowd of unsuspecting sparrow i know the triumph of the falcon as it rise for the final fatal swoop on the fly duck and i have watch the kestrel high in air scanning the field for some rash mouse or lizard that have wander too far from shelter the owl be also a bird of prey but its idea be different from all these vii the barn owl a friend of man a thunderstorm have burst on the common rat its complicity in the spread of the plague which have be prove up to the hilt have fill the cup of its iniquity to overflow and we have awaken to the fact that it be and always have be a arch-enemy of mankind simultaneously in widely separated part of the world a pogrom have be proclaim and the account of the massacre which come to we from great city like calcutta and bombay be appalling and almost incredible they would move to pity the most callous heart if pity could be associate with the rat but it can not the wild rat deserve that humane consideration to which all we natural fellow-creature on this earth be entitle but the domestic rat -lrb- i use this term advisedly for though man have not domesticate it it have thoroughly domesticate itself -rrb- can not justify its existence it be a fungus of civilisation if it confine itself to its natural food the farmer 's grain the tax which it levy on the country would still be such as no free people ought to endure but it confines itself to nothing as waterton say : after dine on carrion in the filthiest sink it will often manage to sup on the choicest dainty of the larder where like celoeno of old _ vestigium foeda relinquit _ it kill chicken plunder the nest of little bird devour mother egg and young murder and feed on its brother and sister and even its own offspring and not infrequently taste even man when it find he asleep the bite of a rat be sometimes very poisonous and i have have to give three month ' sick leave to a clerk who have be bite by one add to this that the rat multiply at a rate which be simply criminal rear a family of perhaps a dozen every two or three month and no further argument be need to justify the war which have be declare against it every engine of war will no doubt be bring into use trap of many kind poison cat the professional rat-catcher and a rat bacillus which if once it get a footing be expect to originate a fearful epidemic but i need not linger any more among rat which be not my subject i be write in the hope that this may be a opportune time to put in a plea for a much persecute native of this and many other country whose principal function in the economy of nature be to kill rat and mouse the barn or screech owl which be find over a great part of europe and asia and also in america be once very common in britain inhabit every ivy-mantled tower church steeple barn loft hollow tree or dovecot in which it could get a lodging but it be never welcome like the jew in the day of king john it have be relentlessly persecute by superstition ignorance and avarice avarice instigate by lady and milliner have look with covetous eye on its downy and beautiful plume while ignorance and superstition have fear and hate the owl in all country and all age in ancient rome it be a bird of evil omen foedaque fit volucri venturus nuncium luctus ignavus bubo dirum mortalibus omen in indium to-day if a owl sit on the house-top the occupant dare scarcely lie down to sleep for they know that the devil be walk the room and mark someone for death lady macbeth when about the murder of duncan start and whisper hark peace it be the owl that shriek the fatal bellman and even as late as the nineteenth century waterton 's aged housekeeper know full well what sorrow it have bring into other house when she be a young woman witch like modern lady of fashion set great value on its wing the latter stick they on they hat the witch in macbeth throw they into they boiling cauldron horace 's canidium could not complete she recipe without plumamque nocturnae strigi we may suppose that in britain these superstition be go for ever kill and bury by board school and compulsory education if they be -lrb- there be room for a _ if _ -rrb- they have be succeed by a worse the superstition of gamekeeper and farmer it be worse in effect because these man have gun which they predecessor have not and it be more wicked because it be found on a ignorance for which there be no excuse how little harm the barn owl be likely to do game may be infer from the fact that when it make its lodging in a dovecot the pigeon suffer no concern waterton -lrb- and no better authority could be quote -rrb- scout the idea common among farmer that its business there be to eat the pigeon ' egg they lay the saddle he say on the wrong horse they ought to put it on the rat he predecessor in the estate have allow the owl to be destroy and the rat to multiply and there be few young pigeon in the dovecot waterton take strong measure to exterminate the rat but build breed place for the owl and the dovecot which they constantly frequent become prolific again but grant that the owl do twice the injury to game with which they be credit it would be repay many time over by they service waterton well say that if we know its utility in thin the country of mouse it would be with we what the ibis be with the egyptian -- a sacred bird he examine the pellet eject by a pair of owl that occupy a ruin gateway on the estate every pellet contain skeleton of from four to seven mouse owl it may be necessary to explain swallow they food without separate flesh from bone skin and hair and afterwards disgorge the indigestible portion roll up into little ball in sixteen month the pair of owl above-mentioned have accumulate a deposit of more than a bushel of these pellet each a funeral urn of from four to seven mouse in the old portuguese fort of bassein in western indium i notice that the earth at the foot of a ruin tower be plentifully mix with small skull jaw and other bone take home a handful and examine they i find that they be the remains of rat mouse and muskrat the owl kill small bird large insect frog and even fish but these be extra : its profession be rat-catching and mousing and only those who have a very intimate personal acquaintance with it know how peculiarly its equipment and method be adapt to this work the falcon give open chase to the wild duck keep above it if possible until near enough for a last spurt then it come down at a speed which be terrific and striking the duck from above dash it to the ground the sparrow hawk plunge unexpectedly into a group of little bird and nip up one with a long outstretched foot before they have time to get clear of each other the harrier skim over field copse and meadow suddenly round corner and top fence and surprising small bird or mouse on which it drop before they have recover from they surprise the owl do none of these thing for one thing it hunt in the night when its sight be keenest and rat be abroad feed its flight be almost noiseless and yet marvellously light and rapid when it please sailing over field lane and hedgerow and examine the ground as it go it find a likely place and take a post of observation on a fence perhaps or a sheaf of corn here it sit bolt upright all eye it see a rat emerge from the grass and advance slowly as it feed into open ground there be no hurry for the doom of that rat be already fix so the owl just sit and watch till the right moment have arrive then it flit swiftly softly silently across the intervene space and drop like a flake of snow without warn or suspicion of danger the rat feel eight sharp claw bury in its flesh it protest with frantic squeal but these be stop with a nip that crunch its skull and the owl be away with it to the old tower where the hungry child be call with weird impatient hiss for something to eat the owl do not hunt the field and hedgerow only it go to all place where rat or mouse may be reconnoitre farmyard barn and dwelling house and boldly enter open window sometimes it hover in the air like a kestrel scanning the ground below and though its regular hunting hour be from dusk till dawn it have be see at work as late as nine or ten on a bright summer morning but the vulgar boy of bird society be fond of mob it when it appear abroad by day and it dislike publicity the barn owl lay its egg in the place which it inhabit there be usually a thick bed of pellet on the floor and it consider no other nest needful the egg be say to be lay in pair there may be two four or six of different egg in the nest and perhaps a young one or two at the same time egg be find from April or even march till June or July and there be sometimes at any rate a second brood as late as November or December this owl do not hoot but screech a weird and ghostly voice it be from which accord to ovid the bird have its latin name strix -lrb- pronounced streex probably at that time -rrb- est illi strigibus noman sed nominis hujus causa quod horrenda stridere nocte silent it be a sound which come suddenly out of the darkness might well start fear and foreboding in the dark and guilty mind of untutored man which would not be dispel by a nearer view of the strange object from which they proceed white ghostly upright spindle-shaped and biggest at the top where two great orb flare like fiery bull 's - eye from the centre of two round white target it stand solemn and speechless you approach nearer and it fall into fearsome pantomimic attitude and grimace like a clown try to frighten a child and now a new horror have be add to the barn owl the numerous letter which appear in _ the time _ and be summarise with comment by sir t digby pigott cb in _ the contemporary review _ of July 1908 leave no reasonable room for doubt that this bird sometimes become brightly luminous and be the will-o ' - the-wisp for believe in which we be deride we forefather all thing consider i can not withhold my sympathy and some respect for the superstition of aged housekeeper roman and indian for that of gamekeeper and farmer i have neither all we new scheme of nature study will surely deserve the reproach of futility if in the next generation every farmhouse in england have not its own owl tower for the encouragement of this friend of man viii domestic animal long before jubal become the father of all such as handle the harp and the organ and tubalcain the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron abel be a keeper of sheep but the sacred writer have not inform we how he first catch they and tame they if we consult other record of the infancy of the human race they reveal as little when the egyptian begin to portray they daily life on stone 6000 or 7000 year ago they already have cattle and sheep goose and duck and dog and plenty of ass though not horse they get these from the assyrian who have use they in they chariot long before they begin to record anything further back than this we have no one to question except those shadowy man of the stone age who have leave we heap of they implement but none of they bone they be not so careful of the bone of horse which lie in thousand about the precinct of they untidy village but not a scrawl on a bit of a mammoth tusk have be find to indicate whether these be ridden and drive or only hunt and eat why should it be record that cadmus invent letter why should we inquire who first make gunpowder and glass why should every schoolboy be teach that watt be the inventor of the steam engine can any of these be put in the scale as benefactor of we race with the man who first train a horse to carry he on its back or draw milk with he hand from the udder of a cow the familiarity of the thing have make we callous to the wonder of it let we put it before we like a painting or a statue and have a good look at it there be a farmhouse any common farmhouse just one of the molecule that constitute the mass of we wholesome country life a horse be be harness for the plough : its ancestor sniff the wind on the steppe of tartary meek cow be stand to be milk : when primitive man first know they in they native forest he use to give they a wide berth for he flint arrow fall harmless off they tough hide and they be fierce exceedingly a cock be crow on the fence as if the whole farm belong to himself : he ought to be skulk in a indian jungle the sheep have no business here they place be on the rocky mountain of asia as for the dog it be difficult to assign it a country for it own no wild kindred in any part of the world but it ought at least to be worry the sheep if there be a ass it be a native of abyssinium and the turkey be american the cat derive its descent from a egyptian but all these be of one country now and of one religion they know no home nor desire any except the farmhouse in which they be bear and breed and the lord of it be they lord to whom they look for food and protection and what would he do without they what should we do without they it be impossible to conceive that life could be carry on if we be deprive of these obedient and uncomplaining servant high civilisation have be attain without steam engine education as we use the term now be superfluous -- runjeet singh the lion of the punjab could neither read nor write the human race have prosper and multiply without the knowledge of iron but we know of no time when man do without domestic animal it be vain to speculate how the thing first come about whether the sportive anthropoid ape take to ride on a wild goat before he emerge as a man keep flock or whether some great pioneer destine to be worship in after age as a demigod show he fellow how the wild calf if take young might be train into tractable slave and it be hopeless to expect that any record will now leap to light which will give we knowledge in place of speculation but it might not be unprofitable to seek for some clue to the strange selection which the domesticate genius of man have make from among the multifarious material present to it by the animal kingdom if we do so we shall almost be force to the conclusion that domesticability be a character or quality inherent in some animal and entirely want in other let we begin with pigeon a very large group but one that show more unity than any of the other order into which naturalist divide bird it embrace turtle dove of many species wood pigeon ground pigeon fruit pigeon and some strange form like the great crown pigeon of victorium of all these only one the common blue rock have be domesticate the ring dive of asia have be keep as a cage bird for so long that a permanent albino and also a fawn-coloured variety have be establish and be more common in aviary than bird of the natural color but the ring dive have not become a domestic fowl and never will in this instance there be a plausible explanation for the blue rock unlike the rest of the tribe nest and roost in hole and be also gregarious therefore if provide with accommodation of the kind it require it will form a permanent settlement and remain with we on the same term as the honey bee while the ring dive not care for a fix home must be confine however tame it may become or it will wander and be lose but this explanation will not fit other case what a multitude of wild duck there be in scotland and every other country mallard pintail gadwall widgeon pochard and teal all very much alike in they habit and taste but of they all only one species and that a migratory one the mallard have be persuade to abandon its wander way and settle down to a life of ease and obesity as a dependant of man in indium there be a duck of the same genus as the mallard know as the spotted-billed duck -lrb- _ ana poecilorhynchus _ -rrb- which be as large as the mallard and quite as tasty and be moreover not migratory but remain and breed in the country but it have not be domesticate : the tame duck in indium as here be all mallard the muscovy duck be a distinct species which have be domesticate elsewhere and introduce from the duck let we turn to the hen the partridge grouse and pheasant be all dainty bird but if we desire to eat they we must shoot they or -lrb- _ proh pudor _ -rrb- snare they plover 's egg be worth four shilling a dozen but we must seek they on the moor the bird that have covenant to accept we food and protection and lay they egg for we use and rear they young for we to kill be descend from _ gallus bankivus _ the jungle fowl of eastern indium how they come here history record not : perhaps the gipsy bring they they appear now in strange and diverse guise the ponderous and feather-legged cochin-china the clean-limbed and wiry game the crested houdan the minorca with its monstrous comb and the puny bantam in japan there be a breed that carry a tail seven or eight foot in length which have to be do regularly like a lady 's hair to keep it from dirt and damage but however they outward aspect may differ they be of the same blood and know it a featherweight bantam cock will stand up to a elephantine brahma and fight he accord to the rule of the ring and next minute pay compliment to he lady in language which she will be at no loss to understand and if the artificial condition of they life be remove they would soon all lapse alike to the image of the stock from which they be spring this be well illustrate in a show case in the south kensington museum exhibit a group of fowl from pitcairn 's island these be descend from some stock land by the mutinous crew of hm _ bounty _ in 1790 which run wild and in a century they have go back to the small size and lithe figure and almost to the game color of the wild bird from which they branch off before history dawn if we turn next to the ruminant the clean beast which chew the cud and divide the hoof the puzzle become harder still deer and antelope be often keep as pet and become so tame that they be allow to wander at liberty in egypt herd of gazelle be so keep before the day of cheop in indium i have know a black buck which regularly attend the station cricket ground move among the nervous player with its nose in the air and insolence in its gait fully aware that eighteen-inch horn with very sharp point insure respectful treatment mr sterndale train a neilghaus to go in harness the great bovine antelope of africa would become as tame and there be no reason to suppose that they beef and milk would not be as good as those of the cow but no antelope or deer appear ever to have be domesticate with the exception of the reindeer of the other ruminant the ox buffalo yak goat sheep and a few other be domestic animal while the bison and the gaur or so-called indian bison and a large number of wild goat and sheep have be neglect the buffalo and yak have probably come under the yoke in comparatively recent time for they be little changed but the goat and still more the sheep have undergo a wonderful transformation within and without who could recognize in a leicester ewe the wary denizen of precipitous mountain which will not feed until it have set a sentinel to give warn if danger approach and here be a curious fact which have scarcely be notice by naturalist the original of we goat be suppose to be the persian ibex at any rate it be a ibex of some species as its horn plainly show but on the plain of northern indium under range of hill on which the persian ibex wander wild the common domestic goat be a very different animal from that of europe and have peculiar spiral horn of the same pattern as the markhor another grand species of wild goat which draw eager hunter to the higher reach of the same mountain from this it would appear that two species of wild goat have be domesticate and keep to some extent distinct one eventually find its way westward but not eastward and southward the indian humped cattle also differ so widely in form structure and voice from those of europe that there can scarcely be a doubt of they descent from distinct species but both have entirely disappear as wild animal unless indeed the white cattle of chillingham be really descendant of caesar 's dreadful urus and not merely domestic cattle lapse into savagery so have the camel and with a similar possible exception the horse be the whole race in each of these case subjugate or exterminate and that by uncivilised man with he primitive weapon there be no analogy here with the extinction of such animal as the mammoth for the ox be a beast in every way fit to live and thrive in the present condition of this world as much so as the buffalo and the indian bison which show no sign of approach extinction we father easily get rid of the difficulty by assume that noah never release these species after the flood but what shall those do who can not believe in the literality of noah 's ark as for the dog its domestication have be the creation of a new species the material be perhaps the wolf more likely the jackal but possibly a blend of more than one species but a dog be now a dog and neither a wolf nor a jackal a mastiff a pug a collie a greyhound a pariah all recognize each other and observe the same rule of etiquette when they meet we must admit however that whatever pliability of disposition or other inherent suitability lead to the first domestication of certain species of animal the change induce in they nature by many generation of domesticity have make they amenable to man 's control to a degree which put a wide difference between they and they wild relation a wild ass though bring up from its birth in a stable would make a very intractable costermonger 's moke we may infer from this that the first subjugation of each of we common domestic animal be the achievement of some genius or of some tribe favourably situate and that they spread from that center by sale or barter rather than that they be separately domesticate in many place this would partly explain why a few species of widely different family be so universally keep in all country to the exclusion of hundred of species nearly ally and apparently as suitable when a want could be supply by obtain from another country a animal breed to live with man and serve he the long and difficult task of soften down the wild instinct of a beast take from the forest or the hill and acclimatise its constitution to a domestic life be not likely to be attempt but there have be a few recent addition to we list of domestic animal the turkey and the guinea fowl be example and perhaps within another generation we may be able to add the zebra and there may be many other animal fit to enrich and adorn human life which would make no insuperable resistance to domestication if wisely and patiently handle here be a noble opening for carry out in its kindest sense the command multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the earth ix snake i have meet person otherwise quite sane who tell I that they would like to visit indium if it be not for the _ snake _ now there be something very depressing in the thought that this state of mind be extant in england for it be calculate on occasion to have result of a most melancholy nature by way of example let we picture the case of a broken-hearted maiden force to reject a ardent lover because duty call he to a land where there be snake think of he happiness blighted for ever and she doom to a perpetual maidenhood harrow with remorseful dream of the hourly peril and horror through which he must be pass without she and dread to enter a academy or picture-gallery lest a laocoon or a fury might revive apprehension too horrible to be bear in view of possibility so dreadful surely it be a duty that a man owe to he kind to disseminate the truth if he can about the present condition in the east of that reptile which crawl on its belly and eat dust and have its head bruise by the descendant of eve sometimes pay off she share of the curse on they heel here the truth be within the limit of we indian empire include burmah and ceylon there be at present know to naturalist two hundred and sixty-four species of snake twenty-seven of these be sea-serpent which never leave the sea and could not if they would the remain two hundred and thirty-seven species comprise sample of every size and pattern of limbless reptile find on this globe from the gigantic python which crush a jackal and swallow it whole to the little burrow _ typhlop _ whose proportion be those of a earthworm and its food white ant if you have make up you mind never to touch a snake or go nearer to one than you can help then i need scarcely tell you what you know already that these be all alike hideous and repulsive in they aspect be smear from head to tail with a viscous and venomous slime which as you shakespeare will tell you leave a trail even on fig-leaf when they have occasion to pass over such this preparation would appear to line they inside as well as out for there be no lack of ancient and modern testimony to the fact that they slaver they prey all over before swallow it that it may slide the more easily down they ghastly throat they eye be cruel and stony and possess a peculiar property know as fascination which place they victim entirely at they mercy they have also the power of coil themselves up like a watch-spring and discharge themselves from a considerable distance at those whom they have doom to death -- a fact which be attest by such passage in the poet as -- like adder dart from he coil and by traveller _ passim _ this be the true faith with respect to all serpent and if you be resolve to remain steadfast in it you may do so even in indium for it be possible to live in that country for month i might almost say year without ever get a sight of a live snake except in the basket of a snake-charmer if however you be mind to cultivate a acquaintance with they it be not difficult to find opportunity of do so but i must warn you that it will be with jeopardy to you faith for the very first thing that will strike you about they will probably be they cleanness what have become of the classical slime i can not tell but it be a fact that the skin of a modern snake be always delightfully dry and clean and as smooth to the touch as velvet the next thing that attract attention be they beauty not so much the beauty of they color as of they form with few exception snake be the most graceful of live thing every position into which they put themselves and every motion of they perfectly proportioned form be artistic the effect of this be enhance by they gentleness and the softness of they movement but if you want to see they properly you must be careful not to frighten they for there be no creature more timid at heart than a snake one will sometimes let you get quite near to it and watch it simply because it do not notice you be rather deaf and very shortsighted but when it do discover you presence its one thought be to slip away quietly and hide itself it be on account of this extreme timidity that we see they so seldom of the two hundred and thirty-seven kind that i have refer to some be of course very rare or only find in particular part of the country but at least forty or fifty of they occur everywhere and some be as plentiful as crow yet they keep themselves out of we way so successfully that it be quite a rare event to meet with one occasionally one find its way into a house in quest of frog lizard musk-rat or some other of the numerous malefactor that use we dwelling as city of refuge from the avenger and it be discover by the hamal behind a cupboard or under a carpet he do the one thing which it occur to a native to do in any emergency -- viz raise a alarm then there be a general hubbub servant rush together with the longest stick they can find the child be hurry away to a place of safety the master appear on the scene arm with he gun and the wee sleekit cowrin ' tim ` rous beastie try to slip away from the fuss which it dislike so much be head and blow or batter to piece then its head be pound to a jelly for the servant be agree that if this precaution be omit it will revive during the night and come and coil itself on the chest of its murderer finally a council be hold and a unanimous resolution record that decease be a serpent of the deadliest kind this be not a lie for they believe it but in the great majority of case it be a untruth of we two hundred and thirty-seven kind of snake only forty-four be rank by naturalist as venomous and many of these be quite incapable of kill any animal as large as a man other be very rare or local in short we may reckon the poisonous snake with which we have any practical concern at four kind and the chance of a snake find in the house belong to one of these kind stand at less than one in ten it be a sufficiently terrible thought however that there be even four kind of reptile go silently about the land whose bite be certain death if they know they power and be maliciously disposed we life in the east would be like christian 's progress through the valley of the shadow of death but the poisonous snake be just as timid as the rest and as little inclined to act on the offensive against any live creature except the little animal on which they prey even a trodden worm will turn and a snake have as much spirit as a worm if a man tread on it it will turn and bite he but it have no desire to be trodden on it do its best to avoid that mischance and i need scarcely say so do a man unless he be drunk when both party be sincerely anxious to avoid a collision a collision be not at all likely to occur and the fact be that of all form of death to which we be expose in indium death by snake-bite be about the one which we have least reason to apprehend during a pretty long residence in indium i have hear of only one instance of a englishman be kill by a snake it be in manipur and i read of it in the newspaper during the same time i have hear of only one death by lightning and one by fall into the ferment vat of a brewery so i suppose these accident be equally uncommon eating oyster be much more fatal : i have hear of at least four or five death from that cause the native be far more expose to danger from snake than we be because they go barefoot by night as well as day through field and along narrow overgrown footpath about they village the tread of a barefooted man do not make noise enough to warn a snake to get out of he way and if he tread on one there be nothing between its fang and he skin again the hut of the native be make of wattle and daub and thatched with straw offer to snake just the kind of shelter that they like and the wonder be that naked man sleep on the ground in such place and poke about dark corner among they store of fuel and other chattel meet with so few accident it say a great deal for the mild and inoffensive nature of the snake still the total number of death by snake-bite report every year be very large and look absolutely appalling if you do not think of divide it among three hundred million treat in that way it shrivel up at once and when compare with the result of other cause of death look quite insignificant the native themselves be so far from regard the serpent tribe with we feeling that the deadliest of they all have be canonise and be treat with all the respect due to a sub-deity no brahmin or religious-minded man of any respectable caste will have a cobra kill on any account if one take to haunt he premise he will propitiate it with offering of silk and look for good luck from its patronage about snake other than the cobra the average native concern himself so little that he do not know one from another by sight they be all class together as _ janwar _ a word which answer exactly to the venomous beast of act xxviii 4 and though they be aware that some be deadly and some be not any particular snake that a _ sahib _ have have the honor to kill be one of the deadliest as a matter of course i have never meet a native who know that a venomous snake could be distinguish by its fang except a few doctor and educate man who have imbibe western science in fact they do not think of the venom as a material substance situate in the mouth it be a effluence from the entire animal which may be project at a man in various way by bite he or spit at he or give he a flick with the tail the government of indium spend a large sum of money every year in reward for the destruction of snake this be one of those sacrifice to sentiment which every prudent government offer the sentiment to which respect be pay in this case be of course british not indian indian sentiment be propitiate by not levy any tax on dog so the pariah cur own and disown in all stage of starvation mange and disease infest every town and village lie in wait for the bacillus of rabies against the one fatal case of snake-bite mention above i have know of at least half a dozen death among englishman from the more horrible scourge of hydrophobia in the steamer which bring I home there be two private soldier on they way to m pasteur at the expense of course of the british government x the indian snake-charmer we must wait for another month or two before we can think of the winter in this country in the past tense but in indium the month of march be the beginning of the hot season and the tourist who have be enjoy the pleasant side of anglo-indian life and assure themselves that they exile countryman have not much to grumble at will now be make haste to flee during the month the various hotel of bombay will be pretty familiar with the gray sun-hat fortify with _ puggaree _ and pendent flap which be the sign of the globe-trotter in the east and all the tribe of bird of prey who look upon he as they lawful spoil will recognize the sign from afar and gather about he as he sit in the balcony after breakfast take he last view of the gorgeous east and perhaps -lrb- it be to be fear -rrb- seek inspiration for a few matured reflection wherewith to bring the forthcoming book to a impressive close the vendor of delhus jewellery will be there and the sind-work-box-wallum with he small compress white turban and spotless robe and the cashmere shawl merchant and many more press on the gentleman 's notice for the last time they most tempting wares and prepare for the long bout of fence which will decide at what point between ask price and selling price each article shall change ownership the distance between these two point be wide and variable depend upon the indication of wealth about the purchaser 's person and the indication of innocence about he countenance and when the poor globe-trotter who have long since spend more money than he ever mean to spend and loaded himself with thing which he could have get cheaper in london or new york try to shake off he tormentor by get up and lean over the balcony rail the shrill voice of the snake-charmer will assail he from below promise he in a torrent of sonorous hindustanee variegate with pigeon english and illuminate with wild gesticulation such a superfine _ tamasha _ as it never be the fortune of the _ sahib _ to witness before _ tamasha _ be one of those indian word like _ bundobust _ for which there be no equivalent in the english language and which be at once so comprehensive and so expressive that when once the use of they have be acquire they become indispensable so that they have gain a permanent place in the anglo-indian 's vocabulary it be not slang but a good word of ancient origin hobson-jobson quote a curious latin writer on the empire of the grand mogul who use it with a definition append ut spectet thamasham id est pugna elephantorum leonum buffalorum et aliarura ferarum show come nearest it in english but fall far short of it the _ tamasha _ which the snake-charmer promise the _ sahib _ will include serpent dance a fight between a cobra and a mungoose the inevitable mango tree and other trick of juggling but to a stranger the snake-charmer himself be a better _ tamasha _ than anything he can show he be indeed a most extraordinary animal he hair and beard be long and unkempt he general aspect wild he clothing a mixture of savagery and the wreckage of civilisation he wear a turban of course and generally a large one but it be put on without art just wind about he head anyhow and hang lopsidedly over one ear it and the loose cloth wrap about the middle of he be as dirty as may be and truly oriental though erratic but besides these he wear a jacket of color calico or any other material with one button fasten probably on the wrong buttonhole and under this if the weather be cold he may have a shirt seemingly obtain from some indian representative of mose & co on he shoulder he carry a long bamboo from the end of which hang villainously shabby basket some flat and round occupy by snake other large and oblong fill with apparatus of jugglery the member of he family down to a unclothed precocious imp of ten accompany he carry similar basket or capacious wallet or long cylindrical drum on which they play with they finger the dramatic effect of the whole be enhance when one of they allow a huge python a snake of the _ boa constrictor _ tribe which kill its prey by crush it to wind its hideous speckled coil round he body what the snake-charmer be by race or origin ethnologist may determine when they have do with the gipsy he be not a hindu no particular part of the country acknowledge he as its native he be to the great race caste and creed of indium what the waif be to the billow of the sea he language in public at least be hindustanee but this be a sort of _ lingua franca _ the common property of all the inhabitant of the country he religion be probably one of the many form of demon worship which grow rank on the fringe of hinduism he must be class no doubt with the other wander tribe which roam the country camping under umbrella or something little better each consecrate to some particular form of common crime and each profess some not in itself dishonest occupation like the tinkering of gipsy but the snake-charmer be the best know and most widely spread of they all by occupation he be a professor of three occult science first he be a juggler and in this art he have some skill he masterpiece be the famous mango trick which consist in make a miniature mango tree grow up in a few minute and even blossom and bear fruit out of some bare spot which he have cover with he mysterious basket it have be write about by traveller in extravagant term of astonishment and admiration but as generally perform be a extremely clumsy-looking trick though it be undoubtedly difficult to guess how it be do a more blood-curdling feat be to put the unclothed and precocious imp aforementioned under a large basket and then run a sword savagely through and through every corner of it and draw it out cover with gore when the sicken spectator be about to lynch the murderer the imp run in smile from the garden gate the connection between these performance and the man 's second trade namely snake-charming be not obvious to a western mind but it must be remember that the snake-charmer be not a mere vulgar juggler amusing people with sleight-of-hand he feat be miracle perform with the assistance of superior power in short he be a theosophist only he converse be not with excorporated mahatma from thibet but with spirit of another grade whose superior have be know from very remote antiquity as a old serpent in deference to this respectable connection the cobra hold a distinguished place even in orthodox hinduism so it be altogether fit that a performer of wonder should be on intimate term with the serpent tribe the snake-charmer keep all sort of they but chiefly cobra these he profess to charm from they hole by play upon a instrument which may have some hereditary connection with the bagpipe for it have a air-reservoir consist of a large gourd and it make a most abominable noise as soon as the cobra show itself the charmer catch it by the tail with one hand and run the other swiftly along its body grip it firmly just behind the jaw so that it can not turn and bite practice and coolness make this a easy feat then the poison fang be pull out with a pair of forceps and the cobra be quite harmless it be keep in a round flat basket out of which when the charmer remove the lid and begin to play it raise its graceful head and expand its hood sway gently in response to the music scientific man aver that a snake have no ear and can not possibly hear the strain of the pipe but that sort of science simply spoil a picturesque subject like the snake-charmer so much be certain that all snake can not be play upon in this way : there be some species which be utterly callous to the influence to which the cobra yield itself so readily no missionary will find any difficulty in get a snake-charmer to appreciate that scripture text about the deaf adder which will not listen to the voice of the charmer charm he never so wisely to these two occupation the snake-charmer add that of a medicine man for who should know the occult potency of herb and tree so well as he so as he wander from village to village he be welcome as well as fear but one wealthy tourist be worth more to he than a whole village of ryot so he keep he eye on every town in which he be likely to fall in with the travel white man and the travel white man would be sorry to miss he for he be one of the few relic of a ancient state of thing which railway and telegraph and the educational department have leave unchanged the itinerant jeweller and the sind-work-box-wallum be unmistakably be leave behind as the east hurry after the west and we shall soon know they no more showy shop where the inexperienced traveller may see all the product of sind and benare and cutch and cashmere spread before he at fix price be multiply rapidly and take the bread from the mouth of the poor hawker but the snake-charmer seem safe from that kind of competition it be difficult to forecast a time when a broad signboard in rampart row will invite the passer-by to visit mr nagshett 's world-renowned serpent tamasha mungoose and cobra fight mango-tree illusion etc entrance one rupee xi cure for snake-bite in a little book on the snake of indium publish many year ago by dr nicholson of the madras medical service the conviction be express that the snake-charmer of burmah know of some antidote to the poison of the cobra which give they confidence in handle it he say that nothing would induce they to divulge it but that he suspect it consist in gradual inoculation with the venom itself put the question to himself why he do not attempt to attest this by experiment he reply that there be two reason which if i recollect rightly be first that he have a strong natural repugnance to anything like cruelty to animal and secondly that he have observe that as soon as a man get the notion into he head that he have discover a cure for snake-bite he begin to show symptom of insanity it be rather remarkable that after so many year another scottish doctor not in madras but in edinburgh have prove by just such experiment as dr nicholson shrink from that a aged and previously sedate horse may by gradual inoculation with cobra poison be render so thoroughly proof against it that a dose which would suffice to kill ten ordinary horse only impart increase vigor and liveliness to it further dr fraser have find that the serum of the blood of a animal thus render proof against poison be itself a antidote capable of combate that poison after it have be at work for thirty minute in the vein of a rabbit and arrest its effect and all this have be achieve without apparent detriment to the distinguished doctor 's sanity this must be intensely interesting intelligence to englishmen throughout indium and joyful intelligence too for scoff as we may at the danger of be bite by a poisonous snake nobody like to think that if such a thing _ should _ happen to he -lrb- and very narrow escape sometimes remind we that it may -rrb- there would be nothing for he to do but to lie down and die and so ever since the honorable east indium company be charter the antidote to snake poison have be a sort of philosopher 's stone seek after by doctor and man of science along many line of investigation and every now and then somebody have rise up and announce that he have find it and have have disciple for a season but one remedy after another though it might give startling result in the laboratory have prove to be useless in common life and the majority of englishman have long since resign themselves to the conclusion that there be no practical cure for the bite of a poisonous snake for what avail it to carry about in you travel bag a phial of strong ammonia and to live in more jeopardy of death by asphyxiation than you ever be by snake unless you have some guarantee that when it be you fate to be bite by a snake the phial will be at hand for ammonia must act on the venom before the venom have have time to act upon you or it will only add another pain to you end and that give only a few minute to go upon so with nitric acid and every agent that operate by neutralise the poison and not by counteract its effect and this have be the character of all the remedy hitherto put forward they be say sir joseph fayrer absolutely without any specific effect on the condition produce by the poison but anti-venene as dr fraser call he immunised blood-serum follow the poison into the system even after the fatal symptom have begin to show themselves and arrest they at once so the anglo-indian may throw away he ammonia phial and arm himself with another of anti-venene and a hypodermic syringe feel that he be safe against a accident which will never happen as for the man who be not nervous he will speak of the new antidote and think of it as most interesting and valuable and go on he way as before with no expectation of ever be bite by a venomous snake the medical man of every degree will order a supply as soon as it be to be have and conscientiously try to stamp out the smoulder hope within he that somebody in the station will soon be bite by a cobra and give he a chance among the dusky million of indium dr fraser 's discovery will create no catholic ravishment because they will not hear of it and if they do hear of it they would regard he labor as misapply and the result as superfluous for the hindu have never share the englishman 's opinion that there be no cure for snake-bite on the contrary he be assure that there be not one or two but many specifics for the bite of every kind of snake know to those whose business it be to know they if they be not invariably efficacious it be for the simple reason that if a man 's time have come to die he will die but if he time have not come to die they will not fail to cure he and since no man can know when he be bite whether he time have come or not he will lay the odds against fate by try not one or another of they but as many as he can hear of or get some of they be drastic in they effect and so it too often prove that the poor man 's time have indeed come for though he might survive the snake he succumb to the cure it be many year now since the news be bring to I one day that a man whom i know very well have be bite by a deadly serpent and be die he be a fine strongly build young fellow a mohammedan in the employ of a parsee liquor distiller in whose godown he be arrange firewood when he be bite in the foot without look at the snake he rush out and fall on he face on the ground implore the bystander to take care of he wife and child as he be a dead man the news spread and all the village run together the man be take to a open room in he employer 's premise and vigorous measure for he recovery be set on foot in which he employer 's family and servant he own friend and as many of the general public as choose to look in be allow to take part first of all some jungle man be call in for the man of the jungle must naturally know more about snake than other man these be probably katkurree a aboriginal race who live by woodcut hunting and other sylvan occupation they prove to be practical man and at once suck the wound a intelligent havildar of the custom department who chance to be present then lance the wound slightly to let the blood flow and tie the leg tightly in two place above it this be admirable if what the jungle man and the havildar do be always and promptly do whenever a man be bite by a snake few such accident would end fatally but this poor man 's friend do not stop there a supply of chicken have be procure with all haste and these be scientifically apply this be a remedy in which the native have great faith and i have know european who be convince of its efficacy the manner of its application scarcely admit of description in these page but the effect be that the chicken absorb the poison and die while the man live the number of chicken require be a gauge of the virulence of the serpent for as soon as the venom be all extract they cease to die nobody however could tell I how many chicken perish in this case they be all too busy to stop and note the result of one remedy while another remain untried and there be many yet somebody suggest that the venom should be dislodge from the patient 's stomach so a emetic be administer in the form of a handful of common salt with immediate and seismic effect then a decoction of _ neem _ leave be pour down the man 's throat the _ neem _ tree be a enemy of all fever and a friend of man generally so much so that it be healthful to sleep under its shade therefore a decoction of the leaf could not fail to be beneficial in one way or another the residue of the leaf be well rub into the crown of the man 's head for more direct effect on the brain in case they might be affect something else be rub in under the root of the tongue in the meantime a man with some experience in exorcism have bring twig of a tree of well-ascertained potency in expel the devil and advise that in view of the known connection between serpent and satan it would be well to try beat the patient with these the advice be take and many stripe be lay upon he massage be also try and other homely expedient such as bandaging and thump with the fist be not neglect it be about noon when i be tell of the accident and i go down at once and find the poor man in a woeful state as well he might be after such rough handling as he have suffer for four consecutive hour but he be quite conscious and there be neither pain nor swell in the bitten foot i remonstrate most vigorously point out that the snake which nobody have see might not have be a venomous one at all that there be no symptom of poisoning except such as might also be explain by the treatment the man have suffer at the hand of he friend and that in short i could see no reason to think he be go to die unless they be determine to kill he my word appear to produce a good effect on the parsee at least and they consent to stop cure the man and let he rest give he such stimulate refreshment as he would take for he be a pious mussulman and would not touch wine or spirit i say what i could to cheer he up and go away hope that i have save a human life alas in a hour or so a friend come in with a root of rare virtue and persuade the man to swallow some preparation of it _ post hoc _ whether _ propter hoc _ i dare not say he become unconscious and sink before night he be bury all this do not happen in some obscure village in a remote jungle it happen within a mile and a half of a town control by a municipal corporation which enjoy the rights and privilege of local self-government in that town there be a dispensary with a very capable assistant-surgeon in charge and in that dispensary i doubt not you would have find a bottle of strong _ liquor ammoniæ _ and a print copy of the direction issue by a paternal government for the recovery of person bite by venomous serpent but when the man be bite the one thing which occur to nobody be to take he there and when i hear of the matter the assistant-surgeon have just leave for a distant place pass on he way the gate of the house in which the man lay this be a bad case but there be little reason to hope that it be altogether exceptional i be afraid there can be no question at all that hundred of the death put down to snake-bite by village punchayet every year might with more truth be register as cure to death xii the cobra bungalow a story of a moneylender beharil surajmul be the greatest moneylender in dowlutpoor he be a man of rare talent he remember the face of every man who have at any time come to borrow money of he since he begin to work as a little boy in he father 's office so that it be impossible to deceive he he have also such a miraculous skill in the make out of account that a poor man who have come to he in extremity for a loan of fifty rupee to meet the expense of he daughter 's marriage might go on make payment for the remainder of he life without reduce the debt by one rupee in fact it seem to increase with each payment and if the matter go into court beharilal never fail to show that there be still a balance due to he much larger than the original loan but so courteous and pleasant be the seth in he manner to all that such matter never go into court until the right time of which he be a infallible judge for he know the private affair of every family in dowlutpoor then a decree be obtain and the debtor 's house or land be sell to defray the debt beharilal himself be usually the purchaser though not of course in he own name for he be a prudent man by these means beharilal have become possess of large estate which he manage with such skill that they yield to he revenue which they have never yield to the former owner of they while he tenant who be mostly former owner grow daily more deeply involve in they pecuniary obligation to he and therefore entertain no thought of leave he for he could put they into prison any day if he choose they contentment give he great satisfaction and he treat they with benevolence give they advance of money for all they necessary expense and appropriate the whole of they crop at the harvest to repay himself he bind they to buy all that they have need of at he shop so that he make profit off they on both side and as he wealth increase he person increase with it and he appearance become more impose so that he be regard everywhere with the highest respect and esteem he be moreover a very religious man and charitable beyond most by early riser he might be see in he garden seek out the nest of ant and give they with he own hand they daily dole of rice it be he benevolent thoughtfulness which have supply drinking trough for the flock of pigeon that continually plunder the store of the other grain merchant he have also establish a pinjrapole for aged sickly and ownerless animal of all kind to this he require all he tenant to send they bullock when they become unfit for work and he sell they new cattle good and strong at price fix by himself if any of he old debtor when reduce to beggary come to he door for alms they be never send away without a handful of rice or a copper coin he keep a bag of the smallest copper coin always at hand for such purpose beharilal have a fine house design by himself and surround by a vast garden stock with mango guava custard apple orange and other fruit tree and make beautiful and fragrant with all manner of flower the cool shade draw together bird of many kind from the dry plain of the surrounding country and it pleased beharilal to think that they also be recipient of he bounty and that the benefit which he confer on they would certainly be enter to the credit of he account with heaven some he feed such as the crow which flock about the back door like a convocation of christian padre in the morning and afternoon when the lady of he family give out they portion of boil rice and ghee the pigeon also come together in hundred in a open space under the shade of a noble peepul tree where grain be throw out for they at three o'clock every day and among they be many chatter sparrow and not a few green parrot which walk quaintly among the bustling pigeon they long tail move from side to side like the pointer of the scale on which the bunium weigh he rupee this resemblance strike he as he recline against the fat red cushion in he verandah sum up he gain there be other bird which would not eat he food but find abundance suit to they respective caste among the shrub and tree that he have plant myna walk eagerly on the lawn look for grasshopper glitter sunbird hover over the flower thrust they slender bill into each nectar-laden blossom bulbul twitter among the mulberry and the koel make the shady banian tree resound with its melodious note in a remote corner of the garden under the dark shade of a tamarind there stand a small shrine like a whitewashed tomb with a niche or recess on one side of it contain a conical stone smear with red ochre some call it mahadeo and some khandoba but no one could explain the presence of a mahratta god in a bunium 's garden in dowlutpoor except by quote a old tradition about one narayen who have come from the mahratta country and live for many year in this place some say he be a prosperous goldsmith of great piety but other maintain that he be a sunyasee or saint and there be no certainty in the matter the one point on which all be agree be the great sanctity of the shrine and beharilal be most careful to perform at it every ceremony which custom or tradition sanction for placate the god and avert any calamity that might arise from he displeasure at the base of one of the old crack wall of the shrine there be a hole which be the den of a very large black cobra several time it have be see in the garden and when pursue have glide into this hole and escape when beharilal first hear of it he be much trouble in he mind but have consult a brahmin he give strict injunction that the reptile should not be molest and since that time he have never fail to place a offering of milk near to the hole in the morning and in the evening now it happen that at this time there be in dowlutpoor a english doctor who be generally know as the jadoo-wallum saheb because he be believe to practice sorcery and have some mysterious need of snake perhaps he be only make experiment with they venom at any rate he want live cobra and offer a good price for they so when nagoo the snake-charmer hear that there be a large one in beharilal 's garden he think he might do good business by capture it for the jadoo-wallum saheb and at the same time demand a reward from the timorous bunium for rid he of such a dangerous neighbor with this intent he repair to the garden with all the apparatus of he art he flat snake basket he mongoose and he crooked pipe have reconnoitr the ground he commence operation by sit down on he ham and produce such ear-splitting strain from the crooked pipe as might have charm cerberus to leave he kennel at the gate of hell great be he surprise and mortification when he hear the voice of beharilal raise in tone of unwonted passion and see a stalwart purdaisee advance towards he arm with a iron-bound lathee who without ceremony nay with abusive epithet hustle he and all he gear out of the garden nagoo be a snake-charmer and by nature a gipsy and this treatment rankle in he dark bosom some week pass and the sun have scarcely rise when beharilal sit in the ota in front of he house at he daily business which begin as soon as he tooth be clean and end about eleven at night the place be not tidy two or three mat be spread on the floor a spare one be roll up in a corner several pair of shoe be on the step umbrella lean against the wall handle downward and a large chatty of drinking water stand beside they the bunium himself bare-headed and bare-footed sit cross-legged on a cushion with a wooden stool in front of he on which lay a open ledger of stout yellowish paper bind in soft red leather and nearly two foot in length in this he be carefully enter yesterday 's transaction with a reed pen which he dip frequently in a brass inkpot fill with a sponge soak in a muddy black fluid beside he sit he son aged two year play with the red lacquered cylinder in which he keep he reed pen beharilal have two girl also but they be with the woman folk in the interior of the house where he be content they should stay this be he only boy the pride and joy of he heart engross as he be in record he gain he could not refrain from lift he eye now and again to feast they on that rotund little body like a goblet set on two pillar no clothing conceal the tense and shiny brown skin but there be silver bracelet on the fat wrist and massive anklet where deep crease divide the fat little foot from the fat little leg and a representation in chase silver of eve 's fig leaf hang from a silver chain which encircle the sphere that should have be he waist he globular head be curiously shave from two deep pit between the bulge brow and the fat cheek that nearly squeeze out the little nose between they two black diamond twinkle full of wonder as the small purse mouth prattle to itself softly and inarticulately of the mystery of life suddenly a startled cry pass into a prolonged wail of fear rouse old beharilal and he see a sight that nearly cause he to swoon with terror the little man a moment ago so placid and happy be shrink back with i do not like that thing inscribe in line of anguish on he distorted face and not three foot from he a huge cobra just emerge from the roll of mat eye he with a stony stare its head raise and its hood expand its quiver tongue flicker out from between its lip like distant flash of fork lightning for a moment beharilal stand stupefied then all the heroism that be in he spend itself at once seize the heavy wooden stool in both he hand he raise it high over he head and dash it down on the reptile the sharp edge of hard wood break its back and as it wriggle and lash about bite at everything within reach the bunium snatch up he boy and waddle into the house at a pace to which he have long be unaccustomed call out in frantic gasp for help a rush of excited and scream woman meet he in the inner court and he drop he precious burden with pious ejaculation into the arm of its mother and stand panting and speechless then call aloud to know if all danger be past he venture cautiously out again and see that the purdaisee and the malee have eject the wriggle cobra and be pound its head into a jelly with a big stone for some seconds he look on in a strange stupor and then he realize what he have do he beharilal the bunium who have always remove the insect so tenderly from he own person that they be not hurt who have never commit the sin of kill a mosquito or a fly he with he own hand have take the life of the guardian cobra of the shrine urray-ray bap-ray he cry for what demerit of mine have this ill-luck befall I in my old age what will happen now nay sethjkee say the malee be not afraid it be in you destiny that this offspring of satan should come to its end by you hand we have pound its head properly so it will not return to you but what of its mate say beharilal i have hear that if any man kill a cobra its mate will follow he by day and by night until it have have its revenge be that not so the malee answer chh chh there be no mate of this cobra but he tone be not confident go cry beharilal -- go quickly and call nagoo the snake-charmer he have knowledge i will go say the malee and set off at a run but when he get out of the gate he lapse into a leisurely walk for why should a man lose he breath without cause in time he find he way to the little settlement of hut construct of pole and mat where nagoo sit on the ground smoking he chillum and tell he errand why should i come be nagoo 's reply i go to take away that cobra and the bunium drive I from the garden with abuse why do he send for I now he be a bunium say the malee as if that sum up the whole matter but he add after a pause if he see a burning ground he shake like a peepul leaf the cobra have die by he hand and he liver have become like water whatever you ask he will give you should come nagoo reply aloud i will come and to himself i will give he physic then he take up he basket and he pipe and follow the malee beharilal proceed to business with a directness foreign to he habit look over he shoulder at interval lest a snake might be silently approach good nagoo he say a great misfortune have happen the cobra of the shrine have be kill have it a mate how can a cobra not have a mate answer nagoo curtly then beharilal employ the most insinuate of the many tone of he voice listen nagoo you be a man of skill capture that cobra and i will pay you well i will give you five rupee then observe no response in the wrinkled visage of the charmer i will give you ten rupee nagoo would have sell he revenge for a tithe of the wealth thus dangle before he but he see no reason to suppose that there be another cobra anywhere in the garden so he answer with the calm confidence of a expert that can not be do the serpent will not heed any pipe now in its mind there be only revenge then what will it do say the tremble bunium if its mate die by the hand of a man it will follow that man until it have accomplish its purpose but how will it know ask beharilal by whose hand its mate die nagoo reply with pious simplicity how can i tell by what mean it know god inform it but plead beharilal be there no escape -- if a man go away by the railway or by water nagoo ponder for a moment and say if a man cross the sea the serpent would be baulk if he go by railway it will not leave he let he go to madra it will find he with a falter hand the bunium put some rupee uncounted into the charmer 's skinny palm say go make incantation do something there be great knowledge of mystery with you and he hurry back into the house he arrangement be very soon make he account book with a bundle of bond and hoondy and cash and he son be put into a small cart draw by a pair of fast trot bullock into which he himself climb after look under the cushion to see that there be no evil beast lurk there and get away in haste while the sun be yet hot the rest of the family follow with the household property and in a few day the house be empty and only the malee remain in charge many year have pass and the house be empty still and the malee grow gray and frail be still in charge he get no wages but he sell the jasmine flower and the mango and guava and he grow chilli and brinjal and so fill the stomach of himself and he little grandson and be contented if you ask he where the seth have go he reply who know he debt have go with he creditor go glimmer through the dream of thing that be and he have no desire to recall they a civil or military officer from the station take a solitary walk sometimes find himself at the cobra bungalow and turn in to wander among its old tree and unswept path obstruct by overgrown and untended shrub and wonder how it get its name then he pause at the whitewashed shrine and note that the god-stone have be freshly paint red and that chaplet of fade flower lie before it but the old malee approach with a meek salaam and a posy of jasmine and marigold and warn he that there be a cobra in the shrine xiii the panther i do not shoot it be January 13 of a good many year ago in those happy day that have go glimmer through the dream of thing that be the sun have scarcely rise and i be sit in the cosy cabin of my yacht enjoy my chota hazree which be interpret means lesser presence and in anglo-indian speech signify a eye-opener of tea and toast -- the greater presence appear some hour later and we call it breakfast i will not say that the view from my cabin window be enchant the placid water of the broad creek would have be pleasant to look upon if the level ray of the sun in he strength have not skim they with such a blinding glare but the low flat-topped hill that bound they be forbid the people say truly that god have make this a country of stone but they forget that he have clothe the stone with tree of evergreen foliage and a dense undergrowth of shrub and grass to protect and hold together the thick bed of loam which the fall leave enriched from year to year it be the axis of they father that fell the tree to sell for fuel and the billhook of they mother that hack away the bush and grub up they very root to burn on the household cooking hole then the torrential rain of the south-west monsoon come down on the naked defenceless parched and crack soil and sweep it in muddy cascade down to the sea leave flat of bare rock strew thick with round stone sore to the best-shod foot of man and cruel to the hoof of a horse about and among the hut of the unswept and malodorous hamlet just above the shore there be fine tree mango tamarind babool and bor show what might have be elsewhere on the round top of the highest hill frown in black ruin a old mahratta fort cover on the top and side and choke within by that dense mass of struggle vegetation which always take possession of old fort in indium the weather-worn stone and crumble mortar seem to feed the tree to gluttony first some bird-drop the seed of the banian fig into crevice of the rampart and its insidious root push they way and grow and grow into great tortuous snake embrace the massive block of basalt heave they up and hold they up so that they can not fall then prickly shrub and thorny tree follow fight for every inch of ground but quite unable to eject the gently persistent custard-apple descend doubtless from seed which the garrison drop as they eat the luscious fruit on account of which the portuguese introduce the tree from south america i have penetrate into that fort and have see something of the snake and bird of night but not the ghost and demon which i be assure make it they habitation by day on a level place a little below the fort stand two monument tell of the day when the honorable east indium company maintain a resident at this place here he live in proud solitude uphold the british flag but he wife and the little one on whose face he have not yet look be on they way from bombay in a native pattimar to join he and as he stand gaze over the sea at the red setting sun one 5th of October he think of the glad to-morrow and the end of he dreary loneliness it fall to he to put up one of these monument with a sorrowful inscription to all that be leave to he on the follow morning the memory of a beloved wife and a infant thirty-one day old drown in cross the bar on October 6 1853 we have strew we best to the weed unrest to the shark and the sheer gull if blood be the price of admiralty lord god we ha ' pay in full i carry my gun and rifle with I in my yacht they serve to keep up my character as a sportsman and do not often require to be clean so the morning calm of my mind be lash into a unwonted tempest of excitement when my jolly skipper sheikh abdul rehman come in and tell I briefly that a bag -lrb- which word do not rhyme with rag but must be pronounce like barg without the _ r _ and signify a tiger or panther -rrb- have kill a cow in the village the night before last when he add that the villager have set a spring gun for it last evening and it have return to the kill and be badly wound my excitement be turn into wrath i have be at anchor here all yesterday the indian ryot everywhere turn instinctively to the _ sahib _ as he protector against all wild beast what do these man mean by keep they own counsel and set a infernal machine for they enemy abdul rehman explain and the explanation be simple and sufficient my fat predecessor in the appointment that i hold have no relish for sport and keep no gun so the simple villager when they see my boat with its familiar flag look for no help from that quarter however i might still win renown off that wounded bag if it be not a myth but to tell the truth i be sceptical the tiger and the panther be not nomad on rocky plain like the antelope i land notwithstanding promptly and visit the scene sure enough there be a young heifer lie on its side with the unmistakable deep pit where the jaw of the panther have grip its throat and a gory cavity where it have select a gigot for its dinner round the corpse the villager have arrange a circular fence of thorn with one opening across which they have stretch a cord attach at the other end to the trigger of a old shooting iron of some sort charge with slug and look hard at the open the gun have go off during the night and the ground be soak with blood a few yard off there be another great swamp of blood the beast have stagger away and lie down for a while faint and sick then it have get up and crawl home still drip with blood by which we track it for a good distance but the trace grow gradually fainter and at last cease altogether it have go to the fort say the man -- bag always go to the fort i point out that if it have mean to go to the fort it would have go towards the fort instead of in another direction but the argument do not move they the fort be a jungle and where else should a ` bag ' take refuge but in a jungle however i be obstinate and pursue the original direction until we arrive at the brow of the hill where it slope steeply down to the sea the whole slope for half a mile be cover with a dense scrub of lantana bush this be another plant introduce in some by-gone century from south america and plant first in garden for its profuse cluster of red and pink verbena-like blossom -lrb- it be a near relation of the garden verbena -rrb- whence it have spread like the rabbit in new zealand and become a nuisance there i cry point at the scrub there without doubt you wound ` bag ' be lie some of the man unbelieve still be amusing themselves by roll large stone down the slope when suddenly there be a sound of scramble and across a opening in the scrub in sight of we all a huge hyaena scurry away on three leg i send a man post-haste for my rifle which i have not bring with I never expect to require it until a regular campaign could be arrange as soon as it arrive we form in line and advance throw stone in all direction make no offering of admiration at the shrine of we hardihood for we be in no peril among carnivorous beast there be not a more contemptible poltroon than the hyaena even when wound a friend of mine once tie up a billy goat as a bait for a panther and sit up over it in a tree in the middle of the night a hyaena nose it from afar and come sneak up in the rear for hyaena love the flesh of goat next to that of dog but the goat see it and turn about bravely present he horned front this the hyaena could not find stomach to face for two hour he manoeuvre to take the goat in rear but it turn as he circle and stand up to he stoutly till the dawn come and my friend cut short its disreputable career with a bullet to return to my story we have not go far when on a lower level not many yard from I i be suddenly confront by that repulsive ghoulish physiognomy which can never be forget when once see the smoky-black snout broad forehead and great upstanding ear instantly the beast wheel and scramble over a bank receive a hasty rear shot which as i afterwards find leave it but one limb to go with for the bullet pass clean through a hindleg and lodge in a foreleg it go on however and some time pass before i descry it far off drag itself painfully across a open space a careful shot finish it and it die under a thick bush where we find it and drag it out it prove to be a large male measuring 4 foot 7 inch from which something over a foot must be deduct for its shabby tail the native all maintain still that they cow have be kill by a panther say that the hyaena have come on the second night after they manner to fill its base belly with the leavings and there be some circumstantial evidence in favor of this view in the first place i never hear of a hyaena have the audacity to attack a cow in the second the tooth-mark on the cow show that it have be execute accord to the tradition of all the great cat -- by seize its throat and break its neck and in the third a hyaena sit down to such a meal would certainly have begin with calf 's head and crunch up every bone of the skull before thinking of sirloin or rumpsteak but the absurdity of a panther be find in such a region outweigh all this and i scoff i be yet to learn a lesson in humility out of this adventure two year later i sail over the bar and drop anchor at the same spot i be meet with the intelligence that on the previous evening two panther have be see sit on the brow of the hill and gaze at the beauty of the fading sunset as wild beast be so fond of do a night or two later a cow be attack in a neighbouring field and stagger into the village fall down and die in a narrow alley between two house the panther follow and prowl about all night but the villager hammer at they door with stick scare it from its meal i at once have a nest put up in a small tree and take my position in it at sunset the common people in indium do not waste much money on lamp oil prefer to sleep during the hour appoint by nature for the purpose so it be not long before all door be securely bar and quietness reign then the mosquito awake and come to inquire for I the little bat -lrb- how i bless they -rrb- wheel about my head the night-jar call to he fellow and the little owl sit on a branch together and talk to each other about I hour after hour pass and it become too dark in that narrow alley to see a panther if it have come so i come down and get to my boat the panther be engage a mile away dine on another cow on further inquiry i learn that there be some good forest a day 's journey distant and it be quite the fashion among the panther of that place to spend a weekend occasionally at a spot so full of all delight as this dark jungle-smothered fort xiv the purbhoo i do not believe that the member of parliament who move the adjournment of the house to consider the culpable carelessness of the government of indium in allow the rajah of muttighur to fall into the moat of he own castle when he be drunk could have tell you what a purbhoo be not though you have spell it prabhu so that he could find it in he _ gazetteer _ of course he see hundred of they during that christmas which he spend in the east before he write he book but then he take they all for brahmin he never notice that the curve of they turban be not the same and the idol mark on they forehead be quite different nor even that they shoe be not fork at the toe but end in a sharp point curl upward and if he do not see these thing which be on the surface what could he know of matter that lie deeper now the first and most important thing to be know respect the purbhoo the fundamental fact of he be that he be not a brahmin if he be a brahmin one essential piece of we administrative apparatus in indium would be want and without it the whole machinery would assuredly go out of order nor be it easy to see how we could replace he not one of the other caste would serve even as a makeshift they be all too far remove from the brahmin but the purbhoo be near he irritatingly near he and he have prove in practice to be just the sort of homoeopathic remedy we require the counter-irritant the outward blister by wise application of which we can keep down the internal inflammation in speaking of the brahmin as a inflammation in the body politic i disown all offensive and invidious implication i be only use a convenient simile you may reverse it if you like and make the disease stand for the purbhoo in which case the brahmin will be the blister which way fit the fact best will depend upon which caste chance at the time to be nearest to the vitals of government the case stand thus before the day of british rule the brahmin be the priest and man of letter the clerke in short the raja and chief be much of the same mind as old dougla : thanks to saint bothan son of mine save gawain ne'er could pen a line gawain be a bishop as a mohammedan gentleman related to one of the ruling indian prince put the matter when speak to I a few year ago in those day none of we could write we pen be the sword if any writing have to be do the brahmin be call in and no doubt he do excellent service be diligent astute and withal pliant and diplomatic if to these quality he add ambition he might and often do become a cardinal wolsey in the state in poona for example the brahmin prime minister gradually overshadow the mahratta king and the descendant of shivajee be put on a back shelf as rajah of sattara while the peishwa rule at the capital of course this carnal advancement be not gain without some sacrifice of he spiritual character and the secular brahmin have to bow _ quoad sacra _ to the penniless bhut or regular brahmin who refuse to contaminate he sanctity by do any kind of work eat of the temple or live by royal bounty or private charity and by the free breakfast without which a marriage thread ceremony or funeral in a gentleman 's house could not be respectably celebrated idleness and sanctity be a powerful combination and it be write in the _ shastras _ that every day in which a holy man do no work for he bread but life by beg be equal in the eye of the god to a day spend in fast so though the prospect of power and wealth might tempt a few restless and wayward spirit the great mass of the brahmin caste clung to the sacred call all this time the purbhoo be in the land but insignificant he have no sacred call tradition assign he a hybrid origin he could not presume to be a warrior because he mother be a _ shoodra _ nor could he condescend to be a farmer for he father be a _ kshutriya _ so the god have give he the pen and he be a writer -- not a secretary but a humble quill-driver but when the portuguese and then the british come upon the scene not rule by word of mouth like the native raja but indite they order and keep record the purbhoo see a open door and go in then the brahmin wake up for he see that he be in evil case the spirit of the british _ raj _ be fall like a blight and a pestilence upon the means by which he have live dry up the fountain of religious revenue and slowly but surely blight the luxuriance of that pious liberality which always take the form of feed holy man he find that he must work for he bread whether he like it or not and the only implement of secular work that would not soil he priestly hand be the pen and this be already take up by the purbhoo who carry himself haughtily under the new _ regime _ and show no mind to make way for the holier man hence spring those bitter enmity and jealousy which have do so much to lighten the difficulty of we position the british government have often be accuse of act on the maxim _ divide et impera _ it be a libel we do not divide for there be no need division be already there we have only to rejoice and rule how well and justly we rule all the world know but only the initiate know how much we owe to the fact that the talent and energy which would otherwise be employ in thwart we just intention and phlebotomise the ryot be largely preoccupy with the more useful work of thwart and undermine each other what could a collector do single-handed against a host of clerk and subordinate magistrate and petty official of every grade all arm with the awfulness of a heaven-born sanctity all hedge round with the prestige of a ancient supremacy endowed with a mole-like genius for underground work which the englishman never fathom and all league together to suck to the uttermost the life blood of those inferior caste which be create expressly for they advantage _ he _ be work in a foreign language among custom and way of thought which it take a lifetime to understand : _ they _ be use they mother tongue and handle matter that they have know from childhood _ he _ can not tell a lie and be ashamed to deceive : _ they _ be train in a thrifty policy which save the truth for a last resort in case everything else should fail he would be helpless in they hand as a suck child but he know they will do for he what he can not do for himself the purbhoo will lie in wait for the brahmin and the brahmin will keep he lynx eye on the purbhoo and woe to the one who trip first so the collector arrange he man with judicious skill to the foster of each other 's virtue and the result be most gratify the country bless he administration and he subordinate be equally surprised and delighted at they own integrity i speak of a wise and able administrator there be man in the indian civil service who be neither wise nor able and some who be not administrator at all have most unhappily mistaken they vocation when such a one become collector of a district he _ chitni _ or chief secretary see that that tide in the affair of man have come which take at the flood lead on to fortune and he caste-fellow all through the service be fill with unholy joy but he do nothing rash or hasty wilily and patiently he go to work to make he own foundation sure first of all he study he chief under all condition discover he little foible and vanity and feed they sedulously he master code rule and regulation stand order precedent and past correspondence till it be dangerous to contradict he and always safe to trust he in every difficulty he be at hand clearing away perplexity and refresh the swither mind with he precision and assurance he become indispensable the collector repose absolute confidence in he and be proud to say so in he report then the _ chitni _ if he be a brahmin address himself to the task of eliminate the purbhoo from the service or at least deprive he of place and power it be a delicate task but the brahmin 's touch be light he never disparage a purbhoo from that day damn with faint praise be safer and as effectual he practise the charity which covereth a multitude of fault but he leave a tag end of one peep out to attract curiosity and if the collector ask question he be candid and tell the truth though with manifest reluctance then he grapple with the gradation list which have fall into confusion and put they into such excellent order that the collector can see at a glance every man 's past service and present claim to promotion and from these list it appear that clearly whenever any vacancy have to be fill a brahmin have the first claim and so as the shades of night yield to the dawn of day the purbhoo by degree fade away and disappear and the star of the brahmin rise and shine everywhere with still increase splendor but the purbhoo possess he soul in patience and keep a note of every slip that the brahmin make for the next _ chitni _ may be a purbhoo and then the day of reckoning will come and old score will be pay off the brahmin know that too and the thought of it make he walk warily even in the day of he prosperity thus we administration be save from utter corruption xv the coconut tree among the classic fairy-tale which pass like shooting star across those dark hour of we boyhood in which we wrestle with the grim rudiment of latin and greek and which abide in the memory after nearly all that they help to brighten have pass away there be one which related to a contest between neptune and minerva as to which should confer the greatest benefit on the human race neptune first strike he trident on the ground -lrb- or be it on the wave eheu fugaces -- no that also be go -rrb- and there spring forth a noble steed paw the ground terrible in war and no less useful in peace then the watery god lean back and smile as if he would say now beat that but the goddess of wisdom bring out of the earth a modest dark tree bearing olive and in classic phrase take the cake oriental mythology be more luxuriant and fantastic than that of the west but i do not know if it have any legend parallel to this if it have then i be sure the palm be award to the deity who give to the human race the tree that bear the coconut pass a confectioner 's shop i see a tempting packet label cokernut toffee i buy a pennyworth and give it to my little girl and i laye a-thynkynge a-thynkynge a-thynkynge how many boy and girl be there in this kingdom to whom the word coconut connote a ingredient which go to the making of a very toothsome sweetie and how many confectioner and shop girl be there whose idea be no broader again : i laye a-thynkynge a-thynkynge a-thynkynge and merrie sing the birde as she sit upon the spraye and i say little bird what do you know of the coconut and it make answer it be a cup full of food rich and sweet which kind hand hang out for I in winter how narrow may be the key-hole through which we take we outlook on thing human and divine never doubt that we see the whole in we own british empire only a few thousand mile away sit a mild hindu almost unclad and wholly unlettered to whom the tree that bear the fruit that flavor the toffee that my little girl be enjoy seem to be one of the predominate tint of the whole landscape of life it put a roof over he head it lighten he darkness it help to feed he body it furnish the wine that maketh glad he heart and the oil that causeth he face to shine and time would fail I to tell of all the other thing that it do for he as a type and symbol it be always about he span the sunshine and shower of life with bow of hope the coconut tree be a palm and have nothing to do with cocoa of the breakfast table that word be a perversion of cacao and come to we from mexico : the other be the portuguese word coco which mean a nut it be what vasco da gama call the thing when he first see it and the word with we english translation add have stick to it the tree be i need scarcely say a palm one of many kind that flourish in indium but none of they can be rank with it the rough date palm make dense grove on sandy plain but bring no fruit to perfection pining for something which only arabia can supply the strong but unprofitable brab or fan palm rise on rocky hill the beautiful fish-tailed palm in forest solitarily while the areca rear its tall smooth stem and delicate head in garden and supplies million with a solace more indispensable than tobacco or tea but the coconut love a sandy soil and the salt breath of the sea and the company of its own kind the other grow erect as a mast but the gentle coconut lean on the wind and mingle the wave of they sisterly arm cast a grateful shade on the humble folk who live under they blessing to the mariner sailing by indium 's coral strand that country present the aspect of a endless beach of shell sand quite innocent of coral on which the surf break continually into dazzling white foam against a dark background of pensive palm he might naturally suppose that they have grow up of themselves like the screw-pine and aloe which sometimes share the beach with they but that would be a great mistake everyone of they have be plant and carefully water for year and manured annually with fresh foliage of forest tree bury in a moat round the root and so it grow in stature but not in girth until its head be sixty seventy or even eighty foot above the ground and a hundred nut of various size hang in bunch from long shiny green arm each as thick as a man 's which have thrust themselves out from between the lower frond there be no production of nature that i know of less negotiable than a coconut as the tree present it the man who first show the way into it deserve a place in mythology with prometheus jason and other hero of the dawn there be a crab i know which live on coconut enjoy the scientific name of _ birgus latro _ the burglar but it seem to be a special invention as big as a cat and arm with two fearful pair of pincers in front for rend the outside casing of the fruit and a more delicate tool on its hind-leg for pick out the meat other animal have to do without it as have man i opine in the stone and copper age with the iron age come a chopper call in western indium a koita with which he can hack he way through most of the obstruction of life when with this he have slash off the tough outer rind and the inch-thick packing of agglutinated fiber like metal wire he have only to crack the hard shell which contain the kernel how little we can conceive the space in he life that would be empty without that firm pulp at once nutritious sweet and fragrant curry can not be make without it the cook can not advance three step in its absence pattimar laden with it be sail north south east and west a thousand creaky wooden mill be squeeze the limpid oil out of it a hundred thousand little earthen lamp fill with that oil be make visible the smoky darkness of hut and temple brighten the wedding feast and illuminate the sad page over which the candidate for university honor nod he shaven head that oil fed lighthouse of the first order and illuminate viceregal ball and durbar before paraffin and kerosene inundate the earth and it have other use for arrest premature baldness and prevent the hair turn gray its virtue be equal by no other oil know to we and there be a fortune await the hairdresser who can find means effectually to remove or suppress its peculiar and penetrate odour joao gomez my faithful boy do not object to the odour and when he have be tempt to pass my comb through he raven lock as he be dust my dress table i always know it when the white kernel have be turn to account the utility of the coconut be not exhaust the shell neatly bisect make a pair of teacup and either of these fit with a wooden handle make a handy spoon laurenco de gama demand one or two of these inexpensive spoon to complete the furnishing of my kitchen as for the obstinate case that wrap the coconut shell it be a article of commerce it must first be soak for some month in a pit on the slimy bank of the backwater until all the stuff that hold it together in a stiff and obdurate mass have rot away and set free those hard and smooth fiber which nothing can rot these when thoroughly purge of the foul black pollution in which they have swelter so long will go out to all quarter of the world under the name of coir to make indestructible door mat and other indispensable thing it will penetrate to every corner of indium in which a white man live to mat he verandah and stuff he mattress and who shall recount a tithe of its other use of course the nude man under the coconut tree know nothing of all this he do without a mattress and have no use for a door mat but he can not do without cordage and if you take from he he coconut fiber life would almost stop wherewith would he bind the rafter of he hut to the beam or tether the cow or let down the bucket into the well what would all the boat do that traverse the backwater or lie at anchor in the bay or line the sandy beach from the cable of the great pattimar now get under weigh for the persian gulf with a cargo of coconut to the painter of the dugout hodee every yard of cordage about they be make of imperishable coir when the axe be at last lay to the old coconut tree a beam will fall to the earth sixty foot in length hard as teak and already round and smooth true you can not see it into plank but no one will complain of that in a village which do not own a saw it cleave readily enough and straightly form long trough most useful for lead water from the well to the plantation and for many other purpose it can also be chop into length suitable for the ridge pole of the hut or for bridge to span the deep ditch which drain the rice field or feed the salt pan when out in quest of snipe i have sometimes have to choose between cross by one of those bridge innocent of even a handrail and wade through the black slough of despond which it span choose neither i go home but the kolee and the agree trip over they like bird balance household chattel on they steady head we must not think however of the trunk as at the best anything more than a by-product of the coconut tree whose head be more than its body even while it live its head be shear once a year for as fresh frond push out and upward from the center those of the outer circle get old and must be cut away and when one of those feathery fern-like frond toy with the breeze come crash to the ground it be ten or twelve foot long and consist of a great backbone as thick at the base as a man 's leg with a close-set row of sword on either side about a yard in length they be hard and tough but supple yet and of a shiny green color but they will turn to brown as they wither now observe that this gigantic unmanageable-looking leaf like everything else about the coconut tree be almost a ready-made article demand no machinery to turn it to account except the koita which hang ever ready from the nude man 's girdle with it he will cleave the backbone lengthwise and then take each half separately he will simply twist backwards every second sword and plait they all into a mat two foot wide eight or ten foot long and firmly bound and hold together on one side by the unbreakable backbone this be a jaolee lighter than slate or tile and more handy than any form of thatch you have just to arrange you jaolee neatly on you bamboo frame each overlap the one below it then tie they securely in they place with coir rope and you roof be make for a year there be yet another benevolence of the coconut tree which i have leave to the last and the simple folk of whom i be try to write with fellow feeling would certainly have name it first i ought to refer to it as a curse : they without qualm or question call it a blessing let I try to describe it dispassionately if you wander in any palm grove in western indium look upward it will soon strike you that a large number of the tree do not seem to bear coconut at all but black earthen pot if you visit should chance to be make early in the morning or late in the afternoon the mystery will soon be reveal you will see a dusky sinewy figure not of a monkey but of a man ascend and descend those tree with marvellous celerity and ease grasp the trunk with he hand and fitting he naked foot into slight notch cut in they the distance between the notch be so great that he knee go up to he chin at each step but he be as supple as he be sinewy and feel no inconvenience for he be a bhundaree or toddy-drawer and he forefather have be bhundaree since the time i suppose when manu make he immortal law he waistcloth be tightly gird about he in he hand he carry a broad billhook as bright and keen as a razor and from he caudal region depend a tail more strange than any bear by beast or reptile it look like a large brown pot construct in the middle it be in fact a large gourd or calabash hanging by a hook from the climber 's waistband when he have reach the top of a tree he get among the branch and sit astride of one of they proceed to detach one of the black pot from the stout fruit stem on which it be fasten and empty its contents into he tail then take he billhook he carefully pare the raw end of the stem refasten the black pot in its place and hurry down to make the ascent of another tree and so on until he tail be full of a foam white liquor spot with drowned honey bee and fill the surround air with a rank odour of fermentation this liquor be toddy if i be a darwin i would not leave that word until i have trace the agency which waft it over sea and land from the shore of hindustan to the scottish coast where it first take root and quickly adapt itself to a strange environment develop into a new and vigorous species spread like the thistle and become a national institution at first it be only the briton 's way of mouth a common native word tadus -lrb- pronounced ta-dee -rrb- which mean palm juice but it become current in its present shape as early as 1673 when the traveller fryer write of the native singing and roar all night long be drunk with toddy the wine of the cocoe about a century later burn sing the lad and lass blythely bent to mind baith saul and body sit round the table weel content and steer about the toddy between these i can find no vestigium but imagination easily fill the gap i see a company of jovial scot meet in calcutta or surat on st andrew 's day european wine and beer be expensive whisky not obtainable at all but the skilful khansamah make up a punch with toddy spirit hot water sugar and lime and they be well content after many year i see the few of they who still survive foregather again in the old country and one propose to have a good brew of toddy for auld lang syne if real toddy spirit can not be have what of that whisky be find to take very kindly to hot water and sugar and lime and the old folk at home and the neighbor and the minister himself pronounce a most favourable verdict on toddy in short it have come to stay but we must return to the liquor in the bhundaree 's gourd it be the rich sap which should have go to the form of coconut which be intercept by cut off the point of the fruit stalk and tie on a earthen pot if the pot be clean the juice when it be take down in the morning not fermented yet but just begin to sparkle with minute bubble not too sweet and not so oily as the milk of the coconut be nectar to a hot and thirsty soul no summer drink have i drunk so innocently restorative after a hot and toilsome march on a broil may morning but the bhundaree will not squander it so : he take care not to clean he pot and when he take they down in the morning the liquor be already foam like london stout not that he mean to drink it himself for you must know that by the rule of he caste he be a total abstainer be a bhundaree whose function be to draw toddy not to drink it this be one of those profound institute by which the wisdom of the ancient fence the whole social system of this strange land but while the bhundaree must refuse all intoxicating drink himself it be he duty to exercise a large tolerance towards those who be not so hinder he be in fact a partner in the business of babajee license vendor of fresh toddy towards whose spacious open-fronted shop thatch with jaolee he now carry he gourd there the contents will stand in dirty vessel and a warm place mature they exhilarating quality until the evening when the tam o ' shanter and souter johnny of the village begin to assemble and squat in a ring in the open space in front they may be kolee or fisherman and agree who make salt and aboriginal katkurree from the jungle with they bow and arrow most bibulous of all but among they all there will be no bhundaree babajee sit apart preside and serve beside a dirty table on which be many bottle and dirty tumbler of pattern which be on we table thirty year ago the assembly begin solemnly discuss social problem and bartering village gossip for the hindu be by nature staid after a while at the second bottle perhaps cheerfulness will supervene then mirth and garrulity end as the night close round with wordy contention and a general brawl but nothing serious will happen for toddy though decidedly heady be at the worst a thin potation a strong and very pure spirit be distil from it which have its devotee but the rustic as a rule prefer quantity to quality we be often tell that the british government teach the people of indium to drink but the scene that i have try to describe be indigenous conviviality much older than any european connection with the country be it any wonder that the coconut have become a emblem of fertility and prosperity and all good luck when a new house be build you will see a high pole over the doorway bearing coconut at the top with a umbrella spread over they do not ask the owner the meaning of the sign for he do not know he do not think about such matter but he feel about they and he know that that be the right thing to do besides he might ask you why you nail a horseshoe over you door the difference between we and he be that we do such thing in jest no longer believe in they they be the husk of a dead faith with we but the hindu 's faith be very live still so when he break a coconut at the launching of a pattimar he be a gainer in hope if nothing else while we squander we champagne and gain nothing that nut follow he even to the grave or burning ground with mystic significance which i can not explain i have be tell that when a very holy man die who always clothe himself in ash and never profane he hand with work he disciple sometimes break a coconut over he head if the spirit can escape from the body through the suture of the skull instead of by any of the other orifice it be believe to find a more direct route to heaven so the purpose of this ceremony may be to facilitate its exit that way in that case the breaking of the nut be perhaps only a accident due to its not be so hard as the holy man 's skull xvi the betel nut one half the world do not know how the other half live notice a pot of areca nut toothpaste on a chemist 's counter i ask he what the peculiar property of the areca nut be -- in short what be it good for he reply that it be a astringent and act beneficially on the gum but he have never hear that it be use for any other purpose than the manufacture of a elegant dentifrice i feel inclined to question he about the camel in order to see whether he would tell I that it be a tropical animal chiefly note for the fine quality of its hair from which artist 's brush be make here be a man whose special business it be to know the property and use of all drug and they action on the human system and he have not the faintest notion that there be nearly 300 million of he majesty 's subject and many million more beyond he empire who could scarcely think of life as a thing to be desire if they be oblige to go through it without the areca nut for the areca nut be the betel nut in the canarese language and the kindred dialect of malabar it be call by a name which be render as _ adike _ or _ adika _ in scientific book but would stand more chance of be correctly pronounce by the average englishman if it be spell _ uddiky _ the coast district of canara and malabar be fame for they betel nut the trade name of the article be take from the language current there and be tortured by the portuguese into _ areca _ over the greater part of indium the native use the hindustanee name _ suparus _ but by englishman it be best know as the betel nut because it be always find in company with the betel leaf with which however it have no more connection than strawberry have with cream the one be the leaf of a kind of pepper vine and the other be the seed or nut of a palm but nature and man have combine to marry they to one another and it be difficult to think of they separately in life the betel vine climb up the stem of the areca palm and in death the areca nut be roll in a shroud of the betel leaf and the two be munch together other thing be often add to the morsel such as a clove a cardamom or a pinch of tobacco and a small quantity of fresh lime be indispensable what be the precise nature of the consolation derive from the chew of this mixture it be not easy to say outwardly it produce effect which be visible enough to wit a most copious flow of saliva which be dye deep red by the juice of the nut so that a betel nut chewer seem to go about spit blood all the day as every hindu be a betel nut chewer those 943903 superficial mile of country which make up we indian empire must be bespatter to a degree which it dizzy the mind to contemplate this be one of the difficulty of indian administration in large town and centre of business it be find necessary to fortify the public building in various way the custom house in bombay have the wall paint with dark red ochre to a height of three or four foot from the ground but these be the outward result what be the inwardness of the thing in a word why do the people chew betel nut surely not that they may spit on we public building that be a chance result not seek for and not shun there be of course some deeper reason early traveller in indium be much exercise about this and use to question the people from whom they get some curious explanation one report they say they do it to comfort the heart nor could live without it another say it bite in the mouth accord rheume coole the head strengthen the tooth and be all they phisicke a latin writer get quite eloquent _ ex ea mansione _ -- by that chew -- he say mire recreantur et ad labores tolerandos et ad languores discutiendo but the remarkable thing be that the betel nut have these effect only on the hindu constitution to a european the strong astringent taste and penetrate odour of the betel nut be alike insufferable and there be no instance on record as far as i know of a englishman become a betel nut chewer but wherever hindu blood circulate not in indium only but all through the island of the malay archipelago as far as the philippine the betel nut be a indispensable ingredient of any life that be worth live mohammedanism forbid spirit and brahminism condemn all thing that intoxicate or stupefy but the betel nut be like the cup that cheer yet not inebriate no religion speak disrespectfully of it it flourish bless by all and take its place among the institution of civilisation indeed it be the chief cement of social intercourse in a country where all ordinary conviviality between man and man be almost strangle by the quarantine enforce against ceremonial defilement friend offer friend the betel nut box just as scotsman offer the snuff-box in the hearty old day that be pass away and all visit of ceremony durbar reception leave-takings and public function of the like kind be bring to a August close by the distribution of _ pan suparus _ to go through this rite without visible repugnance be part of the training of we young civil servant when the interview or ceremony have last as long as it be intend to last there enter with due pomp bearer of heavy-scented garland weave of jasmine and marigold and in form like the muff and boa that lady wear in winter these be put upon the neck and wrist of the guest in order of rank silver vase and sprinkler follow contain rose-water and attar of rose you may ward off the former from you person by offer you handkerchief for it and you may present the back of you hand for the latter of which one drop will be apply to you skin with a tiny silver or golden spoon finally when everybody be reek with incongruous odour and try not to be sick a silver tray appear with the daintiest little packet of _ pan suparus _ each pin with a clove and every guest be expect to transfer one to he mouth for they have be prepare by a brahmin and can not hurt the most delicate caste to a englishman however it be now generally concede to compromise by keep the morsel in he hand as if wait a opportunity to enjoy it more at he leisure when you get home you servant crave it of you and contrast real rajah 's _ pan suparus _ with the stuff which the poor man get in the bazaar the chew of betel nut require more apparatus and make greater demand on a man 's time and personal care than the smoking of tobacco or any of the ally vice to cut the nut neatly a instrument be use like a enormous pair of nutcracker with a sharp cut edge the lime should be make from oyster shell and it must be freshly burn and slake exposure to the air soon spoil it so a small air-tight tin box be require to keep it in lastly the betel leaf must be fresh and in a hot climate green leaf do not keep they freshness without special care but the necessity for attend to all these matter no doubt add greatly to the interest which a chewer of _ pan supari _ be able to find in life moreover he taste and wealth have scope for expression in the elegance of he appointment and by these you may generally judge of a man 's rank and mean a well-to-do mahratta cartman will carry in he waistband a sort of bijou hold-all of color cloth which when unrolled display neat pocket of different form for the leaf break nut lime box spice etc but a native magistrate who go about attend by a peon and need not carry he own thing will have a box of polished brass or even silver divide into compartment one may easily infer that to meet such a universal want there must be a correspondingly great industry and the cultivation of the betel nut be indeed a great industry and a most beautiful one surely since adam first begin to till the ground in the sweat of he face he child have find no tillage so eden-like as this indium have produce no virgil to take the common charm of a farmer 's life and put they into immortal song so we search she literature in vain to learn how she simple rustic people feel about these thing and in what we see of they life there be little sign that they feel about they at all but when the englishman wander gun in hand up a steam valley among forest-clad hill suddenly find the path lead he into a betel nut garden with no wire fence or lock gate or inhospitable notice threaten prosecution to trespasser he feel as if he have enter some region of bliss where the earthly sens be too narrow for the delight that press for entrance to the soul in the first place the areca nut palm be almost if not altogether the most graceful of all its graceful tribe unlike the coconut it grow as erect as a flagstaff and the effect of this be increase by its extreme slenderness for though it may attain a height of fifty foot its diameter scarcely exceed six inch at the top of the stem there be a sheath of polished green from the top of which again there issue a tuft of the most ethereal feathery frond diverge and droop with matchless grace under these hang the cluster of reddish-brown nut as the areca nut will not grow except in place that be at once moist and warm the garden be generally situate in narrow valley and dell among hill with little stream of limpid water ripple past they or through they the steam heat of such situation can only be realize by one who have traverse they at noon in the month of may in pursuit of sport or natural history but the palm grow so close together that they frond mingle into a almost unbroken roof through which the sun can scarcely peep and every air that enter there have the heat charm out of it and as it wander among the broad aromatic leaf of the betel vine which wreathe the pillar of that fairy hall it be soften with balmy moisture and laden with fragrance and scent to woo you sens in perfect tune with the tinkling music of the water and the enchanting beauty of the whole scene in a large hut among these shades with banana wave they banner leave over the smooth and well-swept yard in front where the child play live the family that cultivate the garden they be a sect of brahmin but very unbrahminical unsophisticated industrious temperate kind and hospitable other brahmin despise they and wish to deny they the name because they have soil they priestly hand with agriculture but they return the contempt and walk in the way of they father a way which lead they among the purest pleasure that this life afford and keep they from many of its more sordid temptation perhaps the picture have its darker shades too i have not see they and why should i look for they the betel nut harvest be something of the nature of a acrobatic performance for the crop be not on the ground but on pole forty or fifty foot high this be the manner in which it be gather the farmer attend by he wife go out and slip a loose loop of rope over he foot to keep they together so that when he get the trunk of a tree between they it may fit like a wedge he clasp one of the tree with he hand and go up at a surprising rate he carry with he a long rope and when he reach the top he fasten one end of it to the tree and throw the other to he wife who go to a distance and draw it tight then the man break off a heavy bunch of ripe nut and hitch it on the rope let it go it shoot down with such velocity that it would knock he wife down do she not know how to dodge it skilfully and break its force in a bend of the rope when all the bunch be on the ground the man begin to sway he body violently till the tender and supple palm be swing like a pendulum and almost strike the tree on either side watch he opportunity the man grasp one of these and transfer himself to it with the nimbleness of a monkey in this way he make a aerial journey round the garden and avoid the fatigue of climb up and down every separate tree the gather betel nut soon find they way to the warehouse of fat bunia at the coast port where they be peel and prepare and sort and pile in great heap accord to quality and finally ship in _ pattimar _ and _ cotia _ and coast steamer and so disseminate over the length and breadth of the land to be the comforter of poor and rich it only remain to say that the betel nut be not use in the east for tooth-powder though the native believe that the practice of chew it save they from toothache when they use any dentifrice it be generally charcoal and they toothbrush be either the forefinger or a fibrous stick chew at the end till it become like a stiff paintbrush but whatever he may use for the purpose the hindu clean he tooth every morning and that most thoroughly before he will allow food to pass he lip and the whiteness and soundness of he tooth be a object of envy to englishmen xvii a hindu festival poet may sing let the ape and tiger die but they be not quite dead yet only caged and where be the man in whose bosom there lurk no wish that he could open the door just once in a way and let they have a frisk in the east there be no hypocrisy about the matter the tiger 's den be bar and lock and the british government keep the key but the ape have a appoint day in the year on which he shall have he outing they call it the _ holus _ which be a misnomer for of all hindu festival this be the most unholy but of that anon i ask a brahmin what this festival commemorate and he say he do not know he know how to observe it which be the main thing of course there be a explanation of it in hindu mythology which the brahmin ought to have know and very probably do know but be ashamed to tell but it matter little for we may be well assure that the explanation be invent to sanctify the festival long after the festival itself come into vogue as have be the case with some of we most christian holiday the holus come round about the time of the vernal equinox when victory declare for day and warmth in its long struggle with night and cold then nature rise and shake herself as samson rise and shake himself and snap the seven new cord that bind he as tow be snap when it smell the fire then the wanton lapwing get himself another crest and then also the young hindu 's fancy lightly turn to thought of love and so it come about quite naturally that look around among he plentiful god for a deity who might fitly be invite to preside over he lusty rejoicing at this season he pitch upon krishna for krishna when he be upon this earth be a amorous youth and he going on with certain milkmaid be such as would shock mr grundy at the present day even in indium suppose he have be only a man but he be a god therefore he do a thing make it right and where he preside he worshipper may do as he do consequently man woman and child of every caste and grade give themselves licence during these day of the holus to act and speak in a manner that would be scandalous at any other time of the year hindu of the better sort be begin to be outwardly and some of they i hope inwardly rather ashamed of this festival and it be time they be yet there be always something cheer in the sight of untutored mirth and exuberant animal joy break out and triumph over the sadness of life and the monotony of lowly toil and i confess that i find a please side to this festival of the holus i like it best as i have see it in a fishing village on the west coast of indium at first sight you would not suspect the black and brawny kolus of much gaiety but there be deep down in he a spring of mirth and humor which when wine and free companion kindle he can break out into the most boisterous hilarity and jocundity and even buffoonery throw aside all trammel of convention and decorum he woman folk too though they do not go out of they proper place in the social system assert themselves vigorously within it and be gay and vivacious and well aware of they personal attraction so the koli village look forward to the holus and make timely preparation for it the night before the _ poornima _ or full moon of the month phalgoon arrive each trim fishing boat be store with flower and leafy branch all the flag that can be muster and a drum then the whole village go a-fishing next morning each housewife get up early to decorate she house and trick out herself and she child for though the kolus be the most naked of man he whole workaday costume consist of one rag about equal in amplitude to half a good pocket-handkerchief he wife be the most dressy of woman she be always well-dressed even on common day the bareness of she limb may perhaps shock we notion of propriety at first for be a mud-wader of necessity like the stork and the heron she gird she garment about she very tightly indeed but this only set off she wonderfully erect and athletic figure while she well-set head look all the nicer that it have no cover except she own neatly-bound hair she never draw she _ saree _ coyly over she head like other native woman when she meet a man on this day there be no change in the fashion of she costume -lrb- that never change -rrb- but she put on she brightest dress blue or red or lemon yellow with all she private jewellery and deck she hair with a small chaplet of bright flower she child be trick out with more fancy the little brown girl who yesterday have not one square inch of cloth on the whole of she tiny person come out a _ petite _ miss in a crimson bodice and a white skirt with she shine black hair oil and comb and plait and deck with flower and she neck and arm and foot twinkle with ornament she brother of six or seven look as if he be go to a fancy-dress ball in the character of he highness the holkar he small head be set in a great three-cornered maratha turban and he body a stranger to the feel of clothes be mask in a resplendent purple jacket the young man of the village such of they as be not go a-fishing have don clean white jacket beyond that they will not go contemn effeminacy about nine o'clock when the sun be now well up the distant sound of a tom-tom be hear and the first of the return fleet of _ muchwa _ appear at the mouth of the creek a long line of red and white flag extend from the top of the mainyard to the helm and streamer flutter from the masthead a monster bouquet of marigold be mount on the bowsprit branch of tree be stick about in all possible situation and three or four large fish hang from the bow trail they tail in the water with the exception of the man at the helm who sit stolid mind he business and one youth who play the tom-tom the crew be stand in a ring gesticulate with they arm and leg or wave wand and branch of tree some have half of they face smear with red paint if a boat pass they greet it with a shout and a sally of wit or ribaldry the other _ muchwa _ follow close behind with every inch of white sail spread and all a-flutter with flag and streamer : it would be difficult to imagine a prettier spectacle and the tom-toming and the happiness beam on the face of the crew be almost infectious one feel almost compel to wave one 's hat and cry hip hip hooray the boat come to shore and then there ought to be a tumble out of the silvery harvest and a gathering of woman and a strife indescribable of shrill tongue and then a long procession of wife and daughter trot to market each balance a great drip basket on she comely head while the husband and father go home to eat and sleep but there be none of that to-day the silvery harvest may go to destruction and the husband and father can do without sleep for once the child be take on board in all they finery and friend join and musician with they instrument then all sail be spread again and the boat start for a circuit round the harbor the wind blow fiercely from the north and each buoyant _ muchwa _ scud along at a fearful pace heel over until the ripple water finger the edge of the gunwale as if it be just get ready to leap over and take possession but the hilarious koli balance himself on the sloping thwart and jump and sing and clap he hand while the pipe screech and the drum rattle twice or three time do the whole fleet go out over the bar and wheel and return each boat racing to be first with no more sense of danger than a porpoise at play at last they have have enough the sail be furl and the boat beach the big fish be take down from the bow and the whole crowd with they trophy and garland dance they way to the village there it be better that we leave they to-night great fire will be light in the middle of the main road and capacious pot of toddy will be at hand and every merry kolus will get hilariously drunk and do and say thing which we have better not see and hear and the child will look on and try to imitate they elder and woman will find it best to keep out of the way for the sake of they pretty dress if there be no better reason for pot of water dye crimson with _ goolal _ powder be ready and everybody have licence to splash everybody when he get a chance any time during the next two or three day you may find you own servant come home dappled with red so the ape have he fling and the tiger be lurk not far behind in each of those fire it be the proper thing to roast a cock throw he in alive if the fire be a great one a general village fire then it be still greater fun to throw in a live goat but the worst of these ceremony be happily go out of fashion for the english law be stern and the _ sahib _ have strange and quixotic notion about cruelty to animal and although they be far away on tour at this season and no native officer would voluntarily interfere with a immemorial custom still the tiger walk in fear in these day and the kolus be often content to roast a coconut as proxy for a cock or a goat xviii indian poverty the standard of live when mr keir hardie be in indium he satisfy himself that the standard of living among the work class in indium have be deteriorate this be interesting psychologically and one would like to know by what mean mr keir hardie attain to satisfaction on such a great and important question doubtless he have the ungrudging assistance of mr chowdry the poverty of indium have for a good many year be a handy weapon like the sailor 's belay pin for everyone who want to have at we administration of that country and if a lie which be half a truth be ever the blackest of lie then this one must be as black as tartarus for it be indubitably more than half a truth the common field-labourer in indium be about as poor as man can be he be very nearly as poor as a sparrow he hut build by himself be scarcely more substantial or permanent than the sparrow 's nest and he clothing compare very unfavourably with the sparrow 's feather the residue of he worldly goods consist of a few cooking pot and it must be admit a few ornament on he wife but a sparrow be usually well feed and quite happy it have no property simply because it want none if it store honey like the busy bee or nut like the thrifty squirrel it would be a prey to constant anxiety and stand in hourly danger of be plunder of its possession and perhaps kill for the sake of they therefore to speak of a hindu 's poverty as if it certainly imply want and unhappiness be mere misrepresentation bear of ignorance in all age there have be man so enamoured of the possessionless life that they have abandon they worldly goods and form brotherhood pledge to lifelong poverty the majority of religious beggar in indium belong to brotherhood of this kind and be the sturdiest and best-fed man to be see in the country especially in time of famine but the hindu peasant be not a beg friar and may be suppose to have some share of the love of money which be common to humanity so it be worth while to inquire why he be normally so very poor there be two reason both of which be so obvious and have so often be point out by those who have know he best that there be little excuse for overlook they the first of they be thus state in tennant 's _ indian recreation _ write in 1797 before british rule have affect the people of indium much in one direction or another industry can hardly be rank among they virtue among all class it be necessity of subsistence and not choice that urge to labor a native will not earn six rupee a month by work a few hour more if he can live upon three and if he have three he will not work at all such be the hindu a century ago in the eye of a observant and judicious man study he with all the sympathetic interest of novelty and such he be now the other reason for the chronic poverty of the indian peasant be that if he have money beyond he immediate necessity he could not keep it it be the despair of the government of indium and of every english official who endeavor to improve he condition that he can not keep he land or he cattle or anything else on which he permanent welfare depend the follow extract from _ the reminiscence of a indian police official _ give a lively picture of the effect of unaccustomed wealth not on peasant but on farmer own land and cattle and use to something like comfort yellapa like all cotton grower in that part of the western presidency profit enormously by the high price of the staple during the american war silver be pour into the country -lrb- literally -rrb- in _ crore _ -lrb- million sterling -rrb- and cultivator who previously have as much as they could do to live suddenly find themselves possess of sum they imagination have never dream of what to do with they wealth how to spend they cash be they problem have laden they woman and child with ornament and deck they out in expensive _ saree _ they launch into the wildest extravagance in the matter of cart and trot bullock go even as far as silver-plated yoke and harness stud with silver mounting even silver tyre to the wheel become the fashion twelve and fifteen rupee be eagerly pay for a pair of trot bullock trot match for large stake be common and the whole rural population appear with expensive red silk umbrella which a enterprising english firm import as likely to gratify the general taste for display many take to drink not country liquor such as have satisfy they previously but british brandy rum gin and even champagne a few page further on the author tell we of the ruin by debt and drunkenness of the family which have indulge in these extravagance the fact be that to keep for to-morrow what be in the hand to-day demand imagination purpose and self-discipline which the hindu work man have not he be the product of century during which he ruler make the life of to-morrow too uncertain while he climate make the life of to-day too easy no outward application will alone cure he poverty because it be a symptom of a inward disease when a healthier state of mind shall awaken a appetite for comfort and convenience and create necessity unknown to he father then degrade poverty will no longer be possible as the common lot and it be to be hope that the british rule would in time have this happy effect tennant evidently think that it have begin to do so even in he day the existence he say of a regular british government be but a recent circumstance yet in the course of a few year complete security have be afford to all of its dependant many new manufacture have be establish many more have be extend to answer the demand of a larger exportation we have therefore confer upon we asiatic subject a increase of security of industry and of produce and of consequent greater means of enjoyment it be therefore a very grave charge that mr keir hardie bring against the british administration when he say a century after these word be write that the standard of living among the hindu peasantry have deteriorate happily there do not appear to have be a close relation between fact and mr keir hardie 's conclusion during he indian tour so we may continue to put we confidence in the many hopeful indication that exist of a distinct improvement in the ideal of life which have so long prevail among we poor indian fellow-subject the rise in the wages of both skilled and unskilled labor during even the last thirty year especially in and near important town have be most remarkable it be more to the point to know what the labourer be able to do and actually do with he wages and here the return of trade and the report of the railway company post office and savings bank have striking evidence to offer they be publish annually and anyone even mr keir hardie may consult they who like he fact in statistical form for those who live in indium there be abundant evidence with more color in they some thirty year ago or more there be a steamship company in bombay own two small steamer which carry passenger across the harbor by degree it extend its operation and increase its fleet until it have a daily service of fast steamer with accommodation for nearly a thousand third-class passenger which go down the coast as far as goa call at every petty port on the way the head of the firm retire some year ago have make he pile seldom have a more profitable enterprise be start in bombay and whence do the profit come from the pocket of hindu peasant the mahratta of the ratnagirus district supply most of the labor require in bombay and for these the company spread its net and by they incessant come and go it amass its wealth head of mercantile firm and government office and all who have to deal with the mahratta puttiwalum view its success without surprise though always grumble at he wages he never appear to be without the means and the will to travel a marriage a religious ceremony in he family or the death of some relative require he immediate presence in he village and he ask for leave if he can not get it otherwise he offer to forfeit he pay for the period if it be still refuse he resign he situation and go this do not indicate pinch poverty there must be some margin between such man and starvation and a saunter through they village will amply confirm such a surmise it be no uncommon thing in these coast village to see that foreign luxury a chair perhaps even a easy-chair in the verandah of a common bhundaree -lrb- toddy-drawer -rrb- the rapidly grow use of chair glass tumbler enamel ironware soda-water and lemonade patent medicine and even cheap watch declare plainly that the young hindu of the present day do not live as he father do man go better dress and they child be clothe at a earlier age the advertisement in vernacular language that one meet with circulate and post up in all sort of place tell the same tale convincingly for the advertiser know he business and will not angle where no fish rise nor be large town like bombay the only place where the hindu peasant widen he horizon and acquire new taste in the fijus island there be about 22000 native of indium who go out as indentured coolie with the option of return at the end of five year at they own expense or after ten year at that of government when these man come home they bring with they new taste and new idea as well as the habit of save money and thousand of rupee save during they short exile in mauritius and south africa the hindu work man be learn the same lesson when he get back to the sleepy life of he native village he be not likely to settle down contentedly at the level from which he start on every hand in short force be at work stir discontent in the breast of the younger generation with the existence which be the heritage of they father these force operate from the outside and the mass be large and very inert : it would be rash to say that in the heart of it there be not still million who regard a monotonous struggle for a bare existence as they portion from providence but when a man who have travel in indium for half a cold season tell we that the standard of living in indium have deteriorate we be tempt to quote from sir ali baba : what be it that these travel people put on paper let I put it in the form of a conundrum q what be it that the travel mp treasure up and the anglo-indian hasten to throw away a erroneous hazy distorted impression one of the most serious duty attend a residence in indium be the correct of those misapprehension which you travel mp sacrifice he bath to hustle upon paper xix borrow indian word of the result of the roman supremacy in britain none have be so permanent as they influence on we language no doubt this be less due to any direct effect that they residence among the briton have at the time on vernacular speech than to the fact that for many century after they departure latin be the language throughout europe of literature and scholarship we supremacy in indium be act on the language of that country in both way and though it have scarcely last half as long yet as the roman rule in britain english already bid fair to become one day the common tongue of the hindu but there be also a current flow the other way comparatively insignificant but curious and interesting few person in england be aware how often they use word of indian origin in common speech in attempt to give a list of these i will exclude the trade name of article of indian produce or manufacture which have no literary interest and also word which indicate object idea or custom that be not english and therefore have no english equivalent such as tom-tom sepoy and suttee i will also omit indian word such as bundobust and griffin which be use by writer like thackeray in the same way in which french term be commonly introduce into english composition of course it be not always possible to draw a hard and fast line there be word which first come into england as the trade name of indian product but have extend they significance or entirely change it and take a permanent place in the english language pepper still mean what it originally mean but it have also become a verb another example be shawl a word which have lose all trace of its oriental origin it be a pure hindustanus word pronounce shal and indicate a article thus describe in the seventeenth century by thevenot as quote in hobson-jobson : -- une chal qui est une maniere de toilette d'une laine très fine qui se fait a cachmir with the article to england come the name but soon spread itself over all fabric wear in the same fashion except the scotch plaid which hold its own somewhat similar be calico originally a fine cotton cloth import from calicut this place be call calicot by the native and may have drop the final t through the influence of french dressmaker chintz be another example be the hindustanus word cheent which mean a spotted cotton cloth in trade fabric be always describe in the plural and the z in chintz be no doubt a perversion through misunderstanding of the terminal s lac be another indian word which have retain its own meaning but it have go beyond it and give rise to a verb to lacquer with these perhaps should be mention pyjamas and shampoo both of which have undergo strange perversion pyjama be a indian name for loose drawer or trousers tie with a cord round the waist such as mussulman of both sex wear in indium the pyjama be long ago adopt with a loose coat to match as a more decent and comfortable costume than the british nightshirt and when anglo-indian retire they bring the fashion home with they english tailor call the whole costume a pyjama suit but the second word be soon drop and the first improve into the plural number shampoo come from a verb champna to press or squeeze and the imperative champo as often happen be the form in which it become english forbe in he _ oriental memoirs _ write of the effect of opium champoing and other luxury indulge in by oriental sensualist when the medical profession in england begin to patronise the practice it assume a more dignified name massage and the old word be relegate to the hairdresser who appropriate it to the wash of the head a operation with which the word have no proper relation at all there be two word of doubtful derivation which may be mention in this connection cot in the sense of a light bed or cradle be not much use in england but be give in webster 's and other dictionary with the same saxon derivation as the cot beside the hill which the poet roger sigh for if this be correct then it be at least curious that the word should have almost go out of use in england and revive in indium from a distinct root there it be the term in every-day use for any rough bedstead such as the native sleep on and
