produce by juliet sutherland josephine paoluccus and the online distribute proofread team the essay of arthur schopenhauer translate by t bailey saunder ma the art of literature contents preface on authorship on style on the study of latin on man of learn on think for oneself on some form of literature on criticism on reputation on genius translator 's preface the contents of this as of the other volume in the series have be draw from schopenhauer 's _ parerga _ and amongst the various subject deal with in that famous collection of essay literature hold a important place nor can schopenhauer 's opinion fail to be of special value when he treat of literary form and method for quite apart from he philosophical pretension he claim recognition as a great writer he be indeed one of the best of the few really excellent prose-writer of whom germany can boast while he be thus particularly qualify to speak of literature as a art he have also something to say upon those influence which outside of he own merit contribute so much to a author 's success and be so often undervalue when he obtain immediate popularity schopenhauer 's own sore experience in the matter of reputation lend a interest to he remark upon that subject although it be too much to ask of human nature that he should approach it in any dispassionate spirit in the follow page we have observation upon style by one who be a stylist in the best sense of the word not affect nor yet a phrasemonger on think for oneself by a philosopher who never do anything else on criticism by a writer who suffer much from the inability of other to understand he on reputation by a candidate who during the greater part of he life deserve without obtain it and on genius by one who be incontestably of the privileged order himself and whatever may be think of some of he opinion on matter of detail -- on anonymity for instance or on the question whether good work be never do for money -- there can be no doubt that he general view of literature and the condition under which it flourish be perfectly sound it might be think perhaps that remark which be mean to apply to the german language would have but little bearing upon one so different from it as english this would be a just objection if schopenhauer treated literature in a petty spirit and confine himself to pedantic inquiry into matter of grammar and etymology or mere nicety of phrase but this be not so he deal with he subject broadly and take large and general view nor can anyone who know anything of the philosopher suppose this to mean that he be vague and feeble it be true that now and again in the course of these essay he make remark which be obviously mean to apply to the failing of certain writer of he own age and country but in such a case i have generally give he sentence a turn which while keep they faithful to the spirit of the original secure for they a less restricted range and make schopenhauer a critic of similar fault in whatever age or country they may appear this have be do in spite of a sharp word on page seventeen of this volume address to translator who dare to revise they author but the change be one with which not even schopenhauer could quarrel it be thus a significant fact -- a testimony to the depth of he insight and in the main the justice of he opinion -- that view of literature which appeal to he own immediate contemporary should be find to hold good elsewhere and at a distance of fifty year it mean that what he have to say be worth say and since it be adapt thus equally to diverse time and audience it be probably of permanent interest the intelligent reader will observe that much of the charm of schopenhauer 's writing come from its strongly personal character and that here he have to do not with a mere maker of book but with a man who think for himself and have no false scruple in put he meaning plainly upon the page or in unmask sham wherever he find it this be nowhere so true as when he deal with literature and just as in he treatment of life he be no flatterer to man in general so here he be free and outspoken on the peculiar failing of author at the same time he give they good advice he be particularly happy in recommend restraint in regard to read the work of other and the cultivation of independent thought and herein he recall a say attribute to hobbe who be not less distinguish as a writer than as a philosopher to the effect that _ if he have read as much as other man he should have be as ignorant as they _ schopenhauer also utter a warning which we shall do well to take to heart in these day against mingle the pursuit of literature with vulgar aim if we follow he here we shall carefully distinguish between literature as a object of life and literature as a means of live between the real love of truth and beauty and that detestable false love which look to the price it will fetch in the market i be not refer to those who while they follow a useful and honorable call in bring literature before the public be content to be know as man of business if by the help of some second witch of endor we could raise the ghost of schopenhauer it would be interesting to hear he opinion of a certain kind of literary enterprise which have come into vogue since he day and now receive a amount of attention very much beyond its due we may hazard a guess at the direction he opinion would take he would doubtless show we how this enterprise which be carry on by self-styled _ literary man _ end by make literature into a form of merchandise and treat it as though it be so much goods to be buy and sell at a profit and most likely to produce quick return if the maker 's name be well know nor would it be the ghost of the real schopenhauer unless we hear a vigorous denunciation of man who claim a connection with literature by a servile flattery of successful living author -- the dead can not be make to pay -- in the hope of appear to advantage in they reflect light and turn that advantage into money in order to present the contents of this book in a convenient form i have not scruple to make a arrangement with the chapter somewhat different from that which exist in the original so that two or more subject which be there deal with successively in one and the same chapter here stand by themselves in consequence of this some of the title of the section be not to be find in the original i may state however that the essay on _ authorship _ and _ style _ and the latter part of that on _ criticism _ be take direct from the chapter head _ ueber schriftstellereus und stil _ and that the remainder of the essay on _ criticism _ with that of _ reputation _ be supply by the remark _ ueber urtheil kritik beifall und ruhm _ the essay on _ the study of latin _ on _ man of learn _ and on _ some form of literature _ be take chiefly from the four section _ ueber gelehrsamkeit und gelehrte ueber sprache und worte ueber lesen und bücher : anhang _ and _ zur metaphysik des schönen _ the essay on _ thinking for oneself _ be a rendering of certain remark under the head _ selbstdenken genius _ be a favorite subject of speculation with schopenhauer and he often touch upon it in the course of he work always however to put forth the same theory in regard to it as may be find in the conclude section of this volume though the essay have little or nothing to do with literary method the subject of which it treat be the most needful element of success in literature and i have introduce it on that ground it form part of a chapter in the _ parerga _ entitle _ den intellekt überhaupt und in jeder beziehung betreffende gedanken : anhang verwandter stellen _ it have also be part of my duty to invent a title for this volume and i be well aware that objection may be make to the one i have choose on the ground that in common language it be unusual to speak of literature as a art and that to do so be unduly to narrow its meaning and to leave out of sight its main function as the record of thought but there be no reason why the word _ literature _ should not be employ in that double sense which be allow to attach to _ painting music sculpture _ as signify either the objective outcome of a certain mental activity seek to express itself in outward form or else the particular kind of mental activity in question and the method it follow and we do in fact use it in this latter sense when we say of a writer that he pursue literature as a call if then literature can be take to mean a process as well as a result of mental activity there can be no error in speaking of it as art i use that term in its broad sense as mean skill in the display of thought or more fully a right use of the rule of apply to the practical exhibition of think with whatever material it may deal in connection with literature this be a sense and a application of the term which have be sufficiently establish by the example of the great writer of antiquity it may be ask of course whether the true thinker who will always form the soul of the true author will not be so much occupy with what he have to say that it will appear to he a trivial thing to spend great effort on embellish the form in which he deliver it literature to be worthy of the name must it be true deal with noble matter -- the riddle of we existence the great fact of life the change passion of the human heart the discernment of some deep moral truth it be easy to lay too much stress upon the mere garment of think to be too precise to give to the arrangement of word a attention that should rather be pay to the promotion of fresh idea a writer who make this mistake be like a fop who spend he little mind in adorn he person in short it may be charge against the view of literature which be take in call it a art that instead of make truth and insight the author 's aim it favor sciolism and a fantastic and affected style there be no doubt some justice in the objection nor have we in we own day and especially amongst younger man any lack of writer who endeavor to win confidence not by add to the stock of idea in the world but by despise the use of plain language they fault be not new in the history of literature and it be a please sign of schopenhauer 's insight that a merciless exposure of they as they exist half a century ago be still quite applicable to they modern form and since these writer who may in the slang of the hour be call impressionist in literature follow they own bad taste in the manufacture of dainty phrase devoid of all nerve and generally with some quite commonplace mean it be all the more necessary to discriminate carefully between artifice and art but although they may learn something from schopenhauer 's advice it be not chiefly to they that it be offer it be to that great mass of writer whose business be to fill the column of the newspaper and the page of the review and to produce the ton of novel that appear every year now that almost everyone who can hold a pen aspire to be call a author it be well to emphasize the fact that literature be a art in some respects more important than any other the problem of this art be the discovery of those quality of style and treatment which entitle any work to be call good literature it will be safe to warn the reader at the very outset that if he wish to avoid be lead astray he should in he search for these quality turn to book that have stand the test of time for such a amount of hasty writing be do in these day that it be really difficult for anyone who read much of it to avoid contract its fault and thus gradually come to term of dangerous familiarity with bad method this advice will be especially needful if thing that have little or no claim to be call literature at all -- the newspaper the monthly magazine and the last new tale of intrigue or adventure -- fill a large measure if not the whole of the time give to read nor be those who be sincerely anxious to have the best think in the best language quite free from danger if they give too much attention to the contemporary author even though these seem to think and write excellently for one generation alone be incompetent to decide upon the merit of any author whatever and as literature like all art be a thing of human invention so it can be pronounced good only if it obtain lasting admiration by establish a permanent appeal to mankind 's deepest feeling for truth and beauty it be in this sense that schopenhauer be perfectly right in hold that neglect of the ancient classic which be the best of all model in the art of write will infallibly lead to a degeneration of literature and the method of discover the best quality of style and of form a theory of write be not to follow some trick or mannerism that happen to please for the moment but to study the way in which great author have do they best work it will be say that schopenhauer tell we nothing we do not know before perhaps so as he himself say the best thing be seldom new but he put the old truth in a fresh and forcible way and no one who know anything of good literature will deny that these truth be just now of very fit application it be probably to meet a real want that a year or two ago a ingenious person succeed in draw a great number of english and american writer into a confession of they literary creed and the art they adopt in authorship and the interesting volume in which he give these confession to the world contain some very good advice although most of it have be say before in different form more recently a new departure of very doubtful use have take place and two book have be issue which aim the one at be a author 's manual the other at give hint on essay and how to write they a glance at these book will probably show that they author have still something to learn both of these venture seem unhappily to be popular and although they may claim a position next-door to that of the present volume i beg to say that it have no connection with they whatever schopenhauer do not attempt to teach the art of make brick without straw i wish to take this opportunity of tender my thanks to a large number of reviewer for the very gratifying reception give to the earlier volume of this series and i have great pleasure in express my obligation to my friend mr wg collingwood who have look over most of my proof and often give I excellent advice in my effort to turn schopenhauer into readable english tb on authorship there be first of all two kind of author : those who write for the subject 's sake and those who write for write 's sake while the one have have thought or experience which seem to they worth communicate the other want money and so they write for money they thinking be part of the business of write they may be recognize by the way in which they spin out they thought to the greatest possible length then too by the very nature of they thought which be only half-true perverse forced vacillate again by the aversion they generally show to say anything straight out so that they may seem other than they be hence they writing be deficient in clearness and definiteness and it be not long before they betray that they only object in write at all be to cover paper this sometimes happen with the best author now and then for example with lessing in he _ dramaturgie _ and even in many of jean paul 's romance as soon as the reader perceive this let he throw the book away for time be precious the truth be that when a author begin to write for the sake of cover paper he be cheat the reader because he write under the pretext that he have something to say write for money and reservation of copyright be at bottom the ruin of literature no one write anything that be worth write unless he write entirely for the sake of he subject what a inestimable boon it would be if in every branch of literature there be only a few book but those excellent this can never happen as long as money be to be make by write it seem as though the money lay under a curse for every author degenerate as soon as he begin to put pen to paper in any way for the sake of gain the best work of the greatest man all come from the time when they have to write for nothing or for very little and here too that spanish proverb hold good which declare that honor and money be not to be find in the same purse -- _ honora y provecho no caben en un saco _ the reason why literature be in such a bad plight nowadays be simply and solely that people write book to make money a man who be in want sit down and write a book and the public be stupid enough to buy it the secondary effect of this be the ruin of language a great many bad writer make they whole living by that foolish mania of the public for read nothing but what have just be print -- journalist i mean truly a most appropriate name in plain language it be _ journeyman day-laborer _ again it may be say that there be three kind of author first come those who write without think they write from a full memory from reminiscence it may be even straight out of other people 's book this class be the most numerous then come those who do they thinking whilst they be write they think in order to write and there be no lack of they last of all come those author who think before they begin to write they be rare author of the second class who put off they think until they come to write be like a sportsman who go forth at random and be not likely to bring very much home on the other hand when a author of the third or rare class write it be like a _ battue _ here the game have be previously capture and shut up within a very small space from which it be afterwards let out so many at a time into another space also confine the game can not possibly escape the sportsman he have nothing to do but aim and fire -- in other word write down he thought this be a kind of sport from which a man have something to show but even though the number of those who really think seriously before they begin to write be small extremely few of they think about _ the subject itself _ : the remainder think only about the book that have be write on the subject and what have be say by other in order to think at all such writer need the more direct and powerful stimulus of have other people 's thought before they these become they immediate theme and the result be that they be always under they influence and so never in any real sense of the word be original but the former be rouse to think by the subject itself to which they thinking be thus immediately direct this be the only class that produce writer of abide fame it must of course be understand that i be speak here of writer who treat of great subject not of writer on the art of make brandy unless a author take the material on which he write out of he own head that be to say from he own observation he be not worth read book-manufacturer compiler the common run of history-writer and many other of the same class take they material immediately out of book and the material go straight to they finger-tip without even pay freight or undergo examination as it pass through they head to say nothing of elaboration or revision how very learn many a man would be if he know everything that be in he own book the consequence of this be that these writer talk in such a loose and vague manner that the reader puzzle he brain in vain to understand what it be of which they be really think they be think of nothing it may now and then be the case that the book from which they copy have be compose exactly in the same way : so that writing of this sort be like a plaster cast of a cast and in the end the bare outline of the face and that too hardly recognizable be all that be leave to you antinous let compilation be read as seldom as possible it be difficult to avoid they altogether since compilation also include those text-book which contain in a small space the accumulate knowledge of century there be no greater mistake than to suppose that the last work be always the more correct that what be write later on be in every case a improvement on what be write before and that change always mean progress real thinker man of right judgment people who be in earnest with they subject -- these be all exception only vermin be the rule everywhere in the world : it be always on the alert take the mature opinion of the thinker and industriously seek to improve upon they -lrb- save the mark -rrb- in its own peculiar way if the reader wish to study any subject let he beware of rush to the newest book upon it and confine he attention to they alone under the notion that science be always advance and that the old book have be draw upon in the writing of the new they have be draw upon it be true but how the writer of the new book often do not understand the old book thoroughly and yet he be unwilling to take they exact word so he bungle they and say in he own bad way that which have be say very much better and more clearly by the old writer who write from they own lively knowledge of the subject the new writer frequently omit the best thing they say they most striking illustration they happiest remark because he do not see they value or feel how pregnant they be the only thing that appeal to he be what be shallow and insipid it often happen that a old and excellent book be oust by new and bad one which write for money appear with a air of great pretension and much puffing on the part of friend in science a man try to make he mark by bring out something fresh this often mean nothing more than that he attack some receive theory which be quite correct in order to make room for he own false notion sometimes the effort be successful for a time and then a return be make to the old and true theory these innovator be serious about nothing but they own precious self : it be this that they want to put forward and the quick way of do so as they think be to start a paradox they sterile head take naturally to the path of negation so they begin to deny truth that have long be admit -- the vital power for example the sympathetic nervous system _ generatio equivoca _ bichat 's distinction between the working of the passion and the working of intelligence or else they want we to return to crass atomism and the like hence it frequently happen that _ the course of science be retrogressive _ to this class of writer belong those translator who not only translate they author but also correct and revise he a proceeding which always seem to I impertinent to such writer i say : write book yourself which be worth translate and leave other people 's work as they be the reader should study if he can the real author the man who have found and discover thing or at any rate those who be recognize as the great master in every branch of knowledge let he buy second-hand book rather than read they contents in new one to be sure it be easy to add to any new discovery -- _ inventi aliquid addere facile est _ and therefore the student after well master the rudiment of he subject will have to make himself acquaint with the more recent addition to the knowledge of it and in general the follow rule may be lay down here as elsewhere : if a thing be new it be seldom good because if it be good it be only for a short time new what the address be to a letter the title should be to a book in other word its main object should be to bring the book to those amongst the public who will take a interest in its contents it should therefore be expressive and since by its very nature it must be short it should be concise laconic pregnant and if possible give the contents in one word a prolix title be bad and so be one that say nothing or be obscure and ambiguous or even it may be false and misleading this last may possibly involve the book in the same fate as overtake a wrongly address letter the worst title of all be those which have be steal those i mean which have already be bear by other book for they be in the first place a plagiarism and secondly the most convincing proof of a total lack of originality in the author a man who have not enough originality to invent a new title for he book will be still less able to give it new contents akin to these steal title be those which have be imitate that be to say steal to the extent of one half for instance long after i have produce my treatise _ on will in nature _ oerst write a book entitle _ on mind in nature _ a book can never be anything more than the impress of its author 's thought and the value of these will lie either in _ the matter about which he have think _ or in the _ form _ which he thought take in other word _ what it be that he have think about it _ the matter of book be most various and various also be the several excellence attach to book on the score of they matter by matter i mean everything that come within the domain of actual experience that be to say the fact of history and the fact of nature take in and by themselves and in they widest sense here it be the _ thing _ treat of which give its peculiar character to the book so that a book can be important whoever it be that write it but in regard to the form the peculiar character of a book depend upon the _ person _ who write it it may treat of matter which be accessible to everyone and well know but it be the way in which they be treat what it be that be think about they that give the book its value and this come from its author if then from this point of view a book be excellent and beyond comparison so be its author it follow that if a writer be worth read he merit rise just in proportion as he owe little to he matter therefore the better known and the more hackneyed this be the greater he will be the three great tragedian of greece for example all work at the same subject-matter so when a book be celebrated care should be take to note whether it be so on account of its matter or its form and a distinction should be make accordingly book of great importance on account of they matter may proceed from very ordinary and shallow people by the fact that they alone have have access to this matter book for instance which describe journey in distant land rare natural phenomenon or experiment or historical occurrence of which the writer be witness or in connection with which they have spend much time and trouble in the research and special study of original document on the other hand where the matter be accessible to everyone or very well know everything will depend upon the form and what it be that be think about the matter will give the book all the value it possess here only a really distinguished man will be able to produce anything worth read for the other will think nothing but what anyone else can think they will just produce a impress of they own mind but this be a print of which everyone possess the original however the public be very much more concerned to have matter than form and for this very reason it be deficient in any high degree of culture the public show its preference in this respect in the most laughable way when it come to deal with poetry for there it devote much trouble to the task of track out the actual event or personal circumstance in the life of the poet which serve as the occasion of he various work nay these event and circumstance come in the end to be of greater importance than the work themselves and rather than read goethe himself people prefer to read what have be write about he and to study the legend of faust more industriously than the drama of that name and when bürger declare that people would write learn disquisition on the question who leonora really be we find this literally fulfil in goethe 's case for we now possess a great many learn disquisition on faust and the legend attach to he study of this kind be and remain devoted to the material of the drama alone to give such preference to the matter over the form be as though a man be to take a fine etruscan vase not to admire its shape or coloring but to make a chemical analysis of the clay and paint of which it be compose the attempt to produce a effect by means of the material employ -- a attempt which pander to this evil tendency of the public -- be most to be condemn in branch of literature where any merit there may be lie expressly in the form i mean in poetical work for all that it be not rare to find bad dramatist try to fill the house by means of the matter about which they write for example author of this kind do not shrink from put on the stage any man who be in any way celebrate no matter whether he life may have be entirely devoid of dramatic incident and sometimes even they do not wait until the person immediately connect with he be dead the distinction between matter and form to which i be here allude also hold good of conversation the chief quality which enable a man to converse well be intelligence discernment wit and vivacity : these supply the form of conversation but it be not long before attention have to be pay to the matter of which he speak in other word the subject about which it be possible to converse with he -- he knowledge if this be very small he conversation will not be worth anything unless he possess the above-named formal quality in a very exceptional degree for he will have nothing to talk about but those fact of life and nature which everybody know it will be just the opposite however if a man be deficient in these formal quality but have a amount of knowledge which lend value to what he say this value will then depend entirely upon the matter of he conversation for as the spanish proverb have it _ mas sabe el necio en su casa que el sabio en la agena _ -- a fool know more of he own business than a wise man do of other on style style be the physiognomy of the mind and a safer index to character than the face to imitate another man 's style be like wear a mask which be it never so fine be not long in arouse disgust and abhorrence because it be lifeless so that even the ugliest living face be better hence those who write in latin and copy the manner of ancient author may be say to speak through a mask the reader it be true hear what they say but he can not observe they physiognomy too he can not see they _ style _ with the latin work of writer who think for themselves the case be different and they style be visible writer i mean who have not condescend to any sort of imitation such as scotus erigena petrarch bacon descarte spinoza and many other a affectation in style be like make grimace further the language in which a man write be the physiognomy of the nation to which he belong and here there be many hard and fast difference begin from the language of the greek down to that of the caribbean islander to form a provincial estimate of the value of a writer 's production it be not directly necessary to know the subject on which he have think or what it be that he have say about it that would imply a perusal of all he work it will be enough in the main to know _ how _ he have think this which mean the essential temper or general quality of he mind may be precisely determine by he style a man 's style show the _ formal _ nature of all he thought -- the formal nature which can never change be the subject or the character of he thought what it may : it be as it be the dough out of which all the contents of he mind be knead when eulenspiegel be ask how long it would take to walk to the next village he give the seemingly incongruous answer : _ walk _ he want to find out by the man 's pace the distance he would cover in a give time in the same way when i have read a few page of a author i know fairly well how far he can bring I every mediocre writer try to mask he own natural style because in he heart he know the truth of what i be say he be thus force at the outset to give up any attempt at be frank or naïve -- a privilege which be thereby reserve for superior mind conscious of they own worth and therefore sure of themselves what i mean be that these everyday writer be absolutely unable to resolve upon write just as they think because they have a notion that be they to do so they work might possibly look very childish and simple for all that it would not be without its value if they would only go honestly to work and say quite simply the thing they have really think and just as they have think they these writer would be readable and within they own proper sphere even instructive but instead of that they try to make the reader believe that they thought have go much further and deeper than be really the case they say what they have to say in long sentence that wind about in a force and unnatural way they coin new word and write prolix period which go round and round the thought and wrap it up in a sort of disguise they tremble between the two separate aim of communicate what they want to say and of conceal it they object be to dress it up so that it may look learn or deep in order to give people the impression that there be very much more in it than for the moment meet the eye they either jot down they thought bite by bit in short ambiguous and paradoxical sentence which apparently mean much more than they say -- of this kind of write schelling 's treatise on natural philosophy be a splendid instance or else they hold forth with a deluge of word and the most intolerable diffusiveness as though no end of fuss be necessary to make the reader understand the deep meaning of they sentence whereas it be some quite simple if not actually trivial idea -- example of which may be find in plenty in the popular work of fichte and the philosophical manual of a hundred other miserable dunce not worth mention or again they try to write in some particular style which they have be please to take up and think very grand a style for example _ par excellence _ profound and scientific where the reader be torment to death by the narcotic effect of longspun period without a single idea in they -- such as be furnish in a special measure by those most impudent of all mortal the hegelian -lrb- 1 -rrb- or it may be that it be a intellectual style they have strive after where it seem as though they object be to go crazy altogether and so on in many other case all these endeavor to put off the _ nascetur ridiculus mu _ -- to avoid show the funny little creature that be bear after such mighty throe -- often make it difficult to know what it be that they really mean and then too they write down word nay even whole sentence without attach any mean to they themselves but in the hope that someone else will get sense out of they -lrb- footnote 1 : in they hegel-gazette commonly know as _ jahrbücher der wissenschaftlichen literatur _ -rrb- and what be at the bottom of all this nothing but the untiring effort to sell word for thought a mode of merchandise that be always try to make fresh opening for itself and by means of odd expression turn of phrase and combination of every sort whether new or use in a new sense to produce the appearence of intellect in order to make up for the very painfully feel lack of it it be amusing to see how writer with this object in view will attempt first one mannerism and then another as though they be put on the mask of intellect this mask may possibly deceive the inexperienced for a while until it be see to be a dead thing with no life in it at all it be then laugh at and exchange for another such a author will at one moment write in a dithyrambic vein as though he be tipsy at another nay on the very next page he will be pompous severe profoundly learn and prolix stumble on in the most cumbrous way and chop up everything very small like the late christian wolf only in a modern dress longest of all last the mask of unintelligibility but this be only in germany whither it be introduce by fichte perfect by schelling and carry to its highest pitch in hegel -- always with the best result and yet nothing be easier than to write so that no one can understand just as contrarily nothing be more difficult than to express deep thing in such a way that every one must necessarily grasp they all the art and trick i have be mention be render superfluous if the author really have any brain for that allow he to show himself as he be and confirm to all time horace 's maxim that good sense be the source and origin of good style : _ scribendus recte sapere est et principium et fons _ but those author i have name be like certain worker in metal who try a hundred different compound to take the place of gold -- the only metal which can never have any substitute rather than do that there be nothing against which a writer should be more upon he guard than the manifest endeavor to exhibit more intellect than he really have because this make the reader suspect that he possess very little since it be always the case that if a man affect anything whatever it may be it be just there that he be deficient that be why it be praise to a author to say that he be _ naïve _ it mean that he need not shrink from show himself as he be generally speak to be _ naïve _ be to be attractive while lack of naturalness be everywhere repulsive as a matter of fact we find that every really great writer try to express he thought as purely clearly definitely and shortly as possible simplicity have always be hold to be a mark of truth it be also a mark of genius style receive its beauty from the thought it express but with sham-thinker the thought be suppose to be fine because of the style style be nothing but the mere silhouette of thought and a obscure or bad style mean a dull or confused brain the first rule then for a good style be that _ the author should have something to say _ nay this be in itself almost all that be necessary ah how much it mean the neglect of this rule be a fundamental trait in the philosophical writing and in fact in all the reflective literature of my country more especially since fichte these writer all let it be see that they want to appear as though they have something to say whereas they have nothing to say writing of this kind be bring in by the pseudo-philosopher at the university and now it be current everywhere even among the first literary notability of the age it be the mother of that strained and vague style where there seem to be two or even more meaning in the sentence also of that prolix and cumbrous manner of expression call _ le stile empesé _ again of that mere waste of word which consist in pour they out like a flood finally of that trick of conceal the direst poverty of think under a farrago of never-ending chatter which clack away like a windmill and quite stupefy one -- stuff which a man may read for hour together without get hold of a single clearly express and definite idea -lrb- 1 -rrb- however people be easy-going and they have form the habit of read page upon page of all sort of such verbiage without have any particular idea of what the author really mean they fancy it be all as it should be and fail to discover that he be write simply for write 's sake -lrb- footnote 1 : select example of the art of write in this style be to be find almost _ passim _ in the _ jahrbücher _ publish at halle afterwards call the _ deutschen jahrbücher _ -rrb- on the other hand a good author fertile in idea soon win he reader 's confidence that when he write he have really and truly _ something to say _ and this give the intelligent reader patience to follow he with attention such a author just because he really have something to say will never fail to express himself in the simplest and most straightforward manner because he object be to awake the very same think in the reader that he have in himself and no other so he will be able to affirm with boileau that he thought be everywhere open to the light of the day and that he verse always say something whether it say it well or ill : _ ma pensée au grand jour partout s ` offre et s ` expose et mon vers bien ou mal dit toujors quelque choose _ : while of the writer previously describe it may be assert in the word of the same poet that they talk much and never say anything at all -- _ quiparlant beaucoup ne disent jamai rien _ another characteristic of such writer be that they always avoid a positive assertion wherever they can possibly do so in order to leave a loophole for escape in case of need hence they never fail to choose the more _ abstract _ way of express themselves whereas intelligent people use the more _ concrete _ because the latter bring thing more within the range of actual demonstration which be the source of all evidence there be many example prove this preference for abstract expression and a particularly ridiculous one be afford by the use of the verb _ to condition _ in the sense of _ to cause _ or _ to produce _ people say _ to condition something _ instead of _ to cause it _ because be abstract and indefinite it say less it affirm that _ a _ can not happen without _ b _ instead of that _ a _ be cause by _ b _ a back door be always leave open and this suit people whose secret knowledge of they own incapacity inspire they with a perpetual terror of all positive assertion while with other people it be merely the effect of that tendency by which everything that be stupid in literature or bad in life be immediately imitate -- a fact prove in either case by the rapid way in which it spread the englishman use he own judgment in what he write as well as in what he do but there be no nation of which this eulogy be less true than of the german the consequence of this state of thing be that the word _ cause _ have of late almost disappear from the language of literature and people talk only of _ condition _ the fact be worth mention because it be so characteristically ridiculous the very fact that these commonplace author be never more than half-conscious when they write would be enough to account for they dullness of mind and the tedious thing they produce i say they be only half-conscious because they really do not themselves understand the meaning of the word they use : they take word ready-made and commit they to memory hence when they write it be not so much word as whole phrase that they put together -- _ phrase banale _ this be the explanation of that palpable lack of clearly-expressed thought in what they say the fact be that they do not possess the die to give this stamp to they write clear thought of they own be just what they have not get and what do we find in its place -- a vague enigmatical intermixture of word current phrase hackneyed term and fashionable expression the result be that the foggy stuff they write be like a page print with very old type on the other hand a intelligent author really speak to we when he write and that be why he be able to rouse we interest and commune with we it be the intelligent author alone who put individual word together with a full consciousness of they meaning and choose they with deliberate design consequently he discourse stand to that of the writer describe above much as a picture that have be really paint to one that have be produce by the use of a stencil in the one case every word every touch of the brush have a special purpose in the other all be do mechanically the same distinction may be observe in music for just as lichtenberg say that garrick 's soul seem to be in every muscle in he body so it be the omnipresence of intellect that always and everywhere characterize the work of genius i have allude to the tediousness which mark the work of these writer and in this connection it be to be observe generally that tediousness be of two kind objective and subjective a work be objectively tedious when it contain the defect in question that be to say when its author have no perfectly clear thought or knowledge to communicate for if a man have any clear thought or knowledge in he he aim will be to communicate it and he will direct he energy to this end so that the idea he furnish be everywhere clearly express the result be that he be neither diffuse nor unmeaning nor confused and consequently not tedious in such a case even though the author be at bottom in error the error be at any rate clearly work out and well think over so that it be at least formally correct and thus some value always attach to the work but for the same reason a work that be objectively tedious be at all time devoid of any value whatever the other kind of tediousness be only relative : a reader may find a work dull because he have no interest in the question treat of in it and this mean that he intellect be restricted the best work may therefore be tedious subjectively tedious i mean to this or that particular person just as contrarity the worst work may be subjectively engross to this or that particular person who have a interest in the question treat of or in the writer of the book it would generally serve writer in good stead if they would see that whilst a man should if possible think like a great genius he should talk the same language as everyone else author should use common word to say uncommon thing but they do just the opposite we find they try to wrap up trivial idea in grand word and to clothe they very ordinary thought in the most extraordinary phrase the most far-fetched unnatural and out-of-the-way expression they sentence perpetually stalk about on stilt they take so much pleasure in bombast and write in such a high-flown bloated affected hyperbolical and acrobatic style that they prototype be ancient pistol whom he friend falstaff once impatiently tell to say what he have to say _ like a man of this world _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ king henry iv _ part ii act v sc 3 -rrb- there be no expression in any other language exactly answer to the french _ stile empesé _ but the thing itself exist all the more often when associate with affectation it be in literature what assumption of dignity grand air and primeness be in society and equally intolerable dullness of mind be fond of don this dress just as a ordinary life it be stupid people who like be demure and formal a author who write in the prim style resemble a man who dress himself up in order to avoid be confound or put on the same level with a mob -- a risk never run by the _ gentleman _ even in he worst clothes the plebeian may be know by a certain showiness of attire and a wish to have everything spick and span and in the same way the commonplace person be betray by he style nevertheless a author follow a false aim if he try to write exactly as he speak there be no style of write but should have a certain trace of kinship with the _ epigraphic _ or _ monumental _ style which be indeed the ancestor of all style for a author to write as he speak be just as reprehensible as the opposite fault to speak as he write for this give a pedantic effect to what he say and at the same time make he hardly intelligible a obscure and vague manner of expression be always and everywhere a very bad sign in ninety-nine case out of a hundred it come from vagueness of thought and this again almost always mean that there be something radically wrong and incongruous about the think itself -- in a word that it be incorrect when a right thought spring up in the mind it strive after expression and be not long in reach it for clear thought easily find word to fit it if a man be capable of think anything at all he be also always able to express it in clear intelligible and unambiguous term those writer who construct difficult obscure involve and equivocal sentence most certainly do not know aright what it be that they want to say : they have only a dull consciousness of it which be still in the stage of struggle to shape itself as think often indeed they desire be to conceal from themselves and other that they really have nothing at all to say they wish to appear to know what they do not know to think what they do not think to say what they do not say if a man have some real communication to make which will he choose -- a indistinct or a clear way of express himself even quintilian remark that thing which be say by a highly educate man be often easier to understand and much clearer and that the less educate a man be the more obscurely he will write -- _ plerumque accidit ut faciliora sint ad intelligendum et lucidiora multo que a doctissimo quoque dicuntur _ _ erit ergo etiam obscurior quo quisque deterior _ a author should avoid enigmatical phrase he should know whether he want to say a thing or do not want to say it it be this indecision of style that make so many writer insipid the only case that offer a exception to this rule arise when it be necessary to make a remark that be in some way improper as exaggeration generally produce a effect the opposite of that aim at so word it be true serve to make thought intelligible -- but only up to a certain point if word be heap up beyond it the thought become more and more obscure again to find where the point lie be the problem of style and the business of the critical faculty for a word too much always defeat its purpose this be what voltaire mean when he say that _ the adjective be the enemy of the substantive _ but as we have see many people try to conceal they poverty of think under a flood of verbiage accordingly let all redundancy be avoid all string together of remark which have no meaning and be not worth perusal a writer must make a spare use of the reader 's time patience and attention so as to lead he to believe that he author write what be worth careful study and will reward the time spend upon it it be always better to omit something good than to add that which be not worth say at all this be the right application of hesiod 's maxim -lrb- greek : pleon aemisu panto -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- the half be more than the whole _ le secret pour être ennuyeux c'est de tout dire _ therefore if possible the quintessence only mere lead thought nothing that the reader would think for himself to use many word to communicate few thought be everywhere the unmistakable sign of mediocrity to gather much thought into few word stamp the man of genius -lrb- footnote 1 : _ work and day _ 40 -rrb- truth be most beautiful undraped and the impression it make be deep in proportion as its expression have be simple this be so partly because it then take unobstructed possession of the hearer 's whole soul and leave he no by-thought to distract he partly also because he feel that here he be not be corrupt or cheat by the art of rhetoric but that all the effect of what be say come from the thing itself for instance what declamation on the vanity of human existence could ever be more tell than the word of job _ man that be bear of a woman have but a short time to live and be full of misery he cometh up and be cut down like a flower he fleeth as it be a shadow and never continueth in one stay _ for the same reason goethe 's naïve poetry be incomparably greater than schiller 's rhetoric it be this again that make many popular song so affect as in architecture a excess of decoration be to be avoid so in the art of literature a writer must guard against all rhetorical finery all useless amplification and all superfluity of expression in general in a word he must strive after _ chastity _ of style every word that can be spare be hurtful if it remain the law of simplicity and naïveté hold good of all fine art for it be quite possible to be at once simple and sublime true brevity of expression consist in everywhere say only what be worth say and in avoid tedious detail about thing which everyone can supply for himself this involve correct discrimination between what it necessary and what be superfluous a writer should never be brief at the expense of be clear to say nothing of be grammatical it show lamentable want of judgment to weaken the expression of a thought or to stunt the meaning of a period for the sake of use a few word less but this be the precise endeavor of that false brevity nowadays so much in vogue which proceed by leave out useful word and even by sacrifice grammar and logic it be not only that such writer spare a word by make a single verb or adjective do duty for several different period so that the reader as it be have to grope he way through they in the dark they also practice in many other respects a unseemingly economy of speech in the effort to effect what they foolishly take to be brevity of expression and conciseness of style by omit something that might have throw a light over the whole sentence they turn it into a conundrum which the reader try to solve by go over it again and again -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- in the original schopenhauer here enter upon a lengthy examination of certain common error in the writing and speaking of german he remark be address to he own countryman and would lose all point even if they be intelligible in a english translation but for those who practice they german by converse or correspond with german let I recommend what he there say as a useful corrective to a slipshod style such as can easily be contract if it be assume that the native of a country always know they own language perfectly -rrb- it be wealth and weight of thought and nothing else that give brevity to style and make it concise and pregnant if a writer 's idea be important luminous and generally worth communicate they will necessarily furnish matter and substance enough to fill out the period which give they expression and make these in all they part both grammatically and verbally complete and so much will this be the case that no one will ever find they hollow empty or feeble the diction will everywhere be brief and pregnant and allow the thought to find intelligible and easy expression and even unfold and move about with grace therefore instead of contract he word and form of speech let a writer enlarge he thought if a man have be thin by illness and find he clothes too big it be not by cut they down but by recover he usual bodily condition that he ought to make they fit he again let I here mention a error of style very prevalent nowadays and in the degraded state of literature and the neglect of ancient language always on the increase i mean _ subjectivity _ a writer commit this error when he think it enough if he himself know what he mean and want to say and take no thought for the reader who be leave to get at the bottom of it as best he can this be as though the author be hold a monologue whereas it ought to be a dialogue and a dialogue too in which he must express himself all the more clearly inasmuch as he can not hear the question of he interlocutor style should for this very reason never be subjective but _ objective _ and it will not be objective unless the word be so set down that they directly force the reader to think precisely the same thing as the author think when he write they nor will this result be obtain unless the author have always be careful to remember that think so far follow the law of gravity that it travel from head to paper much more easily than from paper to head so that he must assist the latter passage by every means in he power if he do this a writer 's word will have a purely objective effect like that of a finished picture in oils whilst the subjective style be not much more certain in its working than spot on the wall which look like figure only to one whose phantasy have be accidentally arouse by they other people see nothing but spot and blur the difference in question apply to literary method as a whole but it be often establish also in particular instance for example in a recently publish work i find the following sentence : _ i have not write in order to increase the number of exist book _ this mean just the opposite of what the writer want to say and be nonsense as well he who write carelessly confess thereby at the very outset that he do not attach much importance to he own thought for it be only where a man be convince of the truth and importance of he thought that he feel the enthusiasm necessary for a untiring and assiduous effort to find the clearest finest and strongest expression for they -- just as for sacred relic or priceless work of art there be provide silvern or golden receptacle it be this feeling that lead ancient author whose thought express in they own word have live thousand of year and therefore bear the honor title of _ classic _ always to write with care plato indeed be say to have write the introduction to he _ republic _ seven time over in different way -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- it be a fact worth mention that the first twelve word of the _ republic _ be place in the exact order which would be natural in english -rrb- as neglect of dress betray want of respect for the company a man meet so a hasty careless bad style show a outrageous lack of regard for the reader who then rightly punish it by refuse to read the book it be especially amusing to see reviewer criticise the work of other in they own most careless style -- the style of a hirele it be as though a judge be to come into court in dressing-gown and slipper if i see a man badly and dirtily dress i feel some hesitation at first in enter into conversation with he : and when on take up a book i be strike at once by the negligence of its style i put it away good writing should be govern by the rule that a man can think only one thing clearly at a time and therefore that he should not be expect to think two or even more thing in one and the same moment but this be what be do when a writer break up he principal sentence into little piece for the purpose of push into the gap thus make two or three other thought by way of parenthesis thereby unnecessarily and wantonly confuse the reader and here it be again my own countryman who be chiefly in fault that german lend itself to this way of write make the thing possible but do not justify it no prose read more easily or pleasantly than french because as a rule it be free from the error in question the frenchman string he thought together as far as he can in the most logical and natural order and so lay they before he reader one after the other for convenient deliberation so that every one of they may receive undivided attention the german on the other hand weave they together into a sentence which he twist and cross and cross and twist again because he want to say six thing all at once instead of advance they one by one he aim should be to attract and hold the reader 's attention but above and beyond neglect of this aim he demand from the reader that he shall set the above mention rule at defiance and think three or four different thought at one and the same time or since that be impossible that he thought shall succeed each other as quickly as the vibration of a cord in this way a author lay the foundation of he _ stile empesé _ which be then carry to perfection by the use of high-flown pompous expression to communicate the simplest thing and other artifice of the same kind in those long sentence rich in involved parenthesis like a box of box one within another and pad out like roast goose stuff with apple it be really the _ memory _ that be chiefly tax while it be the understanding and the judgment which should be call into play instead of have they activity thereby actually hinder and weaken -lrb- 1 -rrb- this kind of sentence furnish the reader with mere half-phrase which he be then call upon to collect carefully and store up in he memory as though they be the piece of a torn letter afterwards to be complete and make sense of by the other half to which they respectively belong he be expect to go on reading for a little without exercise any thought nay exert only he memory in the hope that when he come to the end of the sentence he may see its meaning and so receive something to think about and he be thus give a great deal to learn by heart before obtain anything to understand this be manifestly wrong and a abuse of the reader 's patience -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- this sentence in the original be obviously mean to illustrate the fault of which it speak it do so by the use of a construction very common in german but happily unknown in english where however the fault itself exist none the less though in different form -rrb- the ordinary writer have a unmistakable preference for this style because it cause the reader to spend time and trouble in understand that which he would have understand in a moment without it and this make it look as though the writer have more depth and intelligence than the reader this be indeed one of those artifice refer to above by means of which mediocre author unconsciously and as it be by instinct strive to conceal they poverty of thought and give a appearance of the opposite they ingenuity in this respect be really astounding it be manifestly against all sound reason to put one think obliquely on top of another as though both together form a wooden cross but this be what be do where a writer interrupt what he have begin to say for the purpose of insert some quite alien matter thus deposit with the reader a meaningless half-sentence and bidding he keep it until the completion come it be much as though a man be to treat he guest by hand they a empty plate in the hope of something appear upon it and comma use for a similar purpose belong to the same family as note at the foot of the page and parenthesis in the middle of the text nay all three differ only in degree if demosthene and cicero occasionally insert word by way of parenthesis they would have do better to have refrain but this style of write become the height of absurdity when the parenthesis be not even fit into the frame of the sentence but wedge in so as directly to shatter it if for instance it be a impertinent thing to interrupt another person when he be speak it be no less impertinent to interrupt oneself but all bad careless and hasty author who scribble with the bread actually before they eye use this style of write six time on a page and rejoice in it it consist in -- it be advisable to give rule and example together wherever it be possible -- break up one phrase in order to glue in another nor be it merely out of laziness that they write thus they do it out of stupidity they think there be a charming _ légèreté _ about it that it give life to what they say no doubt there be a few rare case where such a form of sentence may be pardonable few write in the way in which a architect build who before he set to work sketch out he plan and think it over down to its smallest detail nay most people write only as though they be play domino and as in this game the piece be arrange half by design half by chance so it be with the sequence and connection of they sentence they only have a idea of what the general shape of they work will be and of the aim they set before themselves many be ignorant even of this and write as the coral-insect build period join to period and the lord only know what the author mean life now-a-days go at a gallop and the way in which this affect literature be to make it extremely superficial and slovenly on the study of latin the abolition of latin as the universal language of learn man together with the rise of that provincialism which attach to national literature have be a real misfortune for the cause of knowledge in europe for it be chiefly through the medium of the latin language that a learn public exist in europe at all -- a public to which every book as it come out directly appeal the number of mind in the whole of europe that be capable of think and judge be small as it be but when the audience be break up and sever by difference of language the good these mind can do be very much weaken this be a great disadvantage but a second and worse one will follow namely that the ancient language will cease to be teach at all the neglect of they be rapidly gain ground both in france and germany if it should really come to this then farewell humanity farewell noble taste and high think the age of barbarism will return in spite of railway telegraph and balloon we shall thus in the end lose one more advantage possess by all we ancestor for latin be not only a key to the knowledge of roman antiquity its also directly open up to we the middle age in every country in europe and modern time as well down to about the year 1750 erigena for example in the ninth century john of salisbury in the twelfth raimond lully in the thirteenth with a hundred other speak straight to we in the very language that they naturally adopt in thinking of learn matter they thus come quite close to we even at this distance of time : we be in direct contact with they and really come to know they how would it have be if every one of they speak in the language that be peculiar to he time and country we should not understand even the half of what they say a real intellectual contact with they would be impossible we should see they like shadow on the farthest horizon or may be through the translator 's telescope it be with a eye to the advantage of write in latin that bacon as he himself expressly state proceed to translate he _ essay _ into that language under the title _ sermone fidele _ at which work hobbe assist he -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf thoma hobbe vita : _ carolopolus apud eleutherium anglicum _ 1681 p 22 -rrb- here let I observe by way of parenthesis that when patriotism try to urge its claim in the domain of knowledge it commit a offence which should not be tolerate for in those purely human question which interest all man alike where truth insight beauty should be of sole account what can be more impertinent than to let preference for the nation to which a man 's precious self happen to belong affect the balance of judgment and thus supply a reason for do violence to truth and be unjust to the great mind of a foreign country in order to make much of the smaller mind of one 's own still there be writer in every nation in europe who afford example of this vulgar feeling it be this which lead yriarte to caricature they in the thirty-third of he charming _ literary fable _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- tomas de yriarte -lrb- 1750-91 -rrb- a spanish poet and keeper of archive in the war office at madrid he two best know work be a didactic poem entitle _ la musica _ and the _ fable _ here quote which satirize the peculiar foible of literary man they have be translate into many language into english by rockliffe -lrb- 3rd edition 1866 -rrb- the fable in question describe how at a picnic of the animal a discussion arise as to which of they carry off the palm for superiority of talent the praise of the ant the dog the bee and the parrot be sing in turn but at last the ostrich stand up and declare for the dromedary whereupon the dromedary stand up and declare for the ostrich no one could discover the reason for this mutual compliment be it because both be such uncouth beast or have such long neck or be neither of they particularly clever or beautiful or be it because each have a hump _ no _ say the fox _ you be all wrong do not you see they be both foreigner _ can not the same be say of many man of learning -rrb- in learn a language the chief difficulty consist in make acquaintance with every idea which it express even though it should use word for which there be no exact equivalent in the mother tongue and this often happen in learn a new language a man have as it be to mark out in he mind the boundary of quite new sphere of idea with the result that sphere of idea arise where none be before thus he not only learn word he gain idea too this be nowhere so much the case as in learn ancient language for the difference they present in they mode of expression as compare with modern language be greater than can be find amongst modern language as compare with one another this be show by the fact that in translate into latin recourse must be have to quite other turn of phrase than be use in the original the thought that be to be translate have to be melt down and recast in other word it must be analyze and then recompose it be just this process which make the study of the ancient language contribute so much to the education of the mind it follow from this that a man 's thought vary accord to the language in which he speak he idea undergo a fresh modification a different shading as it be in the study of every new language hence a acquaintance with many language be not only of much indirect advantage but it be also a direct means of mental culture in that it correct and mature idea by give prominence to they many-sided nature and they different variety of meaning as also that it increase dexterity of thought for in the process of learn many language idea become more and more independent of word the ancient language effect this to a greater degree than the modern in virtue of the difference to which i have allude from what i have say it be obvious that to imitate the style of the ancient in they own language which be so very much superior to ours in point of grammatical perfection be the best way of prepare for a skillful and finish expression of think in the mother-tongue nay if a man want to be a great writer he must not omit to do this : just as in the case of sculpture or paint the student must educate himself by copy the great masterpiece of the past before proceed to original work it be only by learn to write latin that a man come to treat diction as a art the material in this art be language which must therefore be handle with the greatest care and delicacy the result of such study be that a writer will pay keen attention to the meaning and value of word they order and connection they grammatical form he will learn how to weigh they with precision and so become a expert in the use of that precious instrument which be mean not only to express valuable thought but to preserve it as well further he will learn to feel respect for the language in which he write and thus be save from any attempt to remodel it by arbitrary and capricious treatment without this schooling a man 's writing may easily degenerate into mere chatter to be entirely ignorant of the latin language be like be in a fine country on a misty day the horizon be extremely limited nothing can be see clearly except that which be quite close a few step beyond everything be bury in obscurity but the latinist have a wide view embrace modern time the middle age and antiquity and he mental horizon be still further enlarged if he study greek or even sanscrit if a man know no latin he belong to the vulgar even though he be a great virtuoso on the electrical machine and have the base of hydrofluoric acid in he crucible there be no better recreation for the mind than the study of the ancient classic take any one of they into you hand be it only for half a hour and you will feel yourself refresh relieved purify ennobled strengthen just as though you have quench you thirst at some pure spring be this the effect of the old language and its perfect expression or be it the greatness of the mind whose work remain unharmed and unweakened by the lapse of a thousand year perhaps both together but this i know if the threaten calamity should ever come and the ancient language cease to be teach a new literature will arise of such barbarous shallow and worthless stuff as never be see before on man of learn when one see the number and variety of institution which exist for the purpose of education and the vast throng of scholar and master one might fancy the human race to be very much concern about truth and wisdom but here too appearance be deceptive the master teach in order to gain money and strive not after wisdom but the outward show and reputation of it and the scholar learn not for the sake of knowledge and insight but to be able to chatter and give themselves air every thirty year a new race come into the world -- a youngster that know nothing about anything and after summarily devour in all haste the result of human knowledge as they have be accumulate for thousand of year aspire to be think cleverer than the whole of the past for this purpose he go to the university and take to read book -- new book as be of he own age and standing everything he read must be briefly put must be new he be new himself then he fall to and criticise and here i be not take the slightest account of study pursue for the sole object of make a living student and learn person of all sort and every age aim as a rule at acquire _ information _ rather than insight they pique themselves upon know about everything -- stone plant battle experiment and all the book in existence it never occur to they that information be only a means of insight and in itself of little or no value that it be he way of _ think _ that make a man a philosopher when i hear of these portent of learning and they impose erudition i sometimes say to myself : ah how little they must have have to think about to have be able to read so much and when i actually find it report of the elder pliny that he be continually read or be read to at table on a journey or in he bath the question force itself upon my mind whether the man be so very lack in thought of he own that he have to have alien thought incessantly instil into he as though he be a consumptive patient take jelly to keep himself alive and neither he undiscerning credulity nor he inexpressibly repulsive and barely intelligible style -- which seem like of a man take note and very economical of paper -- be of a kind to give I a high opinion of he power of independent thought we have see that much reading and learning be prejudicial to think for oneself and in the same way through much writing and teach a man lose the habit of be quite clear and therefore thorough in regard to the thing he know and understand simply because he have leave himself no time to acquire clearness or thoroughness and so when clear knowledge fail he in he utterance he be force to fill out the gap with word and phrase it be this and not the dryness of the subject-matter that make most book such tedious reading there be a say that a good cook can make a palatable dish even out of a old shoe and a good writer can make the dryest thing interesting with by far the largest number of learn man knowledge be a mean not a end that be why they will never achieve any great work because to do that he who pursue knowledge must pursue it as a end and treat everything else even existence itself as only a means for everything which a man fail to pursue for its own sake be but half-pursued and true excellence no matter in what sphere can be attain only where the work have be produce for its own sake alone and not as a means to further end and so too no one will ever succeed in do anything really great and original in the way of thought who do not seek to acquire knowledge for himself and make this the immediate object of he study decline to trouble himself about the knowledge of other but the average man of learning study for the purpose of be able to teach and write he head be like a stomach and intestine which let the food pass through they undigested that be just why he teaching and writing be of so little use for it be not upon undigested refuse that people can be nourished but solely upon the milk which secrete from the very blood itself the wig be the appropriate symbol of the man of learn pure and simple it adorn the head with a copious quantity of false hair in lack of one 's own : just as erudition mean endow it with a great mass of alien thought this to be sure do not clothe the head so well and naturally nor be it so generally useful nor so suit for all purpose nor so firmly root nor when alien thought be use up can it be immediately replace by more from the same source as be the case with that which spring from soil of one 's own so we find sterne in he _ tristram shandy _ boldly assert that _ a ounce of a man 's own wit be worth a ton of other people 's _ and in fact the most profound erudition be no more akin to genius than a collection of dry plant in like nature with its constant flow of new life ever fresh ever young ever change there be no two thing more opposed than the childish naïveté of a ancient author and the learning of he commentator _ dilettante dilettante _ this be the slighting way in which those who pursue any branch of art or learn for the love and enjoyment of the thing -- _ per il loro diletto _ be speak of by those who have take it up for the sake of gain attract solely by the prospect of money this contempt of theirs come from the base belief that no man will seriously devote himself to a subject unless he be spur on to it by want hunger or else some form of greed the public be of the same way of thinking and hence its general respect for professional and its distrust of _ dilettante _ but the truth be that the _ dilettante _ treat he subject as a end whereas the professional pure and simple treat it merely as a means he alone will be really in earnest about a matter who have a direct interest therein take to it because he like it and pursue it _ con amore _ it be these and not hireling that have always do the greatest work in the republic of letter it be as in other republic favor be show to the plain man -- he who go he way in silence and do not set up to be cleverer than other but the abnormal man be look upon as threatening danger people band together against he and have oh such a majority on they side the condition of this republic be much like that of a small state in america where every man be intent only upon he own advantage and seek reputation and power for himself quite heedless of the general weal which then go to ruin so it be in the republic of letter it be himself and himself alone that a man put forward because he want to gain fame the only thing in which all agree be in try to keep down a really eminent man if he should chance to show himself as one who would be a common peril from this it be easy to see how it fare with knowledge as a whole between professor and independent man of learn there have always be from of old a certain antagonism which may perhaps be liken to that exist be dog and wolf in virtue of they position professor enjoy great facility for become know to they contemporary contrarily independent man of learn enjoy by they position great facility for become know to posterity to which it be necessary that amongst other and much rarer gift a man should have a certain leisure and freedom as mankind take a long time in find out on whom to bestow its attention they may both work together side by side he who hold a professorship may be say to receive he food in the stall and this be the best way with ruminant animal but he who find he food for himself at the hand of nature be better off in the open field of human knowledge as a whole and in every branch of it by far the largest part exist nowhere but on paper -- i mean in book that paper memory of mankind only a small part of it be at any given period really active in the mind of particular person this be due in the main to the brevity and uncertainty of life but it also come from the fact that man be lazy and bent on pleasure every generation attain on its hasty passage through existence just so much of human knowledge as it need and then soon disappear most man of learn be very superficial then follow a new generation full of hope but ignorant and with everything to learn from the begin it seize in its turn just so much as it can grasp or find useful on its brief journey and then too go its way how badly it would fare with human knowledge if it be not for the art of write and print this it be that make library the only sure and lasting memory of the human race for its individual member have all of they but a very limited and imperfect one hence most man of learn as be loth to have they knowledge examine as merchant to lay bare they book human knowledge extend on all side farther than the eye can reach and of that which would be generally worth know no one man can possess even the thousandth part all branch of learn have thus be so much enlarged that he who would do something have to pursue no more than one subject and disregard all other in he own subject he will then it be true be superior to the vulgar but in all else he will belong to it if we add to this that neglect of the ancient language which be now-a-days on the increase and be do away with all general education in the humanities -- for a mere smattering of latin and greek be of no use -- we shall come to have man of learn who outside they own subject display a ignorance truly bovine a exclusive specialist of this kind stand on a par with a workman in a factory whose whole life be spend in make one particular kind of screw or catch or handle for some particular instrument or machine in which indeed he attain incredible dexterity the specialist may also be liken to a man who live in he own house and never leave it there he be perfectly familiar with everything every little step corner or board much as quasimodo in victor hugo 's _ nôtre dame _ know the cathedral but outside it all be strange and unknown for true culture in the humanities it be absolutely necessary that a man should be many-sided and take large view and for a man of learn in the higher sense of the word a extensive acquaintance with history be needful he however who wish to be a complete philosopher must gather into he head the remotest end of human knowledge : for where else could they ever come together it be precisely mind of the first order that will never be specialist for they very nature be to make the whole of existence they problem and this be a subject upon which they will every one of they in some form provide mankind with a new revelation for he alone can deserve the name of genius who take the all the essential the universal for the theme of he achievement not he who spend he life in explain some special relation of thing one to another on think for oneself a library may be very large but if it be in disorder it be not so useful as one that be small but well arrange in the same way a man may have a great mass of knowledge but if he have not work it up by think it over for himself it have much less value than a far smaller amount which he have thoroughly ponder for it be only when a man look at he knowledge from all side and combine the thing he know by compare truth with truth that he obtain a complete hold over it and get it into he power a man can not turn over anything in he mind unless he know it he should therefore learn something but it be only when he have turn it over that he can be say to know it read and learn be thing that anyone can do of he own free will but not so _ think _ thinking must be kindle like a fire by a draught it must be sustain by some interest in the matter in hand this interest may be of purely objective kind or merely subjective the latter come into play only in thing that concern we personally objective interest be confine to head that think by nature to whom think be as natural as breathing and they be very rare this be why most man of learn show so little of it it be incredible what a different effect be produce upon the mind by think for oneself as compare with read it carry on and intensify that original difference in the nature of two mind which lead the one to think and the other to read what i mean be that read force alien thought upon the mind -- thought which be as foreign to the drift and temper in which it may be for the moment as the seal be to the wax on which it stamp its imprint the mind be thus entirely under compulsion from without it be drive to think this or that though for the moment it may not have the slightest impulse or inclination to do so but when a man think for himself he follow the impulse of he own mind which be determine for he at the time either by he environment or some particular recollection the visible world of a man 's surroundings do not as reading do impress a _ single _ definite thought upon he mind but merely give the matter and occasion which lead he to think what be appropriate to he nature and present temper so it be that much reading deprive the mind of all elasticity it be like keep a spring continually under pressure the safest way of have no thought of one 's own be to take up a book every moment one have nothing else to do it be this practice which explain why erudition make most man more stupid and silly than they be by nature and prevent they writings obtain any measure of success they remain in pope 's word : _ for ever read never to be read _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ dunciad _ iii 194 -rrb- man of learn be those who have do they reading in the page of a book thinker and man of genius be those who have go straight to the book of nature it be they who have enlighten the world and carry humanity further on its way if a man 's thought be to have truth and life in they they must after all be he own fundamental thought for these be the only one that he can fully and wholly understand to read another 's thought be like take the leavings of a meal to which we have not be invite or put on the clothes which some unknown visitor have lay aside the thought we read be relate to the thought which spring up in ourselves as the fossil-impress of some prehistoric plant to a plant as it bud forth in spring-time reading be nothing more than a substitute for thought of one 's own it mean put the mind into leading-string the multitude of book serve only to show how many false path there be and how widely astray a man may wander if he follow any of they but he who be guide by he genius he who think for himself who think spontaneously and exactly possess the only compass by which he can steer aright a man should read only when he own thought stagnate at they source which will happen often enough even with the best of mind on the other hand to take up a book for the purpose of scare away one 's own original thought be sin against the holy spirit it be like run away from nature to look at a museum of dry plant or gaze at a landscape in copperplate a man may have discover some portion of truth or wisdom after spend a great deal of time and trouble in think it over for himself and add think to thought and it may sometimes happen that he could have find it all ready to hand in a book and spare himself the trouble but even so it be a hundred time more valuable if he have acquire it by think it out for himself for it be only when we gain we knowledge in this way that it enter as a integral part a live member into the whole system of we thought that it stand in complete and firm relation with what we know that it be understand with all that underlie it and follow from it that it wear the color the precise shade the distinguishing mark of we own way of think that it come exactly at the right time just as we feel the necessity for it that it stand fast and can not be forget this be the perfect application nay the interpretation of goethe 's advice to earn we inheritance for ourselves so that we may really possess it : _ be due ererbt von deinen välern hast erwirb e um e zu besitzen _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ faust _ i 329 -rrb- the man who think for himself form he own opinion and learn the authority for they only later on when they serve but to strengthen he belief in they and in himself but the book-philosopher start from the authority he read other people 's book collect they opinion and so form a whole for himself which resemble a automaton make up of anything but flesh and blood contrarily he who think for himself create a work like a living man as make by nature for the work come into be as a man do the think mind be impregnate from without and it then form and bear its child truth that have be merely learn be like a artificial limb a false tooth a waxen nose at best like a nose make out of another 's flesh it adhere to we only because it be put on but truth acquire by thinking of we own be like a natural limb it alone really belong to we this be the fundamental difference between the thinker and the mere man of learn the intellectual attainment of a man who think for himself resemble a fine painting where the light and shade be correct the tone sustain the color perfectly harmonize it be true to life on the other hand the intellectual attainment of the mere man of learning be like a large palette full of all sort of color which at most be systematically arrange but devoid of harmony connection and meaning reading be think with some one else 's head instead of one 's own to think with one 's own head be always to aim at develop a coherent whole -- a system even though it be not a strictly complete one and nothing hinder this so much as too strong a current of other ' thought such as come of continual reading these thought spring every one of they from different mind belong to different system and tinge with different color never of themselves flow together into a intellectual whole they never form a unity of knowledge or insight or conviction but rather fill the head with a babylonian confusion of tongue the mind that be over-loaded with alien thought be thus deprive of all clear insight and be well-nigh disorganized this be a state of thing observable in many man of learning and it make they inferior in sound sense correct judgment and practical tact to many illiterate person who after obtain a little knowledge from without by means of experience intercourse with other and a small amount of reading have always subordinate it to and embody it with they own think the really scientific _ thinker _ do the same thing as these illiterate person but on a larger scale although he have need of much knowledge and so must read a great deal he mind be nevertheless strong enough to master it all to assimilate and incorporate it with the system of he thought and so to make it fit in with the organic unity of he insight which though vast be always grow and in the process he own thought like the bass in a organ always dominate everything and be never drown by other tone as happen with mind which be full of mere antiquarian lore where shred of music as it be in every key mingle confusedly and no fundamental note be hear at all those who have spend they life in reading and take they wisdom from book be like people who have obtain precise information about a country from the description of many traveller such people can tell a great deal about it but after all they have no connected clear and profound knowledge of its real condition but those who have spend they life in think resemble the traveller themselves they alone really know what they be talk about they be acquaint with the actual state of affair and be quite at home in the subject the thinker stand in the same relation to the ordinary book-philosopher as a eye-witness do to the historian he speak from direct knowledge of he own that be why all those who think for themselves come at bottom to much the same conclusion the difference they present be due to they different point of view and when these do not affect the matter they all speak alike they merely express the result of they own objective perception of thing there be many passage in my work which i have give to the public only after some hesitation because of they paradoxical nature and afterwards i have experience a pleasant surprise in find the same opinion record in the work of great man who live long ago the book-philosopher merely report what one person have say and another mean or the objection raise by a third and so on he compare different opinion ponder criticise and try to get at the truth of the matter herein on a par with the critical historian for instance he will set out to inquire whether leibnitz be not for some time a follower of spinoza and question of a like nature the curious student of such matter may find conspicuous example of what i mean in herbart 's _ analytical elucidation of morality and natural right _ and in the same author 's _ letter on freedom _ surprise may be feel that a man of the kind should put himself to so much trouble for on the face of it if he would only examine the matter for himself he would speedily attain he object by the exercise of a little thought but there be a small difficulty in the way it do not depend upon he own will a man can always sit down and read but not -- think it be with thought as with man they can not always be summon at pleasure we must wait for they to come think about a subject must appear of itself by a happy and harmonious combination of external stimulus with mental temper and attention and it be just that which never seem to come to these people this truth may be illustrate by what happen in the case of matter affect we own personal interest when it be necessary to come to some resolution in a matter of that kind we can not well sit down at any given moment and think over the merit of the case and make up we mind for if we try to do so we often find ourselves unable at that particular moment to keep we mind fix upon the subject it wander off to other thing aversion to the matter in question be sometimes to blame for this in such a case we should not use force but wait for the proper frame of mind to come of itself it often come unexpectedly and return again and again and the variety of temper in which we approach it at different moment put the matter always in a fresh light it be this long process which be understand by the term _ a ripe resolution _ for the work of come to a resolution must be distribute and in the process much that be overlook at one moment occur to we at another and the repugnance vanish when we find as we usually do on a closer inspection that thing be not so bad as they seem this rule apply to the life of the intellect as well as to matter of practice a man must wait for the right moment not even the greatest mind be capable of think for itself at all time hence a great mind do well to spend its leisure in reading which as i have say be a substitute for think it bring stuff to the mind by let another person do the think although that be always do in a manner not we own therefore a man should not read too much in order that he mind may not become accustomed to the substitute and thereby forget the reality that it may not form the habit of walk in well-worn path nor by follow a alien course of think grow a stranger to its own least of all should a man quite withdraw he gaze from the real world for the mere sake of reading as the impulse and the temper which prompt to thought of one 's own come far oftener from the world of reality than from the world of book the real life that a man see before he be the natural subject of thought and in its strength as the primary element of existence it can more easily than anything else rouse and influence the think mind after these consideration it will not be matter for surprise that a man who think for himself can easily be distinguish from the book-philosopher by the very way in which he talk by he marked earnestness and the originality directness and personal conviction that stamp all he thought and expression the book-philosopher on the other hand let it be see that everything he have be second-hand that he idea be like the number and trash of a old furniture-shop collect together from all quarter mentally he be dull and pointless -- a copy of a copy he literary style be make up of conventional nay vulgar phrase and term that happen to be current in this respect much like a small state where all the money that circulate be foreign because it have no coinage of its own mere experience can as little as read supply the place of think it stand to think in the same relation in which eating stand to digestion and assimilation when experience boast that to its discovery alone be due the advancement of the human race it be as though the mouth be to claim the whole credit of maintain the body in health the work of all truly capable mind be distinguish by a character of _ decision _ and _ definiteness _ which mean they be clear and free from obscurity a truly capable mind always know definitely and clearly what it be that it want to express whether its medium be prose verse or music other mind be not decisive and not definite and by this they may be know for what they be the characteristic sign of a mind of the highest order be that it always judge at first hand everything it advance be the result of think for itself and this be everywhere evident by the way in which it give its thought utterance such a mind be like a prince in the realm of intellect its authority be imperial whereas the authority of mind of a lower order be delegate only as may be see in they style which have no independent stamp of its own every one who really think for himself be so far like a monarch he position be undelegated and supreme he judgment like royal decree spring from he own sovereign power and proceed directly from himself he acknowledge authority as little as a monarch admit a command he subscribe to nothing but what he have himself authorize the multitude of common mind labor under all sort of current opinion authority prejudice be like the people which silently obey the law and accept order from above those who be so zealous and eager to settle debate question by cite authority be really glad when they be able to put the understanding and the insight of other into the field in place of they own which be want they number be legion for as seneca say there be no man but prefer belief to the exercise of judgment -- _ unusquisque mavult credere quam judicare _ in they controversy such people make a promiscuous use of the weapon of authority and strike out at one another with it if any one chance to become involve in such a contest he will do well not to try reason and argument as a mode of defense for against a weapon of that kind these people be like siegfried with a skin of horn and dip in the flood of incapacity for think and judge they will meet he attack by bring up they authority as a way of abash he -- _ argumentum ad verecundiam _ and then cry out that they have win the battle in the real world be it never so fair favorable and pleasant we always live subject to the law of gravity which we have to be constantly overcome but in the world of intellect we be disembodied spirit hold in bondage to no such law and free from penury and distress thus it be that there exist no happiness on earth like that which at the auspicious moment a fine and fruitful mind find in itself the presence of a thought be like the presence of a woman we love we fancy we shall never forget the think nor become indifferent to the dear one but out of sight out of mind the finest thought run the risk of be irrevocably forget if we do not write it down and the darling of be desert if we do not marry she there be plenty of thought which be valuable to the man who think they but only few of they which have enough strength to produce repercussive or reflect action -- i mean to win the reader 's sympathy after they have be put on paper but still it must not be forget that a true value attach only to what a man have think in the first instance _ for he own case _ thinker may be class accord as they think chiefly for they own case or for that of other the former be the genuine independent thinker they really think and be really independent they be the true _ philosopher _ they alone be in earnest the pleasure and the happiness of they existence consist in think the other be the _ sophist _ they want to seem that which they be not and seek they happiness in what they hope to get from the world they be in earnest about nothing else to which of these two class a man belong may be see by he whole style and manner lichtenberg be a example for the former class herder there can be no doubt belong to the second when one consider how vast and how close to we be _ the problem of existence _ -- this equivocal tortured fleeting dream-like existence of ours -- so vast and so close that a man no sooner discover it than it overshadow and obscure all other problem and aim and when one see how all man with few and rare exception have no clear consciousness of the problem nay seem to be quite unaware of its presence but busy themselves with everything rather than with this and live on take no thought but for the pass day and the hardly longer span of they own personal future either expressly discard the problem or else over-ready to come to term with it by adopt some system of popular metaphysics and let it satisfy they when i say one take all this to heart one may come to the opinion that man may be say to be _ a thinking be _ only in a very remote sense and henceforth feel no special surprise at any trait of human thoughtlessness or folly but know rather that the normal man 's intellectual range of vision do indeed extend beyond that of the brute whose whole existence be as it be a continual present with no consciousness of the past or the future but not such a immeasurable distance as be generally suppose this be in fact corroborate by the way in which most man converse where they thought be find to be chop up fine like chaff so that for they to spin out a discourse of any length be impossible if this world be people by really think being it could not be that noise of every kind would be allow such generous limit as be the case with the most horrible and at the same time aimless form of it -lrb- 1 -rrb- if nature have mean man to think she would not have give he ear or at any rate she would have furnish they with airtight flap such as be the enviable possession of the bat but in truth man be a poor animal like the rest and he power be mean only to maintain he in the struggle for existence so he must need keep he ear always open to announce of themselves by night as by day the approach of the pursuer -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- schopenhauer refer to the crack of whip see the essay _ on noise _ in _ study in pessimism _ -rrb- in the drama which be the most perfect reflection of human existence there be three stage in the presentation of the subject with a corresponding variety in the design and scope of the piece at the first which be also the most common stage the drama be never anything more than merely _ interesting _ the person gain we attention by follow they own aim which resemble ours the action advance by means of intrigue and the play of character and incident while wit and raillery season the whole at the second stage the drama become _ sentimental _ sympathy be rouse with the hero and indirectly with ourselves the action take a pathetic turn but the end be peaceful and satisfactory the climax be reach with the third stage which be the most difficult there the drama aim at be _ tragic _ we be bring face to face with great suffering and the storm and stress of existence and the outcome of it be to show the vanity of all human effort deeply move we be either directly prompt to disengage we will from the struggle of life or else a chord be strike in we which echo a similar feeling the begin it be say be always difficult in the drama it be just the contrary for these the difficulty always lie in the end this be prove by countless play which promise very well for the first act or two and then become muddle stick or falter -- notoriously so in the fourth act -- and finally conclude in a way that be either force or unsatisfactory or else long foresee by every one sometimes too the end be positively revolting as in lessing 's _ emilium galottus _ which send the spectator home in a temper this difficulty in regard to the end of a play arise partly because it be everywhere easier to get thing into a tangle than to get they out again partly also because at the beginning we give the author _ carte blanche _ to do as he like but at the end make certain definite demand upon he thus we ask for a conclusion that shall be either quite happy or else quite tragic whereas human affair do not easily take so decide a turn and then we expect that it shall be natural fit and proper unlabored and at the same time foresee by no one these remark be also applicable to a epic and to a novel but the more compact nature of the drama make the difficulty plainer by increase it _ e nihilo nihil fit _ that nothing can come from nothing be a maxim true in fine art as elsewhere in compose a historical picture a good artist will use live man as a model and take the groundwork of the face from life and then proceed to idealize they in point of beauty or expression a similar method i fancy be adopt by good novelist in draw a character they take a general outline of it from some real person of they acquaintance and then idealize and complete it to suit they purpose a novel will be of a high and noble order the more it represent of inner and the less it represent of outer life and the ratio between the two will supply a means of judge any novel of whatever kind from _ tristram shandy _ down to the crudest and most sensational tale of knight or robber _ tristram shandy _ have indeed as good as no action at all and there be not much in _ la nouvelle heloïse _ and _ wilhelm meister _ even _ don quixote _ have relatively little and what there be very unimportant and introduce merely for the sake of fun and these four be the best of all exist novel consider further the wonderful romance of jean paul and how much inner life be show on the narrowest basis of actual event even in walter scott 's novel there be a great preponderance of inner over outer life and incident be never bring in except for the purpose of give play to thought and emotion whereas in bad novel incident be there on its own account skill consist in set the inner life in motion with the smallest possible array of circumstance for it be this inner life that really excite we interest the business of the novelist be not to relate great event but to make small one interesting history which i like to think of as the contrary of poetry -lrb- greek : istoroumenon -- pepoiaemenon -rrb- be for time what geography be for space and it be no more to be call a science in any strict sense of the word than be geography because it do not deal with universal truth but only with particular detail history have always be the favorite study of those who wish to learn something without have to face the effort demand by any branch of real knowledge which tax the intelligence in we time history be a favorite pursuit as witness the numerous book upon the subject which appear every year if the reader can not help think with I that history be merely the constant recurrence of similar thing just as in a kaleidoscope the same bit of glass be represent but in different combination he will not be able to share all this lively interest nor however will he censure it but there be a ridiculous and absurd claim make by many people to regard history as a part of philosophy nay as philosophy itself they imagine that history can take its place the preference show for history by the greater public in all age may be illustrate by the kind of conversation which be so much in vogue everywhere in society it generally consist in one person relate something and then another person relate something else so that in this way everyone be sure of receive attention both here and in the case of history it be plain that the mind be occupy with particular detail but as in science so also in every worthy conversation the mind rise to the consideration of some general truth this objection do not however deprive history of its value human life be short and fleeting and many million of individual share in it who be swallow by that monster of oblivion which be wait for they with ever-open jaw it be thus a very thankworthy task to try to rescue something -- the memory of interesting and important event or the lead feature and personage of some epoch -- from the general shipwreck of the world from another point of view we might look upon history as the sequel to zoology for while with all other animal it be enough to observe the species with man individual and therefore individual event have to be study because every man possess a character as a individual and since individual and event be without number or end a essential imperfection attach to history in the study of it all that a man learn never contribute to lessen that which he have still to learn with any real science a perfection of knowledge be at any rate conceivable when we gain access to the history of china and of indium the endlessness of the subject-matter will reveal to we the defect in the study and force we historian to see that the object of science be to recognize the many in the one to perceive the rule in any give example and to apply to the life of nation a knowledge of mankind not to go on count up fact _ ad infinitum _ there be two kind of history the history of politics and the history of literature and art the one be the history of the will the other that of the intellect the first be a tale of woe even of terror : it be a record of agony struggle fraud and horrible murder _ en masse _ the second be everywhere please and serene like the intellect when leave to itself even though its path be one of error its chief branch be the history of philosophy this be in fact its fundamental bass and the note of it be hear even in the other kind of history these deep tone guide the formation of opinion and opinion rule the world hence philosophy rightly understand be a material force of the most powerful kind though very slow in its work the philosophy of a period be thus the fundamental bass of its history the newspaper be the second-hand in the clock of history and it be not only make of baser metal than those which point to the minute and the hour but it seldom go right the so-called leading article be the chorus to the drama of pass event exaggeration of every kind be as essential to journalism as it be to the dramatic art for the object of journalism be to make event go as far as possible thus it be that all journalist be in the very nature of they call alarmist and this be they way of give interest to what they write herein they be like little dog if anything stir they immediately set up a shrill bark therefore let we carefully regulate the attention to be pay to this trumpet of danger so that it may not disturb we digestion let we recognize that a newspaper be at best but a magnifying-glass and very often merely a shadow on the wall the _ pen _ be to think what the stick be to walk but you walk most easily when you have no stick and you think with the greatest perfection when you have no pen in you hand it be only when a man begin to be old that he like to use a stick and be glad to take up he pen when a _ hypothesis _ have once come to birth in the mind or gain a footing there it lead a life so far comparable with the life of a organism as that it assimilate matter from the outer world only when it be like in kind with it and beneficial and when contrarily such matter be not like in kind but hurtful the hypothesis equally with the organism throw it off or if force to take it get rid of it again entire to gain _ immortality _ a author must possess so many excellence that while it will not be easy to find anyone to understand and appreciate they all there will be man in every age who be able to recognize and value some of they in this way the credit of he book will be maintain throughout the long course of century in spite of the fact that human interest be always change a author like this who have a claim to the continuance of he life even with posterity can only be a man who over the wide earth will seek he like in vain and offer a palpable contrast with everyone else in virtue of he unmistakable distinction nay more : be he like the wander jew to live through several generation he would still remain in the same superior position if this be not so it would be difficult to see why he thought should not perish like those of other man _ metaphor _ and _ simile _ be of great value in so far as they explain a unknown relation by a known one even the more detailed simile which grow into a parable or a allegory be nothing more than the exhibition of some relation in its simplest most visible and palpable form the growth of idea rest at bottom upon simile because idea arise by a process of combine the similarity and neglect the difference between thing further intelligence in the strict sense of the word ultimately consist in a seize of relation and a clear and pure grasp of relation be all the more often attain when the comparison be make between case that lie wide apart from one another and between thing of quite different nature as long as a relation be know to I as exist only in a single case i have but a _ individual _ idea of it -- in other word only a intuitive knowledge of it but as soon as i see the same relation in two different case i have a _ general _ idea of its whole nature and this be a deeper and more perfect knowledge since then simile and metaphor be such a powerful engine of knowledge it be a sign of great intelligence in a writer if he simile be unusual and at the same time to the point aristotle also observe that by far the most important thing to a writer be to have this power of metaphor for it be a gift which can not be acquire and it be a mark of genius as regard _ reading _ to require that a man shall retain everything he have ever read be like ask he to carry about with he all he have ever eat the one kind of food have give he bodily and the other mental nourishment and it be through these two means that he have grow to be what he be the body assimilate only that which be like it and so a man retain in he mind only that which interest he in other word that which suit he system of thought or he purpose in life if a man want to read good book he must make a point of avoid bad one for life be short and time and energy limited _ repetitio est mater studiorum _ any book that be at all important ought to be at once read through twice partly because on a second read the connection of the different portion of the book will be better understand and the begin comprehend only when the end be know and partly because we be not in the same temper and disposition on both reading on the second perusal we get a new view of every passage and a different impression of the whole book which then appear in another light a man 's work be the quintessence of he mind and even though he may possess very great capacity they will always be incomparably more valuable than he conversation nay in all essential matter he work will not only make up for the lack of personal intercourse with he but they will far surpass it in solid advantage the writings even of a man of moderate genius may be edifying worth reading and instructive because they be he quintessence -- the result and fruit of all he thought and study whilst conversation with he may be unsatisfactory so it be that we can read book by man in whose company we find nothing to please and that a high degree of culture lead we to seek entertainment almost wholly from book and not from man on criticism the follow brief remark on the critical faculty be chiefly intend to show that for the most part there be no such thing it be a _ rara avi _ almost as rare indeed as the phoenix which appear only once in five hundred year when we speak of _ taste _ -- a expression not choose with any regard for it -- we mean the discovery or it may be only the recognition of what be _ right aesthetically _ apart from the guidance of any rule and this either because no rule have as yet be extend to the matter in question or else because if exist it be unknown to the artist or the critic as the case may be instead of _ taste _ we might use the expression _ aesthetic sense _ if this be not tautological the perceptive critical taste be so to speak the female analog to the male quality of productive talent or genius not capable of _ beget _ great work itself it consist in a capacity of _ reception _ that be to say of recognize as such what be right fit beautiful or the reverse in other word of discriminate the good from the bad of discover and appreciate the one and condemn the other in appreciate a genius criticism should not deal with the error in he production or with the poorer of he work and then proceed to rate he low it should attend only to the quality in which he most excel for in the sphere of intellect as in other sphere weakness and perversity cleave so firmly to human nature that even the most brilliant mind be not wholly and at all time free from they hence the great error to be find even in the work of the greatest man or as horace put it _ quandoque bonus dormitat homerus _ that which distinguish genius and should be the standard for judge it be the height to which it be able to soar when it be in the proper mood and find a fitting occasion -- a height always out of the reach of ordinary talent and in like manner it be a very dangerous thing to compare two great man of the same class for instance two great poet or musician or philosopher or artist because injustice to the one or the other at least for the moment can hardly be avoid for in make a comparison of the kind the critic look to some particular merit of the one and at once discover that it be absent in the other who be thereby disparaged and then if the process be reverse and the critic begin with the latter and discover he peculiar merit which be quite of a different order from that present by the former with whom it may be look for in vain the result be that both of they suffer undue depreciation there be critic who severally think that it rest with each one of they what shall be account good and what bad they all mistake they own toy-trumpet for the trombone of fame a drug do not effect its purpose if the dose be too large and it be the same with censure and adverse criticism when it exceed the measure of justice the disastrous thing for intellectual merit be that it must wait for those to praise the good who have themselves produce nothing but what be bad nay it be a primary misfortune that it have to receive its crown at the hand of the critical power of mankind -- a quality of which most man possess only the weak and impotent semblance so that the reality may be number amongst the rarest gift of nature hence la bruyère 's remark be unhappily as true as it be neat _ après l'esprit de discernement _ he say _ ce qu'il y a au monde de plus rare ce sont les diamans et les perle _ the spirit of discernment the critical faculty it be these that be lack man do not know how to distinguish the genuine from the false the corn from the chaff gold from copper or to perceive the wide gulf that separate a genius from a ordinary man thus we have that bad state of thing describe in a old-fashioned verse which give it as the lot of the great one here on earth to be recognize only when they be go : _ e ist nun das geschick der grossen fiier auf erden erst wann sie nicht mehr sind von uns erkannt zu werden _ when any genuine and excellent work make its appearance the chief difficulty in its way be the amount of bad work it find already in possession of the field and accept as though it be good and then if after a long time the new comer really succeed by a hard struggle in vindicate he place for himself and win reputation he will soon encounter fresh difficulty from some affected dull awkward imitator whom people drag in with the object of calmly set he up on the altar beside the genius not see the difference and really think that here they have to do with another great man this be what yriarte mean by the first line of he twenty-eighth fable where he declare that the ignorant rabble always set equal value on the good and the bad : _ siempre acostumbra hacer el vulgo necio de lo bueno y lo malo igual aprecio _ so even shakespeare 's drama have immediately after he death to give place to those of ben jonson massinger beaumont and fletcher and to yield the supremacy for a hundred year so kant 's serious philosophy be crowd out by the nonsense of fichte schelling jacobus hegel and even in a sphere accessible to all we have see unworthy imitator quickly divert public attention from the incomparable walter scott for say what you will the public have no sense for excellence and therefore no notion how very rare it be to find man really capable of do anything great in poetry philosophy or art or that they work be alone worthy of exclusive attention the dabbler whether in verse or in any other high sphere should be every day unsparingly remind that neither god nor man nor bookseller have pardon they mediocrity : _ mediocribus esse poeti non homine non dî non concessere columna _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : horace _ ar poetica _ 372 -rrb- be they not the weed that prevent the corn come up so that they may cover all the ground themselves and then there happen that which have be well and freshly describe by the lament feuchtersleben -lrb- 1 -rrb- who die so young : how people cry out in they haste that nothing be be do while all the while great work be quietly grow to maturity and then when it appear it be not see or hear in the clamor but go its way silently in modest grief : _ ist doch -- rufen sie vermessen -- nicht im werke nicht gethan und da grosse reift indessen still heran _ _ e ersheint nun : niemand sieht e niemand hört e im geschreus mit bescheid ` ner trauer zieht e still vorbei _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- ernst freiherr von feuchtersleben -lrb- 1806-49 -rrb- a austrian physician philosopher and poet and a specialist in medical psychology the best know of he song be that begin _ e ist bestimmt in gotte rath _ to which mendelssohn compose one of he finest melody -rrb- this lamentable death of the critical faculty be not less obvious in the case of science as be show by the tenacious life of false and disproved theory if they be once accept they may go on bidding defiance to truth for fifty or even a hundred year and more as stable as a iron pier in the midst of the wave the ptolemaic system be still hold a century after copernicus have promulgate he theory bacon descarte and locke make they way extremely slowly and only after a long time as the reader may see by d'alembert 's celebrated preface to the _ encyclopedia _ newton be not more successful and this be sufficiently prove by the bitterness and contempt with which leibnitz attack he theory of gravitation in the controversy with clarke -lrb- 1 -rrb- although newton live for almost forty year after the appearance of the _ principium _ he teaching be when he die only to some extent accept in he own country whilst outside england he count scarcely twenty adherent if we may believe the introductory note to voltaire 's exposition of he theory it be indeed chiefly owe to this treatise of voltaire 's that the system become know in france nearly twenty year after newton 's death until then a firm resolute and patriotic stand be make by the cartesian _ vortex _ whilst only forty year previously this same cartesian philosophy have be forbid in the french school and now in turn d'agnesseau the chancellor refuse voltaire the _ imprimatur _ for he treatise on the newtonian doctrine on the other hand in we day newton 's absurd theory of color still completely hold the field forty year after the publication of goethe 's hume too be disregard up to he fiftieth year though he begin very early and write in a thoroughly popular style and kant in spite of have write and talk all he life long do not become a famous man until he be sixty -lrb- footnote 1 : see especially § § 35 113 118 120 122 128 -rrb- artist and poet have to be sure more chance than thinker because they public be at least a hundred time as large still what be think of beethoven and mozart during they life what of dante what even of shakespeare if the latter 's contemporary have in any way recognize he worth at least one good and accredited portrait of he would have come down to we from a age when the art of painting flourish whereas we possess only some very doubtful picture a bad copperplate and a still worse bust on he tomb -lrb- 1 -rrb- and in like manner if he have be duly honor specimen of he handwriting would have be preserve to we by the hundred instead of be confine as be the case to the signature to a few legal document the portuguese be still proud of they only poet camoëns he live however on alms collect every evening in the street by a black slave whom he have bring with he from the indy in time no doubt justice will be do everyone _ tempo è galant uomo _ but it be as late and slow in arrive as in a court of law and the secret condition of it be that the recipient shall be no longer alive the precept of jesus the son of sirach be faithfully follow : _ judge none bless before he death _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- he then who have produce immortal work must find comfort by apply to they the word of the indian myth that the minute of life amongst the immortal seem like year of earthly existence and so too that year upon earth be only as the minute of the immortal -lrb- footnote 1 : a wivell : _ a inquiry into the history authenticity and characteristic of shakespeare 's portrait _ with 21 engraving london 1836 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ecclesiasticus _ xi 28 -rrb- this lack of critical insight be also show by the fact that while in every century the excellent work of earlier time be hold in honor that of its own be misunderstand and the attention which be its due be give to bad work such as every decade carry with it only to be the sport of the next that man be slow to recognize genuine merit when it appear in they own age also prove that they do not understand or enjoy or really value the long-acknowledged work of genius which they honor only on the score of authority the crucial test be the fact that bad work -- fichte 's philosophy for example -- if it win any reputation also maintain it for one or two generation and only when its public be very large do its fall follow sooner now just as the sun can not shed its light but to the eye that see it nor music sound but to the hearing ear so the value of all masterly work in art and science be condition by the kinship and capacity of the mind to which it speak it be only such a mind as this that possess the magic word to stir and call forth the spirit that lie hide in great work to the ordinary mind a masterpiece be a sealed cabinet of mystery -- a unfamiliar musical instrument from which the player however much he may flatter himself can draw none but confused tone how different a painting look when see in a good light as compare with some dark corner just in the same way the impression make by a masterpiece vary with the capacity of the mind to understand it a fine work then require a mind sensitive to its beauty a thoughtful work a mind that can really think if it be to exist and live at all but alas it may happen only too often that he who give a fine work to the world afterwards feel like a maker of firework who display with enthusiasm the wonder that have take he so much time and trouble to prepare and then learn that he have come to the wrong place and that the fancied spectator be one and all inmate of a asylum for the blind still even that be better than if he public have consist entirely of man who make firework themselves as in this case if he display have be extraordinarily good it might possibly have cost he he head the source of all pleasure and delight be the feeling of kinship even with the sense of beauty it be unquestionably we own species in the animal world and then again we own race that appear to we the fairest so too in intercourse with other every man show a decide preference for those who resemble he and a blockhead will find the society of another blockhead incomparably more pleasant than that of any number of great mind put together every man must necessarily take he chief pleasure in he own work because it be the mirror of he own mind the echo of he own thought and next in order will come the work of people like he that be to say a dull shallow and perverse man a dealer in mere word will give he sincere and hearty applause only to that which be dull shallow perverse or merely verbose on the other hand he will allow merit to the work of great mind only on the score of authority in other word because he be ashamed to speak he opinion for in reality they give he no pleasure at all they do not appeal to he nay they repel he and he will not confess this even to himself the work of genius can not be fully enjoy except by those who be themselves of the privileged order the first recognition of they however when they exist without authority to support they demand considerable superiority of mind when the reader take all this into consideration he should be surprise not that great work be so late in win reputation but that it win it at all and as a matter of fact fame come only by a slow and complex process the stupid person be by degree force and as it be tame into recognize the superiority of one who stand immediately above he this one in he turn bow before some one else and so it go on until the weight of the vote gradually prevail over they number and this be just the condition of all genuine in other word deserve fame but until then the greatest genius even after he have pass he time of trial stand like a king amidst a crowd of he own subject who do not know he by sight and therefore will not do he behest unless indeed he chief minister of state be in he train for no subordinate official can be the direct recipient of the royal command as he know only the signature of he immediate superior and this be repeat all the way up into the highest rank where the under-secretary attest the minister 's signature and the minister that of the king there be analogous stage to be pass before a genius can attain widespread fame this be why he reputation most easily come to a standstill at the very outset because the highest authority of whom there can be but few be most frequently not to be find but the further down he go in the scale the more numerous be those who take the word from above so that he fame be no more arrest we must console ourselves for this state of thing by reflect that it be really fortunate that the greater number of man do not form a judgment on they own responsibility but merely take it on authority for what sort of criticism should we have on plato and kant homer shakespeare and goethe if every man be to form he opinion by what he really have and enjoy of these writer instead of be force by authority to speak of they in a fit and proper way however little he may really feel what he say unless something of this kind take place it would be impossible for true merit in any high sphere to attain fame at all at the same time it be also fortunate that every man have just so much critical power of he own as be necessary for recognize the superiority of those who be place immediately over he and for follow they lead this mean that the many come in the end to submit to the authority of the few and there result that hierarchy of critical judgment on which be base the possibility of a steady and eventually wide-reaching fame the lowest class in the community be quite impervious to the merit of a great genius and for these people there be nothing left but the monument raise to he which by the impression it produce on they sens awake in they a dim idea of the man 's greatness literary journal should be a dam against the unconscionable scribble of the age and the ever-increasing deluge of bad and useless book they judgment should be uncorrupted just and rigorous and every piece of bad work do by a incapable person every device by which the empty head try to come to the assistance of the empty purse that be to say about nine-tenth of all exist book should be mercilessly scourge literary journal would then perform they duty which be to keep down the craving for write and put a check upon the deception of the public instead of further these evil by a miserable toleration which play into the hand of author and publisher and rob the reader of he time and he money if there be such a paper as i mean every bad writer every brainless compiler every plagiarist from other 's book every hollow and incapable place-hunter every sham-philosopher every vain and languish poetaster would shudder at the prospect of the pillory in which he bad work would inevitably have to stand soon after publication this would paralyze he twitch finger to the true welfare of literature in which what be bad be not only useless but positively pernicious now most book be bad and ought to have remain unwritten consequently praise should be as rare as be now the case with blame which be withhold under the influence of personal consideration couple with the maxim _ acceda socius laude lauderi ut absen _ it be quite wrong to try to introduce into literature the same toleration as must necessarily prevail in society towards those stupid brainless people who everywhere swarm in it in literature such people be impudent intruder and to disparage the bad be here duty towards the good for he who think nothing bad will think nothing good either politeness which have its source in social relation be in literature a alien and often injurious element because it exact that bad work shall be call good in this way the very aim of science and art be directly frustrate the ideal journal could to be sure be write only by people who join incorruptible honesty with rare knowledge and still rarer power of judgment so that perhaps there could at the very most be one and even hardly one in the whole country but there it would stand like a just aeropagus every member of which would have to be elect by all the other under the system that prevail at present literary journal be carry on by a clique and secretly perhaps also by bookseller for the good of the trade and they be often nothing but coalition of bad head to prevent the good one succeed as goethe once remark to I nowhere be there so much dishonesty as in literature but above all anonymity that shield of all literary rascality would have to disappear it be introduce under the pretext of protect the honest critic who warn the public against the resentment of the author and he friend but where there be one case of this sort there will be a hundred where it merely serve to take all responsibility from the man who can not stand by what he have say or possibly to conceal the shame of one who have be cowardly and base enough to recommend a book to the public for the purpose of put money into he own pocket often enough it be only a cloak for cover the obscurity incompetence and insignificance of the critic it be incredible what impudence these fellow will show and what literary trickery they will venture to commit as soon as they know they be safe under the shadow of anonymity let I recommend a general _ anti-criticism _ a universal medicine or panacea to put a stop to all anonymous review whether it praise the bad or blame the good : _ rascal you name _ for a man to wrap himself up and draw he hat over he face and then fall upon people who be walk about without any disguise -- this be not the part of a gentleman it be the part of a scoundrel and a knave a anonymous review have no more authority than a anonymous letter and one should be receive with the same mistrust as the other or shall we take the name of the man who consent to preside over what be in the strict sense of the word _ une société anonyme _ as a guarantee for the veracity of he colleague even rousseau in the preface to the _ nouvelle heloïse _ declare _ tout honnête homme doit avouer les livres qu'il public _ which in plain language mean that every honorable man ought to sign he article and that no one be honorable who do not do so how much truer this be of polemical writing which be the general character of review riemer be quite right in the opinion he give in he _ reminiscence of goethe : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a overt enemy _ he say _ a enemy who meet you face to face be a honorable man who will treat you fairly and with whom you can come to term and be reconcile : but a enemy who conceal himself _ be a base cowardly scoundrel _ who have not courage enough to avow he own judgment it be not he opinion that he care about but only the secret pleasure of wreak he anger without be find out or punish _ this will also have be goethe 's opinion as he be generally the source from which riemer draw he observation and indeed rousseau 's maxim apply to every line that be print would a man in a mask ever be allow to harangue a mob or speak in any assembly and that too when he be go to attack other and overwhelm they with abuse -lrb- footnote 1 : preface p xxix -rrb- anonymity be the refuge for all literary and journalistic rascality it be a practice which must be completely stop every article even in a newspaper should be accompany by the name of its author and the editor should be make strictly responsible for the accuracy of the signature the freedom of the press should be thus far restricted so that when a man publicly proclaim through the far-sounding trumpet of the newspaper he should be answerable for it at any rate with he honor if he have any and if he have none let he name neutralize the effect of he word and since even the most insignificant person be know in he own circle the result of such a measure would be to put a end to two-third of the newspaper lie and to restrain the audacity of many a poisonous tongue on reputation writer may be classify as meteor planet and fix star a meteor make a striking effect for a moment you look up and cry _ there _ and it be go for ever planet and wander star last a much longer time they often outshine the fix star and be confound with they by the inexperienced but this only because they be near it be not long before they must yield they place nay the light they give be reflect only and the sphere of they influence be confine to they own orbit -- they contemporary they path be one of change and movement and with the circuit of a few year they tale be tell fix star be the only one that be constant they position in the firmament be secure they shine with a light of they own they effect to-day be the same as it be yesterday because have no parallax they appearance do not alter with a difference in we standpoint they belong not to _ one _ system _ one _ nation only but to the universe and just because they be so very far away it be usually many year before they light be visible to the inhabitant of this earth we have see in the previous chapter that where a man 's merit be of a high order it be difficult for he to win reputation because the public be uncritical and lack discernment but another and no less serious hindrance to fame come from the envy it have to encounter for even in the lowest kind of work envy balk even the beginning of a reputation and never cease to cleave to it up to the last how great a part be play by envy in the wicked way of the world ariosto be right in say that the dark side of we mortal life predominate so full it be of this evil : _ questa assai più oscura che serena vita mortal tutta d'invidia piena _ for envy be the move spirit of that secret and informal though flourish alliance everywhere make by mediocrity against individual eminence no matter of what kind in he own sphere of work no one will allow another to be distinguish : he be a intruder who can not be tolerate _ si quelq ` un excelle parmus nous qu'il aille exceller ailleur _ this be the universal password of the second-rate in addition then to the rarity of true merit and the difficulty it have in be understand and recognize there be the envy of thousand to be reckon with all of they bent on suppress nay on smother it altogether no one be take for what he be but for what other make of he and this be the handle use by mediocrity to keep down distinction by not let it come up as long as that can possibly be prevent there be two way of behave in regard to merit : either to have some of one 's own or to refuse any to other the latter method be more convenient and so it be generally adopt as envy be a mere sign of deficiency so to envy merit argue the lack of it my excellent balthazar gracian have give a very fine account of this relation between envy and merit in a lengthy fable which may be find in he _ discreto _ under the head _ hombre de ostentacion _ he describe all the bird as meeting together and conspire against the peacock because of he magnificent feather _ if _ say the magpie _ we could only manage to put a stop to the curse parading of he tail there would soon be a end of he beauty for what be not see be as good as what do not exist _ this explain how modesty come to be a virtue it be invent only as a protection against envy that there have always be rascal to urge this virtue and to rejoice heartily over the bashfulness of a man of merit have be show at length in my chief work -lrb- 1 -rrb- in lichtenberg 's _ miscellaneous writings _ i find this sentence quote : _ modesty should be the virtue of those who possess no other _ goethe have a well-known say which offend many people : _ it be only knave who be modest _ -- _ nur die lumpen sind bescheiden _ but it have its prototype in cervante who include in he _ journey up parnassus _ certain rule of conduct for poet and amongst they the following : _ everyone whose verse show he to be a poet should have a high opinion of himself rely on the proverb that he be a knave who think himself one _ and shakespeare in many of he sonnet which give he the only opportunity he have of speaking of himself declare with a confidence equal to he ingenuousness that what he write be immortal -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ welt al wille _ vol ii c 37 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : collier one of he critical editor in he introduction to the sonette remark upon this point : in many of they be to be find most remarkable indication of self-confidence and of assurance in the immortality of he verse and in this respect the author 's opinion be constant and uniform he never scruple to express it and perhaps there be no writer of ancient or modern time who for the quantity of such writings leave behind he have so frequently or so strongly declare that what he have produce in this department of poetry ` the world would not willingly let die ' -rrb- a method of underrate good work often use by envy -- in reality however only the obverse side of it -- consist in the dishonorable and unscrupulous laudation of the bad for no sooner do bad work gain currency than it draw attention from the good but however effective this method may be for a while especially if it be apply on a large scale the day of reckoning come at last and the fleeting credit give to bad work be pay off by the lasting discredit which overtake those who abjectly praise it hence these critic prefer to remain anonymous a like fate threaten though more remotely those who depreciate and censure good work and consequently many be too prudent to attempt it but there be another way and when a man of eminent merit appear the first effect he produce be often only to pique all he rival just as the peacock 's tail offend the bird this reduce they to a deep silence and they silence be so unanimous that it savor of preconcertion they tongue be all paralyzed it be the _ silentium livori _ describe by seneca this malicious silence which be technically know as _ ignore _ may for a long time interfere with the growth of reputation if as happen in the higher walk of learn where a man 's immediate audience be wholly compose of rival worker and profess student who then form the channel of he fame the greater public be oblige to use its suffrage without be able to examine the matter for itself and if in the end that malicious silence be break in upon by the voice of praise it will be but seldom that this happen entirely apart from some ulterior aim pursue by those who thus manipulate justice for as goethe say in the _ west-östlicher divan _ a man can get no recognition either from many person or from only one unless it be to publish abroad the critic 's own discernment : _ denn e ist kein anerkenen weder vieler noch des einen wenn es nicht be tage fördert will man selbst be möchte scheinen _ the credit you allow to another man engage in work similar to you own or akin to it must at bottom be withdraw from yourself and you can praise he only at the expense of you own claim accordingly mankind be in itself not at all incline to award praise and reputation it be more disposed to blame and find fault whereby it indirectly praise itself if notwithstanding this praise be win from mankind some extraneous motive must prevail i be not here refer to the disgraceful way in which mutual friend will puff one another into a reputation outside of that a effectual motive be supply by the feeling that next to the merit of do something oneself come that of correctly appreciate and recognize what other have do this accord with the threefold division of head draw up by hesiod -lrb- 1 -rrb- and afterwards by machiavellus -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ there be _ say the latter _ in the capacity of mankind three variety : one man will understand a thing by himself another so far as it be explain to he a third neither of himself nor when it be put clearly before he _ he then who abandon hope of make good he claim to the first class will be glad to seize the opportunity of take a place in the second it be almost wholly owe to this state of thing that merit may always rest assure of ultimately meet with recognition -lrb- footnote 1 : _ work and day _ 293 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ the prince _ ch 22 -rrb- to this also be due the fact that when the value of a work have once be recognize and may no longer be conceal or deny all man vie in praise and honor it simply because they be conscious of thereby do themselves a honor they act in the spirit of xenophon 's remark : _ he must be a wise man who know what be wise _ so when they see that the prize of original merit be for ever out of they reach they hasten to possess themselves of that which come second best -- the correct appreciation of it here it happen as with a army which have be force to yield when just as previously every man want to be foremost in the fight so now every man try to be foremost in run away they all hurry forward to offer they applause to one who be now recognize to be worthy of praise in virtue of a recognition as a rule unconscious of that law of homogeneity which i mention in the last chapter so that it may seem as though they way of thinking and look at thing be homogeneous with that of the celebrated man and that they may at least save the honor of they literary taste since nothing else be leave they from this it be plain that whereas it be very difficult to win fame it be not hard to keep it when once attain and also that a reputation which come quickly do not last very long for here too _ quod cito fit cito perit _ it be obvious that if the ordinary average man can easily recognize and the rival worker willingly acknowledge the value of any performance it will not stand very much above the capacity of either of they to achieve it for themselves _ tantum quisque laudat quantum se posse sperat imitari _ -- a man will praise a thing only so far as he hope to be able to imitate it himself further it be a suspicious sign if a reputation come quickly for a application of the law of homogeneity will show that such a reputation be nothing but the direct applause of the multitude what this mean may be see by a remark once make by phocion when he be interrupt in a speech by the loud cheer of the mob turn to he friend who be stand close by he ask : _ have i make a mistake and say something stupid _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : plutarch _ apophthegm _ -rrb- contrarily a reputation that be to last a long time must be slow in mature and the century of its duration have generally to be buy at the cost of contemporary praise for that which be to keep its position so long must be of a perfection difficult to attain and even to recognize this perfection require man who be not always to be find and never in number sufficiently great to make themselves hear whereas envy be always on the watch and do its best to smother they voice but with moderate talent which soon meet with recognition there be the danger that those who possess it will outlive both it and themselves so that a youth of fame may be follow by a old age of obscurity in the case of great merit on the other hand a man may remain unknown for many year but make up for it later on by attain a brilliant reputation and if it should be that this come only after he be no more well he be to be reckon amongst those of whom jean paul say that extreme unction be they baptism he may console himself by think of the saint who also be canonize only after they be dead thus what mahlmann -lrb- 1 -rrb- have say so well in _ herode _ hold good in this world truly great work never please at once and the god set up by the multitude keep he place on the altar but a short time : _ ich denke da wahre grosse in der welt ist immer nur da be nicht gleich gefällt und wen der pöbel zum gotte weiht der steht auf dem altar nur kurze zeit _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- August mahlmann -lrb- 1771-1826 -rrb- journalist poet and story-writer he _ herode vor bethlehem _ be a parody of kotzebue 's _ hussiten vor naumburg _ -rrb- it be worth mention that this rule be most directly confirm in the case of picture where as connoisseur well know the greatest masterpiece be not the first to attract attention if they make a deep impression it be not after one but only after repeat inspection but then they excite more and more admiration every time they be see moreover the chance that any give work will be quickly and rightly appreciate depend upon two condition : firstly the character of the work whether high or low in other word easy or difficult to understand and secondly the kind of public it attract whether large or small this latter condition be no doubt in most instance a corollary of the former but it also partly depend upon whether the work in question admit like book and musical composition of be produce in great number by the compound action of these two condition achievement which serve no materially useful end -- and these alone be under consideration here -- will vary in regard to the chance they have of meeting with timely recognition and due appreciation and the order of precedence beginning with those who have the greatest chance will be somewhat as follow : acrobat circus rider ballet-dancers juggler actor singer musician composer poet -lrb- both the last on account of the multiplication of they work -rrb- architect painter sculptor philosopher the last place of all be unquestionably take by philosopher because they work be mean not for entertainment but for instruction and because they presume some knowledge on the part of the reader and require he to make a effort of he own to understand they this make they public extremely small and cause they fame to be more remarkable for its length than for its breadth and in general it may be say that the possibility of a man 's fame last a long time stand in almost inverse ratio with the chance that it will be early in make its appearance so that as regard length of fame the above order of precedence may be reverse but then the poet and the composer will come in the end to stand on the same level as the philosopher since when once a work be commit to write it be possible to preserve it to all time however the first place still belong by right to the philosopher because of the much greater scarcity of good work in this sphere and the high importance of it and also because of the possibility it offer of a almost perfect translation into any language sometimes indeed it happen that a philosopher 's fame outlive even he work themselves as have happen with thale empedocle heraclitus democritus parmenide epicurus and many other my remark be as i have say confine to achievement that be not of any material use work that serve some practical end or minister directly to some pleasure of the sens will never have any difficulty in be duly appreciate no first-rate pastry-cook could long remain obscure in any town to say nothing of have to appeal to posterity under fame of rapid growth be also to be reckon fame of a false and artificial kind where for instance a book be work into a reputation by means of unjust praise the help of friend corrupt criticism prompt from above and collusion from below all this tell upon the multitude which be rightly presume to have no power of judge for itself this sort of fame be like a swimming bladder by its aid a heavy body may keep afloat it bear up for a certain time long or short accord as the bladder be well sew up and blow but still the air come out gradually and the body sink this be the inevitable fate of all work which be famous by reason of something outside of themselves false praise die away collusion come to a end critic declare the reputation unground it vanish and be replace by so much the greater contempt contrarily a genuine work which have the source of its fame in itself can kindle admiration afresh in every age resemble a body of low specific gravity which always keep up of its own accord and so go float down the stream of time man of great genius whether they work be in poetry philosophy or art stand in all age like isolate hero keep up single-handed a desperate struggle against the onslaught of a army of opponent -lrb- 1 -rrb- be not this characteristic of the miserable nature of mankind the dullness grossness perversity silliness and brutality of by far the greater part of the race be always a obstacle to the effort of the genius whatever be the method of he art they so form that hostile army to which at last he have to succumb let the isolate champion achieve what he may : it be slow to be acknowledge it be late in be appreciate and then only on the score of authority it may easily fall into neglect again at any rate for a while ever afresh it find itself oppose by false shallow and insipid idea which be better suit to that large majority that so generally hold the field though the critic may step forth and say like hamlet when he hold up the two portrait to he wretched mother _ have you eye have you eye _ alas they have none when i watch the behavior of a crowd of people in the presence of some great master 's work and mark the manner of they applause they often remind I of trained monkey in a show the monkey 's gesture be no doubt much like those of man but now and again they betray that the real inward spirit of these gesture be not in they they irrational nature peep out -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- at this point schopenhauer interrupt the thread of he discourse to speak at length upon a example of false fame those who be at all acquaint with the philosopher 's view will not be surprise to find that the writer thus hold up to scorn be hegel and reader of the other volume in this series will with the translator have have by now quite enough of the subject the passage be therefore omit -rrb- it be often say of a man that _ he be in advance of he age _ and it follow from the above remark that this must be take to mean that he be in advance of humanity in general just because of this fact a genius make no direct appeal except to those who be too rare to allow of they ever form a numerous body at any one period if he be in this respect not particularly favor by fortune he will be _ misunderstand by he own age _ in other word he will remain unaccepted until time gradually bring together the voice of those few person who be capable of judge a work of such high character then posterity will say : _ this man be in advance of he age _ instead of _ in advance of humanity _ because humanity will be glad to lay the burden of its own fault upon a single epoch hence if a man have be superior to he own age he would also have be superior to any other provide that in that age by some rare and happy chance a few just man capable of judge in the sphere of he achievement have be bear at the same time with he just as when accord to a beautiful indian myth vischnu become incarnate as a hero so too brahma at the same time appear as the singer of he deed and hence valmikus vyasa and kalidasa be incarnation of brahma in this sense then it may be say that every immortal work put its age to the proof whether or no it will be able to recognize the merit of it as a rule the man of any age stand such a test no better than the neighbor of philemon and bauci who expel the deity they fail to recognize accordingly the right standard for judge the intellectual worth of any generation be supply not by the great mind that make they appearance in it -- for they capacity be the work of nature and the possibility of cultivate they a matter of chance circumstance -- but by the way in which contemporary receive they work whether i mean they give they applause soon and with a will or late and in niggardly fashion or leave it to be bestow altogether by posterity this last fate will be especially reserve for work of a high character for the happy chance mention above will be all the more certain not to come in proportion as there be few to appreciate the kind of work do by great mind herein lie the immeasurable advantage possess by poet in respect of reputation because they work be accessible to almost everyone if it have be possible for sir walter scott to be read and criticise by only some hundred person perhaps in he life-time any common scribbler would have be prefer to he and afterwards when he have take he proper place it would also have be say in he honor that he be _ in advance of he age _ but if envy dishonesty and the pursuit of personal aim be add to the incapacity of those hundred person who in the name of they generation be call upon to pass judgment on a work then indeed it meet with the same sad fate as attend a suitor who plead before a tribunal of judge one and all corrupt in corroboration of this we find that the history of literature generally show all those who make knowledge and insight they goal to have remain unrecognized and neglect whilst those who parade with the vain show of it receive the admiration of they contemporary together with the emolument the effectiveness of a author turn chiefly upon he get the reputation that he should be read but by practice various art by the operation of chance and by certain natural affinity this reputation be quickly win by a hundred worthless people : while a worthy writer may come by it very slowly and tardily the former possess friend to help they for the rabble be always a numerous body which hold well together the latter have nothing but enemy because intellectual superiority be everywhere and under all circumstance the most hateful thing in the world and especially to bungler in the same line of work who want to pass for something themselves -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : if the professor of philosophy should chance to think that i be here hint at they and the tactic they have for more than thirty year pursue toward my work they have hit the nail upon the head -rrb- this be so it be a prime condition for do any great work -- any work which be to outlive its own age that a man pay no heed to he contemporary they view and opinion and the praise or blame which they bestow this condition be however fulfil of itself when a man really do anything great and it be fortunate that it be so for if in produce such a work he be to look to the general opinion or the judgment of he colleague they would lead he astray at every step hence if a man want to go down to posterity he must withdraw from the influence of he own age this will of course generally mean that he must also renounce any influence upon it and be ready to buy century of fame by foregoing the applause of he contemporary for when any new and wide-reaching truth come into the world -- and if it be new it must be paradoxical -- a obstinate stand will be make against it as long as possible nay people will continue to deny it even after they slacken they opposition and be almost convince of its truth meanwhile it go on quietly work its way and like a acid undermine everything around it from time to time a crash be hear the old error come totter to the ground and suddenly the new fabric of think stand reveal as though it be a monument just uncovered everyone recognize and admire it to be sure this all come to pass for the most part very slowly as a rule people discover a man to be worth listen to only after he be go they _ hear hear _ resound when the orator have leave the platform work of the ordinary type meet with a better fate arise as they do in the course of and in connection with the general advance in contemporary culture they be in close alliance with the spirit of they age -- in other word just those opinion which happen to be prevalent at the time they aim at suit the need of the moment if they have any merit it be soon recognize and they gain currency as book which reflect the latest idea justice nay more than justice be do to they they afford little scope for envy since as be say above a man will praise a thing only so far as he hope to be able to imitate it himself but those rare work which be destine to become the property of all mankind and to live for century be at they origin too far in advance of the point at which culture happen to stand and on that very account foreign to it and the spirit of they own time they neither belong to it nor be they in any connection with it and hence they excite no interest in those who be dominate by it they belong to another a higher stage of culture and a time that be still far off they course be related to that of ordinary work as the orbit of uranus to the orbit of mercury for the moment they get no justice do to they people be at a loss how to treat they so they leave they alone and go they own snail 's pace for themselves do the worm see the eagle as it soar aloft of the number of book write in any language about one in 100000 form a part of its real and permanent literature what a fate this one book have to endure before it outstrip those 100000 and gain its due place of honor such a book be the work of a extraordinary and eminent mind and therefore it be specifically different from the other a fact which sooner or later become manifest let no one fancy that thing will ever improve in this respect no the miserable constitution of humanity never change though it may to be sure take somewhat vary form with every generation a distinguished mind seldom have its full effect in the life-time of its possessor because at bottom it be completely and properly understand only by mind already akin to it as it be a rare thing for even one man out of many million to tread the path that lead to immortality he must of necessity be very lonely the journey to posterity lie through a horribly dreary region like the lybian desert of which as be well know no one have any idea who have not see it for himself meanwhile let I before all thing recommend the traveler to take light baggage with he otherwise he will have to throw away too much on the road let he never forget the word of balthazar gracian : _ lo bueno si breve dos vezes bueno _ -- good work be doubly good if it be short this advice be specially applicable to my own countryman compare with the short span of time they live man of great intellect be like huge building stand on a small plot of ground the size of the building can not be see by anyone just in front of it nor for a analogous reason can the greatness of a genius be estimate while he live but when a century have pass the world recognize it and wish he back again if the perishable son of time have produce a imperishable work how short he own life seem compare with that of he child he be like semelum or maium -- a mortal mother who give birth to a immortal son or contrarily he be like achille in regard to theti what a contrast there be between what be fleeting and what be permanent the short span of a man 's life he necessitous afflict unstable existence will seldom allow of he see even the beginning of he immortal child 's brilliant career nor will the father himself be take for that which he really be it may be say indeed that a man whose fame come after he be the reverse of a nobleman who be precede by it however the only difference that it ultimately make to a man to receive he fame at the hand of contemporary rather than from posterity be that in the former case he admirer be separate from he by space and in the latter by time for even in the case of contemporary fame a man do not as a rule see he admirer actually before he reverence can not endure close proximity it almost always dwell at some distance from its object and in the presence of the person revere it melt like butter in the sun accordingly if a man be celebrate with he contemporary nine-tenth of those amongst whom he live will let they esteem be guide by he rank and fortune and the remain tenth may perhaps have a dull consciousness of he high quality because they have hear about he from remote quarter there be a fine latin letter of petrarch 's on this incompatibility between reverence and the presence of the person and between fame and life it come second in he _ epistolae familiares _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and it be address to thoma messanensis he there observe amongst other thing that the learn man of he age all make it a rule to think little of a man 's writings if they have even once see he -lrb- footnote 1 : in the venetian edition of 1492 -rrb- since distance then be essential if a famous man be to be recognize and revere it do not matter whether it be distance of space or of time it be true that he may sometimes hear of he fame in the one case but never in the other but still genuine and great merit may make up for this by confidently anticipate its posthumous fame nay he who produce some really great thought be conscious of he connection with come generation at the very moment he conceive it so that he feel the extension of he existence through century and thus live _ with _ posterity as well as _ for _ it and when after enjoy a great man 's work we be seize with admiration for he and wish he back so that we might see and speak with he and have he in we possession this desire of ours be not unrequited for he too have have he longing for that posterity which will grant the recognition honor gratitude and love deny by envious contemporary if intellectual work of the highest order be not allow they due until they come before the tribunal of posterity a contrary fate be prepare for certain brilliant error which proceed from man of talent and appear with a air of be well ground these error be defend with so much acumen and learn that they actually become famous with they own age and maintain they position at least during they author 's lifetime of this sort be many false theory and wrong criticism also poem and work of art which exhibit some false taste or mannerism favor by contemporary prejudice they gain reputation and currency simply because no one be yet forthcoming who know how to refute they or otherwise prove they falsity and when he appear as he usually do in the next generation the glory of these work be bring to a end posthumous judge be they decision favorable to the appellant or not form the proper court for quash the verdict of contemporary that be why it be so difficult and so rare to be victorious alike in both tribunal the unfailing tendency of time to correct knowledge and judgment should always be keep in view as a means of allay anxiety whenever any grievous error appear whether in art or science or practical life and gain ground or when some false and thoroughly perverse policy of movement be undertake and receive applause at the hand of man no one should be angry or still less despondent but simply imagine that the world have already abandon the error in question and now only require time and experience to recognize of its own accord that which a clear vision detect at the first glance when the fact themselves be eloquent of a truth there be no need to rush to its aid with word : for time will give it a thousand tongue how long it may be before they speak will of course depend upon the difficulty of the subject and the plausibility of the error but come they will and often it would be of no avail to try to anticipate they in the worst case it will happen with theory as it happen with affair in practical life where sham and deception embolden by success advance to greater and greater length until discovery be make almost inevitable it be just so with theory through the blind confidence of the blockhead who broach they they absurdity reach such a pitch that at last it be obvious even to the dullest eye we may thus say to such people : _ the wilder you statement the better _ there be also some comfort to be find in reflect upon all the whim and crotchet which have they day and have now utterly vanish in style in grammar in spelling there be false notion of this sort which last only three or four year but when the error be on a large scale while we lament the brevity of human life we shall in any case do well to lag behind we own age when we see it on a downward path for there be two way of not keep on a level with the time a man may be below it or he may be above it on genius no difference of rank position or birth be so great as the gulf that separate the countless million who use they head only in the service of they belly in other word look upon it as a instrument of the will and those very few and rare person who have the courage to say : no it be too good for that my head shall be active only in its own service it shall try to comprehend the wondrous and vary spectacle of this world and then reproduce it in some form whether as art or as literature that may answer to my character as a individual these be the truly noble the real _ noblesse _ of the world the other be serf and go with the soil -- _ glebae adscripti _ of course i be here refer to those who have not only the courage but also the call and therefore the right to order the head to quit the service of the will with a result that prove the sacrifice to have be worth the make in the case of those to whom all this can only partially apply the gulf be not so wide but even though they talent be small so long as it be real there will always be a sharp line of demarcation between they and the million -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the correct scale for adjust the hierarchy of intelligence be furnish by the degree in which the mind take merely individual or approach universal view of thing the brute recognize only the individual as such : its comprehension do not extend beyond the limit of the individual but man reduce the individual to the general herein lie the exercise of he reason and the higher he intelligence reach the nearer do he general idea approach the point at which they become universal -rrb- the work of fine art poetry and philosophy produce by a nation be the outcome of the superfluous intellect exist in it for he who can understand aright -- _ cum grano sali _ -- the relation between the genius and the normal man may perhaps be best express as follow : a genius have a double intellect one for himself and the service of he will the other for the world of which he become the mirror in virtue of he purely objective attitude towards it the work of art or poetry or philosophy produce by the genius be simply the result or quintessence of this contemplative attitude elaborate accord to certain technical rule the normal man on the other hand have only a single intellect which may be call _ subjective _ by contrast with the _ objective _ intellect of genius however acute this subjective intellect may be -- and it exist in very various degree of perfection -- it be never on the same level with the double intellect of genius just as the open chest note of the human voice however high be essentially different from the falsetto note these like the two upper octave of the flute and the harmonic of the violin be produce by the column of air divide itself into two vibrate half with a node between they while the open chest note of the human voice and the lower octave of the flute be produce by the undivided column of air vibrate as a whole this illustration may help the reader to understand that specific peculiarity of genius which be unmistakably stamp on the work and even on the physiognomy of he who be gifted with it at the same time it be obvious that a double intellect like this must as a rule obstruct the service of the will and this explain the poor capacity often show by genius in the conduct of life and what specially characterize genius be that it have none of that sobriety of temper which be always to be find in the ordinary simple intellect be it acute or dull the brain may be liken to a parasite which be nourish as a part of the human frame without contribute directly to its inner economy it be securely house in the topmost story and there lead a self-sufficient and independent life in the same way it may be say that a man endow with great mental gift lead apart from the individual life common to all a second life purely of the intellect he devote himself to the constant increase rectification and extension not of mere learning but of real systematic knowledge and insight and remain untouched by the fate that overtake he personally so long as it do not disturb he in he work it be thus a life which raise a man and set he above fate and its change always think learn experiment practice he knowledge the man soon come to look upon this second life as the chief mode of existence and he merely personal life as something subordinate serve only to advance end higher than itself a example of this independent separate existence be furnish by goethe during the war in the champagne and amid all the bustle of the camp he make observation for he theory of color and as soon as the numberless calamity of that war allow of he retire for a short time to the fortress of luxembourg he take up the manuscript of he _ farbenlehre _ this be a example which we the salt of the earth should endeavor to follow by never let anything disturb we in the pursuit of we intellectual life however much the storm of the world may invade and agitate we personal environment always remember that we be the son not of the bondwoman but of the free as we emblem and coat of arm i propose a tree mightily shake by the wind but still bear its ruddy fruit on every branch with the motto _ dum convellor mitescunt _ or _ conquassa sed ferax _ that purely intellectual life of the individual have its counterpart in humanity as a whole for there too the real life be the life of the _ will _ both in the empirical and in the transcendental meaning of the word the purely intellectual life of humanity lie in its effort to increase knowledge by means of the science and its desire to perfect the art both science and art thus advance slowly from one generation to another and grow with the century every race as it hurry by furnish its contribution this intellectual life like some gift from heaven hover over the stir and movement of the world or it be as it be a sweet-scented air develop out of the ferment itself -- the real life of mankind dominate by will and side by side with the history of nation the history of philosophy science and art take its innocent and bloodless way the difference between the genius and the ordinary man be no doubt a _ quantitative _ one in so far as it be a difference of degree but i be tempt to regard it also as _ qualitative _ in view of the fact that ordinary mind notwithstanding individual variation have a certain tendency to think alike thus on similar occasion they thought at once all take a similar direction and run on the same line and this explain why they judgment constantly agree -- not however because they be base on truth to such length do this go that certain fundamental view obtain amongst mankind at all time and be always be repeat and bring forward anew whilst the great mind of all age be in open or secret opposition to they a genius be a man in whose mind the world be present as a object be present in a mirror but with a degree more of clearness and a greater distinction of outline than be attain by ordinary people it be from he that humanity may look for most instruction for the deepest insight into the most important matter be to be acquire not by a observant attention to detail but by a close study of thing as a whole and if he mind reach maturity the instruction he give will be convey now in one form now in another thus genius may be define as a eminently clear consciousness of thing in general and therefore also of that which be oppose to they namely one 's own self the world look up to a man thus endowed and expect to learn something about life and its real nature but several highly favorable circumstance must combine to produce genius and this be a very rare event it happen only now and then let we say once in a century that a man be bear whose intellect so perceptibly surpass the normal measure as to amount to that second faculty which seem to be accidental as it be out of all relation to the will he may remain a long time without be recognize or appreciate stupidity prevent the one and envy the other but should this once come to pass mankind will crowd round he and he work in the hope that he may be able to enlighten some of the darkness of they existence or inform they about it he message be to some extent a revelation and he himself a higher be even though he may be but little above the ordinary standard like the ordinary man the genius be what he be chiefly for himself this be essential to he nature : a fact which can neither be avoid nor alter he may be for other remain a matter of chance and of secondary importance in no case can people receive from he mind more than a reflection and then only when he join with they in the attempt to get he thought into they head where however it be never anything but a exotic plant stunt and frail in order to have original uncommon and perhaps even immortal thought it be enough to estrange oneself so fully from the world of thing for a few moment that the most ordinary object and event appear quite new and unfamiliar in this way they true nature be disclose what be here demand can not perhaps be say to be difficult it be not in we power at all but be just the province of genius by itself genius can produce original thought just as little as a woman by herself can bear child outward circumstance must come to fructify genius and be as it be a father to its progeny the mind of genius be among other mind what the carbuncle be among precious stone : it send forth light of its own while the other reflect only that which they have receive the relation of the genius to the ordinary mind may also be describe as that of a idio-electrical body to one which merely be a conductor of electricity the mere man of learning who spend he life in teach what he have learn be not strictly to be call a man of genius just as idio-electrical body be not conductor nay genius stand to mere learning as the word to the music in a song a man of learning be a man who have learn a great deal a man of genius one from whom we learn something which the genius have learn from nobody great mind of which there be scarcely one in a hundred million be thus the lighthouse of humanity and without they mankind would lose itself in the boundless sea of monstrous error and bewilderment and so the simple man of learn in the strict sense of the word -- the ordinary professor for instance -- look upon the genius much as we look upon a hare which be good to eat after it have be kill and dress up so long as it be alive it be only good to shoot at he who wish to experience gratitude from he contemporary must adjust he pace to theirs but great thing be never produce in this way and he who want to do great thing must direct he gaze to posterity and in firm confidence elaborate he work for come generation no doubt the result may be that he will remain quite unknown to he contemporary and comparable to a man who compel to spend he life upon a lonely island with great effort set up a monument there to transmit to future sea-farer the knowledge of he existence if he think it a hard fate let he console himself with the reflection that the ordinary man who live for practical aim only often suffer a like fate without have any compensation to hope for inasmuch as he may under favorable condition spend a life of material production earn buying building fertilize lay out found establish beautify with daily effort and unflagging zeal and all the time think that he be work for himself and yet in the end it be he descendant who reap the benefit of it all and sometimes not even he descendant it be the same with the man of genius he too hope for he reward and for honor at least and at last find that he have work for posterity alone both to be sure have inherit a great deal from they ancestor the compensation i have mention as the privilege of genius lie not in what it be to other but in what it be to itself what man have in any real sense live more than he whose moment of thought make they echo hear through the tumult of century perhaps after all it would be the best thing for a genius to attain undisturbed possession of himself by spend he life in enjoy the pleasure of he own thought he own work and by admit the world only as the heir of he ample existence then the world would find the mark of he existence only after he death as it find that of the ichnolith -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- for a illustration of this feeling in poetry schopenhauer refer the reader to byron 's _ prophecy of dante _ : introd to c 4 -rrb- it be not only in the activity of he highest power that the genius surpass ordinary people a man who be unusually well-knit supple and agile will perform all he movement with exceptional ease even with comfort because he take a direct pleasure in a activity for which he be particularly well-equipped and therefore often exercise it without any object further if he be a acrobat or a dancer not only do he take leap which other people can not execute but he also betray rare elasticity and agility in those easier step which other can also perform and even in ordinary walking in the same way a man of superior mind will not only produce thought and work which could never have come from another it will not be here alone that he will show he greatness but as knowledge and think form a mode of activity natural and easy to he he will also delight himself in they at all time and so apprehend small matter which be within the range of other mind more easily quickly and correctly than they thus he will take a direct and lively pleasure in every increase of knowledge every problem solve every witty thought whether of he own or another 's and so he mind will have no further aim than to be constantly active this will be a inexhaustible spring of delight and boredom that spectre which haunt the ordinary man can never come near he then too the masterpiece of past and contemporary man of genius exist in they fullness for he alone if a great product of genius be recommend to the ordinary simple mind it will take as much pleasure in it as the victim of gout receive in be invite to a ball the one go for the sake of formality and the other read the book so as not to be in arrear for la bruyère be quite right when he say : _ all the wit in the world be lose upon he who have none _ the whole range of thought of a man of talent or of a genius compare with the thought of the common man be even when direct to object essentially the same like a brilliant oil-painting full of life compare with a mere outline or a weak sketch in water-color all this be part of the reward of genius and compensate he for a lonely existence in a world with which he have nothing in common and no sympathy but since size be relative it come to the same thing whether i say caius be a great man or caius have to live amongst wretchedly small people : for brobdingnack and lilliput vary only in the point from which they start however great then however admirable or instructive a long posterity may think the author of immortal work during he lifetime he will appear to he contemporary small wretched and insipid in proportion this be what i mean by say that as there be three hundred degree from the base of a tower to the summit so there be exactly three hundred from the summit to the base great mind thus owe little one some indulgence for it be only in virtue of these little mind that they themselves be great let we then not be surprise if we find man of genius generally unsociable and repellent it be not they want of sociability that be to blame they path through the world be like that of a man who go for a walk on a bright summer morning he gaze with delight on the beauty and freshness of nature but he have to rely wholly on that for entertainment for he can find no society but the peasant as they bend over the earth and cultivate the soil it be often the case that a great mind prefer soliloquy to the dialogue he may have in this world if he condescend to it now and then the hollowness of it may possibly drive he back to he soliloquy for in forgetfulness of he interlocutor or caring little whether he understand or not he talk to he as a child talk to a doll modesty in a great mind would no doubt be please to the world but unluckily it be a _ contradictio in adjecto _ it would compel a genius to give the thought and opinion nay even the method and style of the million preference over he own to set a higher value upon they and wide apart as they be to bring he view into harmony with theirs or even suppress they altogether so as to let the other hold the field in that case however he would either produce nothing at all or else he achievement would be just upon a level with theirs great genuine and extraordinary work can be do only in so far as its author disregard the method the thought the opinion of he contemporary and quietly work on in spite of they criticism on he side despise what they praise no one become great without arrogance of this sort should he life and work fall upon a time which can not recognize and appreciate he he be at any rate true to himself like some noble traveler force to pass the night in a miserable inn when morning come he contentedly go he way a poet or philosopher should have no fault to find with he age if it only permit he to do he work undisturbed in he own corner nor with he fate if the corner grant he allow of he follow he vocation without have to think about other people for the brain to be a mere laborer in the service of the belly be indeed the common lot of almost all those who do not live on the work of they hand and they be far from be discontent with they lot but it strike despair into a man of great mind whose brain-power go beyond the measure necessary for the service of the will and he prefer if need be to live in the narrowest circumstance so long as they afford he the free use of he time for the development and application of he faculty in other word if they give he the leisure which be invaluable to he it be otherwise with ordinary people : for they leisure have no value in itself nor be it indeed without its danger as these people seem to know the technical work of we time which be do to a unprecedented perfection have by increase and multiply object of luxury give the favorite of fortune a choice between more leisure and culture upon the one side and additional luxury and good living but with increase activity upon the other and true to they character they choose the latter and prefer champagne to freedom and they be consistent in they choice for to they every exertion of the mind which do not serve the aim of the will be folly intellectual effort for its own sake they call eccentricity therefore persistence in the aim of the will and the belly will be concentricity and to be sure the will be the center the kernel of the world but in general it be very seldom that any such alternative be present for as with money most man have no superfluity but only just enough for they need so with intelligence they possess just what will suffice for the service of the will that be for the carry on of they business have make they fortune they be content to gape or to indulge in sensual pleasure or childish amusement card or dice or they will talk in the dullest way or dress up and make obeisance to one another and how few be those who have even a little superfluity of intellectual power like the other they too make themselves a pleasure but it be a pleasure of the intellect either they will pursue some liberal study which bring they in nothing or they will practice some art and in general they will be capable of take a objective interest in thing so that it will be possible to converse with they but with the other it be better not to enter into any relation at all for except when they tell the result of they own experience or give a account of they special vocation or at any rate impart what they have learn from some one else they conversation will not be worth listen to and if anything be say to they they will rarely grasp or understand it aright and it will in most case be oppose to they own opinion balthazar gracian describe they very strikingly as man who be not man -- _ hombre che non lo son _ and giordano bruno _ say _ the same thing : _ what a difference there be in have to do with man compare with those who be only make in they image and likeness _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and how wonderfully this passage agree with that remark in the kurral : _ the common people look like man but i have never see anything quite like they _ if the reader will consider the extent to which these idea agree in thought and even in expression and in the wide difference between they in point of date and nationality he can not doubt but that they be at one with the fact of life it be certainly not under the influence of those passage that about twenty year ago i try to get a snuff-box make the lid of which should have two fine chestnut represent upon it if possible in mosaic together with a leaf which be to show that they be horse-chestnut this symbol be mean to keep the thought constantly before my mind if anyone wish for entertainment such as will prevent he feel solitary even when he be alone let I recommend the company of dog whose moral and intellectual quality may almost afford delight and gratification -lrb- footnote 1 : opera : ed wagner 1 224 -rrb- still we should always be careful to avoid be unjust i be often surprise by the cleverness and now and again by the stupidity of my dog and i have similar experience with mankind countless time in indignation at they incapacity they total lack of discernment they bestiality i have be force to echo the old complaint that folly be the mother and the nurse of the human race : _ humanus generi mater nutrixque profecto stultitium est _ but at other time i have be astounded that from such a race there could have go forth so many art and science abound in so much use and beauty even though it have always be the few that produce they yet these art and science have strike root establish and perfect themselves : and the race have with persistent fidelity preserved homer plato horace and other for thousand of year by copying and treasure they writings thus save they from oblivion in spite of all the evil and atrocity that have happen in the world thus the race have prove that it appreciate the value of these thing and at the same time it can form a correct view of special achievement or estimate sign of judgment and intelligence when this take place amongst those who belong to the great multitude it be by a kind of inspiration sometimes a correct opinion will be form by the multitude itself but this be only when the chorus of praise have grow full and complete it be then like the sound of untrained voice where there be enough of they it be always harmonious those who emerge from the multitude those who be call man of genius be merely the _ lucida intervallum _ of the whole human race they achieve that which other could not possibly achieve they originality be so great that not only be they divergence from other obvious but they individuality be express with such force that all the man of genius who have ever exist show every one of they peculiarity of character and mind so that the gift of he work be one which he alone of all man could ever have present to the world this be what make that simile of ariosto 's so true and so justly celebrate : _ natura lo fece e poi ruppe lo stampo _ after nature stamp a man of genius she break the die but there be always a limit to human capacity and no one can be a great genius without have some decidedly weak side it may even be some intellectual narrowness in other word there will foe some faculty in which he be now and then inferior to man of moderate endowment it will be a faculty which if strong might have be a obstacle to the exercise of the quality in which he excel what this weak point be it will always be hard to define with any accuracy even in a give case it may be better express indirectly thus plato 's weak point be exactly that in which aristotle be strong and _ vice versa _ and so too kant be deficient just where goethe be great now mankind be fond of venerate something but its veneration be generally direct to the wrong object and it remain so direct until posterity come to set it right but the educate public be no sooner set right in this than the honor which be due to genius degenerate just as the honor which the faithful pay to they saint easily pass into a frivolous worship of relic thousand of christian adore the relic of a saint whose life and doctrine be unknown to they and the religion of thousand of buddhist lie more in veneration of the holy tooth or some such object or the vessel that contain it or the holy bowl or the fossil footstep or the holy tree which buddha plant than in the thorough knowledge and faithful practice of he high teaching petrarch 's house in arqua tasso 's suppose prison in ferrara shakespeare 's house in stratford with he chair goethe 's house in weimar with its furniture kant 's old hat the autograph of great man these thing be gape at with interest and awe by many who have never read they work they can not do anything more than just gape the intelligent amongst they be move by the wish to see the object which the great man habitually have before he eye and by a strange illusion these produce the mistaken notion that with the object they be bring back the man himself or that something of he must cling to they akin to such people be those who earnestly strive to acquaint themselves with the subject-matter of a poet 's work or to unravel the personal circumstance and event in he life which have suggest particular passage this be as though the audience in a theater be to admire a fine scene and then rush upon the stage to look at the scaffolding that support it there be in we day enough instance of these critical investigator and they prove the truth of the say that mankind be interested not in the _ form _ of a work that be in its manner of treatment but in its actual matter all it care for be the theme to read a philosopher 's biography instead of study he thought be like neglect a picture and attend only to the style of its frame debate whether it be carve well or ill and how much it cost to gild it this be all very well however there be another class of person whose interest be also direct to material and personal consideration but they go much further and carry it to a point where it become absolutely futile because a great man have open up to they the treasure of he inmost be and by a supreme effort of he faculty produce work which not only redound to they elevation and enlightenment but will also benefit they posterity to the tenth and twentieth generation because he have present mankind with a matchless gift these varlet think themselves justified in sit in judgment upon he personal morality and try if they can not discover here or there some spot in he which will soothe the pain they feel at the sight of so great a mind compare with the overwhelming feeling of they own nothingness this be the real source of all those prolix discussion carry on in countless book and review on the moral aspect of goethe 's life and whether he ought not to have marry one or other of the girl with whom he fall in love in he young day whether again instead of honestly devote himself to the service of he master he should not have be a man of the people a german patriot worthy of a seat in the _ paulskirche _ and so on such cry ingratitude and malicious detraction prove that these self-constituted judge be as great knave morally as they be intellectually which be say a great deal a man of talent will strive for money and reputation but the spring that move genius to the production of its work be not as easy to name wealth be seldom its reward nor be it reputation or glory only a frenchman could mean that glory be such a uncertain thing and if you look at it closely of so little value besides it never correspond to the effort you have make : _ responsura tuo nunquam est par fama laborus _ nor again be it exactly the pleasure it give you for this be almost outweigh by the greatness of the effort it be rather a peculiar kind of instinct which drive the man of genius to give permanent form to what he see and feel without be conscious of any further motive it work in the main by a necessity similar to that which make a tree bear its fruit and no external condition be need but the ground upon which it be to thrive on a closer examination it seem as though in the case of a genius the will to live which be the spirit of the human species be conscious of have by some rare chance and for a brief period attain a greater clearness of vision and be now try to secure it or at least the outcome of it for the whole species to which the individual genius in he inmost be belong so that the light which he shed about he may pierce the darkness and dullness of ordinary human consciousness and there produce some good effect arise in some such way this instinct drive the genius to carry he work to completion without thinking of reward or applause or sympathy to leave all care for he own personal welfare to make he life one of industrious solitude and to strain he faculty to the utmost he thus come to think more about posterity than about contemporary because while the latter can only lead he astray posterity form the majority of the species and time will gradually bring the discerning few who can appreciate he meanwhile it be with he as with the artist describe by goethe he have no princely patron to prize he talent no friend to rejoice with he : _ ein fürst der die talente schätzt ein freund der sich mit mir ergötzt die haben leider mir gefehlt _ he work be as it be a sacred object and the true fruit of he life and he aim in store it away for a more discerning posterity will be to make it the property of mankind a aim like this far surpass all other and for it he wear the crown of thorn which be one day to bloom into a wreath of laurel all he power be concentrate in the effort to complete and secure he work just as the insect in the last stage of its development use its whole strength on behalf of a brood it will never live to see it put its egg in some place of safety where as it well know the young will one day find life and nourishment and then die in confidence end of project gutenberg
