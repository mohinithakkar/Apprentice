produce by distribute proofreader the headsman : or the abbaye des vignerons a tale by j fenimore cooper how oft the sight of means to do ill deed make deed ill do complete in one volume 1860 introduction early in October 1832 a travelling-carriage stop on the summit of that long descent where the road pitch from the elevated plain of moudon in switzerland to the level of the lake of geneva immediately above the little city of vévey the postilion have dismount to chain a wheel and the halt enable those he conduct to catch a glimpse of the lovely scenery of that remarkable view the traveller be a american family which have long be wander about europe and which be now destine it know not whither have just traverse a thousand mile of germany in its devious course four year before the same family have halt on the same spot nearly on the same day of the month of October and for precisely the same object it be then journey to italy and as its member hang over the view of the leman with its accessory of chillon châtelard blonay meillerie the peak of savoy and the wild range of the alp they have feel regret that the fairy scene be so soon to pass away the case be now different and yield to the charm of a nature so noble and yet so soft within a few hour the carriage be in remise a house be take the baggage unpacked and the household god of the traveller be erect for the twentieth time in a strange land we american -lrb- for the family have its head -rrb- be familiar with the ocean and the sight of water awake old and pleasant recollection he be hardly establish in vévey as a housekeeper before he seek a boat chance bring he to a certain jean descloux -lrb- we give the spelling at hazard -rrb- with whom he soon strike up a bargain and they launch forth in company upon the lake this casual meeting be the commencement of a agreeable and friendly intercourse jean descloux besides be a very good boatman be a respectable philosopher in he way possess a tolerable stock of general information he knowledge of america in particular might be deem a little remarkable he know it be a continent which lay west of he own quarter of the world that it have a place in it call new vévey that all the whites who have go there be not yet black and that there be plausible hope it might one day be civilized finding jean so enlighten on a subject under which most of the eastern savan break down the american think it well enough to prick he closely on other matter the worthy boatman turn out to be a man of singularly just discrimination he be a reasonably-good judge of the weather have diver marvel to relate concern the doings of the lake think the city very wrong for not make a port in the great square always maintain that the wine of st saphorin be very savory drinking for those who could get no better laugh at the idea of they be sufficient cordage in the world to reach the bottom of the genfer see be of opinion that the trout be a better fish than the fêrà speak with singular moderation of he ancient master the bourgeoïsie of berne which however he always affirm keep singularly bad road in vaud while those around its own city be the best in europe and otherwise show himself to be a discreet and observant man in short honest jean descloux be a fair sample of that homebred upright common-sense which seem to form the instinct of the mass and which it be greatly the fashion to deride in those circle in which mystification pass for profound thinking bold assumption for evidence a simper for wit particular personal advantage for liberty and in which it be deem a mortal offence against good manners to hint that adam and eve be the common parent of mankind monsieur have choose a good time to visit vévey observe jean descloux one evening that they be drift in front of the town the whole scenery resemble a fairy picture rather than a portion of this much-abused earth it blow sometimes at this end of the lake in a way to frighten the gull out of it we shall see no more of the steam-boat after the last of the month the american cast a glance at the mountain draw upon he memory for sundry squall and gale which he have see himself and think the boatman 's figure of speech less extravagant than it have at first seem if you lake craft be better construct they would make better weather he quietly observe monsieur descloux have no wish to quarrel with a customer who employ he every evening and who prefer float with the current to be row with a crooked oar he manifest he prudence therefore by make a reserved reply no doubt monsieur he say that the people who live on the sea make better vessel and know how to sail they more skilfully we have a proof of that here at vévey -lrb- he pronounce the word like v - _ vai _ agreeably to the sound of the french vowel -rrb- last summer which you might like to hear a english gentleman -- they say he be a captain in the marine -- have a vessel build at nice and drag over the mountain to we lake he take a run across to meillerie one fine morning and no duck ever skim along lighter or swifter he be not a man to take advice from a swiss boatman for he have cross the line and see water spout and whale well he be on he way back in the dark and it come on to blow here from off the mountain and he stand on boldly towards we shore heave the lead as he draw near the land as if he have be beat into spithead in a fog -- jean chuckle at the idea of sound in the leman -- while he fly along like a bold mariner as no doubt he be land i suppose say the american among the lumber in the great square monsieur be mistaken he break he boat 's nose against that wall and the next day a piece of she big enough to make a thole-pin be not to be find he might as well have sound the heaven the lake have a bottom notwithstanding you pardon monsieur the lake have no bottom the sea may have a bottom but we have no bottom here there be little use in dispute the point monsieur descloux then speak of the revolution he have see he remember the time when vaud be a province of berne he observation on this subject be rational and be well seasoned with wholesome common sense he doctrine be simply this if one man rule he will rule for he own benefit and that of he parasite if a minority rule we have many master instead of one -lrb- honest jean have get hold here of a cant saying of the privileged which he very ingeniously convert against themselves -rrb- all of whom must be feed and serve and if the majority rule and rule wrongfully why the minimum of harm be do he admit that the people might be deceive to they own injury but then he do not think it be quite as likely to happen as that they should be oppress when they be govern without any agency of they own on these point the american and the vaudoi be absolutely of the same mind from politics the transition to poetry be natural for a common ingredient in both would seem to be fiction on the subject of he mountain monsieur descloux be a thorough swiss he expatiate on they grandeur they storm they height and they glacier with eloquence the worthy boatman have some such opinion of the superiority of he own country as all be apt to form who have never see any other he dwell on the glory of a abbaye des vignerons too with the gusto of a vévaisan and seem to think it would be a high stroke of state policy to get up a new _ fête _ of this kind as speedily as possible in short the world and its interest be pretty generally discuss between these two philosopher during a intercourse that extend to a month we american be not a man to let instruction of this nature easily escape he he lay hour at a time on the seat of jean descloux 's boat look up at the mountain or watch some lazy sail on the lake and speculate on the wisdom of which he be so accidentally make the repository he view on one side be limit by the glacier of mont vélan a near neighbor of the celebrated col of st bernard and on the other he eye could range to the smile field that surround geneva within this setting be contain one of the most magnificent picture that nature ever draw and he bethink he of the human action passion and interest of which it might have be the scene by a connexion that be natural enough to the situation he imagine a fragment of life pass between these grand limit and the manner in which man could listen to the never-wearied prompting of they impulse in the immediate presence of the majesty of the creator he bethink he of the analogy that exist between inanimate nature and we own wayward inequality of the fearful admixture of good and evil of which we be compose of the manner in which the best betray they submission to the devil and in which the worst have gleam of that eternal principle of right by which they have be endow by god of those tempest which sometimes lie dormant in we system like the slumbering lake in the calm but which excite equal its fury when lash by the wind of the strength of prejudice of the worthlessness and changeable character of the most cherish of we opinion and of that strange incomprehensible and yet win _ mélange _ of contradiction of fallacy of truth and of wrong which make up the sum of we existence the follow page be the result of this dream the reader be leave to he own intelligence for the moral a respectable english writer

dwell deeper among the mountain and of the two principal product of the dairy the latter be destine to a market in the less verdant country of the south to these must be add the personal effect of a unusual number of passenger which be stow on the top of the heavier part of the cargo with a order and care that they value would scarcely seem to require the arrangement however be necessary to the convenience and even to the security of the bark have be make by the patron with a view to post each individual by he particular wallet in a manner to prevent confusion in the crowd and to leave the crew space and opportunity to discharge the necessary duty of the navigation with a vessel stow sail ready to drop the wind fair and the day draw on apace the patron of the winkelry who be also she owner feel a very natural wish to depart but a unlooked-for obstacle have just present itself at the water-gate where the officer charge with the duty of look into the character of all who go and come be post and around whom some fifty representative of half as many nation be now cluster in a clamorous throng fill the air with a confusion of tongue that have some probable affinity to the noise which derange the workman of babel it appear by part of sentence and broken remonstrance equally address to the patron whose name be baptiste and to the guardian of the genevese law a rumor be rife among these truculent traveller that balthazar the headsman or executioner of the powerful and aristocratical canton of berne be about to be smuggle into they company by the cupidity of the former contrary not only to what be due to the feeling and rights of man of more creditable calling but as it be vehemently and plausibly insist to the very safety of those who be about to trust they fortune to the vicissitude of the element chance and the ingenuity of baptiste have collect on this occasion as party-colored and heterogeneous a assemblage of human passion interest dialect wish and opinion as any admirer of diversity of character could desire there be several small trader some return from adventure in germany and france and some bind southward with they scanty stock of wares a few poor

exclusive leader and lord these with some slight qualification that it be not yet necessary to particularise compose that essential requisite of all fair representation -- the majority those who remain be of a different caste near the noisy crowd of toss head and brandish arm in and around the gate be a party contain the venerable and still fine figure of a man in the travel dress of one of superior condition and who do not need the testimony of the two or three liveried menial that stand near he person to give a assurance of he belong to the more fortunate of he fellow-creature as good and evil be usually estimate in calculate the chance of life on he arm lean a female so young and yet so lovely as to cause regret in all who observe she fading color the sweet but melancholy smile that occasionally light she mild and please feature at some of the more marked exuberance of folly among the crowd and a form which notwithstanding she lessen bloom be nearly perfect if these symptom of delicate health do not prevent this fair girl from be amuse at the volubility and argument of the different orator she oftener manifest apprehension at find herself the companion of creature so untrained so violent so exacting and so grossly ignorant a young man wear the roquelaure and other similar appendage of a swiss in foreign military service a character to excite neither observation nor comment in that age stand at she elbow answer the question that from time to time be address to he by the other in a manner to show he be a intimate acquaintance though there be sign about he travel equipage to prove he be not exactly of they ordinary society of all who be not immediately engage in the boisterous discussion at the gate this young soldier who be commonly address by those near he as monsieur sigismund be much the most interested in its progress though of herculean frame and evidently of unusual physical force he be singularly agitate he cheek which have not yet lose the freshness due to the mountain air would at time become pale as that of the wilting flower near he while at other the blood rush across he brow in a torrent that seem to threaten a rupture of the start vessel in which it so tumultuously flow unless address however he say nothing he distress gradually subside until it be merely betray by the convulsive writhing of he finger which unconsciously grasp the hilt of he sword the uproar have now continue for some time : throat be get sore tongue clammy voice hoarse and word incoherent when a sudden check be give to the useless clamor by a incident quite in unison with the disturbance itself two enormous dog be in attendance hard by apparently await the movement of they respective master who be lose to view in the mass of head and body that stop the passage of the gate one of these animal be cover with a short thick coating of hair whose prevail color be a dingy yellow but whose throat and leg with most of the inferior part of the body be of a dull white nature on the other hand have give a dusky brownish shaggy dress to he rival though he general hue be relieve by a few shades of a more decide black as respects weight and force of body the difference between the brute be not very obvious though perhaps it slightly inclined in favor of the former who in length if not in strength of limb however have more manifestly the advantage it would much exceed the intelligence we have bring to this task to explain how far the instinct of the dog sympathise in the savage passion of the human being around they or whether they be conscious that they master have espouse opposite side in the quarrel and that it become they as faithful esquire to tilt together by way of support the honor of those they follow but after measure each other for the usual period with the eye they come violently together body to body in the manner of they species the collision be fearful and the struggle be between two creature of so great size and strength of the fiercest kind the roar resemble that of lion effectually drown the clamor of human voice every tongue be mute and each head be turn in the direction of the combatant the tremble girl recoil with avert face while the young man step eagerly forward to protect she for the conflict be near the place they occupy but powerful and active as be he frame he hesitate about mingle in a affray so ferocious at this critical moment when it seem that the furious brute be on the point of tear each other in piece the crowd be push violently open and two man burst side by side out of the mass one wear the black robe the conical asiatic-looking tufted cap and the white belt of a augustine monk and the other have the attire of a man addict to the sea without however be so decidedly maritime as to leave he character a matter that be quite beyond dispute the former be fair ruddy with a oval happy face of which internal peace and good-will to he fellow be the principal characteristic while the latter have the swarthy hue bold lineament and glitter eye of a italian uberto say the monk reproachfully affect the sort of offended manner that one would be apt to show to a more intelligent creature willing but at the same time afraid to trust he person nearer to the furious conflict shame on thee old uberto hast forget thy schooling -- hast no respect for thine own good name on the other hand the italian do not stop to expostulate but throw himself with reckless hardihood on the dog by dint of kick and blow of which much the heaviest portion fall on the follower of the augustine he succeed in separate the combatant ha nettuno he exclaim with the severity of one accustomed to exercise a stern and absolute authority so soon as this daring exploit be achieve and he have recover a little of the breath lose in the violent exertion -- what dost mean canst find no better amusement than quarrel with a dog of san bernardo fie upon thee foolish nettuno i be ashamed of thee dog : thou that hast discreetly navigate so many sea to lose thy temper on a bit of fresh water the dog which be in truth no other than a noble animal of the well-known newfoundland breed hang he head and make sign of contrition by draw nearer to he master with a tail that sweep the ground while he late adversary quietly seat himself with a species of monastic dignity look from the speaker to he foe as if endeavor to comprehend the rebuke which he powerful and gallant antagonist take so meekly father say the italian we dog be both too useful in they several way and both of too good character to be enemy i know ubarto of old for the path of st bernard and i be no stranger and if report do the animal no more than justice he have not be a idle cur among the snow he have be the instrument of save seven christian from death answer the monk beginning again to regard he mastiff with friendly look for at first there have be keen reproach and severe displeasure in he manner -- not to speak of the body that have be find by he activity after the vital spark have flee as for the latter father we can count little more in favor of the dog than a good intention value service on this scale i might ere this have be the holy father himself or at least a cardinal but seven life save for they owner to die quietly in they bed and with opportunity to make they peace with heaven be no bad recommendation for a dog nettuno here be every way worthy to be the friend of old uberto for thirteen drown man have i myself see he draw from the greedy jaw of shark and other monster of deep water what dost thou say father shall we make peace between the brute the augustine express he readiness as well as he desire to aid in a effort so laudable and by dint of command and persuasion the dog who be predispose to peace from have have a mutual taste of the bitterness of war and who now feel for each other the respect which courage and force be apt to create be soon on the usual term of animal of they kind that have no particular grounds for contention the guardian of the city improve the calm produce by this little incident to regain a portion of he lose authority beat back the crowd with he cane he clear a space around the gate into which but one of the traveller could enter at a time while he profess himself not only ready but determine to proceed with he duty without further procrastination baptiste the patron who behold the precious moment waste and who in the delay foresee a loss of wind which to one of he pursuit be loss of money now earnestly press the traveller to comply with the necessary form and to take they station in he bark with all convenient speed of what matter be it continue the calculate waterman who be rather conspicuously know for the love of thrift that be usually attribute to most of the inhabitant of that region whether there be one headsman or twenty in the bark so long as the good vessel can float and steer we leman wind be fickle friend and the wise take they while in the humor give I the breeze at west and i will load the winkelry to the water 's edge with executioner or any other pernicious creature thou wilt and thou mayest take the lightest bark that ever swim in the _ bise _ and let we see who will first make the haven of vévey the loudest and in a sense that be very important in all such discussion the principal speaker in the dispute be the leader of the neapolitan _ troupe _ who in virtue of good lung a agility that have no competitor in any present and a certain mixture of superstition and bravado that form nearly equal ingredient in he character be a man likely to gain great influence with those who from they ignorance and habit have a inherent love of the marvellous and a profound respect for all who possess in act more audacity and in believe more credulity than themselves the vulgar like a excess even if it be of folly for in they eye the abundance of any particular quality be very apt to be take as the standard of its excellence this be well for he who receive but it may be death to he that pay cry the son of the south gain not a little among he auditor by the distinction for the argument be sufficiently wily as between the buyer and the seller thou wilt get thy silver for the risk and we may get watery grave for we weakness nought but mishap can come of wicked company and accurse will they be in the evil hour that be find in brotherly communion with one whose trade be hurry christian into eternity before the time that have be lend by nature be fairly up santa madre i would not be the fellow-traveller of such a wretch across this wild and changeable lake for the honor of leap and show my poor power in the presence of the holy father and the whole of the learn conclave this solemn declaration which be make with suitable gesticulation and a action of the countenance that be well adapt to prove the speaker 's sincerity produce a corresponding effect on most of the listener who murmur they applause in a manner sufficiently significant to convince the patron he be not about to dispose of the difficulty simply by virtue of fair word in this dilemma he bethink he of a plan of overcome the scruple of all present in which he be warmly second by the agent of the police and to which after the usual number of cavilling objection that be generate by distrust heated blood and the obstinacy of disputation the other party be finally induce to give they consent it be agree that the examination should no longer be delay but that a species of deputation from the crowd might take they stand within the gate where all who pass would necessarily be subject to they scrutiny and in the event of they vigilance detect the abhorred and proscribed balthazar that the patron should return he money to the headsman and preclude he from form one of a party that be so scrupulous of its association and apparently with so little reason the neapolitan whose name be pippo one of the indigent scholar for a century since learning be rather the auxiliary than the foe of superstition and a certain nicklaus wagner a fat bernese who be the owner of most of the cheese in the bark be the choose of the multitude on this occasion the first owe he election to he vehemence and volubility quality that the ignoble vulgar be very apt to mistake for conviction and knowledge the second to he silence and a demureness of air which pass with another class for the stillness of deep water and the last to he substance as a man of known wealth a advantage which in spite of all that alarmist predict on one side and enthusiast affirm on the other will always carry greater weight with those who be less fortunate in this respect than be either reasonable or morally healthful provide it be not abuse by arrogance or by the assumption of very extravagant and oppressive privilege as a matter of course these depute guardian of the common rights be first oblige to submit they own papers to the eye of the genevese -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : as we have so often allude to this examination it may be well to explain that the present system of gend ` armerie and passport do not then prevail in europe take they rise nearly a century later than that in which the event of this tale have place but geneva be a small and exposed state and the regulation to which there be reference here be one of the provision which be resort to from time to time in order to protect those liberty and that independence of which its citizen be so unceasingly and so wisely jealous -rrb- the neapolitan than whom a archer knave or one that have commit more petty wrong do not present himself that day at the water-gate be regularly fortify by every precaution that the long experience of a vagabond could suggest and he be permit to pass forthwith the poor westphalian student present a instrument fairly write out in scholastic latin and escape further trouble by the vanity of the unlettered agent of the police who hastily affirm it be a pleasure to encounter document so perfectly in form but the bernese be about to take he station by the side of the other two appear to think inquiry in he case unnecessary while move through the passage in stately silence nicklaus wagner be occupy in secure the string of a well fill purse which he have just lighten of a small copper coin to reward the varlet of the hostelry in which he have pass the night and who have be oblige to follow he to the port to obtain even this scanty boon and the genevese be fain to believe that in the urgency of this important concern he have overlook those form which all be just then oblige to respect on quit the town thou hast a name and character observe the latter with official brevity god help thee friend -- i do not think geneva have be so particular with a swiss -- and a swiss who be so favorably know on the aar and indeed over the whole of the great canton i be nicklaus wagner a name of little account perhaps but which be well esteemed among man of substance and which have a right even to the bürgerschaft -- nicklaus wagner of berne -- thou wilt scarce need more naught but proof of its truth thou wilt remember this be geneva the law of a small and exposed state need be particular in affair of this nature i never question thy state be geneva i only wonder thou shouldst doubt my be nicklaus wagner i can journey the darkest night that ever throw a shadow from the mountain any where between the jura and the oberland and none shall say my word be to be dispute look ` ee there be the patron baptiste who will tell thee that if he be to land the freight which be ship in my name he bark would float greatly the lighter all this time nicklaus be nothing loth to show he papers which be quite in rule he even hold they with a thumb and finger separate the fold ready to be present to he questioner the hesitation come from a feeling of wounded vanity which would gladly show that one of he local importance and known substance be to be exempt from the exaction require from man of smaller mean the officer who have great practice in this species of collision with he fellow-creature understand the character with which he have to deal and see no good reason for refuse to gratify a feeling which be innocent though sufficiently silly he yield to the bernese pride thou canst proceed he say turn the indulgence to account with a ready knowledge of he duty and when thou gettest again among thy burgher do we of geneva the grace to say ^ we treat we ally fairly i think thy question hasty exclaim the wealthy peasant swell like one who get justice though tardily now let we to this knotty affair of the headsman take he place with the neapolitan and the westphalian nicklaus assume the grave air of a judge and a austerity of manner which prove that he enter on he duty with a firm resolution to do justice thou ` art well know here pilgrim observe the officer with some severity of tone to the next that come to the gate st franci to speed master it be else wonderful i should be so for the season scarce come and go more regularly there must be a sore conscience somewhere that rome and thou should need each other so often the pilgrim who be envelop in a tattered coat sprinkle with cockle-shell who wear he beard and be

thou would ` st not have say this my own failing give I little trouble i be engage by certain parish of germany to take upon my poor person they physical pain and it be not easy to name another that have do as many message of this kind as myself with better proof of fidelity if thou hast any little offering to make thou shalt see fair papers to prove what i say -- papers that would pass at st peter 's itself the officer perceive that he have to do with one of those unequivocal hypocrite -- if such a word can properly be apply to he who scarcely think deception necessary -- who then make a traffic of expiation of this nature a pursuit that be common enough at the close of the seventeenth and in the commencement of the eighteenth century and which have not even yet entirely disappear from europe he throw the pass with unconcealed aversion towards the profligate who recover he document assume unasked he station by the side of the three who have be select to decide on the fitness of those who be to be allow to embark go to cry the officer as he permit this ebullition of disgust to escape he thou hast well say that we be follower of calvin geneva have little in common with she of the scarlet mantle and thou wilt do well to remember this in thy next pilgrimage lest the beadle make acquaintance with thy back -- hold who art thou a heretic hopelessly damned by anticipation if that of yonder travel prayer-monger be the true faith answer one who be press past with a quiet assurance that have near carry its point without incur the risk of the usual investigation into he name and character it be the owner of nettuno whose aquatic air and perfect self-possession now cause the officer to doubt whether he have not stop a waterman of the lake -- a class privileged to come and go at will thou knowest we usage say the half-satisfied genevese i be a fool else even the ass that often travel the same path come in time to tell its turn and winding art not satisfy with touch the

go-between of heaven and earth thou knowest but creature that come part of the water and part of the land the italian speak loud and confidently and to the manner of one who address himself more to the humor of those near than to the understanding of the genevese he laugh and look about he in a manner to extract a echo from the crowd though not one among they all could probably have give a sufficient reason why he have so readily take part with the stranger against the authority of the town unless it might have be from the instinct of opposition to the law thou hast a name continue the

signification of what the italian say laugh aloud and apparently with great glee for to the grossly vulgar extreme audacity have a irresistible charm the officer feel that the merriment be against he though he scarce know why and ignorant of the language in which the other have give he extraordinary appellation he yield to the contagion and laugh with the other like one who understand the joke to the bottom the italian profit by this advantage nod familiarly with a good-natured and know smile and proceed whistle the dog to he side he walk leisurely to the bark into which he be the first that

a fearful mystery and this thou seest be the sole hope of my line -- the only heir that be leave to the name and land of willading art thou at ease in thy condition there be those in we town who be less so with many thanks for the friendliness of the question a slight color suffuse the face of adelheid de willade for so be the daughter of the bernese call and she advance a step nearer to the officer they who have so few at they own board need think of those who have so many she say drop a piece of gold into the hand of the genevese : then she add in a voice scarce louder than a whisper -- if the young and innocent of thy household can offer a prayer in the behalf of a poor girl who have much need of aid ` twill be remember of god and it may serve to lighten the grief of one who have the dread of be childless god bless thee lady say the officer little use to deal with such spirit and touch by the mild resignation and piety of the speaker whose simple but winning manner move he nearly to tear all of my family old as well as young shall bethink they of thee and thine adelheid 's cheek resume its paleness and she quietly accompany she father as he slowly proceed towards the bark a scene of this nature do not fail to shake the pertinacity of those who stand at watch near the gate of course they have nothing to say to any of the rank of melchior de willading who go into the bark without a question the influence of beauty and station unite to so much simple grace as that show by the fair actor in the little incident we have just relate be much too strong for the ill-trained feeling of the neapolitan and he companion they not only let all the menial pass unquestioned also but it be some little time before they vigilance resume its former truculence the two or three traveller that succeed have the benefit of this fortunate change of disposition the next who come to the gate be the young soldier whom the baron de willading have so often address as monsieur sigismund he papers be regular and no obstacle be offer to he departure it may be doubt how far this young man would have be dispose to submit to these extra-official inquiry of the three deputy of the crowd have there be a desire to urge they for he go towards the quay with a eye that express any other sensation than that of amity or compliance respect or a more equivocal feeling prove he protection for none but the pilgrim who display ultra-zeal in the pursuit of he object venture so far as to hazard even a smother remark as he pass there go a arm and a sword that might well shorten a christian 's day say the dissolute and shameless dealer in the church 's abuse and yet no one ask he name or call thou hadst better put the question thyself return the sneering pippo since penitence be thy trade for myself i be content with whirling round at my own bidding without take a hint from that young giant 's arm the poor scholar and the burgher of berne appear to acquiesce in this opinion and no more say in the matter in the mean while there be another at the gate the new applicant have little in he exterior to renew the vigilance of the superstitious trio a quiet meek-looking man seemingly of a middle condition in life and of a air altogether calm and unpretending have submit he passport to the faithful guardian of the city the latter read the document cast a quick and inquire glance at its owner and return the paper in a way to show haste and a desire to be rid of he it be well he say thou canst go thy way how now cry the neapolitan to whom buffoonery be a congenial employment as much by natural disposition as by practice how now -- have we balthazar at last in this bloody-minded and fierce-looking traveller as the speaker have expect this sally be reward by a general laugh and he be accordingly encourage to proceed thou knowest we office friend add the unfeeling mountebank and must show we thy hand none pass who bear the stain of blood the traveller appear stagger for he be plainly a man of retire and peaceable habit who have be throw by the chance of the road in contact with one only too practice in this unfeeling species of wit he show he open palm however with a direct and confide simplicity that draw a shout of merriment from all the by-stander this will not do soap and ash and the tear of victim may have wash out the mark of he work from balthazar himself the spot we seek be on the soul man and we must look into that ere thou art permit to make one in this goodly company thou didst not question yonder young soldier thus return the stranger whose eye kindle as even the meek repel unprovoked outrage though he frame tremble violently at be subject to open insult from man so rude and unprincipled thou didst not dare to question yonder young soldier thus by the prayer of san gennaro which be know to stop run and melt lava i would rather thou should ` st undertake that office than i yonder young soldier be a honorable decapitator and it be a pleasure to be he companion on a journey for no doubt some six or eight of the saint be speak in he behalf daily but he we seek be the outcast of all good or bad whether in heaven or on earth or in that other hot abode to which he will surely be send when he time shall come and yet he do no more than execute the law what be law to opinion friend but go thy way none suspect thee to be the redoubtable enemy of we head go thy way for heaven 's sake and mutter thy prayer to be deliver from balthazar 's axe the countenance of the stranger work as if he would have answer then suddenly change he purpose he pass on and instantly disappear in the bark the monk of st bernard come next both the augustine and he dog be old acquaintance of the officer who do not require any evidence of he character or errand from the former we be the protector of life and not its foe observe the monk as leave the more regular watchman of the place he draw near to those whose claim to the office would have admit of dispute : we live among the snow that christian may not die without the church 's comfort honor holy augustine to thee and thy office say the neapolitan who reckless and abandon as he be possess that instinct of respect for those who deny they nature for the good of other which be common to all however taint by cupidity themselves thou and thy dog old uberto can freely pass with we best good wish for both there no longer remain any to examine and after a short consultation among the more superstitious of the traveller they come to the very natural opinion that intimidate by they just remonstrance the offensive headsman have shrink unperceived from the crowd and that they be at length happily relieve from he presence the annunciation of the welcome tiding draw much self-felicitation from the different member of the motley company and all eagerly embark for baptiste now loudly and vehemently declare that a single moment of further delay

accompany by a menial and follow by a porter stagger under the burthen of they luggage be fast approach the water-gate as if conscious the least delay might cause they be leave this party be lead by one considerably past the meridian of life and who evidently be enable to maintain he post more by the deference of he companion than by he physical force a cloak be throw across one arm while in the hand of the other he carry the rapier which all of gentle blood then consider a necessary appendage of they rank you be near lose the last bark that sail for the abbaye des vignerons signor say the genevese recognize the country of the stranger at a glance if as i judge from you direction and haste these festivity be in you mind such be we aim return the elder of the traveller and as thou sayest we be of a certainty tardy a hasty departure and bad road have be the cause -- but as happily we be yet in time to profit by this bark wilt do we the favor to look into we authority to pass the officer peruse the offer document with the customary care turn it from side to side as if all be not right though in a way to show that he regret the informality signora you pass be quite in rule as touch savoy and the country of nice but it want the city 's form by san francesco more 's the pity we be honest gentleman of genoa hurry to witness the revel at vévey of which rumor give a entice report and we sole desire be to come and go peaceably as thou seest we be late for hear at the post on alight that a bark be about to spread its sail for the other extremity of the lake we have no time to consult all the observance that thy city 's rule may deem necessary so many turn they face the same way to witness these ancient game that we have not think out quick passage through the town of sufficient importance to give thy authority the trouble to look into we proof therein signore you have judge amiss it be my swear duty to stay all who want the republic 's permission to proceed this be unfortunate to say no more art thou the patron of the bark friend and she owner signora answer baptiste who listen to the discourse with longing equal to he doubt i should be a great deal too happy to count such honorable traveller among my passenger thou wilt then delay thy departure until this gentleman shall see the authority of the town and obtain the require permission to quit it thy compliance shall not go unrewarded as the genoese conclude he drop into a palm that be well practice in bribe a sequin of the celebrated republic of which he be a citizen baptiste have long cultivate a aptitude to suffer himself to be influence by gold and it be with unfeigned reluctance that he admit the necessity of refuse in this instance to profit by he own good disposition still retain the money however for he do not well know how to overcome he reluctance to part with it he answer in a manner sufficiently embarrassed to show the other that he have at least gain a material advantage by he liberality he excellency know not what he ask say the patron fumble the coin between a finger and thumb we genevese citizen love to keep house till the sun be up lest they should break they neck by walk about the uneven street in the dark and it will be two long hour before a single bureau will open its window in the town besides you man of the police be not like we of the lake happy to get a morsel when the weather and occasion permit but he be a regular feeder that must have he grape and he wine before he will use he wit for the benefit of he employer the winkelried would weary of do nothing with this fresh western breeze hum between she mast while the poor gentleman be swearing before the town-house gate at the laziness of the officer i know the rogue better than you excellency and would advise some other expedient baptiste look with a certain expression at the guardian of the water-gate and in a manner to make he meaning sufficiently clear to the traveller the latter study the countenance of the genevese a moment and better practice than the patron or a more enlighten judge of character he fortunately refuse to commit himself by offer to purchase the officer 's good-will if there be too many who love to be tempt to forget they trust by a well-managed venality there be a few who find a greater satisfaction in be think beyond its influence the watchman of the gate happen to be one of the latter class and by one of the many unaccountable workings of human feeling the very vanity which have induce he to suffer il maledetto to go through unquestioned rather than expose he own ignorance now lead he to wish he might make some return for the stranger 's good opinion of he honesty will you let I look again at the pass signora ask the genevese as if he think a sufficient legal warranty for that which he now strongly desire to do might yet be find in the instrument itself the inquiry be useless unless it be to show that the elder genoese be call the signer grimaldus and that he companion go by the name of marcellus shake he head he return the paper in the manner of a disappointed man thou canst not have read half of what the paper contain say baptiste peevishly you reading and write be not such easy matter that a squint of the eye be all-sufficient look at it again and thou mayest yet find all in rule it be unreasonable to suppose signor of they rank would journey like vagabond with papers to be suspect nothing be want but we city signature without which my duty will let none go by that be truly traveller this come signora of the accursed art of write which be much push and greatly abused of late i have hear the aged waterman of the leman praise the good old time when box and bale go and come and no ink touch paper between he that send and he that carry and yet it have now reach the pass that a christian may not transport himself on he own leg without call on the scrivener for permission we lose the moment in word when it be far better to be do return the signora grimaldi the pass be luckily in the language of the country and need but a glance to get the approval of the authority thou wilt do well to say thou canst remain the time necessary to see this little do be you excellency to offer I the doge 's crown as a bribe this could not be we leman wind will not wait for king or noble bishop or priest and duty to those i have in the bark command I to quit the port as soon as possible thou art truly well charge with live freight already say the genoese regard the deeply loaded bark with a half-distrustful eye ' i hope thou hast not overdo thy vessel 's power in receive so many i could gladly reduce the number a little excellent signora for all that you see pile among the box and tub be no better than so many knave fit only to give trouble and raise question touch the embarkation of those who be willing to pay better than themselves the noble swiss whom you see seat near the stern with he daughter and people the worthy melchior de willade give a more liberal reward for he passage to vévey than all those nameless rogue together the genoese make a hasty movement towards the patron with a earnestness of eye and air that betray a sudden and singular interest in what he hear do ` st thou say de willade he exclaim eager as one of much fewer year would have be at the unexpected announcement of some pleasurable event melchior too of that honorable name signore the same none other bear the title now for the old line they say be draw to a end i remember this same baron when he be as ready to launch he boat into a troubled lake as any in switzerland -- fortune have truly favor I good marcellus interrupt the other grasp the hand of he companion with strong feeling go thou to the bark master patron and advise thy passenger that -- what shall we say to melchior shall we tell he at once who wait he here or shall we practice a little on he fail memory by san francesco we will do this enrico that we may try he power ` twill be pleasant to see he wonder and guess -- my life on it however that he know I at a glance i be truly little change for one that have see so much the signor marcellus lower he eye respectfully at this opinion of he friend but he do not see fit to discourage a belief which be merely a sudden ebullition produce by the recollection of younger day baptiste be instantly dispatch with a request that the baron would do a stranger of rank the favor to come to the water-gate tell he ` tis a traveller disappoint in the wish to be of he company repeat the genoese that will suffice i know he courteous and he be not my melchior honest marcellus if he delay a instant : -- thou seest he be already quit the bark for never do i know he refuse a act of friendliness -- dear dear melchior -- thou art the same at seventy as thou wast at thirty here the agitation of the genoese get the better of he and he walk aside under a sense of shame lest he might betray unmanly weakness in the mean time the baron de willade advance from the water-side without suspect that he presence be require for more than a act of simple courtesy baptiste tell I that gentleman of genoa be here who be desirous of hasten to the game of vévey say the latter raise he beaver and that my presence may be of use in obtain the pleasure of they company i will not unmask till we be fairly and decently embark

the manner of a stranger though he voice tremble with eagerness at each syllable we be indeed of genoa and most anxious to be of the party in you bark -- but -- he little suspect who speak to he marcellus -- but signora there have be some small oversight touch the city signature and we have need of friendly assistance either to pass the gate or to detain the bark until the form of the place shall have be respect ' signore the city of geneva have need to be watchful for it be a expose and weak state and i have little hope that my influence can cause this trusty watchman to dispense with he duty touch the bark a small gratuity will do much with honest baptiste should there not be a question of the stability of the breeze in which case he might be somewhat of a loser you say the truth noble melchior put in the patron be the wind ahead or be it two hour earlier in the morning the little delay should not cost the stranger a batz -- that be to say nothing unreasonable but as it be i have not twenty minute more to lose evep be all the city magistrate cloak to be of the party in they proper and worshipful person i greatly regret sigriore it should be so resume the baron turn to the applicant with the consideration of one accustomed to season he refusal by a gracious manner but these waterman have they secret sign by which it would seem they know the latest moment they may with prudence delay by the mass marcellus i will try he a little -- should have know he in a carnival dress signor barone we be but poor italian gentleman it be true of genoa you have hear of we republic beyond question -- the poor state of genoa though of no great pretension to letter signora answer melchior smile i be not quite ignorant that such a state exist you could not have name a city on the shore of you mediterranean that would sooner warm my heart than this very town of which you speak many of my happiest hour be pass within its wall and often even at this late day do i live over again my life to recall the pleasure of that merry period be there leisure i could repeat a list of honorable and much esteemed name that be familiar to you ear in proof of what i say name they signor barone -- for the love of the saint and the bless virgin name they i beseech you a little amaze at the eagerness of the other melchior de willade earnestly regard he furrowed face and for a instant a expression like incertitude cross he own feature nothing would be easier signora than to name many the first in my memory as he have always be the first in my love be gaetano grimaldus of whom i doubt not both of you have often hear we have we have that be -- yes i think we may say marcellus that we have often hear of he and not unfavorably well what of this grimaldus signora the desire to converse of you noble townsman be natural but be i to yield to my wish to speak of gaetano i fear the honest baptiste might have reason to complain to the devil with baptiste and he bark melchior -- my good melchior -- dearest dearest melchior hast thou indeed forget I here the genoese open wide he arm and stand ready to receive the embrace of he friend the baron de willade be trouble but he be still so far from suspect the real fact that he could not have easily tell the reason why he gaze wistfully at the work feature of the fine old man who stand before he and though memory seem to flit around the truth it be in gleam so transient as completely to baffle he wish dost thou deny I de willade -- dost thou refuse to own the friend of thy youth -- the companion of thy pleasure -- the sharer of thy sorrow -- thy comrade in the war -- nay more -- thy confidant in a dearer tie none but gaetano grimaldus himself can claim these title burst from the lip of the tremble baron be i aught else -- be i not this gaetano -- that gaetano -- thy gaetano -- old and very dear friend thou gaetano exclaim the bernoi recoil a step instead of advance to meet the eager embrace of the genoese whose impetuous feeling be little cool by time -- thou the gallant active daring bloom grimaldus signore you trifle with a old man 's affection by the holy mass i do not deceive thee ha marcelli he be slow to believe as ever but fast and certain as the vow of a churchman when convince if we be to distrust each other for a few wrinkle thou wilt find objection rise against thine own identity as well as against mine friend melchior i be none other than gaetano -- the gaetano of thy youth -- the friend thou hast not see these many long and weary year recognition be slow in make its way in the mind of the bernese lineament after lineament however become successively know to he and most of all the voice serve to awaken long dormant recollection but as heavy nature be say to have the least self-command when fairly excite so do the baron betray the most ungovernable emotion of the two when conviction come at last to confirm the word of he friend he throw himself on the neck of the genoese and the old man weep in a manner that cause he to withdraw aside in order to conceal the tear which have so suddenly and profusely break from fountain that he have long think nearly dry chapter iii ha cousin silence that thou hadst see that that this knight and i have see _ king henry iv _ the calculate patron of the winkelry have patiently watch the progress of the foregoing scene with great inward satisfaction but now that the stranger seem to be assure of support powerful as that of melchior de willading he be dispose to turn it to account without farther delay the old man be still stand with they hand grasp each other after another warm and still closer embrace and with tear roll down the furrowed face of each when baptiste advance to put in he raven-like remonstrance noble gentleman he say if the felicitation of one humble as i can add to the pleasure of this happy meeting i beg you to accept they but the wind have no heart for friendship nor any thought for the gain or loss of we waterman i feel it my duty as patron of the bark to recall to you honor that many poor traveller far from they home and pine family be wait we leisure not to speak of foot-sore pilgrim and other worthy adventurer who be impatient in they heart though respect for they superior keep they tongue-tied while we be lose the best of the breeze by san francesco the varlet be right say the genoese hurriedly erase the mark of he recent weakness from he cheek we be forgetful of all these worthy people while joy at we meeting be so strong and it be time that we think of other canst thou aid I in dispense with the city 's signature the baron de willade pause for well-disposed at first to assist any gentleman who find themselves in a unpleasant embarrassment it will be readily imagine that the case lose none of its interest when he find that he oldest and most try friend be the party in want of he influence still it be much easier to admit the force of this new and unexpected appeal than to devise the means of success the officer be to use a phrase which most man seem to think supplies a substitute for reason and principle too openly commit to render it probable he would easily yield it be necessary however to make the trial and the baron therefore address the keeper of the water-gate more urgently than he have yet do in behalf of the stranger it be beyond my function there be not one of we syndic whom i would more gladly oblige than yourself noble baron answer the officer but the duty of the watchman be to adhere strictly to the command of those who have place he at he post gaetano we be not the man to complain of this we have stand together too long in the same trench and have too often sleep soundly in situation where failure in this doctrine might have cost we we life to quarrel with the honest genevese for he watchfulness to be frank ` twere little use to tamper with the fidelity of a swiss or with that of he ally with the swiss that be well pay to be vigilant answer the genoese laughing in a way to show that he have only revive one of those stand but bite jest that they who love each other best be perhaps most accustomed to practice the baron de willading take the facetiousness of he friend in good part return the mirth of the other in a manner to show that the allusion recall day when they hour have idly pass in the indulgence of spontaneous outbreaking of animal spirit be this thy italy gaetano a sequin would not only supply the place of a dozen signature but by the name of thy favorite san francesco it would give the honest gate-keeper that gift of second-sight on which the scottish seer be say to pride themselves well the two side of the alp will keep they character even though we quarrel about they virtue -- but we shall never see again the day that we have know neither the game of vévey nor the use of old joke will make we the youth we have be dear de willade signora a million of pardon interrupted baptiste but this western wind be more inconstant even than the spirit of the young the rogue be again right and we forget yonder cargo of honest traveller who be wish we both in abraham 's bosom for keep the impatient bark in idleness at the quay good marcellus hast thou aught to suggest in this strait signora you forget that we have another document that may be find sufficient -- the person question who appear to fill a middle station between that of a servant and that of a companion rather hint than observe : thou sayest true -- and yet i would gladly avoid produce it -- but anything be better than the loss of thy company melchior name it not we shall not separate though the winkelried rot where she lie ` twere easier to separate we faithful canton than two such friend nay noble baron you forget the wearied pilgrim and the many anxious traveller in the bark if twenty crown will purchase thy consent honest baptiste we will have no further discussion it be scarce in human will to withstand you noble sir -- well the pilgrim have weary foot and rest will only fit they the better for the passage of the mountain and as for the other why let they quit the bark if they dislike the condition i be not a man to force my commerce on any nay nay i will have none of this keep thy gold melchior and let the honest baptiste keep he passenger to say nothing of he conscience i beseech you excellency interrupted baptiste not to distress yourself in tenderness for I i be ready to do far more disagreeable thing to oblige so noble a gentleman i will none of it signor officer wilt thou do I the favor to cast a glance at this as the genoese conclude he place in the hand of the watchman at the gate a paper different from that which he have first show the officer peruse the new instrument with deep attention and when half through its contents he eye leave the page to become rivetted in respectful attention on the face of the expectant italian he then read the passport to the end raise he cap ceremoniously the keeper of the gate leave the passage free bow with deep deference to the stranger have i sooner know this he say there would have be no delay i hope you excellency will consider my ignorance -- name it not friend thou hast do well in proof of which i beg thy acceptance of a small token of esteem the genoese drop a sequin into the hand of the officer pass he at the same time on he way to the waterside as the reluctance of the other to receive gold come rather from a love of duty than from any particular aversion to the metal itself this second offering meet with a more favorable reception than the first the baron de willade be not without surprise at the sudden success of he friend though he be far too prudent and well-bred to let he wonder be see every obstacle to the departure of the winkelried be now remove and baptiste and he crew be soon actively engage in loosen the sail and in cast off the fast the movement of the bark be at first slow and heavy for the wind be intercept by the building of the town but as she recede from the shore the canvass begin to flap and belly and ere long it fill outward with a report like that of a musket after which the motion of the traveller begin to bear some relation to they nearly exhaust patience soon after the party which have be so long detain at the water-gate be embark adelheid first learn the reason of the delay she have long know from the mouth of she father the name and early history of the signor grimaldus a genoese of illustrious family who have be the swear friend and the comrade of melchior de willading when the latter pursued he career in arm in the war of italy these circumstance have pass long before she own birth and even before the marriage of she parent and she be the youngest and the only survivor of a numerous family of child they be as respect herself event that already begin to assume the hue of history she receive the old man frankly and even with affection though in he yielding but still fine form she have quite as much difficulty as she father in recognize the young gay gallant brilliant and handsome gaetano grimaldus that she imagination have conceive from the verbal description she have so often hear and from she fancy be still wont to draw as he be paint in the affectionate description of she father when he suddenly and affectionately offer a kiss the color flush she face for no man but he to whom she owe she being have ever before take that liberty but after a instant of virgin embarrassment she laugh and blushingly present she cheek to receive the salute the last tiding i have of thee melchior say the italian be the letter send by the swiss ambassador who take we city in he way as he travel south and which be write on the occasion of the birth of this very girl not of this dear friend but of a elder sister who be long since a cherub in heaven thou seest the ninth precious gift that god bestow and thou seest all that be now leave of he bounty the countenance of the signor grimaldus lose its joyousness and a deep pause in the discourse succeed they live in a age when communication between friend that be separate by distance and by the frontier of different state be rare and uncertain the fresh and novel affection of marriage have first break a intercourse that be continue under such disadvantage as marked the period long after they duty call they different way and time with its change and the embarrassment of war have finally destroy nearly every link in the chain of they correspondence each have therefore much of a near and interesting character to communicate to the other and each dread to speak lest he might cause some wound that be not perfectly heal to bleed anew the volume of matter convey in the few word utter by the baron de willading show both in how many way they might inflict pain without intention and how necessary it be to be guard in they discourse during the first day of they renew intercourse this girl at least be a treasure of itself of which i must envy thee the possession the signor grimaldus at length rejoin the swiss make one of those quick movement which betray surprise and it be very apparent that just at the moment he be more affect by some interest of he friend than by the apprehension which usually beset he when any very direct allusion be make to he survive child gaetano thou hast a son he be lose -- hopelessly -- irretrievably lose -- at least to I these be brief but painful glimpse into each other 's concern and another melancholy and embarrassed pause follow as the baron de willade witness the sorrow that deeply shadow the face of the genoese he almost feel that providence in summon he own boy to early grave might have spare he the still bitterer grief of mourning over the unworthiness of a living son these be god 's decree melchior the italian continue of he own accord and we as soldier as man and more than either as christian should know how to submit the letter of which i speak contain the last direct tiding that i receive of thy welfare though different traveller have mention thee as among the honor and trust of thy country without descend to the particulars of thy private life the retirement of we mountain and the little intercourse of stranger with the swiss have deny I even this meager satisfaction as respects thee and thy fortune since the especial courier send accord to we ancient agreement to announce -- the baron hesitate for he feel he be again touch on forbid ground to announce the birth of my unhappy boy continue the signor grimaldus firmly to announce that much-wished-for event i have not have news of thee except in a way so vague as to whet the desire to know more rather than to appease the longing of love these doubt be the penalty that friendship pay to separation we enlist the affection in youth with the recklessness of hope and when call different way by duty or interest we first begin to perceive that the world be not the heaven we think it but that each enjoyment have its price as each grief have its solace thou hast carry arm since we be soldier in company as a swiss only the answer draw a gleam of habitual humor from the keen eye of the italian whose countenance be apt to change as rapidly as he thought in what service nay a truce to thy old pleasantry good grimaldus -- and yet i should scarce love thee as i do wert thou other than thou art i believe we come at last to prize even the foible of those we truly esteem it must be so young lady or boyish folly would long since have wean thy father from I i have never spare he on the subject of snow and money and yet he beareth with I marvellously well strong love endureth much have the baron often speak to thee of old grimaldus -- young grimaldus i should say -- and of the many freak of we thoughtless day so much signora return adelheid who have weep and smile by turn during the interrupted dialogue of she father and he friend that i can repeat most of you youthful history the castle of willading be deep among the mountain and it be rare indeed for the foot of stranger to enter its gate during the long evening of we severe winter i have listen as a daughter would be apt to listen to the recital of most of you common adventure and in listen i have not only learn to know but to esteem one that be justly so dear to my parent i make no doubt now thou hast the history of the plunge into the canal by over-stooping to see the venetian beauty at thy finger 's end i do remember some such act of humid gallantry return adelheid laughing do thy father tell thee child of the manner in which he bear I off in a noble rescue from a deadly charge of the imperial cavalry i have hear some light allusion to such a event too return adelheid evidently try to recall the history of the affair to she mind but -- light do he call it and of small account i wish never to see another as heavy this be the impartiality of thy narrative good melchior in which a life preserve wound receive and a charge to make the german quail be set down as matter to be touch with a light hand if i do thee this service it be more than deserve by the manner in which before milan -- well let it all pass together we be old fool young lady and should we get garrulous in each other 's praise thou mightest mistake we for braggart a character that in truth neither wholly merit didst thou ever tell the girl melchior of we mad excursion into the forest of the apennine in search of a spanish lady that have fall into the hand of bandit and how we pass week on a foolish enterprise of errantry that have become useless by the timely application of a few sequin on the part of the husband even before we start on the chivalrous not to say silly excursion say chivalrous but not silly answer adelheid with the simplicity of a young and sincere mind of this adventure i have hear but to I it have never seem ridiculous a generous motive might well excuse a undertaking of less favorable auspices ` tis fortunate return the signor grimaldus thoughtfully that if youth and exaggerated opinion lead we to commit mad prank under the name of spirit and generosity there be other youthful and generous mind to reflect we sentiment and to smile upon we folly this be more like the wary grey-headed ex-pounder of wisdom than like the hot-headed gaetano grimaldus of old exclaim the baron though he laugh while utter the word as if he feel at least a portion of the other 's indifference to those exaggerated feeling that have enter much into the character of both in youth the time have be when the word policy and calculation would have cost a companion thy favor ` tis say that the prodigal of twenty make the miser of seventy it be certain that even we southern sun do not warm the blood of threescore as suddenly as it heat that of one but we will not darken thy daughter 's view of the future by a picture too faithfully draw lest she become wise before she time i have often question melchior which be the most precious gift of nature a worm fancy or the colder power of reason but if i must say which i most love the point become less difficult of decision i would prefer each in its season or rather the two unite with a gradual change in they influence let the youth commence with the first in the ascendant and close with the last he who begin life too cold a reasoner may end it a calculate egotist and he who be rule solely by he imagination be in danger of have he mind so ripened as to bring forth the fruit of a visionary have it pleased heaven to have leave I the dear son i possess for so short a period i would rather have see he lean to the side of exaggeration in he estimate of man before experience come to chill he hope than to see he scan he fellow with a too philosophical eye in boyhood ` tis say we be but clay at the best but the ground before it have be well till send forth the plant that be most congenial to its soil and though it be of no great value give I the spontaneous and generous growth of the weed which prove the depth of the loam rather than a stinted imitation of that which cultivation may no doubt render more useful if not more grateful the allusion to he lost son cause another cloud to pass athwart the brow of the genoese thou seest adelheid he continue after a pause -- for adelheid will i call thee in virtue of a second father 's rights -- that we be make we folly respectable at least to ourselves -- master patron thou hast a well-charged bark thanks to you two honor answer baptiste who stand at the helm near the group of principal passenger these windfall come rarely to the poor and we must make much of such as offer the game at vévey have call every craft on the leman to the upper end of the lake and a little mother-wit lead I to trust to the last turn of the wheel which as you see signora have not come up a blank have many stranger pass by you city on they way to these sport many hundred noble gentleman and report speak of thousand that be collect at vévey and in the neighbor village the country of vaud have not have a richer harvest from she game this many a year it be fortunate melchior that the desire to witness these revel should have arise in we at the same moment the hope of at last obtain certain tiding of thy welfare be the chief inducement that cause I to steal from genoa whither i be compel to return forthwith there be truly something providential in this meeting i so esteem it return the baron de willade though the hope of soon embrace thee be strongly alive in I thou art mistake in fancy that curiosity or a wish to mingle with the multitude at vévey have draw I from my castle italy be in my eye as it have long be in my heart how -- italy nothing less this fragile plant of the mountain have droop of late in she native air and skilful adviser have counsel the sunny side of the alp as a shelter to revive she animation i have promise roger de blonay to pass a night or two within he ancient wall and then we be destine to seek the hospitality of the monk of st bernard like thee i have hope this unusual sortie from my hold might lead to intelligence touch the fortune of one i have never cease to love the signor grimaldus turn a more scrutinize take towards the face of they female companion she gentle and winning beauty give he pleasure but with he attention quicken by what have just fall from she father he trace in silent pain the sign of that early fading which threaten to include this last hope of he friend in the common fate of the family disease have not however set its seal on the sweet face of adelheid in a manner to attract the notice of a common observer the lessen of the bloom the mournful character of a dove-like eye and a look of thoughtfulness on a brow that he have ever know devoid of care and open as day with youthful ingenuousness be the symptom that first give the alarm to she father whose previous loss and whose solitariness as respects the tie of the world have render he keenly alive to impression of such a nature the reflection excite by this examination bring painful recollection to all and it be long before the discourse be renew in the mean time the winkelried be not idle as the vessel recede from the cover of the building and the hill the force of the breeze be feel and she speed become quicken in proportion though the waterman of she crew often study the manner in which she drag she way through the element with a shake of the head that be intend to express they consciousness that too much have be require of the craft the cupidity of baptiste have indeed charge he good bark to the uttermost the water be nearly on a line with the low stern and when the bark have reach a part of the lake where the wave be roll with some force it be find that the vast weight be too much to be lift by the feeble and broken effort of these miniature sea the consequence be however more vexatious than alarming a few wet foot among the less quiet of the passenger with a occasional slapping of a sheet of water against the gangway and a consequent drift of spray across the pile of human head in the center of the bark be all the immediate personal inconveniency still unjustifiable greediness of gain have tempt the patron to commit the unseaman-like fault of overload he vessel the decrease of speed be another and a graver consequence of he cupidity since it might prevent they arrival in port before the breeze have expend itself the lake of geneva lie nearly in the form of a crescent stretch from the south-west towards the north-east its northern or the swiss shore be chiefly what be call in the language of the country a _ côte _ or a declivity that admit of cultivation and with few exception it have be since the earliest period of history plant with the generous vine here the roman have many station and post vestige of which be still visible the confusion and the mixture of interest that succeed the fall of the empire give rise in the middle age to various baronial castle ecclesiastical town and tower of defense which still stand on the margin of this beautiful sheet of water or ornament the eminence a little inland at the time of which we write the whole coast of the leman if so impose a word may be apply to the shore of so small a body of water be in the possession of the three several state of geneva savoy and berne the first consist of a mere fragment of territory at the western or lower horn of the crescent the second occupied nearly the whole of the southern side of the sheet or the cavity of the half-moon while the latter be mistress of the whole of the convex border and of the eastern horn the shore of savoy be compose with immaterial exception of advanced spur of the high alp among which tower mont blanc like a sovereign seat in majesty in the midst of a brilliant court the rock frequently rise from the water 's edge in perpendicular mass none of the lake of this remarkable region possess a greater variety of scenery than that of geneva which change from the smile aspect of fertility and cultivation at its lower extremity to the sublimity of a savage and sublime nature at its upper vévey the haven for which the winkelried be bind lie at the distance of three league from the head of the lake or the point where it receive the rhone and geneva the port from which the reader have just see she take she departure be divide by that river as it glance out of the blue basin of the leman again to traverse the fertile field of france on its hurry course towards the distant mediterranean it be well know that the current of air on all body of water that lie amid high and broken mountain be uncertain both as to they direction and they force this be the difficulty which have most disturbed baptiste during the delay of the bark for the experienced waterman well know it require the first and the freest effort of the wind to drive the breeze home as it be call by seaman against the oppose current that frequently descend from the mountain which surround he port in addition to this difficulty the shape of the lake be another reason why the wind rarely blow in the same direction over the whole of its surface at the same time strong and continue gale commonly force themselves down into the deep basin and push they way against all resistance into every crevice of the rock but a power less than this rarely succeed in favor the bark with the same breeze from the entrance to the outlet of the rhone as a consequence of these peculiarity the passenger of the winkelry have early evidence that they have trifle too long with the fickle air the breeze carry they up abreast of lausanne in good season but here the influence of the mountain begin to impair its force and by the time the sun have a little fallen towards the long dark even line of the jura the good vessel be drive to the usual expedient of jibe and hauling-in of sheet baptiste have only to blame he own cupidity for this disappointment and the consciousness that have he comply with the engagement make on the previous evening with the mass of he passenger to depart with the dawn he should now have be in a situation to profit by any turn of fortune that be likely to arise from the multitude of stranger who be in vévey render he moody as be usual with the headstrong and selfish when they possess the power other be make to pay for the fault that he alone have commit he man be vex with contradictory and useless order the inferior passenger be accuse of constant neglect of he instruction a fault which he do not hesitate to affirm have cause the bark to sail less swiftly than usual and he no longer even answer the occasional question of those for whom he feel habitual deference with he former respect and readiness chapter iv thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again to make up nine macbeth baffling and light air keep the winkelry a long time nearly stationary and it be only by pay the greatest attention to trim the sail and to all the little minutiæ of the waterman 's art that the vessel be work into the eastern horn of the crescent as the sun touch the hazy line of the jura here the wind tail entirely the surface of the lake become as glassy and smooth as a mirror and further motion for the time at least be quite out of the question the crew perceive the hopelessness of they exertion and fatigue with the previous toil throw themselves among the box and bale and endeavor to catch a little sleep in anticipation of the north breeze which at this season of the year usually blow from the shore of vaud within a hour or two of the disappearance of the sun the deck of the bark be now leave to the undisputed possession of she passenger the day have latterly be sultry for the season the even water have cast back the hot ray in fierce reflection and as evening draw on a refreshing coolness come to relieve the densely packed and scorching traveller the effect of such a change be like that which would have be observe among a flock of heavily fleece sheep which after gasp for breath beneath tree and hedge during the time of the sun 's power be see scattering over they pasture to feed or to play they antic as a grateful shade succeed to cool they panting side baptiste as be but too apt to be the case with man possess of brief authority during the day have mercilessly play the tyrant with all the passenger that be beneath the privileged degree more than once threaten to come to extremity with several who have betray restlessness under the restraint and suffering of they unaccustomed situation perhaps there be no man who feel less for the complaint of the novice than you weather-beaten and hardened mariner for familiarize to the suffering and confinement of a vessel and at liberty himself to seek relief in he duty and avocation he can scarcely enter into the privation and embarrassment of those to whom all be so new and painful but in the patron of the winkelry there exist a natural in difference to the grievance of other and a narrow selfishness of disposition in aid of the opinion which have be form by a life of hardship and exposure he consider the vulgar passenger as so much troublesome freight which while it bring the advantage of a higher remuneration than the same cubic measurement of inanimate matter have the unpleasant drawback of volition and motion with this general tendency to bully and intimidate the wary patron have however make a silent exception in favor of the italian who have introduce himself to the reader by the ill-omened name of il maledetto or the accursed this formidable personage have enjoy a perfect immunity from the effect of baptiste 's tyranny which he have be able to establish by a very simple and quiet process instead of cower at the fierce glance or recoil at the rude remonstrance of the churlish patron he have choose he time when the latter be in one of he hottest ebullition of anger and when malediction and menace flow out of he mouth in torrent coolly to place himself on the very spot that the other have proscribe where he maintain he ground with a quietness and composure which it might have be difficult to say be more to be imputed to extreme ignorance or to immeasurable contempt at least so reason the spectator some thinking that the stranger mean to bring affair to a speedy issue by brave the patron 's fury and other charitably infer that he know no better but thus do not baptiste reason himself he see by the calm eye and resolute demeanor of he passenger that he himself he pretended professional difficulty he captiousness and he threat be alike despise and he shrink from collision with such a spirit precisely on the principle that the intimidate among the rest of the traveller shrink from a contest with he own from this moment il maledetto or as he be call by baptiste he self who it would appear have some knowledge of he person maso become as completely the master of he own movement as if he have be one of the more honor in the stern of the bark or even she patron he do not abuse he advantage however rarely quit the indicate station near he own effect where he have be mainly content to repose in listless indolence like the other doze away the minute but the scene be now altogether change the instant the wrangle discontented and unhappy because disappointed patron confess he inability to reach he port before the come of the expect night-breeze and throw himself on a bale to conceal he dissatisfaction in sleep head arise after head from among the pile of freight and body after body follow the nobler member until the whole mass be alive with human being the invigorating coolness the tranquil hour the prospect of a safe if not a speedy arrival and the relief from excessive weariness produce a sudden and agreeable re-action in the feeling of all even the baron de willading and he friend who have share in none of the especial privation just name join in the general exhibition of satisfaction and good-will rather aid by they smile and affability than restrain by they presence the whim and joke of the different individual among the motley group of they nameless companion the aspect and position of the bark as well as the prospects of those on board as they be connect with they arrival now deserve to be more particularly mention the manner in which the vessel be load to the water 's edge have already be more than once allude to the whole of the center of the broad deck a portion of the winkelry which owe to the over-hanging gangway possess in common with all the similar craft of the leman a greater width than be usual in vessel of the same tonnage elsewhere be so cumbered with freight as barely to leave a passage to the crew forward and aft by step among the box and bale that be pile much higher than they own head a little vacant space be leave near the stern in which it be possible for the party who occupy that part of the deck to move though in sufficiently straitened limit while the huge tiller play in its semicircle behind at the other extremity as be absolutely necessary in all navigation the forecastle be reasonably clear though even this important part of the deck be bristle with the fluke of no less than nine anchor that lay in a row across its breadth the wild roadstead of this end of the lake render such a provision of ground-tackle absolutely indispensable to the safety of every craft that venture into its eastern horn the effect of the whole see as it be in a state of absolute rest be to give to the winkelry the appearance of a small mound in the midst of the water that be crowd with human being and seemingly so incorporate with the element oh which it float as to grow out of its bosom a image that the fancy be not slow to form aid as it be by the reflection of the mass that the unruffled lake throw back from its mirror-like face as perfectly form as unwieldy and nearly as distinct as the original to this picture of a motionless rock or island the spar sail and high pointed beak however form especial exception the yard hang as seamen term it a cockbill or in such negligent and picturesque position as a artist would most love to draw while the drapery of the canvass be suspend in graceful and spotless festoon as it have fall by chance or be cast carelessly from the hand of the boatman the beak or prow rise in its sharp gallant stem resemble the stately neck of a swan slightly swerve from its direction or inclining in a nearly imperceptible sweep as the hull yield to the secret influence of the vary current when the teem pile of freight therefore begin so freely to bring forth and traveller after traveller leave he wallet there be no great space find in which they could stretch they wearied limb or seek the change they need but suffer be a good preparative for pleasure and there be no sweetner of liberty like previous confinement baptiste be no sooner hear to snore than the whole hummock of cargo be garnish with upright body and stretch arm and leg as mouse be know to steal from they hole during the slumber of they mortal enemy the cat the reader have be make sufficiently acquaint with the moral composition of the winkelried 's living freight in the opening chapter as it have undergo no other alteration than that produce by lassitude he be already prepare therefore to renew he communication with its different member all of whom be well disposed to show off in they respective character the moment they be favor with a opportunity the mercurial pippo as he have be the most difficult to restrain during the day be the first to steal from he lair now that the argus-like eye of baptiste permit the freedom and the exhilarating coolness of the sunset invite action he success embolden other and ere long the buffoon have a admiring audience around he that be well-disposed to laugh at he witticism and to applaud all he practical joke gain courage as he proceed the buffoon gradually go from liberty to liberty until he be at length triumphantly establish on what might be term a advanced spur of the mountain form by the tub of nicklaus wagner in the regular exercise of he art while a crowd of amuse and gaping spectator cluster about he people every eminence of the height and even invade the more privileged deck in they eagerness to see and to admire though frequently reduce by adverse fortune to the lowest shift of he call such as the horse-play of policinello and the imitation of uncouth sound that resemble nothing either in heaven or earth pippo be a clever knave in he way and be quite equal to a display of the higher branch of he art whenever chance give he a audience capable of estimate he quality on the present occasion he be oblige to address himself both to the polished and to the unpolished for the proximity of they position as well as a good-natured readiness to lend themselves to foolery that be so agreeable to most around they have bring the more gentle portion of the passenger within the influence of he wit and now illustrissimi signor continue the wily juggler after have draw a burst of applause by one of he happiest hit in a sleight-of-hand exhibition i come to the most impose and the most mysterious part of my knowledge -- that of look into the future and of foretell event if there be any among you who would wish to know how long they be to eat the bread of toil let they come to I if there be a youth that wish to learn whether the heart of he mistress be make of flesh or of stone -- a maiden that would see into a youth 's faith and constancy while she long eyelash cover she sight like a modest silken veil -- or a noble that would fain have a insight into the movement of he rival at court or council let they all put they question to pippo who have a answer ready for each and a answer so real that the most expert among the listener will be ready to swear that a lie from he mouth be worth more than truth from that of another man he that would gain credit for knowledge of the future gravely observe the signor grimaldus who have listen to he countryman 's voluble eulogium on he own merit with a good-natured laugh have best commence by show he familiarity with the past who and what be he that speak to thee as a specimen of thy skill in sooth-saying he eccellenza be more than he seem less than he deserve to be and as much as any present he have a old and a prize friend at he elbow have come because it be he pleasure to witness the game at vévey -- will depart for the same reason when they be over and will seek he home at he leisure -- not like a fox steal into he hole but as the stately ship sail gallantly and by the light of the sun into she haven this will never do pippo return the good-humoured old noble at need i might equal this myself thou shouldst relate that which be less probable while it be more true signora we prophet like to sleep in whole skin if it be you eccellenza 's pleasure and that of you noble company to listen to the truly wonderful i will tell some of these honest people matter touch they own interest that they do not know themselves and yet it shall be as clear to every body else as the sun in the heaven at noon-day thou wilt probably tell they they fault you eccellenza have a right to my place for no prophet could have better divine my intention answer the laughing knave come nearer friend he add beckon to the bernoi thou art nicklaus wagner a fat peasant of the great canton and a warm husbandman that fancy he have a title to the respect of all he meet because some one among he father buy a right in the bürgerschaft thou hast a large stake in the winkelry and art at this moment think what punishment be good enough for a impudent soothsayer who dare dive so unceremoniously into the secret of so warm a citizen while all around thee wish thy cheese have never leave the dairy to the discomfort of we limb and to the great detriment of the bark 's speed this sally at the expense of nicklaus draw a burst of merriment from the listener for the selfish spirit he have manifest throughout the day have win little favor with a majority of he fellow traveller who have all the generous propensity that be usually so abundant among those who have little or nothing to bestow and who be by this time so well disposed to be merry that much less would have serve to stimulate they mirth wert thou the owner of this good freight friend thou might find its presence less uncomfortable than thou now appearest to think return the literal peasant who have no humor for raillery and to whom a jest on the subject of property have that sort of irreverend character that popular opinion and holy saying have attach to waste the cheese be well enough where they find themselves if thou dislikest they company thou hast the alternative of the water a truce between we worshipful burgher and let we skirmish end in something that may be useful to both thou hast that which would be acceptable to I and i have that which no owner of cheese would refuse do he know the means by which it might be come at honestly nicklaus growl a few word of distrust and indifference but it be plain that the ambiguous language of the juggler as usual have succeed in awaken interest with the affectation of a mind secretly conscious of its own infirmity he pretend to be indifferent to what the other profess a readiness to reveal while with the rapacity of a grasp spirit he betray a longing to know more first i will tell thee say pippo with a parade of good-nature that thou deservest to remain in ignorance as a punishment of thy pride and want of faith but it be the fail of you prophet to let that be know which he ought to conceal thou flatterest thyself this be the fattest cargo of cheese that will cross the swiss water this season on they way to a italian market shake not thy head -- ` tis useless to deny it to a man of my learn nay i know there be other as heavy and it may be as good but this have the advantage of be the first a circumstance that be certain to command a price such be the blindness of one that nature send on earth to deal in cheese -- the herr von willading and he friend smile among themselves at the cool impudence of the mountebank -- thou fanciest it be so and at this moment a heavily laden bark be drive before a favorable gale near the upper end of the lake of the four canton while a long line of mule be wait at flüellen to bear its freight by the path of the st gothard to milano and other rich market of the south in virtue of my secret power i see that in despite of all thy craving it will arrive before thine nicklaus fidget for the graphic particularity of pippo almost lead he to believe the augury might be true have this bark sail accord to we covenant he say with a simplicity that betray he uneasiness the beast bespeak by I would now be load at villeneuve and if there be justice in vaud i shall hold baptiste responsible for any disadvantage that may come of the neglect luckily the generous baptiste be asleep return pippo or we might hear objection to this scheme but signiorus i see you be satisfy with this insight into the character of the warm peasant of berne who to say truth have not much to conceal from we and i will turn my search look into the soul of this pious pilgrim the reverend conrado whose unction may well go near to be a leaven sufficient to lighten all in the bark of they burthen of backsliding thou earnest the penitence and prayer of many sinner besides some merchandise of this nature of thine own i be bind to loretto with the mental offering of certain christian who be too much occupy with they daily concern to make the journey in person answer the pilgrim who never absolutely throw aside he professional character though he care in general so little about he hypocrisy be know i be poor and humble of appearance but i have see miracle in my day if any trust valuable offering to thy keep thou art a living miracle in thine own person i can foresee that thou wilt bear nought else beside ave nay i pretend to deal in little more the rich and great they that send vessel of gold and rich dress to we lady employ they own favorite messenger i be but the bearer of prayer and the substitute for the penitent the suffering that i undergo in the flesh be pass to the credit of my employer who get the benefit of my ache and pain i pretend to be no more than they go-between as yonder manner have so lately call I pippo turn suddenly follow the direction of the other 's eye and cast a glance at the self-styled il maledetto this individual of all the common herd have alone forborne to join the gaping and amuse crowd near the juggler he forbearance or want of curiosity have leave he in the quiet possession of the little platform that be make by the stowage of the box and he now stand on the summit of the pile conspicuous by he situation and mein the latter be remarkable for its unmoved calmness heighten by the understanding manner that be so peculiar to a seaman when afloat wilt thou have the history of thy come peril friend mariner cry the mercurial mountebank : a journal of thy future risk and tempest to amuse you in this calm such a picture of sea-monster and of coral that grow in the ocean 's cavern where mariner sleep that shall give thee the night-mare for month and cause thee to dream of wreck and bleached bone for the rest of thy life thou hast only to wish it to have the adventure of thy next voyage lay before thee like a map thou would ` st gain more credit with I as one cunning in thy art by give the history of the last the request be reasonable and thou shalt have it : for i love the bold adventurer that trust himself hardily upon the great deep answer the unabashed pippo my first lesson in necromancy be receive on the mole of napolus amid burly inglesus straight-nosed greek swarthy sicilian and maltese with spirit as fine as the gold of they own chain this be the school in which i learn to know my art and a apt scholar i prove in all that touch the philosophy and humanity of my craft signora thy palm maso spread he sinewy hand in the direction of the juggler without descend from he elevation and in a way to show that while he would not balk the common humor he be superior to the gaping wonder and childish credulity of most of those who watch the result pippo affect to stretch out he neck in order to study the hard and dark line and then he resume he revelation like one perfectly satisfy with what he have discover the hand be masculine and have be familiar with many friend in its time it have deal with steel and cordage and saltpetre and most of all with gold signor the true seat of a man 's digestion lie in the palm of he hand if that be free to give and to receive he will never have a costive conscience for of all damnable inconvenience that afflict mortal that of a conscience that will neither give up nor take be the heaviest curse let a man have as much sagacity as shall make he a cardinal if it get entangled in the mesh of one of you unyielding conscience ye shall see he a mendicant brother to he die day let he be bear a prince with a close-ribbed opinion of this sort and he have better have be bear a beggar for he reign will be like a river from which the current set outward without any return no my friend a palm like this of maso 's be a favorable sign since it hinge on a pliant will that will open and shut like a well-formed eye or the jacket of a shell-fish at its owner 's pleasure thou hast draw near to many a port before this of vévey after the sun have fall low signor maso in that i have take a seaman 's chance which depend more on the wind than on he own wish thou esteemest the bottom of the craft in which thou art require to sail as far more important than she ancient thou hast a eye for a keel but none for color unless indeed as it may happen to be convenient to seem that thou art not nay master soothsayer i suspect thee to be a officer of some of the holy brotherhood send in this guise to question we poor traveller to we ruin answer maso i be what thou seest but a poor mariner that have no better bark under he than this of baptiste and on a sea no larger than a swiss lake shrewdly observe say pippo wink to those near he though he so little like the eye and bearing of the other that he be not sorry to turn to some new subject but what matter it signor to be speak of the quality of man we be all alike honorable merciful more disposed to help other than to help ourselves and so little give to selfishness that nature have be oblige to supply every mother 's son of we with a sort of goad that shall be constantly prick we on to look after we own interest here be animal whose disposition be less understand and we will bestow a useful minute in examine they quality reverend augustine this mastiff of thine be name uberto he be know by that appellation throughout the canton and they ally the fame of the dog reach even to turin and to most of the town in the plain of lombardy now signori you perceive that this be but a secondary creature in the scale of animal do he good and he will be grateful do he harm and he will forgive feed he and he be satisfied he will travel the path of the st bernard night and day to do credit to he training and when the toil be end all he ask be just as much meat as will keep the breath within he rib have heaven give uberto a conscience and greater wit the first might have show he the impiety of work for traveller on holy day and festa while the latter would be apt to say he be a fool for troubling himself about the safety of other at all and yet he master the good augustine themselves do not hold so selfish a creed observe adelheid ah they have heaven in view i cry the reverend augustine 's pardon -- but lady the difference be in the length of the calculation woe 's I brethren i would that my parent have educate I for a bishop or a viceroy or some other modest employment that this learn craft of mine might have fall into better hand ye would lose in instruction but i should be remove from the giddy height of ambition and die at last with some hope of be a saint fair lady thou travellest on a bootless errand if i know the reason that tempt thee to cross the alp at this late season of the year this sudden address cause both adelheid and she father to start for in despite of pride and the force of reason it be seldom that we can completely redeem we opinion from the shackle of superstition and that dread of the unseen future which appear to have be entail upon we nature as a ceaseless monitor of the eternal state of be to which all be hasten with step so noiseless and yet so sure the countenance of the maiden change and she turn a quick involuntary glance at she anxious parent as if to note the effect of this rude announcement on he before she answer i go in quest of the blessing health she say and i should be sorry to think thy prognostic likely to be realize with youth a good constitution and tender friend of my side there be reason to think thou mayest in this at least prove a false prophet lady hast thou hope pippo venture this question as he have adventure he opinion that be to say recklessly pretendingly and with great indifference to any effect it might have except as it be likely to establish he reputation with the crowd still it would seem that by one of those singular coincidence that be hourly occur in real life he have unwittingly touch a sensitive chord in the system of he fair fellow-traveller she eye sink to the deck at this abrupt question the color again steal to she polished temple and the least practice in the emotion of the sex might have detect painful embarrassment in she mein she be however spare the awkwardness of a reply by the unexpected and prompt interference of maso hope be the last of we friend to prove recreant say this mariner else would the case of many in company be bad enough thine own include pippo for judge by the outward sign the swabian campaign have not be rich in spoil providence have order the harvest of wit much as it have order the harvest of the field return the juggler who feel the sarcasm of the other 's remark with all the poignancy that it could derive from truth since to expose he real situation he be absolutely indebted to a extraordinary access of generosity in baptiste for he very passage across the leman one year thou shall find the vineyard drip liquor precious as diamond while the next barrenness shall make it its seat to-day the peasant will complain that poverty prevent he from build the cover necessary to house he crop while to-morrow he will be hear groan over empty garner abundance and famine travel the earth hard upon each other 's heel and it be not surprising that he who live by he wit should sometimes fail of he harvest as well as he who live by he hand if constant custom can secure success the pious conrad should be prosperous answer maso for of all machinery that of sin be the least seldom idle he trade at least can never fail for want of employer thou hast it signor maso and it be for this especial reason that i wish my parent have educate I for a bishoprick he that be charge with reprove he fellow creature for they vice need never know a idle hour thou dost not

favorite shrine there be then ten i have hear the elder of we pilgrim say that fifty year since 'twa a pleasure to bear the sin of a whole parish for ours be a business in which the load do not so much depend on the amount as the quality and in they time there be willing offering frank confession and generous consideration for those who undertake the toil in such a trade the less thou hast to

those who profess a faith obnoxious to the attack of all who dissent from the opinion and the spiritual domination of rome but conrad be a rare specimen of what may be effect by training and well-rooted prejudice in present this man to the mind of the reader we have no intention to impugn the doctrine of the particular church to which he belong but simply to show as the truth will fully warrant to what a pass of flagrant and impudent pretension the quality of man unbridled by the wholesome corrective of a sound and healthful opinion be capable of conduct abuse on the most solemn and gravest subject in that age usage prevail and be so familial to the mind of the actor as to excite neither reflection nor comment which would now lead to revolution and a general rise in defense of principle which be hold to be clear as the air we breathe though we entertain no doubt of the existence of that truth which pervade the universe and to which all thing tend we think the world in its practice its theory and its conventional standard of right and wrong be in a condition of constant change which it should be the business of the wise and good to favor so long as care be have that the advantage be not buy by a re-action of evil that shall more than prove its counterpoise conrad be one of the lowest class of those fungus that grow out of the decayed part of the moral as they more material type prove the rottenness of the vegetable world and the probability of the truth of the portraiture be not to be loosely deny without mature reflection on the similar anomaly that be yet to be find on every side of we or without study the history of the abuse which then disgrace christianity and which in truth become so intolerable in they character and so hideous in they feature as to be the chief influence cause to bring about they own annihilation pippo who have that useful tact which enable a man to measure he own estimation with other be not slow to perceive that the more enlighten part of he audience begin to tire of this pretending buffoonery resort to a happy subterfuge by means of one of he sleight-of-hand expedient he succeed in transfer the whole of that portion of the spectator who still find amusement in he jugglery to the other end of the vessel where they establish themselves among the anchor ready as ever to swallow a aliment that seem to find a unextinguishable appetite for its reception among the vulgar here he continue he exhibition now moralize in the quaint and often in the pithy manner which render the southern buffoon so much superior to he duller competitor of the north and utter a wild jumble of wholesome truth loose morality and witty inuendo the latter of which never fail to extort roar of laughter from all but those who happen to be they luckless subject once or twice baptiste raise he head and stare about he with drowsy eye but satisfied there be nothing to be do in the way of force the vessel ahead he resume he nap without interfere in the pastime of those whom he have hitherto seem to take pleasure in annoying left entirely to themselves therefore the crowd on the forecastle represent one of those every-day but profitable picture of life which abound under we eye but which though they be pregnant with instruction be treat with the indifference that would seem to be the inevitable consequence of familiarity the crowded and overloaded bark might have be compare to the vessel of human life which float at all time subject to the thousand accident of a delicate and complicated machinery : the lake so smooth and alluring in its present tranquillity but so capable of lash its iron-bound coast with fury to a treacherous world whose smile be almost always as dangerous as its frown and to complete the picture the idle laughing thoughtless and yet inflammable group that surround the buffoon to the unaccountable medley of human sympathy of sudden and fierce passion of fun and frolic so inexplicably mingle with the grossest egotism that enter into the heart of man : in a word to so much that be beautiful and divine with so much that would seem to be derive directly from the demon a compound which compose this mysterious and dread state of be and which we be teach by reason and revelation be only a preparation for another still more incomprehensible and wonderful chapter v how like a fawn publican he look shylock the change of the juggler 's scene of action leave the party in the stern of the barge in quiet possession of they portion of the vessel baptiste and he boatman still sleep among the box maso continue to pace he elevated platform above they head and the meek-looking stranger whose entrance into the barge have draw so many witticism from pippo sate a little apart silent furtively observant and retire in the identical spot he have occupy throughout the day with these exception the whole of the rest of the traveller be crowd around the person of the mountebank perhaps we have not do well however in class either of the two just name with the more common herd for there be strong point of difference to distinguish both from most of they companion the exterior and the personal appointment of the unknown traveller who have shrink so sensitively before the hit of the neapolitan be greatly superior to those of any other in the bark beneath the degree of the gentle not even except those of the warm peasant nicklaus wagner the owner of so large a portion of the freight there be a decency of air that command more respect than it be then usual to yield to the nameless a quietness of demeanor that denote reflection and the habit of self-study and self-correction together with a deference to other that be well adapt to gain friend in the midst of the noisy clamorous merriment of all around he he restrained and rebuke manner have win upon the favor of the more privileged who have unavoidably notice the difference and have prepare the way to a more frank communication between the party of the noble and one who if not they equal in the usual point of worldly distinction be greatly superior to those among whom he have be accidentally cast by the chance of he journey not so with maso he apparently have little in common with the unobtruding and silent be that sit so near he path in the short turn he be make to and fro across the pile of freight the mariner be thirty while the head of the unknown traveller be already begin to be sprinkle with gray the walk attitude and gesture of the former be also those of a man confident of himself a little addict to be indifferent to other and far more disposed to lead than to follow these be quality that it may be think he present situation be scarcely suit to discover but they have be make sufficiently apparent by the cool calculate look he throw from time to time at the maneuver command by baptiste the expressive sneer with which he criticise he decision and a few bite remark which have escape he in the course of the day and which have convey any thing but compliment to the nautical skill of the patron and he fresh-water follower still there be sign of better stuff in this suspicious-looking person than be usually see about man whose attire pursuit and situation be so indicative of the world 's press hard upon they principle as happen to be the fact with this poor and unknown seaman though ill clad and wear about he the general token of a vagrant life and that loose connexion with society that be usually take as sufficient evidence of one 's demerit he countenance occasionally denote thought and during the day he eye have frequently wander towards the group of he more intelligent fellow-passenger as if he find subject of greater interest in they discourse than in the rude pleasantry and practical joke of those nearer he person the high-bred be always courteous except in case in which presumption repel civility for they who be accustom to the privilege of station think far less of they immunity than they who by be exclude from the fancied advantage be apt to exaggerate a superiority that a short experience would show become of very questionable value in the possession without this equitable provision of providence the law of civilized society would become truly intolerable for if peace of mind pleasure and what be usually term happiness be the exclusive enjoyment of those who be rich and honor there would indeed be so cry a injustice in they present ordinance as could not long withstand the unite assault of reason and justice but happily for the relief of the less gifted and the peace of the world the fact be very different wealth have its peculiar woe honor and privilege pall in the use and perhaps as a rule there be less of that regulate contentment which form the nearest approach to the condition of the bless of which this unquiet state of be be susceptible among those who be usually the most envy by they fellow-creature than in any other of the numerous gradation into which the social scale have be divide he who read we present legend with the eye that we could wish will find in its moral the illustration of this truth for if it be we intention to delineate some of the wrong that spring from the abuse of the privileged and powerful we hope equally to show how completely they fall short of they object by fail to confer that exclusive happiness which be the goal that all struggle to attain neither the baron de willading nor he noble friend the genoese though educate in the opinion of they caste and necessarily under the influence of the prejudice of the age be addict to the insolence of vulgar pride they habit have revolt at the coarseness of the majority of the traveller and they be glad to be rid of they by the expedient of pippo but no sooner do the modest decent air of the stranger who remain make itself apparent than they feel a desire to compensate he for the privation he have already undergo by show the civility that they own rank render so easy and usually so grateful with this view then as soon as the noisy _ troupe _ have depart the signor grimaldus raise he beaver with that discreet and impose politeness which equally attract and repel and address the solitary stranger he invite he to descend and stretch he leg on the part of the deck which have hitherto be consider exclusively devote to the use of he own party the other start reddened and look like one who doubt whether he have hear aright these noble gentleman would be glad if you would come down and take advantage of this opportunity to relieve you limb say the young sigismund raise he own athletic arm towards the stranger to offer its assistance in help he to reach the deck still the unknown traveller hesitate in the manner of one who fear he might overstep discretion by obtrude beyond the limit impose by modesty he glance furtively upwards at the place where maso bad post himself and mutter something of a intention to profit by its present nakedness it have a occupant who do not seem disposed to admit another say sigismund smile you mariner have a self-possession when afloat that usually give he the same superiority that the well-armed swasher have among the timid in the street you would do well then to accept the offer of the noble genoese the stranger who have once or twice be call rather ostentatiously by baptiste the herr müller during the day as if the patron be dispose to let he hearer know that he have those who at least bear creditable name even among he ordinary passenger no longer delay he come down from he seat and move about the deck in he usual quiet subdue manner but in a way to show that he find a very sensible and grateful relief in be permit to make the change sigismund be reward for this act of good-nature by a smile from adelheid who think he warm interference in behalf of one seemingly so much he inferior do no discredit to he rank it be possible that the youthful soldier have some secret sentiment of the advantage he derive from he kind interest in the stranger for he brow flush and he look more satisfied with himself after this little office of humanity have be perform you be better among we here the baron kindly observe when the herr müller be fairly establish in he new situation than among the freight of the honest nicklaus wagner who heaven help the worthy peasant have load we fairly to the water 's edge with the notable industry of he dairy people i like to witness the prosperity of we burgher but it would have be better for we traveller at least have there be less of the wealth of honest nicklaus in we company be you of berne or of zurich of berne herr baron i might have guess that by find you on the genfer see instead of the wallenstätter there be many of the müllers in the emman thal the herr be right the name be frequent both in that valley and in entlibuch it be a frequent appellation among we of the teutonick stock i have many müllers in my company gaetano when we lay before mantua i remember that two of the brave fellow be bury in the marsh of that low country for the fever help the enemy as much as the sword in the life-wasting campaign of the year we besiege the place the more observant italian saw that the stranger be distressed by the personal nature of the conversation and while he quietly assent to he friend 's remark he take occasion to give it a new direction you travel like ourselves signore to get a look at these far-famed revel of the vévasians that and affair have bring I into this honorable company answer the herr müller whom no kindness of tone however could win from he timid and subdue manner of speaking and thou father turn to the augustine art journey towards thy mountain residence after a visit of love to the valley and they people the monk of st bernard assent to the truth of this remark explain the manner in which he community be accustomed annually to appeal to the liberality of the generous in switzerland in behalf of a institution that be found in the interest of humanity without reference to distinction of faith ` tis a bless brotherhood answer the genoese cross himself perhaps as much from habit as from devotion and the traveller need wish it well i have never share of you hospitality but all report speak fairly of it and the title of a brother of san bernardo should prove a passport to the favor of every christian signora say maso stop suddenly and take he part uninvited in the discourse and yet in a way to avoid the appearance of a impertinent interference none know this better than i a wanderer these many year i have often see the stony roof of the hospice with as much pleasure as i have ever behold the entrance of my haven when a adverse gale be press against my canvass honor and a rich _ quête _ to the clavier of the convent therefore for it be bring succor to the poor and rest to the weary as he utter this opinion maso decorously raise he cap and pursue he straitened walk with the industry of a caged tiger it be so unusual for one of he condition to obtrude on the discourse of the fair and noble that the party exchange look of surprise but the signor grirnaldus more accustomed than most of he friend to the frank deportment and bold speech of mariner from have dwell long on the coast of the mediterranean feel disposed rather to humor than to repulse this disposition to talk thou art a genoese by thy dialect he say assume as a matter of course the right to question one of year so much fewer and of a condition so much inferior to he own signora return maso uncover himself again though he manner betray profound personal respect rather than the deference of the vulgar i be bear in the city of palace though it be my fortune first to see the light beneath a humble roof the poorest of we be proud of the splendor of genova la superba even if its glory have come from we own groan the signor grimaldus frowned but ashamed to permit himself to be disturb by a allusion so vague and perhaps so unpremeditated and more especially come as it do from so insignificant a source he brow regain its expression of habitual composure a instant of reflection tell he it would be in better taste to continue the conversation than churlishly to cut it short for so light a cause thou art too young to have have much connexion either in advantage or in suffer he rejoin with the erection of the gorgeous dwelling to which thou alludest this be true signora except as one be the better or worse for those who have go before he i be what i seem more by the act of other than by any fault of my own i envy not the rich or great however for one that have see as much of life as i know the difference between the gay color of the garment and that of the shrivel and diseased skin it conceal we make we felucca glitter and fine with paint when they timber work the most and when the treacherous plank be ready to let in the sea to drown we thou hast the philosophy of it young man and hast utter a bite truth for those who waste they prime in chase a phantom thou hast well bethought thee of these matter for if content with thy lot no palace of we city would make thee happier if signora be a meaning word -- content be like the north-star -- we seamen steer for it while none can ever reach it be i then deceive in thee after all be thy seeming moderation only affect and would ` st thou be the patron of the bark in which fortune have make thee only a passenger and a bad fortune it have proved return maso laughing we appear fate to pass the night in it for so far from see any sign of this land-breeze of which baptiste have so confidently speak the air seem to have go to sleep as well as the crew thou art accustom to this climate reverend augustine be it usual to see so deep a calm on the leman at this late season a question like this be well adapt to effect the speaker 's wish to change the discourse for it very naturally direct the attention of all present from a subject that be rather tolerate from idleness than interesting in itself to the different natural phenomenon by which they be surround the sunset have now fairly pass and the traveller be at the witching moment that precede the final disappearance of the day a calm so deep rest on the limpid lake that it be not easy to distinguish the line which separate the two element in those place where the blue of the land be confound with the well-known and peculiar color of the leman the precise position of the winkelried be near mid-way between the shore of vaud and those of savoy though nearer to the first than to the last not another sail be visible on the whole of the watery expanse with the exception of one that hang lazily from its yard in a small bark that be pull towards st gingoulph bear savoyard return to they home from the other side of the lake and which in that delusive landscape appear to the eye to be within a stone 's throw of the base of the mountain though in truth still a weary row from the land nature have spread she work on a scale so magnificent in this sublime region that ocular deception of this character abound and it require time and practice to judge of those measurement which have be render familiar in other scene in like manner to the bark under the rock of savoy there lay another a heavy-moulded boat nearly in a line with villeneuve which seem to float in the air instead of its proper element and whose oar be see to rise and fall beneath a high mound that be render shapeless by refraction this be a craft bearing hay from the meadow at the mouth of the rhone to they proprietor in the village of the swiss coast a few light boat be pull about in front of the town of vévey and a forest of low mast and latine yard see in the hundred picturesque attitude peculiar to the rig crowd the wild anchorage that be term its port a air-line draw from st saphorin to meillerie would have pass between the spar of the winkelry she distance from she haven consequently a little exceed a marine league this space might readily have be conquer in a hour or two by means of the sweep but for the lumbered condition of the deck which would have render they use difficult and the unusual draught of the bark which would have cause the exertion to be painful as it have be see baptiste prefer wait for the arrival of the night breeze to have recourse to a expedient so toil some and slow we have already say that the point just describe be at the place where the leman fairly enter its eastern horn and where its shore possess they boldest and finest face on the side of savoy the coast be a sublime wall of rock here and there clothe with chestnut or indented with ravine and dark glen and naked and wild along the whole line of they giddy summit the village so frequently mention and which have become celebrated in these later time by the touch of genius cling to the uneven declivity they lower dwelling lave by the lake and they upper confound with the rugged face of the mountain beyond the limit of the leman the alp shoot up into still higher pinnacle occasionally show one of those naked excrescence of granite which rise for a thousand foot above the rest of the range -- a trifle in the stupendous scale of the vast pile -- and which in the language of the country be not inaptly term dent from some fancy and plausible resemblance to human tooth the verdant meadow of noville aigle and bex spread for league between these snow-capped barrier so dwindle to the eye however that the spectator believe that to be a mere bottom which be in truth a broad and fertile plain beyond these again come the celebrated pass of st maurice where the foam rhone dash between two abutment of rock as if anxious to effect its exit before the superincumbent mountain could come together and shut it out for ever from the invite basin to which it be hurry with a never-ceasing din behind this gorge so celebrate as the key of the valai and even of the alp in the time of the conqueror of the world the back-ground take a character of holy mystery the shades of evening lay thick in that enormous glen which be sufficiently large to contain a sovereign state and the dark pile of mountain beyond be see in a hazy confused array the setting be a gray boundary of rock on which fleecy cloud rest as if tire with they long and high flight and on which the parting day still linger soft and lucid one cone of dazzling white tower over all it resemble a bright stepping-stone between heaven and earth the heat of the hot sun fall innocuously against its side like the cold and pure breast of a virgin repel those treacherous sentiment which prove the ruin of a shine and glorious innocence across the summit of this brilliant and cloud-like peak which form the most distant object in the view run the imaginary line that divide italy from the region of the north draw nearer and hold its course on the opposite shore the eye embrace the range of rampart-like rock that beetle over villeneuve and chillon the latter a snow-white pile that seem to rest partly on the land and partly on the water on the vast débris of the mountain cluster the hamlet of claren montreux châtelard and all those other place since render so familiar to the reader of fiction by the vivid pen of rousseau above the latter village the whole of the savage and rocky range recede leave the lake-shore to vine-clad côtes that stretch away far to the west this scene at all time alluring and grand be now behold under its most favorable auspices the glare of day have desert all that belong to what might be term the lower world leave in its stead the mild hue the pleasing shadow and the vary tint of twilight it be true that a hundred châlets dot the alp or those mountain pasturage which spread themselves a thousand fathom above the leman on the foundation of rock that lay like a wall behind montreux shine still with the brightness of a bland even but all below be fast catch the more sombre color of the hour as the transition from day to night grow more palpable the hamlet of savoy become gray and hazy the shades thicken around the basis of the mountain in a manner to render they form indistinct and massive and the milder glory of the scene be transfer to they summit see by sun-light these noble height appear a long range of naked granite pile on a foundation of chestnut-covered hill and buttress by a few such salient spur as be perhaps necessary to give variety and agreeable shadow to they acclivity they outline be now draw in those wave line that the pencil of raphael would have love to sketch dark distinct and appear to be carve by art the inflect and capricious edge of the rock stand out in high relief against the back-ground of pearly sky resemble so much ebony work into every fantastic curvature that a wild and vivid fancy could conceive of all the wonderful and impose sight of this extraordinary region there be perhaps none in which there be so exquisite a admixture of the noble the beautiful and the bewitching as in this view of these natural arabesque of savoy see at the solemn hour of twilight the baron de willading and he friend stand uncover in reverence of the sublime picture which could only come from the hand of the creator and with unalloyed enjoyment of the bland tranquillity of the hour exclamation of pleasure have escape they as the exhibition advance for the view like the shift of scene be in a constant state of transition under the wane and change light and each have eagerly point out to the other some peculiar charm of the view the sight be in sooth of a nature to preclude selfishness no one catch a glimpse that he do not wish to be share by all vévey they journey the fleeting minute and they disappointment be all forget in the delight of witness this evening landscape and the silence be break only to express those feeling of delight which have long be uppermost in every bosom i doff my beaver to thy switzerland friend melchior cry the signor grimaldus after direct the attention of adelheid to one of the peak of savoy of which he have just remark that it seem a spot where a angel might love to light in he visit to the earth if thou hast much of this we of italy must look to it or -- by the shades of we father we shall lose we reputation for natural beauty how be it young lady hast thou many of these sun-set at willading or be this after all but a exception to what thou seest in common -- as much a matter of astonishment to thyself as -- by san francesco good marcellus we must even own it be to thee and I adelheid laugh at the old noble 's good-humored rhapsody but much as she love she native land she could not pervert the truth by pretend that the sight be one to be often meet with if we have not this however we have we glacier we lake we cottage we châlets we oberland and such glen as have a eternal twilight of they own ay my true-hearted and pretty swiss this be well for thee who wilt affirm that a drop of thy snow-water be worth a thousand limpid spring or thou art not the true child of old melchior de willade but it be lose on the cooler head of one who have see other land father xavier thou art a neutral for thy dwelling be on the divide ridge between the two country and i appeal to thee to know if these helvetian have much of this quality of evening the worthy monk meet the question in the spirit with which it be ask for the elasticity of the air and the heavenly tranquillity and bewitching loveliness of the hour well dispose he to be joyous to maintain my character as a impartial judge he answer i will say that each region have its own advantage if switzerland be the most wonderful and impose italy be the most win the latter leave more durable impression and be more fondly cherish one strike the sens but the other slowly wind its way into the affection and he who have freely vent he admiration in exclamation and epithet in one will in the end want language to express all the secret longing the fond recollection the deep repining that he retain for the other fairly reason friend melchior and like a able umpire leave to each he share of consolation and vanity herr müller dost thou agree in a decision that give thy much vaunted switzerland so formidable a rival signora answer the meek traveller i see enough to admire and love in both as be always the fact with that which god have form this be a glorious world for the happy and most might be so could they summon courage to be innocent the good augustine will tell thee that this bear hard on certain point of theology in which we common nature be treat with but indifferent respect he that would continue innocent must struggle hard with he propensity the stranger be thoughtful and sigismund whose eye have be earnestly rivet on he face think that it denote more of peace then usual signora rejoin the herr müller when time have be give for reflection i believe it be good for we to know unhappiness he that be permit too much of he own will get to be headstrong and like the overfed bullock difficult to be manage whereas he who live under the displeasure of he fellow-creature be drive to look closely into himself and come at last to chasten he spirit by detect its fault art thou a follower of calvin demand the augustine suddenly surprise to hear opinion so healthful in the mouth of a dissenter from the true church father i belong neither to rome nor to the religion of geneva i be a humble worshipper of god and a believer in the bless mediation of he holy son how -- where dost thou find such sentiment out of the pale of the church in mine own heart this be my temple holy augustine and i never enter it without adoration for its almighty founder a cloud be over the roof of my father at my birth and i have not be permit to mingle much with man but the solitude of my life have drive I to study my own nature which i hope have become none the worse for the examination i know i be a unworthy and sinful man and i hope other be as much better than i as they opinion of themselves would give reason to think the word of the herr müller which lose none of they weight by he unaffected and quiet manner excite curiosity at first most of the listener be dispose to believe he one of those exaggerated spirit who exalt themselves by a pretended self-abasement but he natural quiet and thoughtful deportment soon produce a more favorable opinion there be a habit of reflection a retreat inward look about he eye that reveal the character of one long and truly accustomed to look more at himself than at other and which work singularly in he behalf we may not all have these flattering opinion of ourselves that thy word would seem to imply signor müller observe the genoese he tone change to one better suit to soothe the feeling of the person address while a shade insensibly steal over he own venerable feature neither be all at peace that so seem if it will be any consolation to thee to know that other be probably no more happy than thyself i will add that i have know much pain and that too amid circumstance which most would deem fortunate and which i fear a great majority of mankind might be dispose to envy i should be base indeed to seek consolation in such a source i do not complain signora though my whole life have so pass that i can hardly say that i enjoy it it be not easy to smile when we know that all frown upon we else could i be content as it be i rather feel than repine this be a most singular condition of the mind whisper adelheid to young sigismund for both have be deeply attentive listener to the calm but strong language of the herr müller the young man do not answer and he fair companion see with surprise that he be pale and with difficulty notice she remark with a smile the frown of man my son observe the monk be usually reserve for those who offend its ordinance the latter may not be always just but there be a common sentiment which refuse to visit innocence even in the narrow sense in which we understand the word with undeserved displeasure the herr müller look earnestly at the augustine and he seem about to answer but check the impulse he bow in submission at the same time a wild painful smile gleam on he face i agree with thee good canon rejoin the simple-minded baron : we be much addict to quarrel with the world but after all when we look closely into the matter it will commonly be find that the cause of we grievance exist in ourselves be there no providence father exclaim adelheid a little reproachfully for one of she respectful habit and great filial tenderness can we recall the dead to life or keep those quick whom god be pleased to destroy thou hast I girl -- there be a truth in this that no bereaved parent can deny this remark produce a embarrassed pause during which the herr müller gaze furtively about he look from the face of one to that of another as if seek for some countenance on which he could rely but he turn away to the view of those hill which have be so curiously work by the finger of the almighty and seem to lose himself in they contemplation this be some spirit that have be bruise by early indiscretion say the signor grimaldus in a low voice and whose repentance be strangely mix with resignation i know not whether such a man be most to be envy or pity there be a fearful mixture of resignation and of suffer in he air he have not the mien of a stabber or a knave answer the baron if he come truly of the müllers of the emman thal or even of those of entlibuch i should know something of he history they be warm burgher and mostly of fair name it be true that in my youth one of the family get out of favor with the council on account of some concealment of they lawful claim in the way of revenue but the man make a atonement that be deem sufficient in amount and the matter be forget it be not usual herr müller to meet citizen in we canton who go for neither rome nor calvin it be not usual mein herr to meet man place as i be neither rome nor calvin be sufficient for I -- i have need of god i fear thou hast take life the stranger bow and he face grow livid seemingly with the intensity of he own thought melchior de willading so dislike the expression that he turn away he eye in uneasiness the other glance frequently at the forward part of the bark and he seem struggle hard to speak but for some strong reason unable to effect he purpose uncover himself at length he say steadily as if superior to shame while he fully feel the import of he communication but in a voice that be cautiously suppress -- i be balthazar of you canton herr baron and i pray you powerful succor should those untame spirit on the forecastle come to discover the truth my blood have be make to curdle to-day whilst listen to they heartless threat and terrible malediction without this fear i should have keep my secret -- for god know i be not proud of my office the general and sudden surprise accompany as it be by a common movement of aversion induce the signor grimaldus to demand the reason thy name be not in much favor apparently herr müller or herr balthazar whichever it be thy pleasure to be call observe the genoese cast a quick glance around the circle there be some mystery in it that to I need explanation signora i be the headsman of berne though long school in the polished habit of he high condition which teach he ordinarily to repress strong emotion the signor grimaldus could not conceal the start which this unexpected announcement produce for he have not escape the usual prejudice of man truly we have be fortunate in we associate melchior he say drily turn without ceremony from the man whose modest quiet mien have lately interested he so much but whose manner he now take to be assume -- few pause to investigate the motive of those who be condemn of opinion : -- here have be much excellent and useful morality throw away upon a very unworthy subject the baron receive the intelligence of the real name of they travel companion with less feeling he have be greatly puzzle to account for the singular language he have hear and he find relief in so brief a solution of the difficulty the pretended name after all then be only a cloak to conceal the truth i know the müllers of the emman thal so well that i have great difficulty in fitting the character which the honest man give of himself fairly upon any one of they all but it be now clear enough and doubtless balthazar have no great reason to be proud of the turn which fortune have play he family in make they executioner be the office hereditary demand the genoese quickly it be thou knowest that we of berne have great respect for ancient usage he that be bear to the bürgerschaft will die in the exercise of he rights and he that be bear out of its venerable pale must be satisfy to live out of it unless he have gold or favor we institution be a hint from nature which leave man as they be create preserve the order and harmony of society by venerable and well-defined law as be wise and necessary in nature he that be bear strong remains strong and he that have little force must be content with he feebleness the signor grimaldus look like one who feel contrition art thou in truth a hereditary executioner he ask address balthazar himself signore i be : else would hand of mine have never take life ` tis a hard duty to perform even under the obligation and penalty of the law -- otherwise it be accursed thy father deem it a privilege we suffer for they error : signore the sin of the father in we case have indeed be visit on the child to the latest generation the countenance of the genoese grow brighter and he voice resume the polished tone in which he usually speak here have be some injustice of a certainty he say or one of thy appearance would not be find in this cruel position depend on we authority to protect thee should the danger thou seemest to apprehend really occur still the law must be respect though not always of the rigid impartiality that we might wish thou hast own the imperfection of human nature and it be not wonderful that its work should have flaw i complain not now of the usage which to I have become habit but i dread the untame fury of these ignorant and credulous man who have take a wild fancy that my presence might bring a curse upon the bark there be accidental situation which contain more healthful moral than can be draw from a thousand ingenious and plausible homily and in which fact in they naked simplicity be far more eloquent than any meaning that can be convey by word such be the case with this meek and unexpected appeal of balthazar all who hear he see he situation under very different color from those in which it would have be regard have the subject present itself under ordinary circumstance a common and painful sentiment attest strongly against the oppression that have give birth to he wrong and the good melchior de willade himself wonder how a case of this striking injustice could have arise under the law of berne chapter vi methought i see a thousand fearful wreck a thousand man that fish gnaw upon wedge of gold great anchor heap of pearl inestimable stone unvalued jewel all scatter in the bottom of the sea _ richard iii _ the flit twilight be now on the wane and the shades of evening be gather fast over the deep basin of the lake the figure of maso as he continue to pace he elevated platform be draw dark and distinct against the southern sky in which some of the last ray of the sun still linger but object on both shore be get to be confound with the shapeless mass of the mountain here and there a pale star peep out though most of the vault that stretch across the confine horizon be shut in by dusky cloud a streak of dull unnatural light be see in the quarter which lay above the meadow of the rhone and nearly in a direction with the peak of mont blanc which though not visible from this portion of the leman be know to lie behind the rampart of savoy like a monarch of the hill entrench in he citadel of rock and ice the change the lateness of the hour and the unpleasant reflection leave by the short dialogue with balthazar produce a strong and common desire to see the end of a navigation that be begin to be irksome those object which have lately yield so much and so pure a delight be now get to be black and menacing and the very sublimity of the scale on which nature have here throw together she element be a additional source of uncertainty and alarm those fairy-like softly-delineated natural arabesque which have so lately be dwell upon with rapture be now convert into dreary crag that seem to beetle above the helpless bark give unpleasant admonition of the savage and inhospitable property of they iron-bound basis which be know to prove destructive to all who be cast against they while the element be in disorder these change in the character of the scene which in some respects begin to take the aspect of omen be uneasily witness by all in the stern of the bark though the careless laughter the rude joke and the noisy cry which from time to time arise on the forecastle sufficiently show that the careless spirit it hold be still indulge in the coarse enjoyment most suit to they habit one individual however be see steal from the crowd and establish himself on the pile of freight as if he have a mind more addict to reflection and less disposed to unmeaning revelry than most of those whom he have just abandon this be the westphalian student who weary with amusement that be below the level of he acquirement and suddenly strike with the impose aspect of the lake and the mountain have steal apart to muse on he distant home and the being most dear to he under a excitement that suit those morbid sensibility which he have long encourage by a very subtle metaphysical system of philosophy until now maso have pace he lofty post with he eye fix chiefly on the heaven in the direction of mont blanc occasionally turn it however over the motionless bulk of the bark but when the student place himself across he path he stop and smile at the abstracted air and rivet regard with which the youth gaze at a star art thou a astronomer that thou lookest so closely at yonder shine world demand il maledetto with the superiority that the mariner afloat be wont successfully to assume over the unhappy wight of a landsman who be very liable to admit he own impotency on the novel and dangerous element : -- the astrologer himself would not study it more deeply this be the hour agree upon between I and one that i love to bring the unseen principle of we spirit together by commune through its medium i have hear of such means of intercourse dost see more than other by reason of such a assistant i see the object which be gaze upon at this moment by kind blue eye that have often look upon I in affection when we be in a strange land and in a fearful situation such a communion have its pleasure maso lay he hand upon the shoulder of the student which he press with the force of a vice thou art right he say moodily make the most of thy friendship and if there be any that love thee tighten the knot by all the means thou hast none know the curse of be desert in this selfish and cruel battle of interest better than i be not ashamed of thy star but gaze at it till thy eye-string crack see the bright eye of she that love thee in its twinkle she constancy in its lustre and she melancholy in its sadness lose not the happy moment for there will soon be a dark curtain to shut out its view the westphalian be strike with the singular energy as well as with the poetry of the mariner and he distrust the obvious allusion to the cloud which be in fact fast cover the vault above they head dost thou like the night he demand turn from he star in doubt it might be fairer this be a wild region and you cold swiss lake sometimes become too hot for the stoutest seaman 's heart gaze at thy star young man while thou mayest and bethink thee of the maiden thou lovest and of all she kindness we be on a crazy water and pleasant thought should not be lightly throw away maso walk away leave the student alarmed uneasy at he know not what and yet bent with childish eagerness on regard the little luminary that occasionally be still see wading among volume of vapor at this instant a shout of unmeaning clamorous merriment arise on the forecastle il maledetto do not remain any longer on the pile but abandon it to the new occupant he descend among the silent thoughtful party who be in possession of the clear space near the stern it be now so dark that some little attention be necessary to distinguish face even at trifling distance but by means of move among these privileged person with great coolness and seeming indifference he soon succeed in place himself near the genoese and the augustine signora he say in italian raise he cap to the former with the same marked respect as before though it be evidently no easy matter to impress he with the deference that the obscure usually feel for the great -- this be likely to prove a unfortunate end to a voyage that begin with so fair appearance i could wish that you eccellenza with all this noble and fair company be safely land in the town of vévey dost thou mean that we have cause to fear more than delay signora the mariner 's life be one of unequal chance : now he float in a lazy calm and presently he be toss between heaven and earth in a way to make the stoutest heart sick my knowledge of these water be not great but there be sign make themselves see in the sky here above the peak that lie in the direction of mont blanc that would trouble I be this we own clue but treacherous mediterranean what thinkest thou of this father a long residence in the alp must have give thee some insight into they storm the augustine have be grave and thoughtful from the moment that he cease to converse with balthazar he too have be strike with the omen and long use to study the change of the weather in a region where the element sometimes work they will on a scale commensurate with the grandeur of the mountain he thought have be anxiously recur to the comfort and security of some of those hospitable roof in the city to which they be bind and which be always ready to receive the clavier of st bernard in return for the service and self-denial of he brotherhood with maso i could wish we be safely land answer the good canon the intense heat that a day like this create in we valley and on the lake so weaken the sub-strata or foundation of air that the cold mass which collect around the glacier sometimes descend like avalanche from they height to fill the vacuum the shock be fearful even to those who meet it in the glen and among the rock but the plunge of such a column of air upon one of the lake be certain to be terrible and thou thinkest there be danger of one of these phenomenon at present i know not but i would we be house that unnatural light above and this deep tranquillity below which surpass a ordinary cairn have already drive I to my ave the reverend augustine speak like a book man and one who have pass he time up in he mountain-convent in study and reflection rejoin maso whereas the reason i have to offer savor more of the seaman 's practice a calm like this will be follow sooner or later by a commotion in the atmosphere i like not the absence of the breeze from the land on which baptiste count so surely and take that symptom with the sign of yonder hot sky i look soon to see this extraordinary quiet displaced by some violent struggle among the wind nettuno too my faithful dog have give notice by the manner in which he snuff the air that we be not to pass the night in this motionless condition i have hope ere this to be quietly in we haven what mean yonder bright light be it a star in the heaven or do it merely lie against the side of the huge mountain there shine old roger de blonay cry the baron heartily he know of we be in the bark and he have fire he beacon that we may steer by its light the conjecture seem probable for while the day remain the castle of blonay seat on the bosom of the mountain that shelter vévey to the north-east have be plainly visible it have be much admire a please object in a view that be so richly stud with hamlet and castle and adelheid have point it out to sigismund as the immediate goal of she journey the lord of blonay be apprize of the intended visit nothing be more probable than that he a old and try friend of melchior de willading 's should show this sign of impatience partly in compliment to those whom he expect and partly as a signal that might be really useful to those who navigate the leman in a night that threaten so much murky obscurity the signor grimaldus rightly deem the circumstance grave and call to he he friend and sigismund he communicate the apprehension of the monk and maso a braver man than melchior de willading do not dwell in all switzerland but he do not hear the gloomy prediction of the genoese without shake in every limb my poor enfeebled adelheid he say yield to a father 's tenderness : what will become of this frail plant if expose to a tempest in a unsheltered bark she will be with she father and with she father 's friend answer the maiden herself for the narrow limit to which they be necessarily confine and the sudden burst of feeling in the parent which have render he incautious in pitch he voice make she the mistress of the cause of alarm i have hear enough of what the good father xavier and this mariner have say to know that we be in a situation that might be better but be i not with try friend i know already what the herr sigismund can do in behalf of my life and come what may we have all a beneficent guardian in one who will not leave any of we to perish without remember we be he child this girl shame we all say the signor grimaldus but it be often thus with these fragile being who rise the firmest and noblest in moment when prouder man begin to despair they put they trust in god who be a prop to sustain even those who be feebler than we gentle adel hold but we will not exaggerate the cause of apprehension which after all may pass away like many other threatening danger and leave we hour of felicitation and laughter in return for a few minute of fright say rather of thanksgiving observe the clavier for the aspect of the heaven be get to be fearfully solemn thou who art a mariner -- hast thou nothing to suggest we have the simple expedient of we sweep father but after neglect they use so long it be now too late to have recourse to they we could not reach vévey by such means with this bark load to the water 's edge before the night would change and the water once fairly in motion they could not be use at all but we have we sail put in the genoese they at least may do we good service when the wind shall come maso shake he head but he make no answer after a brief pause in which he seem to study the heaven still more closely he go to the spot where the patron yet lay lose in sleep and shake he rudely -- ho baptiste awake there be need here of thy counsel and of thy command the drowsy owner of the bark rub he eye and slowly regain the use of he faculty there be not a breath of wind he mutter why didst awake I maso -- one that have lead thy life should know that sleep be sweet to those who toil ay ` tis they advantage over the pampered and idle look at the heaven man and let we know what thou thinkest of they appearance be there the stuff in thy winkelry to ride out a storm like this we may have to encounter thou talkest like a foolish quean that have be frighten by the fluttering of she own poultry the lake be never more calm or the bark in greater safety dost see yonder bright light here over the tower of thy vévey church ay ` tis a gallant star and a fair sign for the mariner fool ` tis a hot flame in roger de blonay 's beacon they begin to see that we be in danger on the shore and they cast out they signal to give we notice to be active they think we be-stirring ourselves like stout man and those use to the water while in truth we be as undisturbed as if the bark be a rock that might laugh at the leman and its wave the man be benumb continued maso turn away towards the anxious listener he will not see that which be get to be but too plain to all the other in he vessel another idle and general laugh from the forecastle come to contradict this opinion of maso 's and to prove how easy it be for the ignorant to exist in security even on the brink of destruction this be the moment when nature give the first of those signal that be intelligible to vulgar capacity the whole vault of the heaven be now veil with the exception of the spot so often name which lay nearly above the brawl torrent of the rhone this fiery opening resemble a window admit of fearful glimpse into the dreadful preparation that be make up among the higher peak of the alp a flash of red quiver light be emit and a distant rumble rush that be not thunder but rather resemble the wheeling of a thousand squadron into line follow the flash the forecastle be desert to a man and the hillock of freight be again darkly see people with crouch human form just then the bark which have so long lain in a state of complete rest slowly and heavily raise its bow as if labor under its great and unusual burthen while a sluggish swell pass beneath its entire length lift the whole mass foot by foot and pass away by the stern to cast itself on the shore of vaud ` tis madness to waste the precious moment longer say maso hurriedly on whom this plain and intelligent hint be not lose signor we must be bold and prompt or we shall be overtake by the tempest unprepared i speak not for myself since by the aid of this faithful dog and favor by my own arm i have always the shore for a hope but there be one in the bark i would wish to save even at some hazard to myself baptiste be unnerved by fear and we must act for we self or perish what wouldest thou demand the signor grimaldus he that can proclaim the danger should have some expedient to divert it more timely exertion would have give we the resource of ordinary means but like those who die in they sin we have foolishly waste most precious minute we must lighten the bark though it cost the whole of she freight a cry from nicklaus wagner announce that the spirit of avarice be still active as ever in he bosom even baptiste who have lose all he dogmatism and he disposition to command under the impose omen which have now make themselves apparent even to he loudly join in the protest against this waste of property it be rare that any sudden and extreme proposal like this of maso 's meet with a quick echo in the judgment of those to whom the necessity be unexpectedly present the danger do not seem sufficiently imminent to have recourse to a expedient so decide and though startle and arouse the untame spirit of those who crowd the menaced pile be rather in a state of uneasiness than of that fierce excitement to which they be so capable of be work and which be in some degree necessary to induce even they thriftless and destitute as they be to be the agent of effect so great a destruction of properly the project of the cool and calculate maso would therefore have fail entirely but for another wheeling of those airy squadron and a second wave which lift the groan bark until the loosen yard swing creak above they head the canvass flap too in the darkness like some huge bird of prey flutter its feather previously to take wing holy and just ruler of the land and the sea exclaim the augustine remember thy repentant child and have we at this awful moment in thy omnipotent protection the wind be come down and even the dumb lake send we the signal to be ready shout maso overboard with the freight if ye would live a sudden heavy plunge into the water prove that the mariner be in earnest notwithstanding the impose and awful sign with which they be surround every individual of the nameless herd bethought he of the puck that contain he own scanty worldly effect and there be a general and quick movement with a view to secure they as each man succeed in effect he own object he be lead away by that community of feeling which rule a multitude the common rush be believe to be with a view to succor maso though each man secretly know the falsity of the impression as respect he own particular case and box after box begin to tumble into the water as new and eager recruit lend themselves to the task the impulse be quickly impart from one to another until even young sigismund be active in the work on these slight accident do the most important result depend when the hot impulse that govern the mass obtain the ascendant it be not to be suppose that either baptiste or nicklaus wagner witness the waste of they joint effect with total indifference so far from this each use every exertion in he power to prevent it not only by he voice but with he hand one menace the law -- the other threaten maso with condign punishment for he interference with a patron 's rights and duty but they remonstrance be utter to inattentive ear maso know himself to be irresponsible by situation for it be not a easy matter to bring he within the grasp of the authority and as for the other most of they be far too insignificant to feel much apprehension for a reparation that would be most likely if it fall at all to fall on those who be more able to bear it sigismund alone exert himself under a sense of he liability but he work for one that be far dearer to he than gold and little do he bethink he of any other consequence than those which might befall the precious life of adelheid de willade the meager package of the common passenger have be throw in a place of safety with the sort of unreflecting instinct with which we take care of we limb when in danger this timely precaution permit each to work with a zeal that find no drawback in personal interest and the effect be in proportion a hundred hand be busy and nearly as many throbbing heart lend they impulse to the accomplishment of the one important object baptiste and he people aid by laborer of the port have pass a entire day in heap that pile on the deck of the winkelry which be now crumble to piece with a rapidity that seem ally to magic the patron and nicklaus wagner bawl themselves hoarse with utter useless threat and deprecation for by this time the laborer in the work of destruction have receive some such impetus as the rolling stone acquire by the increase momentum of its descent package box bale and everything that come to hand be hurl into the water frantically and without other thought than of the necessity of lighten the groan bark of its burthen the agitation of the lake too be regularly increase wave follow wave in a manner to cause the vessel to pitch heavily as it rise upon the come or sink with the recede swell at length a shout announce that in one portion of the pile the deck be attain the work now proceed with greater security to those engage for hitherto the motion of the bark and the unequal footing frequently render they situation in the darkness and confusion to the last degree hazardous maso now abandon he own active agency in the toil for no sooner do he see the other fairly and zealously enlist in the undertaking than he cease he personal effort to give those direction which come from one accustomed to the occupation be far more valuable than any service that could be derive from a single arm thou art know to I signor maso say baptiste hoarse with he impotent effort to restrain the torrent and thou shalt answer for this as well as for other of thy crime so soon as we reach the haven of vévey dotard thou would ` st carry thyself and all with thee by thy narrowness of spirit to a port from which when it be once enter none ever sail again it lieth between ye both rejoin nicklaus wagner thou art not less to blame than these madman baptiste hadst thou leave the town at the hour name in we condition this danger could not have overtake we be i a god to command the wind i would that i have never see thee or thy cheese or that thou wouldst relieve I of thy presence and go after they into the lake this come of sleep on duty nay i know not but that a proper use of the oar would still bring we in in safety and without necessary harm to the property of any noble baron de willade here may be occasion for you testimony and as a citizen of berne i pray you to heed well the circumstance baptiste be not in a humor to bear these merit reproach and he rejoin upon the aggrieved nicklaus in a manner that would speedily have bring they ill-timed wrangle to a issue have not maso pass rudely between they shove they asunder with the sinew of a giant this repulse serve to keep the peace for the moment but the wordy war continue with so much acrimony and with so many unmeasured term that adelheid and she maid pale and terror-struck by the surrounding scene as they be gladly shut they ear to exclude epithet of such bitterness and menace that they curdle the blood maso pass on among the workman when he have interpose between the disputant he give he order with perfect self-possession though he understanding eye perceive that instead of magnify the danger he have himself not fully anticipate its extent the rolling of the wave be now incessant and the quick wash rush of the water a sound familiar to the seaman announce that they have become so large that they summit break send they lighter foam ahead there be symptom too which prove that they situation be understand by those on the land light be flash along the strand near vévey and it be not difficult to detect even at the distance at which they lay the evidence of a strong feeling among the people of the town i doubt not that we have be see say melchior de willading and that we friend be busy in devise means to aid we roger de blonay be not a man to see we perish without a effort nor would the worthy bailiff peter hofmeister be idle know that a brother of the bürgerschaft and old school associate have need of he assistance none can come to we without run a equal risk with ourselves answer the genoese it be better that we should be leave to we own exertion i like the coolness of this unknown mariner and i put my faith in god a new shout proclaim that the deck have be gain on the other side of the bark much the greater part of the deck-load have now irretrievably disappear and the movement of the relieved vessel be more lively and sane maso call to he one or two of the regular crew and together they roll up the canvass in a manner peculiar to the latine rig for a breath of hot air the first of any sort that have be feel for many hour pass athwart the bark this duty be perform as canvass be know to be furl at need but it be do securely maso then go among the laborer again encourage they with he voice and direct they effort with he counsel thou art not equal to thy task he say address one who be vainly endeavor to roll a bale to the side of the vessel a little apart from the rest of the busy crowd thou wilt do better to assist the other than to waste thy force here i feel the strength to remove a mountain do we not work for we life the mariner bent forward and look into the other 's face these frantic and ill-directed effort come from the westphalian student thy star have disappear he rejoin smile -- for maso have smile in scene far more impose than even that with which he be now surround she gaze at it still she think of one that love she who be journey far from the fatherland hold since thou wilt have it so i will help thee to cast this bale into the water place thine arm thus a ounce of well-directed force be worth a pound that act against itself stoop together they united strength do that which have baffle the single effort of the scholar the package roll to the gangway and the german frenzied with excitement shout aloud the bark lurch and the bale go over the side as if the lifeless mass be suddenly possess with the desire to perform the evolution which its inert weight have so long resist maso recover he footing which have be derange by the unexpected movement with a seaman 's dexterity but he companion be no longer at he side kneel on the gangway he perceive the dark bale disappear in the element with the foot of the westphalian drag after he bent forward to grasp the rise body but it never return to the surface be entangled in the cord or what be equally probable retain by the frantic grasp of the student whose mind have yield to the awful character of the night the life of il maledetto have be one of great vicissitude and peril he have often see man pass suddenly into the other state of existence and have be calm himself amid the cry the groan and what be far more appalling the execration of the die but never before have he witness so brief and silent a end for more than a minute he hang suspend over the dark and working water expect to see the student return and when hope be reluctantly abandon he arise to he foot a startled and admonished man still discretion do not desert he he see the uselessness and even the danger of distract the attention of the workman and the ill-fated scholar be permit to pass away without a word of regret or a comment on he fate none know of he loss but the wary mariner nor be he person miss by any of those who have spend the day in he company but she to whom he hud plighted he faith on the bank of the elbe long gaze at that pale star and weep in bitterness that she feminine constancy meet with no return she true affection long outlive they object for he image be deeply enshrine in a warm female heart day week month and year pass for she in the waste cheerlessness of hope defer but the dark leman never give up its secret and he to whom she lover 's fate alone be know little bethought he of a accident which if not forget be but one of many similar frightful incident in he eventful career maso re-appear among the crowd with the force composure of one who well know that authority be most efficient when most calm the command of the vessel be now virtually with he baptiste enervate by the extraordinary crisis and choke with passion be utterly incapable of give a distinct or a useful order it be fortunate for those in the bark that the substitute be so good for more fearful sign never impend over the leman than those which darken the hour we have necessarily consume much time in relate these event the pen not equal the activity of the thought twenty minute however have not pass since the tranquillity of the lake be first disturbed and so great have be the exertion of those in the winkelry that the time appear to be shorter but though it have be so well employ neither have the power of the air be idle the unnatural opening in the heaven be shut and at short interval those fearful wheeling of the aërial squadron be draw nearer thrice have fitful breathing of warm air pass over the bark and occasionally as she plunge into a sea that be heavier than common the face of those on board be cool as it might be with some huge fan these be no more however than sudden change in the atmosphere of which vein be displace by the distant struggle between the heated air of the lake and that which have be chill on the glacier or they be the still more simple result of the violent agitation of the vessel the deep darkness which shut in the vault give to the embedded leman the appearance of a gloomy liquid glen contribute to the awful sublimity of the night the rampart of savoy be barely distinguishable from the fly cloud have the appearance of black wall seemingly within reach of the hand while the more varied and softer côtes of vaud lay a indefinable and sombre mass less menacing it be true but equally confused and unattainable still the beacon blaze in the grate of old roger de blonay and flare torch glide along the strand the shore seem alive with human being able as themselves to appreciate and to feel for they situation the deck be now clear and the traveller be collect in a group between the mast pippo have lose all he pleasantry under the dread sign of the hour and conrad tremble with superstition and terror be free from hypocrisy they and those with they discourse on they chance on the nature of the risk they run and on its probable cause i see no image of marium nor even a pitiful lamp to any of the bless in this accursed bark say the juggler after several have hazard they quaint and peculiar opinion let the patron come forth and answer for he negligence the passenger be about equally divide between those who dissent from and those who worship with rome this proposal therefore meet with a mixed reception the latter protest against the neglect while the former equally under the influence of abject fear be loud in declare that the idolatry itself might cost they all they life the curse of heaven alight on the evil tongue that first utter the think mutter the tremble pippo between he tooth too prudent to fly openly in the face of so strong a opposition and yet too credulous not to feel the omission in every nerve -- hast nothing by thee pious conrad that may avail a christian the pilgrim reach forth he hand with a rosary and cross the sacred emblem pass from mouth to mouth among the believer with a zeal little short of that they have manifest in unload the deck encourage by this sacrifice they call loudly upon baptiste to present himself confront with these unnurtured spirit the patron shake in every limb for between anger and abject fear he self-command have by this time absolutely desert he to the repeat appeal to procure a light that it might be place before a picture of the mother of god which conrad produce he object he protestant faith the impossibility of maintain the flame while the bark pitch so violently and the divide opinion of the passenger the catholic bethink they of the country and influence of maso and they loudly call upon he for the love of god to come and enforce they request but the mariner be occupy on the forecastle lower one anchor after another into the water passively assist by the people of the bark who wonder at a precaution so useless since no rope could reach the bottom even while they do not dare deny he order something be now say of the curse that have alight on the vessel in consequence of its patron 's intention to embark the headsman baptiste tremble to the skin of he crown and he blood creep with a superstitious awe dost think there can really be aught in this he ask with parched lip and a falter tongue all distinction of faith be lose in the general ridicule now the westphalian be go there be not a man among they to doubt that a navigation so accompany would be curse baptiste stammer mutter many incoherent sentence and finally in he impotency he permit the dangerous secret to escape he the intelligence that balthazar be among they produce a solemn and deep silence the fact however furnish as conclusive evidence of the cause of they peril to the mind of these untutored being as a mathematician could have receive from the happiest of he demonstration new light break in upon they and the ominous stillness be follow by a general demand for the patron to point out the man obey this order partly under the influence of a terror that be ally to he moral weakness and partly in bodily fear he shove the headsman forward substitute the person of the proscribed man for he own and profit by the occasion he steal out of the crowd when the herr müller or as he be now know and call balthazar be rudely push into the hand of these ferocious agent of superstition the apparent magnitude of the discovery induce a general and breathless pause like the treacherous calm that have so long reign upon the lake it be a precursor of a fearful and violent explosion little be say for the occasion be too ominous for a display of vulgar feeling but conrad pippo and one or two more silently raise the fancied offender in they arm and bear he desperately towards the side of the bark call on marium for the good of thy soul whisper the neapolitan with a strange mixture of christian zeal in the midst of all he ferocity the sound of word like these usually convey the idea of charity and love but notwithstanding this gleam of hope balthazar still find himself bear towards he fate on quit the throng that cluster together in a dense body between the mast baptiste encounter he old antagonist nicklaus wagner the fury which have so long be pent in he breast suddenly find vent and in the madness of the moment he strike he the stout bernese grapple he assailant and the struggle become fierce as that of brute scandalize by such a spectacle offend by the disrespect and ignorant of what else be pass near -- for the crowd have utter its resolution in the suppress voice of man determine -- the baron de willading and the signor grimaldus advance with dignity and firmness to prevent the shameful strife at this critical moment the voice of balthazar be hear above the roar of the come wind not call on marium as he have be admonish but appeal to the two old noble to save he sigismund spring forward like a lion at the cry but too late to reach those who be about to cast the headsman from the gangway he be just in time to catch the body by its garment when actually sailing in the air by a vast effort of strength its direction be divert instead of alight in the water balthazar encounter the angry combatant who drive back on the two noble force the whole four over the side of the bark into the water the struggle between the two body of air cease that on the surface of the lake yield to the avalanche from above and the tempest come howl upon the bark chapter vii -- and now the glee of the loud hill shake with they mountain-mirth byron it be necessary to recapitulate a little in order to connect event the sign of the hour have be gradually but progressively increase while the lake be unruffle a stillness so profound prevail that sound from the distant port such as the heavy fall of a oar or a laugh from the waterman have reach the ear of those in the winkelried bring with they the feeling of security and the strong charm of a calm at even to these succeed the gathering in the heaven and the roaring of the wind as they come rush down the side of the alp in they first descent into the basin of the leman as the sight grow useless except as it might study the dark omen of the impending vault the sense of hearing become doubly acute and it have be a powerful agent in heighten the vague but acute apprehension of the traveller the rush of the wind which at first be break at interval resemble the roar of a chimney-top in a gale have soon reach the fearful grandeur of those aërial wheeling of squadron to which we have more than once allude pass off in dread muttering that in the deep quiet of all other thing bear a close affinity to the rumble of a surf upon the sea-shore the surface of the lake be first break after one of these symptom and it be this infallible sign of a gale which have assure maso there be no time to lose this movement of the element in a calm be a common phenomenon on water that be much environ with elevated and irregular head-land and it be a certain proof that wind be on some distant portion of the sheet it occur frequently on the ocean too where the mariner be accustom to find a heavy sea setting in one direction the effect of some distant storm while the breeze around he be blow in its opposite it have be succeed by the single rolling swell like the outer circle of wave produce by drop a stone into the water and the regular and increase agitation of the lake until the element break as in a tempest and that seemingly of its own volition since not a breath of air be stir this last and formidable symptom of the force of the come gust however have now become so unequivocal that at the moment when the three traveller and the patron fall from she gangway the winkelry to use a seaman 's phrase be literally wallow in the trough of the sea a dull unnatural light precede the wind and notwithstanding the previous darkness the nature of the accident be fully apparent to all even the untame spirit that have just be bent upon so fierce a sacrifice to they superstitious dread utter cry of horror while the pierce shriek of adelheid sound in that fearful moment as if being of super-human attribute be ride in the gale the name of sigismund be hear too in one of those wild appeal that the frantic suffer to escape they in they despair but the interval between the plunge into the water and the swoop of the tempest be so short that to the sens of the traveller the whole seem the occurrence of the same teem moment maso have complete he work on the forecast have see that other provision which he have order be duly make and have reach the tiller just in time to witness and to understand all that occur adelheid and she female attendant be already lash to the principal mast and rope be give to the other around she as indispensable precaution for the deck of the bark now clear of every particle of its freight be as expose and as defenceless against the power of the wind as a naked heath such be the situation of the winkelry when the omen of the night change to they dread reality instinct in case of sudden and unusual danger must do the office of reason there be no necessity to warn the unthinking but panic-struck crowd to provide for they own safety for every man in the center of the barge throw he body flaon the deck and grasp the cord that maso have take care to provide for that purpose with the tenacity with which all who possess life cling to the means of existence the dog give beautiful proof of the secret and wonderful means that nature have impart to answer the end of they creation old uberto crouch cower and oppress with a sense of helplessness at the side of he master while the newfoundland follower of the mariner go leap from gangway to gangway snuff the heated air and bark wildly as if he would challenge the element to close for the strife a vast body of warm air have pass unheeded athwart the bark during the minute that precede the intended sacrifice of balthazar it be the forerunner of the hurricane which have chase it from the bed where it have be sleep since the warm and happy noon-tide ten thousand chariot at they speed could not have equal the rumble that succeed when the wind come boom over the lake as if too eager to permit anything within they fang to escape they bring with they a wild dull light which fill while it cloud the atmosphere and which it be scarcely fanciful to imagine have be hurry down in they vortex from those chill glacier where they have so long be condense they force for the present descent the wave be not increase but depress by the pressure of this atmospheric column though it take up hogshead of water from they crest scatter it in fine penetrate spray till the entire space between the heaven and the earth seem saturate with its particle the winkelried receive the shock at a moment when the lee-side of she broad deck be wallow in the trough and its weather be protrude on the summit of a swell the wind howl when it strike the pent limit as if anger at be thwart and there be a roar under the wide gangway resemble that of lion the reel vessel be raise in a manner to cause those or board to believe it about to be lift bodily from the water but the ceaseless rolling of the element restore the balance maso afterwards affirm that nothing but this accidental position which form a sort of lee prevent all in the bark from be sweep from the deck before the first gust of the hurricane sigismund have hear the heart-rending appeal of adelheid and notwithstanding the awful strife of the element and the fearful character of the night he alone breast the shock on he foot though aid by a rope and bow like a reed he herculean frame tremble under the shock in a way to render even he ability to resist seriously doubtful but the first blast expend he spring to the gangway and leap into the cauldron of the lake unhesitatingly and yet in the possession of all he faculty he be desperately bent on save a life so dear to adelheid or on die in the attempt maso have watch the crisis with a seaman 's eye a seaman 's resource and a seaman 's coolness he have not refuse to quit he foot but kneel on one knee he press the tiller down lash it and cling to the massive timber face the tempest with the steadiness of a water-god there be sublimity in the intelligence deliberation and calculate skill with which this solitary unknown and nearly hopeless mariner obey he professional instinct in that fearful concussion of the element which loosen from every restraint now appear abandon to they own wild and fierce will he throw aside he cap push forward he thick but streaming lock as veil to protect he eye and watch the first encounter of the wind as the wary but sullen lion keep he gaze on the hostile elephant a grim smile steal across he feature when he feel the vessel settle again into its watery bed after that breathless moment in which there have be reason to fear it might actually be lift from its proper element then the precaution which have seem so useless and incomprehensible to other come in play the bark make a fearful whirl from the spot where it have so long lain yield to the touch of the gust like a vane turn on its pivot while the water gurgle several streak on deck but the cable be no sooner taut than the numerous anchor resist and bring the bark head to wind maso feel the yielding of the vessel 's stern as she swing furiously round and he cheer aloud the tremble of the timber the dashing against the pointed beak and that high jet of water which shoot up over the bow and fall heavily on the forecastle wash aft in a flood be so many evidence that the cable be true advance from he post with some such dignity as a master of fence display in the exercise of he art he shout for he dog nettuno -- nettuno -- where art thou brave nettuno the faithful animal be whine near he unheard in that war of the element he wait only for this encouragement to act no sooner be he master 's voice hear than bark bravely he snuff the gale dash to the side of the vessel and leap into the boil lake when melchior de willading and he friend return to the surface after they plunge it be like man make they appearance in a world abandon to the infernal humor of the fiend of darkness the reader will understand it be at the instant of the swoop of the wind that have just be detail for what we have take so many page to describe in word scarce need a minute of time in the accomplishment maso knelt on the verge of the gangway sustain himself by pass a arm around a shroud and bend forward he gaze into the cauldron of the lake with ache eye once or twice he think he hear the stifled breathing of one who struggle with the rage water but in that roar of the wind it be easy to be deceive he shout encouragement to he dog however and gather a small rope rapidly he make a heave coil of one of its end this he cast far from he with a peculiar swing and dexterity hauling-in and repeat the experiment steadily and with unwearied industry the rope be necessarily throw at hazard for the misty light prevent more than it aid vision and the howling of the power of the air fill he ear with sound that resemble the laugh of devil in the cultivation of the youthful manly exercise neither of the old noble have neglect the useful skill of be able to buffet with the wave but both possess what be far better in such a strait than the knowledge of a swimmer in that self-command and coolness in emergency which they be apt to acquire who pass they time in encounter the hazard and in overcome the difficulty of war each retain a sufficiency of recollection therefore on come to the surface to understand he situation and not to increase the danger by the ill-directed and frantic effort that usually drown the frightened the case be sufficiently desperate at the best without the additional risk of distraction for the bark have already drift to some unseen spot that as respects they be quite unattainable in this uncertainty it would have be madness to steer amid the waste of water as likely to go wrong as right and they limit they effort to mutual support and encouragement place they trust in god not so with sigismund to he the roaring tempest be mute the boiling and hissing lake have no horror and he have plunge into the fathomless leman as recklessly as he could have leap to land the shriek the sigismund oh sigismund of adelheid be in he ear and she cry of anguish thrill on every nerve the athletic young swiss be a practice and expert swimmer or it be improbable that even these strong impulse could have overcome the instinct of self-preservation in a tranquil basin it would have be no extraordinary or unusual feat for he to conquer the distance between the winkelry and the shore of vaud but like all the other on cast himself into the water he be oblige to shape he course at random and this too amid such a drive spray as render even respiration difficult as have be say the wave be compress into they bed rather than augment by the wind but have it be otherwise the mere heaving and settling of the element while it obstruct he speed offer a support rather than a obstacle to the practice swimmer notwithstanding all these advantage the strength of he impulse and the numberless occasion on which he have breast the surge of the mediterranean sigismund on recover from he plunge feel the fearful chance of the risk he run as the stern soldier meet the hazard of battle in which he know if there be victory there be also death he dash the troubled water aside though he swim blindly and each stroke urge he farther from the bark he only hope of safety he be between dark rolling mound and on rise to they summit a hurricane of mist make he glad to sink again within a similar shelter the break crest of the wave which be glance off in foam also give he great annoyance for such be they force that more than once he be hurl helpless as a log before they still he swim boldly and with strength nature have gifted he with more than the usual physical energy of man but uncertain in he course unable to see the length of he own body and press hard upon by the wind even the spirit of sigismund steinbach could not long withstand so many adverse circumstance he have already turn waver in purpose think to catch a glimpse of the bark in the direction he have come when a dark mass float immediately before he eye and he feel the cold clammy nose of the dog scent about he face the admirable instinct or we might better say the excellent training of nettuno tell he that he service be not need here and bark with wild delight as if in mockery of the infernal din of the tempest he sheer aside and swim swiftly on a thought flash like lightning on the brain of sigismund he best hope be in the inexplicable faculty of this animal throw forward a arm he seize the bushy tail of the dog and suffer himself to be drag ahead he know not whither though he second the movement with he own exertion another bark proclaim that the experiment be successful and voice rise as it be from the water close at hand announce the proximity of human being the brunt of the hurricane be past and the wash of the wave which have be still by the roar and the revelry of the wind again become audible the strength of the two struggle old man be sink fast the signor grimaldus have thus far generously sustain he friend who be less expert than himself in the water and he continue to cheer he with a hope he do not feel himself nobly refuse to the last to separate they fortune how dost find thyself old melchior he ask cheer thee friend -- i think there be succor at hand the water gurgle at the mouth of the baron who be near the gasp ` tis late -- bless thee dearest gaetano -- god be with my child -- my adelheid -- poor adelheid the utterance of this precious name under a father 's agony of spirit most probably save he life the sinewy arm of sigismund direct by the word grasp he dress and he feel at once that a new and preserve power have interpose between he and the cavern of the lake it be time for the water have cover the face of the fail baron ere the muscular arm of the youth come to perform its charitable office yield thee to the dog signora say sigismund clear he mouth of water to speak calmly once assure of he own burthen trust to he sagacity and -- god keep we in mind -- all may yet be well the signor grimaldus retain sufficient presence of mind to follow this advice and it be probably quite as fortunate that he friend have so far lose he consciousness as to become a unresisting burthen in the hand of sigismund nettuno -- gallant nettuno -- sweep past they on the gale for the first time the partial hushing of the wind permit the clear call of maso to reach so far the sound direct the effort of sigismund though the dog have swim steadily away the moment he have the genoese in he gripe and with a certainty of manner that show he be at no loss for a direction but sigismund have tax he power too far he who could have buffet a ordinary sea for hour be now completely exhaust by the unwonted exertion the deadening influence of the tempest and the log-like weight of he burthen he would not desert the father of adelheid and yet each fainting and useless stroke tell he to despair the dog have already disappear in the darkness and he be even uncertain again of the true position of the bark he pray in agony for a single glimpse of the rock mast and yard or to catch one syllable of the cheer voice of maso but in both he wish be vain in place of the former he have naught but the veil misty light that have come on with the hurricane and instead of the latter he ear be fill with the wash of the wave and the roar of the gust the blast now descend to the surface of the lake and now go whirling and swell upward in a way to lead the listener to fancy that the viewless wind might for once be see for a single painful instant in one of those disheartening moment of despair that will come over the stoutest he hand be about to relinquish its hold of the baron and to make the last natural struggle for life but that fair and modest picture of maiden loveliness and truth which have so long haunt he waking hour and adorn he night-dream interpose to prevent the act after this brief and fleeting weakness the young man seem endowed with new energy he swim stronger and with greater apparent advantage than before nettuno -- gallant nettuno -- again drive over he bring with it the chill certainty that turn from he course by the rolling of the water he have throw away these desperate effort by take a direction which lead he from the bark while there be the smallest appearance of success no difficulty of whatever magnitude could entirely extinguish hope but when the dire conviction that he have be actually aid instead of diminish the danger press upon sigismund he abandon he effort the most he endeavor or hope to achieve be to keep he own head and that of he companion above the fatal element while he answer the cry of maso with a shout of despair nettuno -- gallant nettuno -- again fly past on the gale this cry might have be a answer or it might merely be the italian encourage he dog to bear on the body with which it be already load sigismund utter a shout which he feel must be the last he struggle desperately but in vain the world and its allurement be vanish from he thought when a dark line whirl over he and fall thrashing upon the very wave which cover he face a instinctive grasp catch it and the young soldier feel himself impel ahead he have seize the rope which the mariner have not cease to throw as the fisherman cast he line and he be at the side of the bark before he confused faculty enable he to understand the means employ for he rescue maso take a hasty turn with the rope and stoop forward favor by a roll of the vessel he draw the baron de willade upon deck watch he time he repeat the experiment always with admirable coolness and dexterity place sigismund also in safety the former be immediately drag senseless to the center of the bark where he receive those attention that have just be eagerly offer to the signior grimaldus and with the same happy result but sigismund motion all away from himself know that they care be need elsewhere he stagger forward a few pace and then yield to a complete exhaustion of he power he fall at full length on the wet plank he long lay panting speechless and unable to move with a sense of death on he frame nettuno gallant gallant nettuno -- shout the indefatigable maso still at he post on the gangway whence he cast he rope with unchanging perseverance the fitful wind which have already play so many fierce antic that eventful night sensibly lull and give one or two sigh as if regret that they be about to be curb again by that almighty master from whose benevolent hand they have so furtively escape as suddenly cease blow the yard creak swing loosely above the crowded deck and the dull wash of water fill the ear to these diminish sound be to be add the bark of the dog who be still abroad in the darkness and a struggle noise like the broken and smother attempt of human voice although the time appear a age to all who await the result scarcely five minute have elapse since the accident occur and the hurricane have reach they there be still hope therefore for those who yet remain in the water maso feel the eagerness of one who have already be successful beyond he hope and in he desire to catch some guide signal he lean forward till the rolling lake wash into he face ha gallant -- gallant nettuno man certainly speak and that near he but the sound resemble word utter beneath a cover the wind whistle too though but for a moment and then it seem to sail upward into the dark vault of the heaven nettuno bark audibly and he master answer with another shout for the sympathy of man in he kind be inextinguishable my brave my noble nettuno the stillness be now impose and maso hear the dog growl this ill-omened signal be undeniably follow by smother voice the latter become clearer as if the mock wind be willing that a sad exhibition of human frailty should be know or what be more probable violent passion have awaken stronger power of speech this much the mariner understand loosen thy grasp accursed baptiste wretch loosen thine own be god naught with thee why dost throttle so infernal nicklaus thou wilt die damned thou chokest -- villain -- pardon -- pardon he hear no more the merciful element interpose to drown the appalling strife once or twice the dog howl but the tempest come across the leman again in its might as if the short pause have be make merely to take breath the wind take a new direction and the bark still hold by its anchor swing wide off from its former position tend in towards the mountain of savoy during the first burst of this new blast even maso be glad to crouch to the deck for million of infinitely fine particle be lift from the lake and drive on with the atmosphere with a violence to take away he breath the danger of be sweep before the furious tide of the drive element be also a accident not impossible when the lull return no exertion of he faculty could catch a single sound foreign to the proper character of the scene such as the plash of the water and the creaking of the long swinging yard the mariner now feel a deep concern for he dog he call to he until he grow hoarse but fruitlessly the change of position with the constant and vary drift of the vessel have carry they beyond the reach of the human voice more time be expend in summon nettuno gallant nettuno than have be consume in the passage of all the event which it have be necessary to we object to relate so minutely and always with the same want of success the mind of maso be pitch to a degree far above the opinion and habit of those with whom he life bring he ordinarily in contact but as even fine gold will become tarnish by exposure to impure air he have not entirely escape the habitual weakness of the italian of he class when he find that no cry could recall he faithful companion he throw himself upon the deck in a paroxysm of passion tear he hair and weep audibly nettuno my brave my faithful nettuno he say what be all these to I without thee thou alone lovedst I -- thou alone hast pass with I through fair and foul -- through good and evil without change or wish for another master when the pretended friend have be false thou hast remain faithful when other be sycophant thou wert never a flatterer strike with this singular exhibition of sorrow the good augustine who until now like all the other have be look to he own safety or employ in restore the exhaust take advantage of the favorable change in the weather and advance with the language of consolation thou hast save all we life bold mariner he say and there be those in the bark who will know how to reward thy courage and skill forget then thy dog and indulge in a grateful heart to marium and the saint that they have be we friend and thine in this exceed jeopardy father i have eat with the animal -- sleep with the animal -- fight swum and make merry with he and i could now drown with he what be thy noble and they gold to I without my dog the gallant brute will die the death of despair swimming about in search of the bark in the midst of the darkness until even one of he high breed and courage must suffer he heart to burst christian have be call into the dread presence unconfessed and unshrived to-night and we should bethink we of they soul rather than indulge in this grief in behalf of one that however faithful end but a unreasoning and irresponsible existence all this be throw away upon maso who cross himself habitually at the allusion to the drowned but who do not the less bewail the loss of he dog whom he seem to love like the affection that david bear for jonathan with a love surpass that of woman perceive that he counsel be useless the good augustine turn away to knee and offer up he own orison of gratitude and to bethink he of the dead nettuno _ povera carissima bestia _ continue maso whither art thou swimming in this infernal quarrel between the air and water would i be with thee dog no mortal shall ever share the love i bear thee _ povero nettuno _ -- i will never take another to my heart like thee the outbreaking of maso 's grief be sudden and it be brief in its duration in this respect it might be liken to the hurricane that have just pass excessive violence in both case appear to bring its own remedy for the irregular fitful gust from the mountain have already cease and be succeed by a strong but steady gale from the north and the sorrow of maso soon end its characteristic plaint to take a more continued and even character during the whole of the foregoing scene the common passenger have crouch to the deck partly in stupor partly in superstitious dread and much of the time from a positive inability to move without incur the risk of be drive from the defenceless vessel into the lake but as the wind diminish in force and the motion of the bark become more regular they rally they sens like man who have be in a trance and one by one they rise to they foot about this time adelheid hear the sound of she father 's voice blessing she care and console she sorrow the north wind blow away the canopy of cloud and the star shine upon the angry leman bring with they some such promise of divine aid as the pillar of fire afford to the israelite in they passage of the red sea such a evidence of return peace bring renew confidence all in the bark passenger as well as crew take courage at the benignant sign while adelheid weep in gratitude and joy over the gray hair of she father maso have now obtain complete command of the winkelry as much by the necessity of the case as by the unrivalled skill and courage he have manifest during the fearful minute of they extreme jeopardy no sooner do he succeed in stay he own grief than he call the people about he and issue he order for the new measure that have become necessary all who have ever be subject to they influence know that there be nothing more uncertain than the wind they fickleness have pass into a proverb but they inconstancy as well as they power from the fan air to the destructive tornado be to be trace to cause that be sufficiently clear though hide in they nature from the calculation of we forethought the tempest of the night be owe to the simple fact that a condensed and chill column of the mountain have press upon the heated substratum of the lake and the latter after a long resistance suddenly find vent for its escape have be oblige to let in the cataract from above as in all extraordinary effort whether physical or moral reaction would seem to be a consequence of excessive action the current of air push beyond they proper limit be now set back again like a tide on its reflux this cause produce the northern gale that succeed the hurricane the wind that come from off the shore of vaud be steady and fresh the bark of the leman be not construct for beat to windward and it might even have be question whether the winkelry would have bear she canvass against so heavy a breeze maso however appear to understand himself thoroughly and as he have acquire the influence which hardihood and skill be sure to obtain over doubt and timidity in situation of hazard he be obey by all on board with submission if not with zeal no more be hear of the headsman or of he suppose agency in the storm and as he prudently keep himself in the back-ground so as not to endanger a revival of the superstition of he enemy he seem entirely forget the business of get the anchor occupy a considerable time for maso refuse now there exist no necessity for the sacrifice to permit a yarn to be cut but release from this hold on the water the bark whirl away and be soon drive before the wind the mariner be at the helm and cause the head-sail to be loosen he steer directly for the rock of savoy this maneuver excited disagreeable suspicion in the mind of several on board for the lawless character of they pilot have be more than suspect in the course of they short acquaintance and the coast towards which they be furiously rush know to be iron-bound and in such a gale fatal to all who come rudely upon its rock half-an-hour remove they apprehension when near enough to the mountain to feel they deadening influence on the gale the natural effect of the eddy form by they resistance to the current he luffed-to and set he main-sail relieve by this wise precaution the winkelry now wear she canvass gallantly and she dash along the shore of savoy with a foam beak shooting past ravine valley glen and hamlet as if sailing in air in less than a hour st gingoulph or the village through which the divide line between the territory of switzerland and those of the king of sardinium pass be abeam and the excellent calculation of the sagacious maso become still more apparent he have foresee another shift of wind as the consequence of all this poise and counterpoise and he be here meet by the true breeze of the night the last current come out of the gorge of the valai sullen strong and hoarse bring he however fairly to windward of he port the winkelried be cast in season and when the gale strike she anew she canvass draw fairly and she walk out from beneath the mountain into the broad lake like a swan obey its instinct the passage across the width of the leman in that horn of the crescent and in such a breeze require rather more than a hour this time be occupy among the common herd in self-felicitation and in those vain boasting that distinguish the vulgar who have escape a imminent danger without any particular merit of they own among those whose spirit be better trained and more rebuke there be attention to the sufferer and deep thanksgiving with the touching intercourse of the grateful and happy the late scene and the fearful fate of the patron and nicholaus wagner cast a shade upon they joy but all inwardly feel that they have be snatch from the jaw of death maso shape he course by the beacon that still blaze in the grate of old roger de blonay with he eye rivet on the luff of he sail he hip bear hard against the tiller and a heart that relieve itself from time to time with bitter sigh he rule the bark like a preside spirit at length the black mass of the côtes of vaud take more distinct and regular form here and there a tower or a tree betray its outline against the sky and then the object on the margin of the lake begin to stand out in gloomy relief from the land light flare along the strand and cry reach they from the shore a dark shapeless pile stand directly athwart they watery path and at the next moment it take the aspect of a ruin castle-like edifice the canvass flap and be hand the winkelried rise and set more slowly and with a gentler movement and glide into the little secure artificial haven of la tour de peil a forest of latine yard and low mast lay before they but by give the bark a rank sheer maso bring she to she berth by the side of another lake craft with a gentleness of collision that as the mariner have it would not have break a egg a hundred voice greet the traveller for they approach have be see and watch with intense anxiety fifty eager vévaisans pour upon she deck in a noisy crowd the instant it be possible among other a dark shaggy object bound foremost it leap wildly forward and maso find himself in the embrace of nettuno a little later when delight and a more temper feeling permit examination a lock of human hair be discover entangled in the tooth of the dog and the follow week the body of baptiste and the peasant of berne be find still clench in the desperate death-gripe wash upon the shore of vaud chapter viii the moon be up by heaven a lovely eve long stream of light o'er glancing wave expand now lad on shore may sigh and maid believe : such be we fate when we return to land byron the approach of the winkelry have be see from vévey throughout the afternoon and evening the arrival of the baron de willading and he daughter be expect by many in the town the rank and influence of the former in the great canton render he a object of interest to more than those who feel affection for he person and respect for he upright quality roger de blonay have not be he only youthful friend for the place contain another with whom he be intimate by habit if not from a community of those principle which be the best cement of friendship the officer charge with the especial supervision of the district or circle into which berne have cause its dependent territory of vaud to be divide be term a _ baillus _ a title that we word bailiff will scarcely render except as it may strictly mean a substitute for the exercise of authority that be the property of another but which for the want of a better term we may be compel occasionally to use the baillus or bailiff of vévey be peter hofmeister a member of one of those family of the bürgerschaft or the municipal aristocracy of the canton which find its institution venerable just and and if one might judge from they language almost sacred simply because it have be in possession of certain exclusive privilege under they authority that be not only comfortable in they exercise but fecund in other worldly advantage this peter hofmeister be in the main a hearty well-meaning and somewhat benevolent person but live as he do under the secret consciousness that all be not as it should be he push he opinion on the subject of vested interest and on the stability of temporal matter a little into extreme pretty much on the same principle as that on which the engineer expend the largest portion of he art in fortify the weakest point of the citadel take care that there shall be a constant flight of shot great and small across the most accessible of its approach by one of the exclusive ordinance of those time in which man be glad to get relief from the violence and rapacity of the baron and the satellite of the prince ordinance that it be the fashion of the day to term liberty the family of hofmeister have come into the exercise of a certain charge or monopoly that in truth have always constitute its wealth and importance but of which it be accustom to speak as form its principal claim to the gratitude of the public for duty that have be perform not only so well but for so long a period by a unbroken succession of patriot descend from the same stock they who judge of the value attach to the possession of this charge by the animation with which all attempt to relieve they of the burthen be repel must have be in error for to hear they friend descant on the difficulty of the duty of the utter impossibility that they should be properly discharge by any family that have not be in they exercise just one hundred and seventy-two year and a half the precise period of the hard servitude of the hofmeister and the rare merit of they self-devotion to the common good it would seem that they be so many modern curtius anxious to leap into the chasm of uncertain and endless toil to save the republic from the ignorance and peculation of certain interested and selfish knave who wish to enjoy the same high trust for a motive so unworthy as that of they own particular advantage this subject apart however and with a strong reservation in favor of the supremacy of berne on whom he importance depend a better or a more philanthropic man than peter hofmeister would not have be easily find he be a hearty laugher a hard drinker a common and peculiar fail of the age a great respecter of the law as be meet in one so situated and a bachelor of sixty-eight a time of life that by refer he education to a period more remote by half a century than that in which the incident of we legend take place be not at all in favor of any very romantic predilection in behalf of the rest of the human race in short the herr hofmeister be a bailiff much as balthazar be a headsman on account of some particular merit or demerit -lrb- it might now be difficult to say which -rrb- of one of he ancestor by the law of the canton and by the opinion of man the only material difference between they be in the fact that the one greatly enjoy he station while the other have but a indifferent relish for he trust when roger de blonay by the aid of a good glass have assure himself that the bark which lay off st saphorin in the even tide with yard a-cock-bill and sail pendent in they picturesque drapery contain a party of gentle traveller who occupy the stern and saw by the plume and robe that a female of condition be among they he give a order to prepare the beacon-fire and descend to the port in order to be in readiness to receive he friend here he find the bailiff pacing the public promenade which be wash by the limpid water of the lake with the air of a man who have more on he mind than the daily care of office although the baron de blonay be a vaudoi and look upon all the functionary of he country 's conqueror with a species of hereditary dislike he be by nature a man of mild and courteous quality and the meeting be as usual friendly in the externals and of seem cordiality great care be have by both to speak in the second person on the part of the vaudoi that it might be see he value himself as at least the equal of the representative of berne and on that of the bailiff in order to show that he office make he as good as the head of the oldest house in all that region thou expectest to see friend from genf in yonder bark say the herr hofmeister abruptly and thou a friend and one more than a friend answer the bailiff evasively my advice tell I that melchior de willading will sojourn among we during the festival of the abbaye and secret notice have be send that there will be another here who wish to see we merry-making without pretension to the honor that he might fairly claim it be not rare for noble of mark and even prince to visit we on these occasion under feigned name and without the _ éclat _ of they rank for the great when they descend to folly seldom like to bring they high condition within they influence the wiser they i have my own trouble with these accursed foolery for -- it may be a weakness but it be one that be official -- i can not help imagine that a bailiff cut but a shabby figure before the people in the presence of so many god and goddess to own to thee the truth i rejoice that he who cometh cometh as he doth -- hast letter of late date from berne none though report say that there be like to be a change among some of those who fill the public trust so much the worse growl the bailiff be it to be expect that man who never do a hour 's duty in a charge can acquit themselves like those who have it might be say suck in practice with they mother 's milk ay this be well enough for thee but other say that even the erlach have a begin himmel be i a heathen to deny this as many beginning as thou wilt good roger but i like not thy end no doubt a erlach be mortal like all of we and even a create be but a man be not a charge let the clay die if thou wilt but if thou wouldst have faithful or skilful servant look to the true successor but we will have none of this to-day -- hast many guest at blonay not one i look for the company of melchior de willading and he daughter -- and yet i like not the time there be evil sign play about the high peak and in the neighborhood of the dent since the sun have set thou art ever in a storm up in thy castle there the leman be never more peaceable and i should take it truly in evil part be the rebellious lake to get into one of its fit of sudden anger with so precious a freight on its bosom i do not think the genfer see will regard even a bailiff 's displeasure rejoin the baron de blonay laughing i repeat it the sign be suspicious let we consult the waterman for it may be well to send a light-pulling boat to bring the traveller to land roger de blonay and the bailiff walk towards the little earthen mole that partially protect the roadstead of vévey and which be for ever form and for ever wash away before the storm of winter in order to consult some of those who be believe to be expert in detect the symptom that precede any important change of the atmosphere the opinion be various most believe there would be a gust but as the winkelried be know to be a new and well-built bark and none could tell how much beyond she power she have be load by the cupidity of baptiste and as it be generally think the wind would be as likely to bring she up to she haven as to be against she there appear no sufficient reason for send off the boat especially as it be believe the bark would be not only drier but safer than a smaller craft should they be overtake by the wind this indecision so common in case of uncertainty be the means of expose adelheid and she father to all those fearful risk they have just run when the night come on the people of the town begin to understand that the tempest would be grave for those who be oblige to encounter it even in the best bark on the leman the darkness add to the danger for vessel have often run against the land by miscalculate they distance and the light be show along the strand by order of the bailiff who manifest a interest so unusual in those on board the winkelry as to draw about they more than the sympathy that would ordinarily be feel for traveller in distress every exertion that the case admit be make in they behalf and the moment the state of the lake allow boat be send off in every probable direction to they succor but the winkelried be run along the coast of savoy ere any venture forth and the search prove fruitless when the rumor spread however that a sail be to be discern come out from under the wide shadow of the opposite mountain and that it be steer for la tour de peil a village with a far safer harbor than that of vévey and but a arrow 's flight from the latter town crowd rush to the spot the instant it be know that the miss party be in she the traveller be receive with cheer of delight and cry of hearty greet the bailiff and roger de blonay hasten forward to receive the baron de willading and he friend who be carry in a tumultuous and joyful manner into the old castle that adjoin the port and from which in truth the latter derive its name the bernoi noble be too much affect with the scene through which he have so lately pass and with the strong and ungovernable tenderness of adelheid who have weep over

welcome among we -- in the two character just name and as one that have do thee and we so great a service sigismund receive the compliment which he so well merit with modesty the bailiff however not content with make the usual felicitation whisper in he ear that a service like this render to one of its most esteemed noble would not be forget by the council on a proper occasion thou art happily arrive herr melchior he then add aloud come as thou wilt float or sail in air we have thee among we none the worse for the accident and we thank god as roger de blonay have just so well observe we

companion in the bark but these i see around we there be another and i wonder that he be not here ` tis a noble genoese that thou hast often hear I name sire de blonay as one that i love gaetano grimaldus be a name familiar to thee or the word of friendship have be utter in a idle ear i have hear so much of the italian that i can almost fancy he a old and try acquaintance when thou first returnedst from the italian war thy tongue be never weary of recount he praise : it be gaetano say this -- gaetano think thus -- gaetano do that surely he be not of thy company he and no other a lucky meeting on the quay of genf bring we together again after a separation of full thirty year and as if heaven have reserve its trial for the occasion we have be make to go through the late danger in company i have he in my arm in that fearful moment roger when the sky and the mountain and all of earth even to that dear girl be fading as i think for ever from my sight -- he that have already be my partner in so many risk who have bleed for I watch for I ride for I and do all other thing that love could prompt for I be bring by providence to be my companion in the awful strait through which i have just pass while the baron be still speak he friend enter with the quiet and dignified mien he always maintain when it be not he pleasure to throw aside the reserve of high station or when he yield to the torrent of feeling that sometimes pour through he southern temperament in a way to unsettle the deportment of mere convention he be present to roger de blonay and the bailiff as the person just allude to and as the oldest and most try of the friend of he introducer he reception by the former be natural and warm while the herr hofmeister be so particular in he profession of pleasure and respect as to excite not only notice but surprise thanks thanks good peterchen say the baron de willade for such be the familiar diminutive by which the bustling bailiff be usually address by those who could take the liberty thanks honest peterchen thy kindness to gaetano be so much love show to myself i honor thy friend as thyself herr von willade return the bailiff for thou hast a claim to the esteem of the bürgerschaft and all its servant but the homage pay to the signor grimaldus be due on he own account we be but poor swiss that dwell in the midst of wild mountain little favor by the sun if ye will and less know to the world -- but we have we manners a man that have be intrust with authority as long as i be unfit for he trust do he not tell as it might be by instinct when he have those in he presence that be to be honor signora the loss of melchior von willading before we haven would have make the lake unpleasant to we all for month not to say year but have so great a calamity arrive as that of you death by means of we water i could have pray that the mountain might fall into the basin and bury the offend leman under they rock melchior de willading and old roger de blonay laugh heartily at peterchen 's hyperbolical compliment though it be quite plain that the worthy bailiff himself fancy he have say a clever thing i thank you signore no less than my friend de willade return the genoese a gleam of humor light he eye this courteous reception quite outdo we of italy for i doubt if there be a man south of the alp who would be willing to condemn either of we sea to so overwhelming a punishment for a fault so venial or at least so natural i beg however that the lake may be pardon since at the worst it be but a secondary agent in the affair and i doubt not it would have treat we as it treat all traveller have we keep out of its embrace the crime must be imputed to the wind and as they be the offspring of the hill i fear it will be find that these very mountain to which you look for retribution will be convict at last as the true deviser and abettor of the plot against we life the bailiff chuckle and simper like a man pleased equally with he own wit and with that he have excite in other and the discourse change though throughout the night as indeed be the fact on all other occasion during he visit the signor grimaldus receive from he so marked and particular attention as to create a strong sentiment in favor of the italian among those who have be chiefly accustom to see peterchen enact the busy important dignified local functionary attention be now pay to the first want of the traveller who have great need of refreshment after the fatigue and exposure of the day to obtain the latter roger de blonay insist that they should ascend to he castle in whose grate the welcome beacon still blaze by means of _ chars-à-banc _ the peculiar vehicle of the country the short distance be soon overcome the bailiff not a little to the surprise of the owner of the house insist on see the stranger safely house within its wall at the gate of blonay however peterchen take he leave make a hundred apology for he absence on the ground of the extensive duty that have devolve on he shoulder in consequence of the approach fête we shall have a mild winter for i have never know the herr hofmeister so courteous observe roger de blonay while show he guest into the castle thy bernese authority melchior be little apt to be lavish of they compliment to we poor noble of vaud signora you forget the interest of we friend observe the laughing genoese there be other and better bailiwick beyond a question in the gift of the council and the signor de willading have a loud voice in they disposal have i find a solution for this zeal thou hast not return the baron for peterchen have little hope beyond that of die where he have live the deputed ruler of a small district the worthy man should have more credit for a good heart he own no doubt be touch at see those who be as it may be redeem from the grave i owe he grace for the kindness and should a better thing really offer and could my poor voice be of account why i do not say it should be silent it be serve the public well to put man of these kind feeling into place of trust this opinion appear very natural to the listener all of whom with the exception of the signor grimaldus join in echo the sentiment the latter more experienced in the winding of the human heart or possess some reason know only to himself merely smile at the remark that he hear as if he thoroughly understand the difference between the homage that be pay to station and that which a generous and noble nature be compel to yield to its own impulse a hour later the light repast be end and roger de blonay inform he guest that they would be well repay for walk a short distance by a look at the loveliness of the night in sooth the change be already so great that it be not easy for the imagination to convert the soft and smile scene that lay beneath and above the tower of blonay into the dark vault and the angry lake from which they have so lately escape every cloud have already sail far away towards the plain of germany and the moon have climb so high above the ragged dent de jaman as to its ray to stream into the basin of the leman a thousand pensive star spangle the vauk image of the benign omnipotence which unceasingly pervade and govern the universe whatever may be the local derangement or accidental struggle of the inferior agent the foam and rush wave have go down nearly as fast as they have arise and in they stead remain myriad of curl ridge along which the glitter moonbeam dance rioting with mild impunity on the surface of the placid sheet boat be out again pull for savoy or the neighbor village : and the whole view betoken the renew confidence of those who trust habitually to the fickle and blustering element there be a strong and fearful resemblance between the human passion and these hot and angry gust of nature observe the signor grimaldus after they have stand silently regard the scene for several muse minute -- alike quick to be arouse and to be appease equally ungovernable while in the ascendant and admit the influence of a wholesome reaction that bring a more sober tranquillity when the fit be over you northern phlegm may render the analogy less apparent but it be to be find as well among the cooler temperament of the teutonic stock as among we of warmer blood do not this placid hill-side yon lake and the starry heaven look as if they regret they late unseemly violence and wish to cheat the beholder into forgetfulness of they attack on we safety as a impetuous but generous nature would repent it of the blow give in anger or of the cut speech that have escape in a moment of spleen what hast thou to say to my opinion signor sigismund for none know better than thou the quality of the tempest we have encounter signora answer the young soldier modestly you forget this brave mariner without whose coolness and forethought all would have be lose he have come up to blonay at we own request but until now he have be overlook

command he say address the genoese but have my own affair on hand must now beg to know you pleasure we have in sooth be negligent of thy merit on landing my first thought be of thee as thou knowest : but other thing have cause I to forget thee thou art like myself a italian signora i be of what country of you own signora a genoese as i have say before the other remember the circumstance though it do not seem to please he he look around as if to detect what other think and then continue he question a genoese he repeat slowly : if this be so we should know something of each other hast ever hear of I in thy frequent visit to the port maso smile at first he appear disposed to be facetious but a dark cloud pass over he swarthy lineament and he lose he pleasantry in a air of thoughtfulness that strike he interrogator as singular signora he say after a pause most that follow my manner of life know something of you eccellenza if it be only to be question of this that i be here i pray leave to be permit to go my way no by san francesco thou quittest we not so unceremoniously i be wrong to assume the manner of a superior with one to whom i owe my life and be well answer but there be a heavy account to be settle between we and i will do something towards wipe out the balance which be so greatly against I now leave thee to apply for a further statement when we shall both be again in we own genoa the signor grimaldus have reach forth a arm while speak and receive a well-filled purse from he countryman and companion marcellus this be soon empty of its contents a fair show of sequin all of which be offer to the mariner without reservation maso look coldly at the glitter pile and by he hesitation leave a doubt whether he do not think the reward insufficient i tell thee it be but the present gage of further payment at genoa we account shall be fairly settle but this be all that a traveller can prudently spare thou wilt come to I in we own town and we will look to all thy interest signore you offer that for which man do all act whether of good or of evil they jeopard they soul for this very metal mock at god 's law overlook the right trifle with justice and become devil incarnate to possess it and yet though nearly penniless i be so place as to be compel to refuse what you offer i tell thee maso that it shall be increase hereafter -- or -- we be not so poor as to go a-begging good marcellus empty thy hoard and i will have recourse to melchior de willading 's purse for we want until we can get nearer to we own supplies and be melchior de willade to pass for nothing in all this exclaim the baron put up thy gold gaetano and leave I to satisfy the honest mariner for the present at a later day he can come to thee in italy : but here on my own ground i claim the right to be he banker signora return maso earnestly and with more of gentle feeling than he be accustom to betray you be both liberal beyond my desire and but too well disposed for my poor want i

in a manner that be force -- but poverty and meanness be not always inseparable you have more than suspect to-day that my life be free and i admit it but it be a mistake to believe that because man quit the high-road which some call honesty in any particular practice they be without human feeling i have be useful in save you life signor and there be more pleasure in the reflection than i should find in have the means to earn twice the gold ye offer here be the signor capitano he add take sigismund by the arm and drag he forward lavish you favor on he for no practice of mine could have be of use without he bravery if ye give he all in you treasury even to its richest pearl ye will do no more than reason as maso cease he cast a glance towards the attentive breathless adelheid that continue to utter he meaning even after the tongue be silent the bright suffusion that cover the maiden 's face be visible even by the pale moonlight and sigismund shrink back from he rude grasp in the manner in which the guilty retire from notice these opinion be creditable to thee maso return the genoese affect not to understand he more particular meaning and they excite a stronger wish to be thy friend i will say no more on the subject at present for i see thy humor thou wilt let I see thee at genoa the expression of maso 's countenance be inexplicable but he retain he usual indifference of manner signor gaetano he say use a mariner 's freedom in the address there be noble in genoa that might better knock at the door of you palace than i and there be those too in the city that would gossip be it know that you receive such guest this be tie thyself too closely to a evil and a dangerous trade i suspect thee to be of the contraband but surely it be not a pursuit so free from danger of so much repute or judge by thy attire of so much profit even that thou needest be wed to it for life mean can be find to relieve thee from its odium by give thee a place in those custom with which thou hast so often trifled maso laugh outright so it be signora in this moral world of ours he who would run a fair course in any particular trust have only to make himself dangerous to be buy up you thief-taker be desperate rogue out of business you tide-waiter have get he art by cheat the revenue and i have be in land where it be say that all they who most fleece the people begin they calling as suffer patriot the rule be firmly enough establish without the help of my poor name and by you leave i will remain as i be one that have he pleasure in live amid risk and who take he revenge of the authority by railing at they when defeat and in laugh at they when in success young man thou hast in thee the material of a better life signora this may be true answer maso whose countenance again grow dark we boast of be the lord of the creation but the bark of poor baptista be not less master of its movement in the late gust than we be master of we fortune signor grimaldus i have in I the material that make a man but the law and the opinion and the accursed strife of man have leave I what i be for the first fifteen year of my career the church be to be my stepping-stone to a cardinal 's hat or a fat priory but the briny sea-water wash out the necessary unction thou art better bear than thou seemest -- thou hast friend who should be grieve at this the eye of maso flash but he bent it aside as if bear down by the force of a indomitable will some sudden and fierce impulse i be bear of woman he say with singular emphasis and thy mother -- be she not pained at thy present course -- do she know of thy career the haggard smile to which this question give birth induce the genoese to regret that he have put it maso evidently struggle to subdue some feeling which harrow he very soul and he success be owe to such a command of himself as man rarely obtain she be dead he answer huskily she be a saint with the angel have she live i should never have be a mariner and -- and -- lay he hand on he throat as if to keep down the sense of suffocation he smile and add laughingly -- ay and the good winkelried would have be a wreck maso thou must come to I at genoa i must see more of thee and question thee further of thy fortune a fair spirit have be pervert in thy fall and the friendly aid of one who be not without influence may still restore its tone the signor grimaldus speak warmly like one who sincerely feel regret and he voice have all the melancholy and earnestness of such a sentiment the truculent nature of maso be touch by this show of interest and a multitude of fierce passion be at once subdue he approach the noble genoese and respectfully take he hand pardon the freedom signora he say more mildly intently regard the wrinkled and attenuate finger with the map-like tracery of vein that he hold in he own brown and hard palm this be not the first time that we flesh have touch each other though it be the first time that we hand have join let it now be in amity a humor have come over I and i would crave you pardon venerable noble for the freedom signora you be aged and honor and stand high doubtless in heaven 's favor as in that of man -- grant I then you blessing ere i go my way as maso prefer this extraordinary request he kneel with a air of so much reverence and sincerity as to leave little choice as to grant it the genoese be surprised but not disconcert with perfect dignity and self-possession and with a degree of feeling that be not unsuited to the occasion the fruit of emotion so powerfully awaken he pronounce the benediction the mariner arise kiss the hand which he still hold make a hurry sign of salutation to all leap down the declivity on which they stand and vanish among the shadow of a copse sigismund who have witness this unusual scene with surprise watch he to the last and he see by the manner in which he dash he hand across he eye that he fierce nature have be singularly shake on recover he thought the signor grimaldus too feel certain there have be no mockery in the conduct of they inexplicable preserver for a hot tear have fall on he hand ere it be liberate he be himself strongly agitate by what have pass and lean on he friend he slowly re-enter the gate of blonay this extraordinary demand of maso 's have bring up the sad image of my own poor son dear melchior he say would to heaven that he could have receive this blessing and that it might have be of use to he in the sight of god nay he may yet hear of it -- for canst thou believe it i have think that maso may be one of he lawless associate and that some wild desire to communicate this scene have prompt the strange request i grant the discourse continue but it become secret and of the most confidential kind the rest of the party soon seek they bed though lamp be burn in the chamber of the two old noble to a late hour of the night chapter ix where be my switzer let they guard the door : what be the matter hamlet the american autumn or fall as we poetically and affectionately term this generous and mellow season among ourselves be think to be unsurpassed in its warm and genial lustre its bland and exhilarating air and its admirable constancy by the decline of the year in nearly every other portion of the earth whether attachment to we own fair and generous land have lead we to over-estimate its advantage or not and bright and cheerful as we autumnal day certainly be a fairer morning never dawn upon the alleghany than that which illumine the alp on the reappearance of the sun after the gust of the night which have be so lately describe as the day advance the scene grow gradually more lovely until warm and glowing italy itself could scarce present a landscape more winning or one possess a fairer admixture of the grand and the soft than that which greet the eye of adelheid de willading as lean on the arm of she father she issue from the gate of blonay upon its elevated and gravelled terrace it have already be say that this ancient and historical building stand against the bosom of the mountain at the distance of a short league behind the town of vévey all the elevation of this region be so many spur of the same vast pile and that on which blonay have now be seat from the earliest period of the middle age belong to that particular line of rocky rampart which separate the valai from the center canton of the confederation of switzerland and which be commonly know as the range of the oberland alp this line of snow-crowned rock terminate in perpendicular precipice on the very margin of the leman and form on the side of the lake a part of that magnificent setting which render the south-eastern horn of its crescent so wonderfully beautiful the upright natural wall that overhang villeneuve and chillon stretch along the verge of the water barely leave room for a carriage-road with here and there a cottage at its base for the distance of two league when it diverge from the course of the lake and withdraw inland it be finally lose among the minor eminence of fribourg every one have observe those slope declivity compose of the washing of torrent the _ débris _ of precipice and what may be term the constant dripping of perpendicular eminency and which lie like broad buttress at they foot form a sort of foundation or basement for the superincumbent mass among the alp where nature have act on so sublime a scale and where all the proportion be duly observe these _ débris _ of the high mountain frequently contain village and town or form vast field vineyard and pasturage accord to they elevation or they exposure towards the sun it may be question in strict geology whether the variegated acclivity that surround vévey rich in village and vine hamlet and castle have be thus form or whether the natural convulsion which expel the upper rock from the crust of the earth leave they basis in the present broken and beautiful form but the fact be not important to the effect which be that just name and which give to these vast range of rock secondary and fertile basis that in other region would be term mountain of themselves the castle and family of blonay for both still exist be among the oldest of vaud a square rude tower base upon a foundation of rock one of those ragged mass that thrust they naked head occasionally through the soil of the declivity be the commencement of the hold other edifice have be rear around this nucleus in different age until the whole present one of those peculiar and picturesque pile that ornament so many both of the savage and of the softer site of switzerland the terrace towards which adelheid and she father advance be a irregular walk shaded by venerable tree that have be raise near the principal or the carriage gate of the castle on a ledge of those rock that form the foundation of the building themselves it have its parapet wall its seat its artificial soil and its gravel _ allées _ as be usual with these antiquated ornament but it also have what be better than these one of the most sublime and lovely view that ever greet human eye beneath it lay the undulating and teem declivity rich in vine and carpet with sward here dot by hamlet there park-like and rural with forest tree while there be no quarter that do not show the roof of a château or the tower of some rural church there be little of magnificence in swiss architecture which never much surpass and be perhaps generally inferior to we own but the beauty and quaintness of the site the great variety of the surface the hill-side and the purity of the atmosphere supply charm that be peculiar to the country vévey lay at the water-side many hundred foot lower and seemingly on a narrow strand though in truth enjoy ample space while the house of st saphorin corsier montreux and of a dozen more village be cluster together like so many of the compact habitation of wasp stick against the mountain but the principal charm be in the leman one who have never witness the lake in its fury could not conceive the possibility of danger in the tranquil shine sheet that be now spread like a liquid mirror for league beneath the eye some six or seven bark be in view they sail droop in negligent form as if disposed expressly to become model for the artist they yard incline as chance have cast they and they hull loom large to complete the picture to these near object must be add the distant view which extend to the jura in one direction and which in the other be bound by the frontier of italy whose aërial limit be to be trace in that region which appear to belong neither to heaven nor to earth the abode of eternal frost the rhone be shine in spot among the meadow of the valai for the elevation of the castle admit of its be see and adelheid endeavor to trace among the maze of the mountain the valley which lead to those sunny country towards which they journey the sensation of both father and daughter when they come beneath the leafy canopy of the terrace be those of mute delight it be evident by the expression of they countenance that they be in a favorable mood to receive pleasurable impression for the face of each be full of that quiet happiness which succeed sudden and lively joy adelheid have be weep but judge from the radiance of she eye the healthful and brighten bloom of she cheek and the struggle smile that play about she ripe lip the tear have be sweet rather than painful though still betray enough of physical frailty to keep alive the concern of all who love she there be a change for the better in she appearance which be so sensible as to strike the least observant of those who live in daily communication with the invalid if pure and mild air a sunny sky and ravishing scenery be what they seek who cross the alp my father say adelheid after they have stand a moment gaze at the magnificent panorama why should the swiss quit he native land be there in italy aught more soft more winning or more healthful than this this spot have often be call the italy of we mountain the fig ripen near yonder village of montreux and open to the morning sun while it be sheltered by the precipice above the whole of that shore well deserve its happy reputation still they whose spirit require diversion and whose constitution need support generally prefer to go into country where the mind have more occupation and where a greater variety of employment help the climate and nature to complete the cure but thou forgettest father it be agree between we that i be now to become strong and active and laughing as we use to be at willade when i first grow into womanhood if i could but see those day again darling my own closing hour would be calm as those of a saint -- though heaven know i have little pretension to that bless character in any other particular dost thou not count a quiet conscience and a sure hope as something father have it as thou wilt girl make a saint of I or a bishop or a hermit if thou wilt the only reward i ask be to see thee smile and happy as thou never failedst to be during the first eighteen year of thy life have i foresee that thou wert to return from my good sister so little like thyself i would have forbid the visit much as i love she and all that be she 's but the wisest of we be helpless mortal and scarce know we own want from hour to hour thou saidst i think that this brave sigismund honestly declare he belief that my consent could never be give to one who have so little to boast of in the way of birth and fortune there be at least good sense and modesty and right feeling in the doubt but he should have think better of my heart he say this return adelheid in a timid and slightly tremble voice though it be quite apparent by the confide expression of she eye that she have no longer any secret from she parent he have too much honor to wish to win the daughter of a noble without the knowledge and approbation of she friend that the boy should love thee adelheid be natural it be a additional proof of he own merit -- but that he should distrust my affection and justice be a offence that i can scarce forgive what be ancestry and wealth to thy happiness thou forget ` st dear sir he be yet to learn that my happiness in any measure depend on he adelheid speak quickly and with warmth he know i be a father and that thou art a only child one of he good sense and right way of think should have better understand the feeling of a man in my situation than to doubt he natural affection as he have never be the parent of a only daughter father answer the smile adelheid for in she present mood smile come easily he may not have feel or anticipate all that thou imagin ` st he know the prejudice of the world on the subject of noble blood and they be few indeed that have much be dispose to part with it to he who have little the lad reason more like a old miser than a young soldier and i have a great mind to let he feel my displeasure for think so meanly of I have we not willade with all its fair land besides we rights in the city that we need go beg money of other like needy mendicant thou hast be in the conspiracy against my character girl or such a fear could not have either uneasiness for a moment i never think father that thou would ` st reject he on account of poverty for i know we own means sufficient for all we own want but i do believe that he who could not boast the privilege of nobility might fail to gain thy favor be we not a republic -- be not the right of the bürgerschaft the one essential right in berne -- why should i raise obstacle about that on which the law be silent adelheid listen as a female of she year would be apt to listen to word so grateful with a charmed ear and yet she shake she head in a way to express a incredulity that be not altogether free from apprehension for thy generous forgetfulness of old opinion in behalf of my happiness dearest father she resume the tear start unbidden to she thoughtful blue eye i thank thee fervently it be true that we be inhabitant of a republic but we be not the less noble dost thou turn against thyself and hunt up reason why i should not do that which thou hast just acknowledge to be so necessary to prevent thee from follow thy brother and sister to they early grave the blood rush in a torrent to the face of adelheid for though weep and in the moment of tender confidence which succeed she thanksgiving for the baron 's safety she have throw herself on he bosom and confess that the hopelessness of the sentiment with which she meet the declare love of sigismund be the true cause of the apparent malady that have so much alarmed she friend the word which have flow spontaneously from she heart in so tender a scene have never appear to she to convey a meaning so strong or one so wound to virgin-pride as that which she father in the strength of he masculine habit have now give they in god 's mercy father i shall live whether unite to sigismund or not to smooth thine own decline and to bless thy old age a pious daughter will never be tear so cruelly from one to whom she be the last and only stay i may mourn this disappointment and foolishly wish perhaps it might have be otherwise but ours be not a house of which the maiden die for they inclination in favor of any youth however deserving noble or simple add the baron laughing for he see that he daughter speak in sudden pique rather than from she excellent heart adelheid whose good sense and quick recollection instantly show she the weakness of this little display of female feeling laugh faintly in she turn though she repeat he word as if to give still more emphasis to she own this will not do my daughter they who profess the republican doctrine should not be too rigid in they construction of privilege if sigismund be not noble it will not be difficult to obtain for he that honorable distinction and in failure of male line he may bear the name and sustain the honor of we family in any case he will become of the bürgerschaft and that of itself will be all that be require in berne in berne father return adelheid who have so far forget the recent movement of pride as to smile on she fond and indulgent parent though yield to the waywardness of the happy she continue to trifle with she own feeling -- it be true the bürgerschaft will be sufficient for all the purpose of office and political privilege but will it suffice for the opinion of we equal for the prejudice of society or for you own perfect contentment when the freshness of gratitude shall have pass thou puttest these question girl as if employ to defeat thine own cause -- dost not truly love the boy after all on this subject i have speak sincerely and as become thy child frankly return adelheid he save my life from imminent peril as he have now save thine and although my aunt fearful of thy displeasure would not that thou should ` st hear the tale she prohibition could not prevent gratitude from have its way i have tell thee that sigismund have declare he feeling although he nobly abstain from even ask a return and i should not have be my mother 's child could i have remain entirely indifferent to so much worth unite to a service so great what i have say of we prejudice be then rather for you reflection dearest sir than for myself i have think much of all this and be ready to make any sacrifice to pride and to bear all the remark of the world in order to discharge a debt to one to whom i owe so much but while it be natural perhaps unavoidable that i should feel thus thou art not necessarily to forget the other claim upon thee it be true that in one sense we be all to each other but there be a tyrant that will scarce let any escape from he reign i mean opinion let we then not deceive ourselves -- though we of berne affect the republic and speak much of liberty it be a small state and the influence of those that be larger and more powerful among we neighbor rule in every thing that touch opinion a noble be as much a noble in berne in all but what the law bestow as he be in the empire -- and thou knowest we come of the german root which have strike deep into these prejudice the baron de willading have be much accustomed to defer to the superior mind and more cultivate understanding of he daughter who in the retirement of she father 's castle have read and reflect far more than she year would have probably permit in the busier scene of the world he feel the justice of she remark and they have walk the entire length of the terrace in profound silence before he could summon the idea necessary to make a suitable answer the truth of what thou sayest be not to be deny he at length say but it may be palliate i have many friend in the german court and favor may be have letter of nobility will give the youth the station he want after which he can claim thy hand without offence to any opinion whether of berne or elsewhere i doubt if sigismund will willingly become a party to this expedient we own nobility be of ancient origin it date from a period anterior to the existence of berne as a city and be much older than we institution i remember to have hear he say that when a people refuse to bestow these distinction themselves they citizen can never receive they from other without a loss of dignity and character and one of he moral firmness might hesitate to do what he think wrong for a boon so worthless as that we offer by the soul of william tell should the unknown peasant dare -- but he be a brave boy and twice have he do the last service to my race i love he adelheid little less than thyself and we will win he ever to we purpose gently and by degree a maiden of thy beauty and year to say nothing of thy other quality thy name the land of willading and the rights of berne be matter after all not to I lightly refuse by a nameless soldier who have naught -- but he courage he virtue he modesty and he excellent sense father thou wilt not let I have the naked satisfaction of vaunt my own wares i see gaetano grimaldus make sign at he window as if he be about to come forth : go thou to thy chamber that i may discourse of this troublesome matter with that excellent friend in good season thou shalt know the result adelheid kiss the hand that she hold in she own and leave he with a thoughtful air as she descend from the terrace it be not with the same elastic step as she have come up half a hour before early deprive of she mother this strong-minded but delicate girl have long be accustom to make she father a confidant of all she hope thought and picture of the future owing to she peculiar circumstance she would have have less hesitation than be usual to she sex in avow to she parent any of she attachment but a dread that the declaration might conduce to he unhappiness without in any manner favor she own cause have hitherto keep she silent she acquaintance with sigismund have be long and intimate rooted esteem and deep respect lay at the bottom of she sentiment which be however so lively as to have chase the rose from she cheek in the endeavor to forget they and to have lead she sensitive father to apprehend that she be suffer under that premature decay which have already rob he of he other child there be in truth no serious ground for this apprehension so natural to one in the place of the baron de willade for until thought and reflection pale she cheek a more bloom maiden than adelheid or one that unite more perfect health with feminine delicacy do not dwell among she native mountain she have quietly consent to the italian journey in the expectation that it might serve to divert she mind from brood over what she have long consider hopeless and with the natural desire to see land so celebrated but not under any mistaken opinion of she own situation the presence of sigismund so far as she be concern be purely accidental although she could not prevent the please idea from obtrude -- a idea so grateful to she womanly affection and maiden pride -- that the young soldier who be in the service of austrium and who have become know to she in one of he frequent visit to he native land have gladly seize this favorable occasion to return to he color circumstance which it be not necessary to recount have enable adelheid to make the youth acquaint with she father though the interdiction of she aunt whose imprudence have lead to the accident which nearly prove so fatal and from whose consequence she have be save by sigismund prevent she from explain all the cause she have for show he respect and esteem perhaps the manner in which this young and imaginative though sensible girl be compel to smother a portion of she feeling give they intensity and hasten that transition of sentiment from gratitude to affection which in another case might have only be produce by a more open and prolonged association as it be she scarcely know herself how irretrievably she happiness be bind up in that of sigismund though she have so long cherish he image in most of she day-dream and have unconsciously admit he influence over she mind and hope until she learn that they be reciprocate the signor grimaldus appear on one end of the terrace as adelheid de willade descend at the other the old noble have separate late on the previous night after a private and confidential communication that have shake the soul of the italian and draw strong and sincere manifestation of sympathy from he friend though so prone to sudden shades of melancholy there be a strong touch of the humorous in the native character of the genoese which come so quick upon he more painful recollection as greatly to relieve they weight and to render he in appearance at least a happy while the truth would have show that he be a sorrowing man he have be make he orison with a grateful heart and he now come forth into the genial mountain air like one who have relieve he conscience of a heavy debt like most layman of the catholic persuasion he think himself no longer bind to maintain a grave and mortified exterior when worship and penitence be duly observe and he join he friend with a cheerfulness of air and voice that a ascetic or a puritan might have attribute to levity after the scene through which he have so lately pass the virgin and san francesco keep thee in mind old friend say the signor grimaldus cordially kiss the two cheek of the baron de willading we both have reason to remember they care though heretic as thou art i doubt not thou hast already find some other mediator to thank that we now stand on this solid terrace of the signor de blonay instead of be worthless clay at the bottom of yonder treacherous lake i thank god for this as for all he mercy -- for thy life gaetano as well as for mine own thou art right thou art right good melchior : 'twa no affair for any but he who hold the universe in the hollow of he hand in good faith for a minute later would have gather both with we lather still thou wilt permit I catholic as i be to remember the intercessor on whom i call in the moment of extremity this be a subject on which we have never agree and on which we probably never shall answer the bernese with somewhat of the reserve of one conscious of a stronger dissidence than he wish to express as they turn and commence they walk up and down the terrace though i believe it be the only matter of difference that ever exist between we be it not extraordinary return the genoese that man should consort together in good and evil bleed for each other love each other do all act of kindness to each other as thou and i have do melchior nay be in the last extremity and feel more agony for the friend than for one 's self and yet entertain such opinion of they respective creed as to fancy the unbeliever in the devil 's claw all this time and to entertain a latent distrust that the very soul which in all other matter be deem so noble and excellent be to be everlastingly damned for the want of certain opinion and formality that we ourselves have be teach to think essential to tell thee the truth return the swiss rub he forehead like a man who wish to brighten up he idea as one would brighten old silver by friction this subject as thou well knowest be not my strong side luther and calvin with other sage discover that it be weakness to submit to dogma without close examination merely because they be venerable and they winnow the wheat from the chaff this we call a reform it be enough for I that man so wise be satisfy with they research and change and i feel little inclination to disturb a decision that have now receive the sanction of nearly two century of practice to be plain with thee i hold it discreet to reverence the opinion of my father though it would seem not of thy grandfather say the italian drily but in perfect good humor by san francesco thou wouldst have make a worthy cardinal have chance bring thee into the world fifty league farther south or west or east but this be the way with the world whether it be you turk you hindoo or you lutheran and i fear it be much the same with the child of st peter too each have he argument for faith or politics or any interest that may be name which he use like a hammer to knock down the brick of he opponent 's reason and when he find himself in the other 's intrenchment why he gather together the scattered material in order to build a wall for he own protection then what be oppression yesterday be justifiable defense to-day fanaticism become logic and credulity and pliant submission get in two century to be deference to the venerable opinion of we father but let it go -- thou wert speaking of thank god and in that roman though i be i fervently and devoutly join with or without saint ' intercession the honest baron do not like he friend 's allusion though they be much too subtle for he ready comprehension for the intellect of the swiss be a little frosted by constant residence among snow and in full view of glacier and it want the volatile play of the genoese 's fancy which be apt to expand like air rarefy by the warmth of the sun this difference of temperament however so far from lessen they mutual kindness be most probably the real cause of its existence since it be well know that friendship like love be more apt to be generate by quality that vary a little from we own than by a perfect homogeneity of character and disposition which be more liable to give birth to rivalry and contention than when each party have some distinct capital of he own on which to adventure and with which to keep alive the interest of he who in that particular feature may be but indifferently provide all that be require for a perfect community of feeling be a mutual recognition of and a common respect for certain great moral rule without which there can exist no esteem between the upright the alliance of knave depend on motive so hackneyed and obvious that we abstain from any illustration of its principle as a work of supererogation the signor grimaldus and melchior de willading be both very upright and justly-minded man as man go in intention at least and they opposite peculiarity and opinion have serve during hot youth to keep alive the interest of they communication and be not likely now that time have mellow they feeling and bring so many recollection to strengthen the tie to overturn what they have be originally the principal instrument in create of thy readiness to thank god i have never doubt answer the baron when he friend have end the remark just record but we know that he favor be commonly show to we here below by means of human instrument ought we not therefore to manifest another sort of gratitude in favor of the individual who be so serviceable in last night 's gust thou meanest my untractable countryman i have bethought I much since we separate of he singular refusal and hope still to find the means of conquer he obstinacy i hope thou may ` st succeed and thou well know ` st that i be always to be count on as a auxiliary but he be not in my thought at the instant there be still another who nobly risk more than the mariner in we behalf since he risk life this be beyond question and i have already reflect much on the means of do he good he be a soldier of fortune i learn and if he will take service in genoa i will charge myself with the care of he preferment trouble not thyself therefore concern the fortune of young sigismund thou knowest my means and canst not doubt my will the baron clear he throat for he have a secret reluctance to reveal he own favorable intention towards the young man the last linger feeling of worldly pride and the consequence of prejudice which be then universal and which be even now far from be extinct a vivid picture of the horror of the past night luckily flash across he mind and the good genius of he young preserver triumph thou knowest the youth be a swiss he say and in virtue of the tie of country i claim at least a equal right to do he good we will not quarrel for precedence in this matter but thou wilt do well to remember that i possess especial means to push he interest -- mean that thou canst not by possibility use that be not prove interrupted the baron de willading i have not thy particular station it be true signor gaetano nor thy political power nor thy princely fortune but poor as i be in these there be a boon in my keep that be worth they all and which will be more acceptable to the boy or i much mistake he mettle than any favor that thou hast name or canst name the signor grimaldus have pursue he walk with eye thoughtfully fasten on the ground but he now raise they in surprise to the countenance of he friend as if to ask a explanation the baron be not only commit by what have escape he but he be warm with opposition for the best may frequently do very excellent thing under the influence of motive of but a very indifferent aspect thou knowest i have a daughter resume the swiss firmly determine to break the ice at once and expose a decision which he fear he friend might deem a weakness thou hast and a fairer or a modester or a tenderer and yet unless my judgment err a firmer at need be not to be find among all the excellent of she excellent sex but thou wouldst scarce think of bestow adelheid in reward for such a service on one so little known or without she wish be consult girl of adelheid 's birth and breeding be ever ready to do what be meet to maintain the honor of they family i deem gratitude to be a debt that must not stand long uncancelled against the name of willade the genoese look grave and it be evident he listen to he friend with something like displeasure we who have so nearly pass through life good melchior he say should know its difficulty and its hazard the way be weary and it have need of all the solace that affection and a community of feeling can yield to lighten its care i have never like this heartless manner of trafficking in the tenderest tie to uphold a fail line or a fail fortune and better it be that adelheid should pass she day unwoo in thy ancient castle than give she hand under any sudden impulse of sentiment not less than under a cold calculation of interest such a girl my friend be not to be bestow without much care and reflection by the mass to use one of thine own favorite oath i wonder to hear thee talk thus -- thou whom i know a hot-blooded italian jealous as a turk and maintain at thy rapier 's point that woman be like the steel of thy sword so easily tarnish by rust or evil breath or neglect that no father or brother could be easy on the score of honor until the last of he name be well wed and that too to such as the wisdom of she adviser should choose i remember thee once say thou couldst not sleep soundly till thy sister be a wife or a nun this be the language of boyhood and thoughtless youth and bitterly rebuke have i be for have use it i wived a beauteous and noble virgin de willading but i much fear that while my fair conduct in she behalf win she respect and esteem i be too late to win she love it be a fearful thing to enter on the solemn and grave tie of married life without enlist in the cause of happiness the support of the judgment the fancy the taste with the feeling that be dependent on they and more than all those wayward inclination whose workings too often baffle human foresight if the hope of the ardent and generous themselves be deceive in the uncertain lottery of wedlock the victim will struggle hard to maintain the delusion but when the calculation of other be parent to the evil a natural inducement that come of the devil i fear prompt we to aggravate instead of strive to lessen the evil thou dost not speak of wedlock as one who find the condition happy poor gaetano i have tell thee what i fear be but too true return the genoese with a heavy sigh my birth vast means and i trust a fair name induce the kinsman of my wife to urge she to a union that i have since have reason to fear she feeling not lead she to form i have a terrible ally too in the acknowledged unworthiness of he who have captivate she young fancy and whom as age bring reflection she reason condemn i be accept therefore as a cure to a bleeding heart and broken peace and my office at the best be not such as a good man could desire or a proud man tolerate the unhappy angiolina die in give birth to she first child the unhappy son of whom i have tell thee so much she find peace at last in the grave thou hadst not time to give thy manly tenderness and noble quality a opportunity else my life on it she would have come to love thee gaetano as all love thee who know thee return the baron warmly thanks my kind friend but beware of make marriage a mere convenience there may be folly in call each truant inclination that deep sentiment and secret sympathy which firmly knit heart to heart and doubtless a common fortune may bind the worldly-mind together but this be not the holy union which keep noble quality in a family and which fortify against the seduction of a world that be already too strong for honesty i remember to have hear from one that understand he fellow-creature well that marriage of mere propriety tend to rob woman of she greatest charm that of superiority to the vulgar feeling of worldly calculation and that all community in which they prevail become of necessity selfish beyond the natural limit and eventually corrupt this may be true -- but adelheid love the youth ha this change the complexion of the affair how dost thou know this from she own lip the secret escape she under the warmth and sincerity of feeling that the late event so naturally excited and sigismund -- he have thy approbation -- for i will not suppose that one like thy daughter yield she affection unsolicited he have -- that be -- he have there be what the world will be apt to call a obstacle but it shall count for nothing with I the youth be not noble the objection be serious my honest friend it be not wise to tax human infirmity too much where there be sufficient to endure from cause that can not be remove wedlock be a precarious experiment and all unusual motive for disgust should be cautiously avoid -- i would he be noble the difficulty shall be remove by the emperor 's favor thou hast prince in italy too that might be prevail on to do we this grace at need what be the youth 's origin and history and by what mean have a daughter of thine be place in a situation to love one that be simply bear sigismund be a swiss and of a family of bernese burgher i should think though to confess the truth i know little more than that he have pass several year in foreign service and that he save my daughter 's life from one of we mountain accident some two year since as he have now save thine and mine my sister near whose castle the acquaintance commence permit the intercourse which it would now be too late to think of prohibit and to speak honestly i begin to rejoice the boy be what he be in order that we readiness to receive he to we arm may be the more apparent if the young fellow be the equal of adelheid in other thing as he be in person and character he would have too much in he favor -- no by the faith of calvin -- he whom thou stylest a heretic -- i think i rejoice that the boy be not noble have it as thou wilt return the genoese whose countenance continue to express distrust and think for he own experience have make he wary on the subject of doubtful or ill-assorted alliance let he origin be what it may he shall not need gold i charge myself with see that the land of willading shall be fairly balanced : and here come we hospitable host to be witness of the pledge roger de blonay advance upon the terrace to greet he guest as the signor grimaldus conclude the three old man continue they walk for a hour longer discuss the fortune of the young pair for melchior de willading be as little disposed to make a secret of he intention with one of he friend as with the other chapter x -- but i have not the time to pause upon these gewgaw of the heart werner though the word castle be of common use in europe as apply to ancient baronial edifice the thing itself be very different in style extent and cost in different country security unite to dignity and the means of accommodate a train of follower suit to the means of the noble be the common object the position and defence of the place necessarily vary accord to the general aspect of the region in which it stand thus ditch and other broad expanse of water be much depend on in all low country as in flander holland part of germany and much of france while hill spur of mountain and more especially the summit of conical rock be seek in switzerland italy and wherever else these natural means of protection could readily find other circumstance such as climate wealth the habit of a people and the nature of the feudal rights also serve greatly to modify the appearance and extent of the build the ancient hold in switzerland be originally little more than a square solid tower perch upon a rock with turret at its angle proof against fire from without it have ladder to mount from floor to floor and often contain its bed in the deep recess of the window or in alcove work in the massive wall as greater security or greater means enable office and construction of more importance arcse around its base inclose a court these necessarily follow the formation of the rock until in time the confused and inartificial pile which be now see moulder on so many of the minor spur of the alp be create as be usual in all ancient hold the rittersaal -- the salle des chevalier -- or the knight ' hall of blonay as it be differently call in different language be both the largest and the most laboriously decorate apartment of the edifice it be no longer in the rude gaol-like keep that grow as it be from the living rock on which it have be rear with so much skill as to render it difficult to ascertain where nature cease and art commence but it have be transfer a century before the occurrence relate in we tale to a more modern portion of the building that form the south-eastern angle of the whole construction the room be spacious square simple for such be the fashion of the country and light by window that look on one side towards valai and on the other over the whole of the irregular but lovely declivity to the margin of the leman and along that beautiful sheet embrace hamlet village city castle and purple mountain until the view be limit by the hazy jura the window on the latter side of the knight ' hall have a iron balcony at a giddy height from the ground and in this airy look-out adelheid have take she seat when after quit she father she mount to the apartment common to all the guest of the castle we have already allude generally to the personal appearance and to the moral quality of the baron de willading 's daughter but we now conceive it necessary to make the reader more intimately acquaint with one who be destine to act no mean part in the incident of we tale it have be say that she be please to the eye but she beauty be of a kind that depend more on expression on a union of character with feminine grace than on the vulgar line of regularity and symmetry while she have no feature that be defective she have none that be absolutely faultless though all be combine with so much harmony and the soft expression of the mild blue eye accord so well with the gentle play of a sweet mouth that the soul of they owner seem ready at all time to appear through these ingenuous tell-tale of she thought still maidenly reserve sate in constant watch over all and it be when the spectator think himself most in communion with she spirit that he most feel its pure and correct influence perhaps a cast of high intelligence of a natural power to discriminate which much surpass the limited means accord to female of that age contribute they share to hold those near she in respect and serve in some degree as a mild and wise repellant to counteract the attraction of she gentleness and candor in short one cast unexpectedly in she society would not have be slow to infer and he would have decide correctly that adelheid de willade be a girl of warm and tender affection of a playful but regulated fancy of a firm and lofty sense of all she duty whether natural or merely the result of social obligation of melting pity and yet of a habit and quality to think and act for herself in all those case in which it be fitting for a maiden of she condition and year to assume such self-control it be now more than a year since adelheid have become fully sensible of the force of she attachment for sigismund steinbach and during all that time she have struggle hard to overcome a feeling which she believe could lead to no happy result the declaration of the young man himself a declaration that be extort involuntarily and in a moment of powerful passion be accompany by a admission of its uselessness and folly and it first open she eye to the state of she own feeling though she have listen as all of she sex will listen even when the passion be hopeless to such word come from lip they love it be with a self-command that enable she to retain she own secret and with a settle and pious resolution to do that which she believe to be she duty to herself to she father and to sigismund from that hour she cease to see he unless under circumstance when it would have draw suspicion on she motive to refuse and while she never appear to forget she heavy obligation to the youth she firmly deny herself the pleasure of even mention he name when it could be avoid but of all ungrateful and reluctant task that of strive to forget be the least likely to succeed adelheid be sustain only by she sense of duty and the desire not to disappoint she father 's wish to which habit and custom have give nearly the force of law with maiden of she condition though she reason and judgment no less than she affection be both strongly enlist on the other side indeed with the single exception of the general unfitness of a union between two of unequal station there be nothing to discredit she choice if that may be term choice which after all be more the result of spontaneous feeling and secret sympathy than of any other cause unless it be a certain equivocal reserve and a manifest uneasiness whenever allusion be make to the early history and to the family of the soldier this sensitiveness on the part of sigismund have be observe and comment on by other as well as by herself and it have be openly ascribe to the mortification of one who have be throw by chance into a intimate association that be much superior to what he be entitle to maintain by birth a weakness but too common and which few have strength of mind to resist or sufficient pride to overcome the intuitive watchfulness of affection however lead adelheid to a different conclusion she see that he never affect to conceal while with equal good taste he abstain from obtrusive allusion to the humble nature of he origin but she also perceive that there be point of he previous history on which he be acutely sensitive and which at first she fear must be attribute to the consciousness of act that he clear perception of moral truth condemn and which he could wish forget for some time adelheid clung to this discovery as to a healthful and proper antidote to she own truant inclination but native rectitude banish a suspicion which have no sufficient ground as equally unworthy of they both the effect of a ceaseless mental struggle and of the fruitlessness of she effort to overcome she tenderness in behalf of sigismund have be describe in the fading of she bloom in the painful solicitude of a countenance naturally so sweet and in the settle melancholy of she playful and mellow eye these be the real cause of the journey undertake by she father and in truth of most of the other event which we be about to describe the prospect of the future have undergo a sudden change the color though more the effect of excitement than of return health -- for he tide of life when rudely check do not resume its current at the first breath of happiness -- again brighten she cheek and impart brilliancy to she look and smile steal easily to those lip which have long be grow pallid with anxiety she lean forward from the balcony and never before have the air of she native mountain seem so balmy and healing at that moment the subject of she thought appear on the verdant declivity among the luxuriant nut-tree that shade the natural lawn of blonay he salute she respectfully and point to the glorious panorama of the leman the heart of adelheid beat violently she struggle for a instant with she fear and she pride and then for the first time in she life she make a signal that she wish he to join she notwithstanding the important service that the young soldier have render to the daughter of the baron de willading and the long intimacy which have be its fruit so great have be the reserve she have hitherto maintain by place a constant restraint on she inclination though the simple usage of switzerland permit greater familiarity of intercourse than be elsewhere accord to maiden of rank that sigismund at first stand root to the ground for he could not imagine the wave of the hand be mean for he adelheid see he embarrassment and the signal be repeat the young man spring up the acclivity with the rapidity of the wind and disappear behind the wall of the castle the barrier of reserve so long and so success fully observe by adelheid be now pass and she feel as if a few short minute must decide she fate the necessity of make a wide circuit in order to enter the court still afford a little time for reflection however and this she endeavor to improve by collect she thought and recover she self-possession when sigismund enter the knight ' hall he find the maiden still seat near the open window of the balcony pale and serious but perfectly calm and with such a expression of radiant happiness in she countenance as he have not see reign in those sweet lineament for many painful month the first feeling be that of pleasure at perceive how well she bear the alarm and danger of the past night this pleasure he express with the frankness admit by the habit of the german thou wilt not suffer adelheid by the exposure on the lake he say study she face until the tell-tale blood steal to she very temple agitation of the mind be a good antidote to the consequence of bodily exposure so far from suffer by what have pass i feel stronger to-day and better able to endure fatigue than at any time since we come through the gate of willade this balmy air to I seem italy and i see no necessity to journey farther in search of what they say be necessary to my health agreeable object and a generous sun you will not cross the st bernard he exclaim in a tone of disappointment adelheid smile and he feel encouraged though the smile be ambiguous notwithstanding the really noble sincerity of the maiden 's disposition and she earnest desire to set he heart at ease nature or habit or education for we scarcely know to which the weakness ought to be ascribe tempt she to avoid a direct explanation why need one desire aught that be more lovely than this she answer evasively here be a warm air such a scene as italy can scarcely surpass and a friendly roof the experience of the last twenty-four hour give little encouragement for attempt the st bernard notwithstanding the fair promise of hospitality and welcome that have be so liberally hold out by the good canon thy eye contradict thy tongue adelheid thou art happy and well enough to use pleasantry to-day for heaven 's sake do not neglect to profit by this advantage however under a mistaken opinion that blonay be the well-sheltered pisa when the winter shall arrive thou wilt see that these mountain be still the icy alp and the wind will whistle through this crazy castle as they be wont to sing in the naked corridor of willade we have time before we and can think of this thou wilt proceed to milan no doubt as soon as the revel of vévey be end the soldier have little choice but duty my long and frequent leaf of absence of late -- leave that have be liberally grant to I on account of important family-concern -- impose a additional obligation to be punctual that i may not seem forgetful of favor already enjoy although we all owe a heavy debt to nature we voluntary engagement have ever seem to I the most serious adelheid listen with breathless attention never before have he utter the word family in reference to himself in she presence the allusion appear to have create unpleasant recollection in the mind of the young man himself for when he cease to speak he countenance fell and he even appear to be fast forget the presence of he fair companion the latter turn sensitively from a subject which she see give he pain and endeavor to call he thought to other thing by a unforeseen fatality the very expedient adopt hasten the explanation she would now have give so much to postpone my father have often extol the site of the baron de blonay 's castle say adelheid gaze from the window though all the fair object of the view float unheeded before she eye : but until now i have always suspect that friendly feeling have a great influence on he description you do he injustice then answer sigismund advance to the opening : of all the ancient hold of switzerland blonay be perhaps entitle to the palm for possess the fairest site regard yon treacherous lake adelheid can we fancy that sleep mirror the same boiling cauldron on which we be so lately toss helpless and nearly hopeless hopeless sigismund but for thee thou forgett ` st the daring italian without whose coolness and skill we must indeed have irredeemably perished and what would it be to I if the worthless bark be save while my father and he friend be abandon to the frightful fate that befall the patron and that unhappy peasant of berne the pulse of the young man beat high for there be a tenderness in the tone of adelheid to which he be unaccustomed and which indeed he have never before discover in she voice i will go seek this brave mariner he say tremble lest he self-command should be again lose by the seduction of such a communion : -- it be time he have more substantial proof of we gratitude no sigismund return the maiden firmly and in a way to chain he to the spot thou must not quit I yet -- i have much to say -- much that touch my future happiness and i be perhaps weak enough to believe thine sigismund be bewilder for the manner of he companion though the color go and come in sudden and bright flash across she pure brow be miraculously calm and full of dignity he take the seat to which she silently point and sit motionless as if carve in stone he faculty absorb in the single sense of hearing adelheid see that the crisis be arrive and that retreat without a appearance of levity that she character and pride equally forbid be impossible the inbred and perhaps the inherent feeling of she sex would now have cause she again to avoid the explanation at least as come from herself but that she be sustain by a high and holy motive thou must find great delight sigismund in reflect on thine own good act to other but for thee melchior de willading would have long since be childless and but for thee he daughter would now be a orphan the knowledge that thou hast have the power and the will to succor thy friend must be worth all other knowledge as connect with thee adelheid it be he answer in a low voice : i would not exchange the secret happiness of have be of this use to thee and to those thou lovest for the throne of the powerful prince i serve i have have my secret wrest from I already and it be vain attempt to deny it if i would thou knowest i love thee and in spite of myself my heart cherish the weakness i rather rejoice than dread to say that it will cherish it until it cease to feel this be more than i ever intend to repeat to thy modest ear which ought not to be wound by idle declaration like these but -- thou smilest -- adelheid -- can thy gentle spirit mock at a hopeless passion why should my smile mean mockery adelheid -- nay -- this never can be one of my birth -- my ignoble nameless origin can not even intimate he wish with honor to a lady of thy name and expectation sigismund it _ can _ be thou hast not well calculate either the heart of adelheid de willading or the gratitude of she father the young man gaze earnestly at the face of the maiden which now that she have disburden she soul of its most secret thought redden to the temple more however with excitement than with shame for she meet he ardent look with the mild confidence of innocence and affection she believe and she have every reason so to believe that she word would give pleasure and with the jealous watchfulness of true love she would not willingly let a single expression of happiness escape she but instead of the brighten eye and the sudden expression of joy that she expect the young man appear overwhelm with feeling of a very opposite and indeed of the most painful character he breathing be difficult he look wander and he lip be convulse he pass he hand across he brow like a man in intense agony and a cold perspiration break out as by a dreadful inward working of the spirit upon he forehead and temple in large visible drop adelheid -- dearest adelheid -- thou knowest not what thou sayest -- one like I can never become thy husband sigismund -- why this distress speak to I -- ease thy mind by word i swear to thee that the consent of my father be accompany on my part by a willing heart i love thee sigismund -- wouldst thou have I -- can i say more the young man gaze at she incredulously and then as think become more clear as one regard a much-prized object that be hopelessly lose he shake he head mournfully and bury he face in he hand say no more adelheid -- for my sake -- for thine own sake say no more -- in mercy be silent thou never canst be mine -- no no -- honor forbid it in thee it would be madness in I dishonor -- we can never be unite what fatal weakness have keep I near thee -- i have long dread this -- dreaded nay do not repeat my word -- for i scarce know what i say thou and thy father have yield in a moment of vivid gratitude to a generous a noble impulse -- but it be not for I to profit by the accident that have enable I to gain this advantage what would all of thy blood all of the republic say adelheid be the noblest bear the best endowed the fairest gentlest best maiden of the canton to wed a nameless houseless soldier of fortune who have but he sword and some gift of nature to recommend he thy excellent father will surely think better of this and we will speak of it no more be i to listen to the common feeling of my sex sigismund this reluctance to accept what both my father and myself offer might cause I to feign displeasure but between thee and I there shall be naught but holy truth my father have well weigh all these objection and he have generously decide to forget they as for I place in the scale against thy merit they have never weigh at all if thou canst not become noble in order that we may be equal i shall find more happiness in descend to thy level than by live in heartless misery at the vain height where i have be place by accident bless ingenuous girl -- but what do it all avail we marriage be impossible if thou knowest of any obstacle that would render it improper for a weak but virtuous girl -- hold adelheid -- do not finish the sentence i be sufficiently humble -- sufficiently debased -- without this cruel suspicion then why be we union impossible -- when my father not only consent but wish it may take place give I time for thought -- thou shalt know all adelheid sooner or later yes this be at the least due to thy noble frankness thou shouldst in justice have know it long before adelheid regard he in speechless apprehension for the evident and violent physical struggle of the young man too fearfully announce the mental agony he endure the color have flee from she own face in which the beauty of expression now reign undisputed distress but it be the expression of the mingled sentiment of wonder dread tenderness and alarm he see that he own suffering be fast communicate themselves to he companion and by a powerful effort he so far master he emotion as to regain a portion of he self-command this explanation have be too heedlessly delay he continue : cost what it may it shall be no longer postpone thou wilt not accuse I of cruelty or of dishonest silence but remember the fail of human nature and pity rather than blame a weakness which may be the cause of as much future sorrow to thyself beloved adelheid as it be now of bitter regret to I i have never conceal from thee that my birth be derive from that class which throughout europe be believe to be of inferior rights to thine own on this head i be proud rather than humble for the invidious distinction of usage have too often provoke comparison and i have be in situation to know that the mere accident of descent bestow neither personal excellence superior courage nor higher intellect though human invention may serve to depress the less fortunate god have give fix limit to the means of man he that would be greater than he kind and illustrious by unnatural expedient must debase other to attain he end by different means than these there be no nobility and he who be unwilling to admit a inferiority which exist only in idea can never be humble by a artifice so shallow on the subject of mere birth as it be ordinarily estimate whether it come from pride or philosophy or the habit of command as a soldier those who might be deem my superior as man i have never be very sensitive perhaps the heavier disgrace which crush I may have cause this want to appear lighter than it otherwise might disgrace repeat adelheid in a voice that be nearly choke the word be fearful come from one of thy regulate mind and as apply to himself i can not choose another disgrace it be by the common consent of man -- by long and enduing opinion -- it would almost seem by the just judgment of god dost thou not believe adelheid that there be certain race which be deem accursed to answer some great and unseen end -- race on whom the holy blessing of heaven never descend as they visit the meek and well-deserving that come of other line how can i believe this gross injustice on the part of a power that be wise without bound and forgive to parental love thy answer would be well be this earth the universe or this state of be the last but he whose sight extend beyond the grave who fashion justice and mercy and goodness on a scale commensurate with he own attribute and not accord to we limited means be not to be estimate by the narrow rule that we apply to man no we must not measure the ordinance of god by law that be plausible in we own eye justice be a relative and not a abstract quality and until we understand the relation of the deity to ourselves as well as we understand we own relation to the deity we reason in the dark i do not like to hear thee speak thus sigismund and least of all with a brow so clouded and in a voice so hollow i will tell my tale more cheerfully dearest i have no right to make thee the partner of my misery and yet this be the manner i have reason and think and ponder -- ay until my brain have grow heated and the power to reason itself have nearly totter ever since that accursed hour in which the truth become know to I and i be make the master of the fatal secret have i endeavor to feel and reason thus what truth -- what secret -- if thou lovest I sigismund speak calmly and without reserve the young man gaze at she anxious face in a way to show how deeply he feel the weight of the blow he be about to give then after a pause he continue we have lately pass through a terrible scene together dearest adelheid it be one that may well lessen the distance set between we by human law and the tyranny of opinion have it be the will of god that the bark should perish what a confused crowd of ill-assorted spirit would have pass together into eternity we have they there of all degree of vice as of nearly all degree of cultivation from the subtle iniquity of the wily neapolitan juggler to thine own pure soul there would have die in the winkelry the noble of high degree the reverend priest the soldier in the pride of he strength and the mendicant death be a uncompromising leveller and the depths of the lake at least might have wash out all we infamy whether it come of real demerit or merely from receive usage even the luckless balthazar the persecute and hate headsman might have find those who would have mourn he loss if any could have die unwept in meet such a fate it must have be one that in common awake so little of human sympathy and one too who by deal himself in the woe of other have less claim to the compassion that we yield to most of we species spare I -- in mercy adelheid spare I -- thou speakest of my father chapter xi fortune have smil would upon guelberto 's birth the heir of valdespesa 's rich domain a only child he grow in year and worth and well repay a father 's anxious pain southey as sigismund utter this communication so terrible to the ear of he listener he arise and flee from the room the possession of a kingdom would not have tempt he to remain and note troubled air and rapid stride as he pass they but too simple to suspect more than the ordinary impetuosity of youth he succeed in get through the inferior gate of the castle and into the field without attract any embarrassing attention to he movement here he begin to breathe more freely and the load which have nearly choke he respiration become lighten for half a hour the young man pace the greensward scarcely conscious whither he go until he find that he step have again lead he beneath the window of the knight ' hall glance a eye upward he see adelheid still seat at the balcony and apparently yet alone he think she have be weep and he curse the weakness which have keep he from effect the often-renewed resolution to remove himself and he cruel fortune for ever from before she mind a second look however show he that he be again beckon to ascend the revolution in the purpose of lover be sudden and easily effect and sigismund through whose mind a dozen ill-digested plan of place the sea between himself and she he love have just be float be now hurriedly retrace he step to she presence adelheid have necessarily be educate under the influence of the prejudice of the age and of the country in which she live the existence of the office of headsman in berne and the nature of its hereditary duty be well know to she : and though superior to the inimical feeling which have so lately be exhibit against the luckless balthazar she have certainly never anticipate a shock so cruel as be now produce by abruptly learn that this despise and persecute be be the father of the youth to whom she have yield she virgin affection when the word which proclaim the connexion have escape the lip of sigismund she listen like one who fancy that she ear deceive she she have prepare herself to learn that he derive he be from some peasant or ignoble artisan and once or twice as he draw nearer to the fatal declaration awkward glimmering of a suspicion that some repulsive moral unworthiness be connect with he origin trouble she imagination but she apprehension could not by possibility once turn in the direction of the revolting truth it be some time before she be able to collect she thought or to reflect on the course it most become she to pursue but as have be see it be long before she could summon the self-command to request what she now see be doubly necessary another meeting with she lover as both have think of nothing but he last word during the short separation there appear no abruptness in the manner in which he resume the discourse on seat himself at she side exactly as if they have not part at all the secret have be tear from I adelheid the headsman of the canton be my father be the fact publicly know the heartless and obdurate law would compel I to be he successor he have no other child except a gentle girl -- one innocent and kind as thou adelheid cover she face with both she hand as if to shut out a view of the horrible truth perhaps a instinctive reluctance to permit she companion to discover how great a blow have be give by this avowal of he birth have also its influence in produce the movement they who have pass the period of youth and who can recall those day of inexperience and hope when the affection be fresh and the heart be untainted with too much communion with the world -- and especially they who know of what a delicate compound of the imaginative and the real the master-passion be form how sensitively it regard all that can reflect credit on the beloved object and with what ingenuity it endeavor to find plausible excuse for every blot that may happen either by accident or demerit to tarnish the lustre of a picture that fancy have so largely aid in draw will understand the rude nature of the shock that she have receive but adelheid de willade though a woman in the liveliness and fervor of she imagination as well as in the proneness to conceive she own ingenuous conception to be more found in reality than a sterner view of thing might possibly have warrant be a woman also in the more generous quality of the heart and in those endure principle which seem to have predispose the better part of the sex to make the heaviest sacrifice rather than be false to they affection while she frame shudder therefore with the violence and abruptness of the emotion she have endure dawning of the right gleam upon she pure mind and it be not long before she be able to contemplate the truth with the steadiness of principle though it might at the same time have be with much of the linger weakness of humanity when she lower she hand she look towards the mute and watchful sigismund with a smile that cause the deadly paleness of she feature to resemble a gleam of the sun lighting upon a spotless peak of she native mountain it would be vain to endeavor to conceal from thee sigismund she say that i could wish this be not so i will confess even more -- that when the truth first break upon I thy repeat service and what be even less pardonable thy try worth be for a instant forget in the reluctance i feel to admit that my fate could ever be unite with one so unhappily situate there be moment when prejudice and habit be stronger than reason but they triumph be short in well-intentioned mind the terrible injustice of we law have never strike I with such force before though last night while those wretched traveller be so eager for the blood of -- of -- my father adelheid of the author of thy be sigismund she continue with a solemnity that prove to the young man how deeply she reverence the tie i be compel to see that society might be cruelly unjust but now i find its law and prohibition visit one like thee so far from join in its oppression my soul revolt against the wrong thanks -- thanks -- a thousand thanks return the young man fervently i do not expect less than this from thee mademoiselle de willading if thou didst not expect more -- far more sigismund resume the maiden she ashen hue brighten to crimson thou hast scarcely be less unjust than the world and i will add thou hast never understand that adelheid de willade whose name be utter with so cold a form we all have moment of weakness moment when the seduction of life the worthless tie which bind together the thoughtless and selfish in what be call the interest of the world appear of more value than aught else i be no visionary to fancy imaginary and factitious obligation superior to those which nature and wisdom have create -- for if there be much unjustifiable cruelty in the practice there be also much that be wise in the ordinance of society -- or to think that a wayward fairy be to be indulge at any and every expense to the feeling and opinion of other on the contrary i well know that so long as man exist in the condition in which they be it be little more than common prudence to respect they habit and that ill-assorted union in general contain in themselves a dangerous enemy to happiness have i always know thy history dread of the consequence or those cold form which protect the fortunate would probably have interpose to prevent either from learn much of the other 's character -- i say not this sigismund as by thy eye i see thou wouldst think in reproach for any deception for i well know the accidental nature of we acquaintance and that the intimacy be force upon thee by we own importunate gratitude but simply and in explanation of my own feeling as it be we be not to judge of we situation by ordinary rule and i be not now to decide on you pretension to my hand merely as the daughter of the baron de willade receive a proposal from one whose birth be not noble but as adelheid should weigh the claim of sigismund subject to some diminution of advantage if thou wilt that be perhaps greater than she have at first anticipated dost thou consider the acceptance of my hand possible after what thou knowest exclaim the young man in open wonder so far from regard the question in that manner i ask myself if it will be right -- if it be possible to reject the preserver of my own life the preserver of my father 's life sigismund steinbach because he be the son of one that man persecute adelheid do not anticipate my word say the maiden calmly but in a way to check he impatience by the quiet dignity of she manner this be a important i might say a solemn decision and it have be present to I suddenly and without preparation thou wilt not think the worse of I for ask time to reflect before i give the pledge-that in my eye will be for ever sacred my father believe thee to be of obscure origin and thoroughly conscious of thy worth dear sigismund authorize I to speak as i do in the beginning of we interview but my father may possibly think the condition of he consent alter by this unhappy exposure of the truth it be meet that i tell he all for thou knowest i must abide by he decision this thine own sense and filial piety will approve in spite of the strong objectionable fact that he have just reveal hope have begin to steal upon the wish of the young man as he listen to the consoling word of the single-minded and affectionate adelheid it would scarcely have be possible for a youth so endowed by nature and one so inevitably conscious of he own value though so modest in its exhibition not to feel encourage by she ingenuous and frank admission as she betray he influence over she happiness in the undisguised and simple manner related but the intention to appeal to she father cause he to view the subject more dispassionately for he strong sense be not slow in point out the difference between the two judge in a case like he trouble he not adelheid the consciousness that he prudence deny what a generous feeling might prompt he to bestow may render he unhappy it be impossible that melchior de willading should consent to give a only child to a son of the headsman of he canton at some other time when the recollection of the late storm shall be less vivid thine own reason will approve of he decision he companion who be thoughtfully lean she spotless brow on she hand do not appeal to hear he word she have recover from the shock give by the sudden announcement of he origin and be now muse intently and with cooler discrimination on the commencement of they acquaintance its progress and all its little incident down to the two grave event which have so gradually and firmly cement the sentiment of esteem and admiration in the stronger and indelible tie of affection if thou art the son of he thou namest why art thou know by the name of steinbach when balthazar bear another demand adelheid anxious to seize even the faintest hold of hope it be my intention to conceal nothing but to lay before thee the history of my life with all the reason that may have influence my conduct return sigismund : at some other time when both be in a calmer state of mind i shall dare to entreat a hearing -- delay be unnecessary -- it might even be improper it be my duty to explain every thing to my father and he may wish to know why thou hast not always appear what thou art do not fancy sigismund that i distrust thy motive but the wariness of the old and the confidence of the young have so little in common -- i would rather that thou tell I now he yield to the mild earnestness of she manner and to the sweet but sad smile with which she second the appeal if thou wilt hear the melancholy history adelheid he say there be no sufficient reason why i should wish to postpone the little it will be necessary to say you be probably familiar with the law of the canton i mean those cruel ordinance by which a particular family be condemn for a better word can scarcely be find to discharge the duty of this revolting office this duty may have be a privilege in the dark age but it be now become a tax that none who have be educate with better hope can endure to pay my father train from infancy to expect the employment and accustom to its discharge in contemplation succeed to he parent while yet young and though form by nature a meek and even a compassionate man he have never shrink from he bloody task whenever require to fulfil they by the command of he superior but touch by a sentiment of humanity it be he wish to avert from I what he better reason lead he to think the calamity of we race i be the eldest bear and strictly i be the child most liable to be call to assume the office but as i have hear the tender love of my mother induce she to suggest a plan by which i at least might be rescue from the odium that have so long be attach to we name i be secretly convey from the house while yet a infant a feigned death conceal the pious fraud and thus far heaven be praise the authority be ignorant of my birth and thy mother sigismund i have great respect for that noble mother who doubtless be endowed with more than she sex 's firmness and constancy since she must have swear faith and love to thy father know he duty and the hopelessness of they be evade i feel a reverence for a woman so superior to the weakness and yet so true to the real and best affection of she sex the young man smile so painfully as to cause he enthusiastic companion to regret that she have put the question my mother be certainly a woman not only to be love but in many particulars deeply to be revere my poor and noble mother have a thousand excellency be a most tender parent with a heart so kind that it would grieve she to see injury do even to the meanest living thing she be not a woman surely intend by god to be the mother of a line of executioner thou seest sigismund say adelheid nearly breathless in the desire to seek a excuse for she own predilection and to lessen the mental agony he endure -- thou seest that one gentle and excellent woman at least could trust she happiness to thy family no doubt she be the daughter of some worthy and just-viewing burgher of the canton that have educate he child to distinguish between misfortune and crime she be a only child and a heiress like thy self adelheid he answer look about he as if he seek some object on which he might cast part of the bitterness that load he heart thou art not less the beloved and cherish of thine own parent than be my excellent mother of she 's sigismund thy manner be startling -- what wouldst thou say neufchâtel and other country besides berne have they privileged my mother be the only child of the headsman of the first thus thou seest adelheid that i boast my quartering as well as another god be praise we be not legally compel however to butcher the condemn of any country but we own the wild bitterness with which this be utter and the energy of he language strike thrilling chord on every nerve of he listener so many honor should not be unsupported he resume we be rich for people of humble wish and have ample means of live without the revenue of we charge -- i love to put forth we long-acquired honor the means of a respectable livelihood be far from be want i have tell you of the kind intention of my mother to redeem one of she child at least from stigma which weigh upon we all and the birth of a second son enable she to effect this charitable purpose without attract attention i be nurse and educate apart for many year in ignorance of my birth at a suitable age notwithstanding the early death of my brother i be send to seek advancement in the service of the house of austrium under the feigned name i bear i will not tell thee the anguish i feel adelheid when the truth be at length reveal of all the cruelty inflict by society there be none so unrighteous in its nature as the stigma it entail in the succession of crime or misfortune : of all its favor none can find so little justification in right and reason as the privilege accord to the accident of descent and yet we be much accustomed to honor those that come of a ancient line and to see some part of the glory of the ancestor even in the most remote descendant the more remote the greater be the world 's deference what better proof can we have of the world 's weakness thus the immediate child of the hero he whose blood be certain who bear the image of the father in he face who have listen to he counsel and may be suppose to have derive at least some portion of he greatness from the nearness of he origin be less a prince than he who have imbibe the current through a hundred vulgar stream and be truth but know may have no natural claim at all upon the much-prized blood this come of artfully lead the mind to prejudice and of a vicious longing in man to forget he origin and destiny by wish to be more than nature ever intend he should become surely sigismund there be something justifiable in the sentiment of desire to belong to the good and noble if good and noble be the same thou hast well designate the feeling so long as it be truly a sentiment it be not only excusable but wise for who would not wish to come of the brave and honest and learn or by what other greatness they may be know -- it be wise since the legacy of he virtue be perhaps the dearest incentive that a good man have for struggle against the current of baser interest but what hope be leave to one like I who find himself so place that he can neither inherit nor transmit aught but disgrace i do not affect to despise the advantage of birth simply because i do not possess they i only complain that artful combination have pervert what should be sentiment and taste into a narrow and vulgar prejudice by which the really ignoble enjoy privilege greater than those perhaps who be worthy of the highest honor man can bestow adelheid have encourage the digression which with one less gifted with strong good sense than sigismund might have only serve to wind he pride but she perceive that he ease he mind by thus draw on he reason and by set up that which should be in opposition to that which be thou knowest she answer that neither my father nor i be dispose to lay much stress on the opinion of the world as it concern thee that be neither will insist on nobility but will either consent to share the obloquy of a union with a hereditary executioner thou hast not yet related all it may be necessary to know that we may decide there be leave little to explain the expedient of my kind parent have thus far succeed they two survive child my sister and myself be snatch for a time at least from they accursed fortune while my poor brother who promise little be leave by a partiality i will not stop to examine to pass as the inheritor of we infernal privilege -- nay pardon dearest adelheid i will be more cool but death have save the youth from the execrable duty and i be now the only male child of balthazar -- yes he add laugh frightfully i too have now a narrow monopoly of all the honor of we house thou -- thou sigismund -- with thy habit thy education thy feeling thou surely canst not be require to discharge the duty of this horrible office it be easy to see that my high privilege do not charm you mademoiselle de willading nor can i wonder at the taste my chief surprise should be that you so long tolerate a executioner in you presence do i not know and understand the bitterness of feeling natural to one so place this language would cruelly hurt I sigismund but thou canst not truly mean there be a real danger of thy ever be call to execute this duty should there be the chance of such a calamity may not the influence of my father avert it he be not without weight in the council of the canton at present he friendship need not be tax for none but my parent my sister and thou adelheid be acquaint with the fact i have just related my poor sister be a artless but a unhappy girl for the well-intentioned design of we mother have greatly disqualify she from bear the truth as she might have do have it be keep constantly before she eye to the world a young kinsman of my father appear destine to succeed he and there the matter must stand until fortune shall decide differently as respects my poor sister there be some little hope that the evil may be altogether avert she be on the point of a marriage here at vévey that may be the means of conceal she origin in new tie as for I time must decide my fate why should the truth be ever know exclaimed adelheid nearly gasp for breath in she eagerness to propose some expedient that should rescue sigismund for ever from so odious a office thou sayest that there be ample means in thy family -- relinquish all to this youth on condition that he assume thy place i would gladly beggar myself to be quit of it -- nay thou wilt not be a beggar while there be wealth among the de willadings let the final decision in respect to other thing be what it may this can we at least promise my sword will prevent I from be under the necessity of accept the boon thou wouldst offer with this good sword i can always command a honorable existence should providence save I from the disgrace of exchange it for that of the executioner but there exist a obstacle of which thou hast not yet hear my sister who have certainly no admiration for the honor that have humiliate we race for so many generation -- i might say age -- have we not ancient honor adelheid as well as thou -- my sister be contract to one who bargain for eternal secrecy on this point as the condition of he accept the hand and ample dowry of one of the gentlest of human being thou seest that other be not as generous as thyself adelheid my father anxious to dispose of he child have consent to the term and as the youth who be next in succession to the family-honor be little disposed to accept they and have already some suspicion of the deception as respects she i may be compel to appear in order to protect the offspring of my unoffending sister from the curse this be assail adelheid in a point where she be the weakest one of she generous temperament and self-denying habit could scarce entertain the wish of exact that from another which she be not willing to undergo herself and the hope that have just be revive in she heart be nearly extinguish by the discovery still she be so much in the habit of feeling under the guidance of she excellent sense and it be so natural to cling to she just wish while there be a reasonable chance of they be accomplish that she do not despair thy sister and she future husband know she birth and understand the chance they run she know all this and such be she generosity that she be not dispose to betray I in order to serve herself but this self-denial form a additional obligation on my part to declare myself the wretch i be i can not say that my sister be accustom to regard we long-endured fortune with all the horror i feel for she have be longer acquaint with the fact and the domestic habit of she sex have leave she less expose to the encounter of the world 's hatred and perhaps she be partly ignorant of all the odium we sustain my long absence in foreign service delay the confidence as respects myself while the yearning of a mother towards a only daughter cause she to be receive into the family though still in secret several year before i be tell the truth she be also much my junior and all these cause with some difference in we education have less dispose she to misery than i be for while my father with a cruel kindness have I well and even liberally instruct christine be teach as better become the hope and origin of both now tell I adelheid that thou hatest I for my parentage and despisest I for have so long dare to intrude on thy company with the full consciousness of what i be for ever present to my thought i like not to hear thee make these bitter allusion to a accident of this nature sigismund be i to tell thee that i do not feel this circumstance with nearly if not quite as much poignancy as thyself add the ingenuous girl with a noble frankness i should do injustice to my gratitude and to my esteem for thy character but there be more elasticity in the heart of woman than in that of thy imperious and proud sex so far from thinking of thee as thou wouldst fain believe i see naught but what be natural and justifiable in thy reserve remember thou hast not tempt my ear by profession and prayer as woman be commonly entreat but that the interest i feel in thee have be modestly and fairly win i can neither say nor hear more at present for this unexpected announcement have in some degree unsettled my mind leave I to reflect on what i ought to do and rest assure that thou canst not have a kinder or more partial advocate of what truly belong to thy honor and happiness than my own heart as the daughter of melchior de willading conclude she extend she hand with affection to the young man who press it against he breast with manly tenderness when he slowly and reluctantly withdraw chapter xii to know no more be woman 's happiest knowledge and she praise milton we heroine be a woman in the best meaning of that endearing and we might add comprehensive word sensitive reserved and at time even timid on point that do not call for the exercise of higher quality she be firm in she principle constant as she be fond in she affection and self-devoted when duty and inclination unite to induce the concession to a degree that place the idea of sacrifice out of the question on the other hand the liability to receive lively impression a distinctive feature of she sex and the aptitude to attach importance to the usage by which she be surround and which be necessarily greatest in those who lead secluded and inactive life render it additionally difficult for she mind to escape from the trammel of opinion and to think with indifference of circumstance which all near she treat with high respect or to which they attach a stigma ally to disgust have the case be reverse have sigismund be noble and adelheid a headsman 's child it be probable the young man might have find the means to indulge he passion without make too great a sacrifice of he pride by transport he wife to he castle confer he own established name separate she from all that be unpleasant and degrading in the connexion and finding occupation for he own mind in the multiply and engrossing employment of he station he would have diminish motive for contemplate and consequently for lament the objectionable feature of the alliance he have make these be the advantage which nature and the law of society give to man over the weaker but the truer sex : and yet how few would have have sufficient generosity to make even the sacrifice of feeling which such a course require on the other hand adelheid would be compel to part with the ancient and distinguished appellation of she family to adopt one which be deem infamous in the canton or if some politic expedient be find to avert this first disgrace it would unavoidably be of a nature to attract rather than to avert the attention of all who know the fact from the humiliating character of he origin she have no habitual relief against the constant action of she thought for the sphere of woman narrow the affection in such a way as to render they most dependent on the little accident of domestic life she could not close she door against communication with the kinsman of she husband should it be he pleasure to command or he feeling to desire it and it would become obligatory on she to listen to the still but never-ceasing voice of duty and to forget at he request that she have ever be more fortunate or that she be bear for better hope we do not say that all these calculation cross the mind of the muse maiden though she certainly have a general and vague view of the consequence that be likely to be draw upon herself by a connexion with sigismund she sit motionless bury in deep thought long after he disappearance the young man have pass by the postern around the base of the castle and be descend the mountain-side across the sloping meadow with rapid step and probably for the first time since they acquaintance she eye follow he manly figure vacantly and with indifference she mind be too intently occupy for the usual observation of the sens the whole of that grand and lovely landscape be spread before she without convey impression as we gaze into the void of the firmament with we look on vacuum sigismund have disappear among the wall of the vineyard when she arise and draw such a sigh as be apt to escape we after long and painful meditation but the eye of the high-minded girl be bright and she cheek flush while the whole of she feature wear a expression of loftier beauty than ordinarily distinguish even she loveliness she own resolution be form she have decide with the rare and generous self-devotion of a female heart that love and which can love in its freshness and purity but once at that instant footstep be hear in the corridor and the three old noble whom we so lately leave on the castle-terrace appear together in the knight ' hall melchior de willading approach he daughter with a joyous face for he too have lately gain what he conceive to be a glorious conquest over he prejudice and the victory put he in excellent humor with himself the question be for ever decide he say kiss the burning forehead of adelheid with affection and rub he hand in the manner of one who be glad to be free from a perplexing doubt these good friend agree with I that in a case like this it become even we birth to forget the origin of the youth he who have save the life of the two last of the willading at least deserve to have some share in what be leave of they here be my good grimaldus too ready to beard I if i will not consent to let he enrich the brave fellow -- as if we be beggar and have not the means of support we kinsman in credit at bear but we will not be indebted even to so try a friend for a tittle of we happiness the work shall be all we own even to the letter of nobility which i shall command at a early day from vienna for it would be cruel to let the noble fellow want so simple a advantage which will at once raise he to we own level and make he as good -- ay by the beard of luther better than the best man in berne i have never know thee niggardly before though i have know thee often well intrenched behind swiss frugality say the signor grimaldus laugh thy life my dear melchior may have excellent value in thine own eye but i be little disposed to set so mean a price on my own as thou appearest to think it should command thou hast decide well i will say nobly in the best meaning of the word in consent to receive this brave sigismund as a son but thou art not to think young lady because this body of mine be get the worse for use that i hold it altogether worthless and that it be to be drag from yonder lake like so much foul linen and no question be to be ask touch the manner in which the service have be do i claim to portion thy husband that he may at least make a appearance that become the son-in-law of melchior de willading be i of no value that ye treat I so unceremoniously as to say i shall not pay for my own preservation have it thine own way good gaetano -- have it as thou wilt so thou dost but leave we the youth -- father -- i will have no maidenly affectation adelheid i expect thee to receive the husband we offer with as good a grace as if he wear a crown it have be agree upon between we that sigismund steinbach be to be my son and from time immemorial the daughter of we house have submit in these affair to what have be advise by the wisdom of they senior as become they sex and inexperience the three old man have enter the hall full of good-humor and it would have be sufficiently apparent by the manner of the baron de willade that he trifle with adelheid have it not be well know to the other that she feeling be chiefly consult in the choice that have just be make but notwithstanding the high glee in which the father speak the pleasure and buoyancy of he manner do not communicate itself to the child as quickly as he could wish there be far more than virgin embarrassment in the mien of adelheid she color go and come and she look turn from one to the other painfully while she struggle to speak the signor grimaldus whisper to he companion and roger de blonay discreetly withdraw under the pretence that he service be need at vévey where active preparation be make for the abbaye des vignerons the genoese would then have follow he example but the baron hold he arm while he turn a inquire eye towards he daughter as if command she to deal more frankly with he father say adelheid in a voice that shake in spite of the effort to control she feeling i have something important to communicate before this acceptance of herr steinbach be a matter irrevocably determine speak freely my child this be a try friend and one entitle to know all that concern we especially in this affair throw aside all pleasantry i trust adelheid that we be to have no girlish trifling with a youth like sigismund to whom we owe so much even to we life and in whose behalf we should be ready to sacrifice every feeling of prejudice or habit -- all that we possess ay even to we pride all father i have say all i will not take back a letter of the word though it should rob I of willade my rank in the canton and a ancient name to boot be i not right gaetano i place the happiness of the boy above all other consideration that of adelheid be understand to be so intimately blended with he i repeat it therefore all it would be well to hear what the young lady have to say before we urge this affair any farther say the signor grimaldus who have achieve no conquest over himself be not quite so exuberant in he exultation as he friend observe more calmly and note what he see with the clearness of a cooler-headed and more sagacious man i be much in error or thy daughter have that which be serious to communicate the paternal affection of melchior now take the alarm and he give a eager attention to he child adelheid return he evident solicitude by a smile of love but its painful expression be so unequivocal as to heighten the baron 's fear art not well love it can not be that we have be deceive -- that some peasant 's daughter be think worthy to supplant thee ha -- signor grimaldus this matter begin in sooth to seem offensive -- but old as i be -- well we shall never know the truth unless thou speakest frankly -- this be a rare business after all gaetano -- that a daughter of mine should be repulse by a hind adelheid make a implore gesture for she father to forbear while she resume she seat from farther inability to stand the two anxious old man follow she example in wonder silence thou dost both the honor and modesty of sigismund great injustice father resume the maiden after a pause and speak with a calmness of manner that surprised even herself if thou and this excellent and try friend will give I you attention for a few minute nothing shall be conceal she companion listen in wonder for they plainly see that the matter be more grave than either have at first imagine adelheid pause again to summon force for the ungrateful duty and then she succinctly but clearly related the substance of sigismund 's communication both the listener eagerly catch each syllable that fall from the quiver lip of the maiden for she tremble notwithstanding a struggle to be calm that be almost superhuman and when she voice cease they gaze at each other like man suddenly astounded by some dire and totally unexpected calamity the baron in truth could scarcely believe that he have not be deceive by a defective hearing for age have begin a little to impair that useful faculty while he friend admit the word as one receive impression of the most revolting and disheartening nature this be a damnable and fearful fact mutter the latter when adelheid have altogether cease to speak do she say that sigismund be the son of balthazar the public headsman of the canton ask the father of he friend in the way that one reluctantly assure himself of some half-comprehended and unwelcome truth -- of balthazar -- of that family accurse such be the parentage it have be the will of god to bestow on the preserver of we life meekly answer adelheid have the villain dare to steal into my family-circle conceal this disgusting and disgraceful fact -- have he endeavor to engraft the impurity of he source on the untarnished stock of a noble and ancient family there be something exceed mere duplicity in this signor grimaldus there be a dark and meaning crime there be that which much exceed we means of remedy good melchior but let we not rashly blame the boy whose birth be rather to be imputed to he as a misfortune than as a crime if he be a thousand balthazar he have save all we life thou sayest true -- thou sayest no more than the truth thou wert always of a more reasonable brain than i though thy more southern origin would seem to contradict it here then be all we fine fancy and liberal scheme of generosity blow to the wind that be not so evident return the genoese who have not fail the while to study the countenance of adelheid as if he would fully ascertain she secret wish there have be much discourse fair adelheid between thee and the youth on this matter signora there have i be about to communicate the intention of my father for the circumstance in which we be place the weight of we many obligation the usual distance which rank interpose between the noble and the simply bear perhaps justified this boldness in a maiden she add though the tell-tale blood reveal she shame i be make sigismund acquaint with my father 's wish when he meet my confidence by the avowal which i have just relate he deem he birth -- a insuperable barrier to the connexion sigismund steinbach though so little favored in the accident of he origin be not a beggar to sue for that which he own generous feeling would condemn and thou adelheid lower she eye and seem to reflect on the nature of she answer thou wilt pardon this curiosity which may wear too much the aspect of unwarrantable meddling but my age and ancient friendship the recent occurrence and a grow love for all that concern thee must plead my excuse unless we know thy wish daughter neither melchior nor i can act as we might wish adelheid be long and thoughtfully silent though every sentiment of she heart and all that inclination which be the offspring of the warm and poetical illusion of love tempt she to declare a readiness to sacrifice every other consideration to the engrossing and pure affection of woman opinion with its iron gripe still hold she in suspense on the propriety of brave the prejudice of the world the timidity of that sex which however ready to make a offering of its most cherish privilege on the shrine of connubial tenderness shrink with a keen sensitiveness from the appearance of a forward devotion to the other have its weight also nor could a child so pious altogether forget the effect she decision might have on the future happiness of she sole survive parent the genoese understand the struggle though he foresee its termination and he resume the discourse himself partly with the kind wish to give the maiden time to reflect maturely before she answer and partly follow a very natural train of he own thought there be naught sure in this fickle state of be he continue neither the throne nor riches nor health nor even the sacred affection be secure against change well may we pause then and weigh every chance of happiness ere we take the last and final step in any great or novel measure thou knowest the hope with which i enter life melchior and the chill disappointment with which my career be likely to close no youth be bear to fairer hope nor do italy know one more joyous than myself the morning i receive the hand of angiolina and yet two short year see all those hope wither this joyousness go and a cloud throw across my prospects which have never disappear a widow husband a childless father may not prove a bad counsellor my friend in a moment when there be so much doubt beset thee and thine thy mind naturally return to thine own unhappy child poor gaetano when there be so much question of the fortune of mine the signor grimaldus turn he look on he friend but the gleam of anguish which be wont to pass athwart he countenance when he mind be draw powerfully towards that painful subject betray that he be not just then able to reply we see in all these event continue the genoese as if too full of he subject to restrain he word the unsearchable design of providence here be a youth who be all that a father could desire worthy in every sense to be the depository of a beloved and only daughter 's weal manly brave virtuous and noble in all but the chance of blood and yet so accursed by the world 's opinion that we might scarce venture to name he as the associate of a idle hour be the fact know that he be the man he have declare himself to be you put the matter in strong language signor grimaldus say adelheid start a youth of a form so command that a king might exult at the prospect of he crown descend on such a head of a perfection of strength and masculine excellence that will almost justify the dangerous exultation of health and vigor of a reason that be riper than he year of a virtue of proof of all quality that we respect and which come of study and not of accident and yet a youth condemn of man to live under the reproach of they hatred and contempt or to conceal for ever the name of the mother that bear he compare this sigismund with other that may be name with the high-born and pampered heir of some illustrious house who riot in man 's respect while he shock man 's moral who presume on privilege to trifle with the sacred and the just who live for self and that in base enjoyment who be fitter to be the lunatic 's companion than any other 's though destine to rule in the council who be the type of the wicked though call to preside over the virtuous who can not be esteem though entitle to be honor and let we ask why this be so what be the wisdom which have draw difference so arbitrary and which while proclaim the necessity of justice so openly so wantonly and so ingeniously set its plainest dictate at defiance signora it should not be thus -- god never intend it should be so while every principle would seem to say that each must stand or fall by he own good or evil deed that man be to be honor as they merit every device of human institution be exert to achieve the opposite this be exalt because he ancestry be noble that condemn for no better reason than that he be bear vile melchior melchior we reason be unhinge by subtlety and we boast philosophy and right be no more than unblushing mockery at which the very devil laugh and yet the commandment of god tell we gaetano that the sin of the father shall be visit on the descendant from generation to generation you of rome pay not this close attention perhaps to sacred writ but i have hear it say that we have not in berne a law for which good warranty can not be find in the holy volume itself ay there be sophist to prove all that they wish the crime and folly of the ancestor leave they physical or even they moral taint on the child beyond a question good melchior -- but be not this sufficient be we blasphemously even impiously to pretend that god have not sufficiently provide for the punishment of the breach of he wise ordinance that we must come forward to second they by arbitrary and heartless rule of we own what crime be imputable to the family of this youth beyond that of poverty which probably drive the first of he race to the execution of they revolting office there be little in the mien or moral of sigismund to denote the visitation of heaven 's wise decree but there be everything in he present situation to proclaim the injustice of man and dost thou gaetano grimaldi the ally of so many ancient and illustrious house -- thou gaetano grimaldi the honor of genoa -- dost thou counsel I to give my only child the heiress of my land and name to the son of the public executioner nay to the very heritor of he disgusting duty there thou hast I on the hip melchior the question be put strongly and need reflection for a answer oh why be this balthazar so rich in offspring and i so poor but we will not press the matter it be a affair of many side and should be judge by we as man as well as noble daughter thou hast just learn by the word of thy father that i be against thee by position and heritage for while i condemn the principle of this wrong i can not overlook its effect and never before do a case of as tangled difficulty one in which right be so palpably oppose by opinion present itself for my judgment leave we that we may command ourselves the require decision exact much care and greater mastery of ourselves than i can exercise with that sweet pale face of thine appeal so eloquently to my heart in behalf of the noble boy adelheid arise and first offer she marble-like brow to the salutation of both she parent for the ancient friendship and strong sympathy of the genoese give he a claim to this appellation in she affection at least she silently withdraw as to the conversation which ensue between the old noble we momentarily drop the curtain to proceed to other incident of we narrative it may however be generally observe that the day pass quietly away without the occurrence of any event which it be necessary to relate all in the château with the exception of the traveller be principally occupy by the approach festivity the signor grimaldus seek a occasion to have a long and confidential communication with sigismund who on he part carefully avoid be see again by she who have so great a influence on he feeling until both have time to recover they self-command chapter xiii hold hurt he not for god 's sake -- he be mad comedy of error the festival of bacchus be suppose to have be the model of those long-continued festivity which be still know in switzerland by the name of the abbaye des vigneron this fête be originally of a simple and rustic character be far from possess the labored ceremony and classical allegory of a later day the severity of monkish discipline most probably prohibit the introduction of allusion to the heathen mythology as be afterwards practice for certain religious community that be the proprietor of large vineyard in that vicinity appear to have be the first known patron of the custom so long as a severe simplicity reign in the festivity they be annually observe but when heavier expense and greater preparation become necessary longer interval succeed the abbaye at first cause its festival to become triennial and subsequently extend the period of vacation to six year as greater time be obtain for the collection of means and inclination the festival gain in _ éclat _ until it come at length to be a species of jubilee to which the idle the curious and the observant of all the adjacent territory be accustom to resort in crowd the town of vévey profit by the circumstance the usual motive of interest be enlist in behalf of the usage and down to the epoch of the great european revolution there would seem to have be a unbroken succession of the fêtes the occasion to which there have so often be allusion be one of the regular and long-expected festival and as report have speak largely of the preparation the attendance be even more numerous than usual early on the morning of the second day after the arrival of we traveller at the neighbor castle of blonay a body of man dress in the guise of halberdier a species of troops then know in most of the court of europe march into the great square of vévey take possession of all its center and post its sentry in such a manner as to interdict the usual passage of the place this be the preliminary step in the come festivity for this be the spot choose for the scene of most of the ceremony of the day the curious be not long behind the guard and by the time the sun have fairly arise above the hill of fribourg some thousand of spectator be press in and about the avenue of the square and boat from the opposite shore of savoy be arrive at each instant crowd to the water 's edge with peasant and they family near the upper end of the square capacious scaffolding have be erect to contain those who be privileged by rank or those who be able to buy honor with the vulgar medium while humbler preparation for the less fortunate complete the three side of a space that be in the form of a parallelogram and which be intend to receive the actor in the coming scene the side next the water be unoccupied though a forest of latine spar and a platform of deck more than supply the deficiency of scaffolding and room music be hear from time to time intermingled or relieve by those wild alpine cry which characterize the song of the mountaineer the authority of the town be early afoot and as be customary with the important agent of small concern they be exercise they municipal function with a bustle which of itself contain reasonable evidence that they be of no great moment and a gravity of mien with which the chief of a state might have believe it possible to dispense the estrade or stage erect for the superior class of spectator be decorate with flag and a portion near its center have a fair display of tapestry and silken hanging the chateau-looking edifice near the bottom of the square and whose window accord to a common swiss and german usage show the intermingled stripe that denote it to be public property be also gay in color for the ensign of the republic float over its pointed roof and rich silk wave against the wall this be the official residence of peter hofmeister the functionary whom we have already introduce to the reader a hour later a shot give the signal for the various _ troupe _ to appear and soon after party of the different actor arrive in the square as the little procession approach to the sound of the trumpet or horn curiosity become more active and the populace be permit to circulate in those portion of the square that be not immediately require for other purpose about this time a solitary individual appear on the stage he seem to enjoy peculiar privilege not only from he situation but by the loud salutation and noisy welcome with which he be greet from the crowd below it be the good monk of st bernard who with a bare head and a joyous contented face answer to the several call of the peasant most of whom have either bestow hospitality on the worthy augustine in he many journeying among the charitable of the lower world or have receive it at he hand in they frequent passage of the mountain these recognition and greeting speak well for humanity for in every instance they wear the air of cordial good-will and a readiness to do honor to the benevolent character of the religious community that be represent in the person of its clavier or steward good luck to thee father xavier and a rich _ quête _ cry a burly peasant thou hast of late unkindly forget benoit emery and he when do a clavier of st bernard ever knock at my door and go away with a empty hand we look for thee reverend monk with thy vessel to-morrow for the summer have be hot the grape be rich and the wine be begin to run freely in we tub thou shalt dip without any to look at thee and take it of which color thou wilt thou shalt take it with a welcome thanks thanks generous benoit st augustine will remember the favor and thy fruitful vine will be none the poorer for thy generosity we ask only that we may give and on none do we bestow more willingly than on the honest vaudoi whom may the saint keep in mind for they kindness and good-will nay i will have none of thy saint thou knowest we be st calvin 's man in vaud if there must be any canonize but what be it to we that thou hearest mass while we love the simple worship be we not equally man do not the frost nip the member of catholic and protestant the same or do the avalanche respect one more than the other i never know thee or any of thy convent question the frozen traveller of he faith but all be feed and warm and at need administer to from the pharmacy with brotherly care and as christian merit whatever thou mayest think of the state of we soul thou on thy mountain there no one will deny thy tender service to we body say i well neighbor or be this only the foolish gossip of old benoit who have cross the col so often that he have forget that out church have quarrel and that the learn will have we go to heaven by different road a general movement among the people and a toss of hand appear in support of the truth and popularity of the honest peasant 's sentiment for in that age the hospice of st bernard more exclusively a refuge for the real and poor traveller than at present enjoy a merited reputation in all the country round thou shalt always be welcome on the pass thou and thy friend and all other in the shape of man without other interference in thy opinion than secret prayer return the good-humored and happy-looking clavier whose round contented face shone partly in habitual joy partly in gratification at this public testimonial in favor of the brotherhood and a little in satisfaction perhaps at the promise of a ample addition to the convent 's store for the community of st bernard while so much be go out have a natural and justifiable desire to see some return for its incessant and unwearied liberality thou wilt not deny we the happiness of pray for those we love though it happen to be in a manner different from that in which they ask blessing for themselves have it thine own way good canon i be none of those who be ready to refuse a favor because it savor of rome but what have become of we friend uberto he rarely come into the valley that we be not anxious to see he glossy coat the augustine give the customary call and the mastiff mount the stage with a grave deliberate step as if conscious of the dignity and usefulness of the life he lead and like a dog accustom to the friendly notice of man the appearance of this well-known and celebrated brute cause another stir in the throng many press upon the guard to get a nearer view and a few casting fragment of food from they wallet as token of gratitude and regard in the midst of this little by-play of good feeling a dark shaggy animal leap upon the scaffolding and very coolly commence with a activity that denote the influence of the keen mountain air on he appetite pick up the different particle of meat that have as yet escape the eye of uberto the intruder be receive much in the manner that a unpopular or a offend actor be make to undergo the hostility of pit and gallery to revenge some slight or neglect for which he have forget or refuse to atone in other word he be incontinently and mercilessly pelt with such missile as first present themselves the unknown animal which the reader however will not be slow in recognize to be the water-dog of il maledetto receive these unusual visitation with some surprise and rather awkwardly for in he proper sphere nettuno have be quite as much accustomed to meet with demonstration of friendship from the race he so faithfully serve as any of the far-famed and petted mastiff of the convent after dodge sundry stone and club as well as a pretty close attention to the principal matter in hand would allow and with a dexterity that do equal credit to he coolness and muscle a missile of formidable weight take the unfortunate follower of maso in the side and send he howl from the stage at the next instant he master be at the throat of the offender throttle he till he be black in the face the unlucky stone have come from conrad forgetful of he assumed character he have join in the hue and cry against a dog whose character and service should have be sufficiently know to he at least to prove he protection and have give the crudest blow of all it have be already see that there be little friendship between maso and the pilgrim for the former appear to have a instinctive dislike of the latter 's call and this little occurrence be not of a character likely to restore the peace between they thou too cry the italian whose blood have mount at the first attack on he faithful follower and which fairly boil when he witness the cowardly and wanton conduct of this new assailant -- art not satisfy with feign prayer and godliness with the credulous but thou must even feign enmity to my dog because it be the fashion to praise the cur of st bernard at the expense of all other brute reptile -- dost not dread the arm of a honest man when raise against thee in just anger friend -- vévaisans -- honorable citizen gasp the pilgrim as the gripe of maso permit breath i be conrad a poor miserable repentant pilgrim -- will ye see I murder for a brute such a contest could not continue long in such a place at first the pressure of the curious and the great density of the crowd rather favor the attack of the mariner but in the end they prove he enemy by prevent the possibility of escape from those who be especially charge with the care of the public peace luckily for conrad for passion have fairly blinded maso to the consequence of he fury the halberdier soon force they way into the center of the living mass and they succeed in seasonably rescue he from the deadly gripe of he assailant il maledetto tremble with the reaction of this hot sally the moment he gripe be forcibly release and he would have disappear as soon as possible have it be the pleasure of those into whose hand he have fall to permit so politic a step but now commence the war of word and the clamor of voice which usually succeed as well as precede all contest of a popular nature the officer in charge of this portion of the square question twenty answer in a breath not only drown each other 's voice but effectually contradict all that be say in the way of explanation one maintain that conrad have not be content with attack maso 's dog but that he have follow up the blow by offer a personal indignity to the master himself this be the publican in whose house the mariner have take up he abode and in which he have be sufficiently liberal in he expenditure fairly to entitle he to the hospitable support of its landlord another profess he readiness to swear that the dog be the property of the pilgrim be accustom to carry he wallet and that maso owe to a ancient grudge against both master and beast have hurl the stone which send the animal away howl and have resent a mild remonstrance of its owner in the extraordinary manner that all have see this witness be the neapolitan juggler pippo who have much attach himself to the person of conrad since the adventure of the bark and who be both ready and willing to affirm anything in behalf of a friend who have so evident need of he testimony if it be only on the score of boon-companionship a third declare that the dog belong truly to the italian that the stone have be really hurl by one who stand near the pilgrim who have be wrongfully accuse of the offence by maso that the latter have make he attack under a false impression and richly merited punishment for the unceremonious manner in which he have stop conrad 's breath this witness be perfectly honest but of a vulgar and credulous mind he attribute the original offence to one near that happen to have a bad name and who be very liable to father every sin that by possibility could be lay at he door as well as some that could not on the other hand he have also be dupe that morning by the pilgrim 's superabundant profession of religious zeal a circumstance that of itself would have prevent he from detect conrad 's arm in the air as it cast the stone and which serve greatly to increase he certainty that the first offence come from the luckless wight just allude to since they who discriminate under general conviction and popular prejudice usually heap all the odium they pertinaciously withhold from the lucky and the favor on those who seem fate by general consent to be the common target of the world 's dart the officer by the time he have deliberately hear the three principal witness together with the confounding explanation of those who profess to be only half-informed in the matter be utterly at a loss to decide which have be right and which wrong he come therefore to the safe conclusion to send all the party to the guard-house include the witness be quite sure that he have hit on a effectual method of visit the true criminal with punishment and of admonish all those who give evidence in future to have a care of the manner in which they contradict each other just as this equitable decision be pronounce the sound of a trumpet proclaim the approach of a division of the principal mummer if so irreverent a term can be apply to man engage in a festival as justly renown as that of the vine-dresser this announcement greatly quicken the step of justice for they who be charge with the execution of she decree feel the necessity of be prompt under the penalty of lose a interesting portion of the spectacle actuate by this new impulse which if riot as respectable be quite as strong as the desire to do right the disturber of the peace even to those who have show a quarrelsome temper by tell story that give each other the lie be hurry away in a body and the public be leave in the enjoyment of that tranquillity which in these perilous time of revolution and change be think to to be so necessary to its dignity so especially favorable to commerce and so grateful to those whose duty it be to preserve the public peace with as little inconvenience to themselves as possible a blast of the trumpet be the signal for a more general movement for it announce the commencement of the ceremony as it will be presently necessary to speak of the different personage who be represent on this joyous occasion we shall only say here that group after group of the actor come into the square each party march to the sound of music from its particular point of rendezvous to the common center the stage now begin to fill with the privileged among whom be many of the high aristocracy of the ruling canton most of its official who be too dignified to be more than complacent spectator of revel like these many noble of mark from prance and italy a few traveller from england for in that age england be deem a distant country and send forth but a few of she _ élite _ to represent she on such occasion most of those from the adjoining territory who could afford the time and cost and who by rank or character be entitle to the distinction and the wife and family of the local officer who happen to be engage as actor in the representation by the time the different part of the principal procession be assemble in the square all the seat of the estrade be crowd with the exception of those reserve for the bailiff and he immediate friend chapter xiv so once be range the son of ancient rome a noble show while roscius tread the stage cowper the day be not yet far advance when all the component part of the grand procession have arrive in the square shortly after a flourish of clarion give notice of the approach of the authority first come the bailiff fill with the dignity of station and watch with a vigilant but covert eye every indication of feeling that might prove of interest to he employer even while he most affect sympathy with the occasion and self-abandonment to the folly of the hour for peter hofmeister owe he long-established favor with the bürgerschaft more to a never-slumbering regard to its exclusive interest and its undivided supremacy than to any particular skill in the art of render man comfortable and happy next to the worthy bailiff for apart from a indomitable resolution to maintain the authority of he master for good or for evil the herr hofmeister merit the appellation of a worthy man come roger de blonay and he guest the baron de willade march _ pari passu _ at the side of the representative of berne himself there might have be some question how far the bailiff be satisfy with this arrangement of the difficult point of etiquette for he issue from he own gate with a sort of side-long movement that keep he nearly confront to the signor grimaldus though it leave he the means of choose he path and of observe the aspect of thing in the crowd at any rate the genoese though apparently occupy a secondary station have no grounds to complain of indifference to he presence most of the observance and not a few of the sally of honest peter who have some local reputation as a joker and a _ bel esprit _ as be apt to be the case with you municipal magistrate more especially when he hold he authority independently of the community with whom he associate and perhaps as little likely to be the fact when he depend on popular favor for he rank be address to the signor grimaldus most of these good thing be return in kind the genoese meeting the courtesy like a man accustom to be the object of peculiar attention and possibly like one who rather riot in the impunity from ceremony and public observation that he now happen to enjoy adelheid with a maiden of the house of blonay close the little train as all commendable diligence be use by the officer of the peace to make way for the bailiff herr hofmeister and he companion be soon in they allotted station which it be scarcely necessary to repeat be the upper place on the estrade peter have seat himself after return numerous salutation for none in a situation to catch he eye neglect so fair a opportunity to show they intimacy with the bailiff when he wander glance fall upon the happy visage of father xavier rise hastily the bailiff go through a multitude of the formal ceremony that distinguish the courtesy of the place and period such as frequent waving and lifting of the beaver profound reverence smile that seem to flow from the heart and a variety of other token of extraordinary love and respect when all be end he resume he place by the side of melchior de willade with whom he commence a confidential dialogue we know not noble freiherr -lrb- he speak in the vernacular of they common canton -rrb- whether we have most reason to esteem or to disrelish these augustine while they do so many christian act to the traveller on they mountain yonder they be devil incarnate in the way of uphold popery and its abomination among the people look you the commonalty -- god bless they as they deserve -- have no great skill at doctrinal discussion and be much disposed to be lead away by appearance numberless be the miserable dolt who fancy the godliness which be content to pass its time on the top of a frozen hill do good feed the hungry dress the wound of the fall and -- but thou knowest the manner in which these saying run -- the ignorant as i be about to add be but too ready to believe that the religion which lead man to do this must have some savor of heaven in it after all be they so very wrong friend peter that we be wise to disturb the monk in the enjoyment of a favor that be so fairly earn the bailiff look askance at he brother burgher for such be the humble appellation that aristocracy assume in berne appear desirous to probe the depth of the other 's political moral before he speak more freely though of a house so honor and trust i believe thou art not much accustomed of late to mingle with the council he evasively observe since this heavy loss in my family of which thou may ` st have hear the care of this sole survive child have be my principal solace and occupation i know not whether the frequent and near sight of death among those so tenderly love may have soften my heart towards the augustine but to I theirs seem a self-denying and a right worthy life ` tis doubtless as you say noble melchior and we shall do well to let we love for the holy canon be see ho mr officer -- do we the favor to request the reverend monk of st bernard to draw nearer that the people may learn the esteem in which they patient charity and never-wearying benevolence be hold by the lookers-on as you will have occasion to pass a night beneath the convent 's roof herr von willading in you journey to italy a little honor show to the honest and pains-taking clavier will not be lose on the brotherhood if these churchman have even a decent respect for the usage of they fellow-creature father xavier take the proffer place which be nearer to the person of the bailiff than the one he have just quit and insomuch the more honorable with the usual thanks but with a simplicity which prove that he understand the compliment to be due to the fraternity of which he be a member and not to himself this little disposition make as well as all other preliminary matter properly observe the bailiff seem satisfied with himself and he arrangement for the moment the reader must imagine the stir in the throng the importance of the minor agent appoint to marshal the procession and the mixture of weariness and curiosity that possess the spectator while the several part of so complicated and numerous a train be get arrange each in its prescribed order and station but as the ceremony which follow be of a peculiar character and have a intimate connexion with the event of the tale we shall describe they with a little detail although the task we have allot to ourselves be less that of sketch picture of local usage and of set before the reader 's imagination scene of real or fancied antiquarian accuracy than the exposition of a principle and the wholesome moral which we have always flatter ourselves might in a greater or less degree follow from we labor a short time previously to the commencement of the ceremony a guard of honor compose of shepherd gardener mower reaper vine-dresser escort by halberdier and head by music have leave the square in quest of the abbé as the regular and permanent preside officer of the abbaye or company

be have so cheap it be churlish to deny it to a people we complain not of the levity noble freiherr for you light thinker make a sober and dutiful subject but we shall have more of this and of a far better quality or we time be waste -- what be think at berne noble melchior of the prospects of the emperor 's obtain a new concession for the levy of troops in we canton i cry thy mercy good peterchen but by thy leave we will touch on these matter more at we leisure boyish though it seem to thy eye so long accustom to look at matter of state i do confess that these folly begin to have they entertainment and may well claim a hour of idleness from he that have nothing better in hand peter hofmeister ejaculate a little expressively he then examine the countenance of the signor grimaldus who have give himself to the merriment with the perfect good-will and self-abandonment of a man of strong intellect and who feel he power too sensibly to be jealous of appearance shrug he shoulder like one that be disappoint the pragmatical bailiff turn he look towards the reveller in order to detect if possible some breach of the usage of the country that might require official reproof for peter be of that class of governor who have a itch to see they finger stir even the air that be breathe by the people lest they should get it of a quality or in a quantity that might prove dangerous to a monopoly which it be now the fashion to call the conservative principle in the mean time the revel proceed no sooner have the gardener quit the arena than a solemn and impose train appear to occupy the sward four female march to the front bear a antique altar that be decorate with suitable device they be clothe in emblematical dress and wear garland of flower on they head boy

and lombard carnival in which to say truth there be sometimes see rare nicety in the way of represent the old deity be it the usage friend hofmeister demand the baron to enjoy these admirable pleasantry often here in vaud we partake of they from time to time as the abbaye desire and much as thou seest the honorable signor grimaldus -- who will pardon I that he get no better treatment than he receive and who will not fail to ascribe what to all who know he might otherwise pass for inexcusable neglect to he own desire for privacy -- he will tell we should he be please to honor we with he real opinion that the subject be none the worse for occasion to laugh and be gay now there be geneva a town give to subtlety as ingenious and complicated as the machinery of they own watch it can never have a merry-making without a leaven of disputation and reason two as damnable ingredient in the public humor as schism in religion or two mind in a _ ménage _ there be not a knave in the city who do not fancy himself a better man than calvin and some there be who believe if they be not cardinal it be merely because the reform church do not relish leg case in red stocking by the word of a bailiff i would not be the ruler look ye of such a community for the hope of become avoyer of berne itself here it be different we play we antic in the shape of god and goddess like sober people and when all be over we go train we vine or count we herd like faithful subject of the great canton do i state the matter fairly to we friend baron de blonay roger de blonay bit he lip for he and he have be of vaud a thousand year and he little relish the allusion to the quiet manner in which he countryman submit to a compel and foreign dictation he bow a cold acquiescence to the bailiff 's statement however as if no farther answer be need we have other ceremony that invite we attention say melchior de willade who have sufficient acquaintance with he friend 's opinion to understand he silence the next group that approach be compose of those who live by the product of the dairy two cowherd lead they beast the monotonous tone of whose heavy bell form a deep and rural accompaniment to the music that regularly precede each party while a train of dairy-girl and of young mountaineer of the class that tend the herd in the summer pasturage succeed a car load with the implement of they call bring up the rear in this little procession no detail of equipment be want the milking-stool be strap to the body of the dairyman one have the peculiarly construct pail in he hand while another bear at he back the deep wooden vessel in which milk be carry up and down the precipice to the chalet when they reach the sodded arena the man commence milk the cow the girl set in motion the different process of the dairy and the whole unite in sing the ranz des vaches of the district it be generally and erroneously believe that there be a particular air which be know throughout switzerland by this name whereas in truth nearly every canton have its own song of the mountain each vary from the other in the note as well as in the word and we might almost add in the language the ranz des vaches of vaud be in the patois of the country a dialect that be compose of word of greek and latin origin mingle on a foundation of celtic like we own familiar tune which be first bestow in derision and which a glorious history have enable we to continue in pride the word be far too numerous to be repeat we shall however give the reader a single verse of a song which swiss feeling have render so celebrated and which be say often to induce the mountaineer in foreign service to desert the mercenary standard and the tame scene of town to return to the magnificent nature that haunt he waking imagination and embellish he dream it will at once be perceive that the power of this song be chiefly to be find in the recollection to which it give birth by recall the simple charm of rural life and by revive the indelible impression that be make by nature wherever she have lay she hand on the face of the earth with the same majesty as in switzerland lé zermaillus dei colombietté dé bon matin sé san léha --

beneath this poplar i be about to press liauba liauba in order to milk -rrb- the music of the mountain be peculiar and wild have most probably receive its inspiration from the grandeur of the natural object most of the sound partake of the character of echo be high-keyed but false note such as the rock send back to the valley when the voice be raise above its natural key in order to reach the cavern and savage recess of inaccessible precipice strain like these readily recall the glen and the magnificence amid which they be first hear and hence by a irresistible impulse the mind be lead to indulge in the strongest of all its sympathy those which be mix with the unalloyed and unsophisticated delight of buoyant childhood the herdsman and dairymaid no sooner utter the first note of this magic song than a deep and breathing stillness pervade the crowd as the peculiar strain of the chorus rise on the ear murmur echo issue from among the spectator and ere the wild intonation could be repeat which accompany the word liauba liauba a thousand voice be lift simultaneously as it be to greet the surround mountain with the salutation of they child from that moment the remainder of the ranz des vaches be a common burst of enthusiasm the offspring of that national fervor which form so strong a link in the social chain and which be capable of recall to the bosom that in other respects have be harden by vice and crime a feeling of some of the purest sentiment of we nature the last strain die amid this general exhibition of healthful feel the cowherd and the dairy-girl collect they different implement and resume they march to the melancholy music of the bell which form a deep contrast to the wild note that have just fill the square to these succeed the follower of cere with the altar the priestess and the enthrone goddess as have be already describe in the approach of flora cornucopiæ ornament the chair of the deity and the canopy be adorn with the gift of autumn the whole be surmount by a sheaf of wheat she hold the sickle as she sceptre and a tiara compose of the bearded grain cover she brow reaper follow bear emblem of the season of abundance and gleaner close the train there be the halt the chant the chorus and the song in praise of the beneficent goddess of autumn as have be do by the votary of the deity of flower a dance of the reaper and gleaner follow the

first receive the flow juice follow a great number of man who bring forward the forge that be use to prepare the tool close this part of the exhibition the song and the dance again succeed when the whole disappear at a signal give by the approach music of bacchus as we now touch upon the most elaborate part of the representation we seize the interval that be necessary to bring it forward in order to take breath ourselves chapter xv and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that stand ` st between she father 's ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show I thy chink to blink through with mine eyne _ midsummer night 's dream _ ` odds my life but this go off with a grace brother peter exclaim the baron de willading as he follow the vine-dresser in they retreat with a amuse eye -- if we have much more like it i shall forget the dignity of the bürgerschaft and turn mummer with the rest though my good for wisdom be the forfeit of the folly that be better say between ourselves than perform before the vulgar eye honorable melchior it would sound ill of a truth be these vaudoi to boast that a noble of thy estimation in berne be thus to forget himself none of this -- be we not here to be merry and to laugh and to be please with any folly that offer a truce then to thy official distrust and superabundant dignity honest peterchen for such be the good-natured name by which the worthy bailiff be most commonly address by he friend let the tongue freely answer to the heart as if we be boy rioting together as be once the case long ere thou wert thought of for this office or i know a sorrowful hour the signor grimaldus shall judge between we : i maintain that restraint be necessary to those in high trust i will decide when the actor have all play they part return the genoese smile at present here cometh one to whom all old soldier pay homage we will not fail of respect in so great a presence on account of a little difference in taste peter hofmeister be not a small drinker and as the approach of the god of the cup be announce by a flourish from some twenty instrument make to speak on a key suit to the vault of heaven he be oblige to reserve he opinion for another time after the passage of the musician and a train of the abbaye 's servant for especial honor be pay to the ruby deity there come three official of the sacrifice one lead a goat with gilded horn while the two other bear the knife and the hatchet to these succeed the altar adorn with vine the incense-bearer and the high-priest of bacchus who lead the way for the appearance of the youthful god himself the deity be seat astride on a cask he head encircle with a garland of generous grape bear a cup in one hand and a vine entwine and fruit-crowned sceptre in the other four nubian carry he on they shoulder while other shaded he form with a appropriate canopy faun wear tiger-skin and play they characteristic antic dance in he train while twenty laughing and light-footed bacchante flourish they instrument move in measure in the rear a general shout in the multitude precede the appearance of silenus who be sustain in he place on a ass by two blackamoor the half-empty skin at he side the vacant laugh the foolish eye the loll tongue the bloated lip and the idiotic countenance give reason to suspect that there be a better motive for they support than any which belong to the truth of the representation two youth then advance bearing on a pole a cluster of grape that nearly descend to the ground and which be intend to represent the fruit bring from canaan by the messenger of joshua -- a symbol much affect by the artist and mummer of the other hemisphere on occasion suit to its display a huge vehicle clepe the ark of noah close the procession it hold a wine-press have its workman embower among the vine and it contain the family of the second father of the human race as it roll past trace of the rich liquor be leave in the track of its wheel then come the sacrifice the chant and the dance as in most of the precede exhibition each of which like this of bacchus have contain allusion to the peculiar habit and attribute of the different deity the bacchanal that close the scene be perform in character the trumpet flourish and the procession depart in the order in which it have arrive peter relent a little from he usual political reserve as he witness these game in honor of a deity to whom he so habitually do practical homage for it be seldom that this elaborate functionary who might be term quite a doctrinaire in he way compose he sens in sleep without have pretty effectually steep they in the liquor of the neighbor hill a habit that be of far more general use among man of he class in that age than in this of ours which seem so eminently to be the season of sobriety this be not amiss of a verity observe the contented bailiff as the faun and bacchante move off the sward caper and cut they classical antic with far more agility and zeal than grace this look like the inspiration of good wine signior genoese and be the truth know it would be find that the rogue who play the part of the fat person on the ass -- how dost call the knave noble melchior body o ' I if i be wiser than thyself worthy bailiff it be clearly a rogue who can never have do he mummery so expertly without some aid from the flask twill be well to know the fellow 's character for there may be the occasion to commend he to the gentleman of the abbaye when all be over you skilful ruler have two great instrument that he need use with discretion baron de willading and these be fear and flattery and berne have no servant more ready to apply both or either as there may be necessity than one of she poor bailiff that have not receive all he due from the general opinion if truth be speak but it be well to be prepare to speak these good people of the abbaye fairly touch they exploit harkee master halberdier thou art of vévey i think and a warm citizen in thy every-day character or my eye do we both injustice i be as you have say monsieur le bailli a vévaisan and one that be well know among we artisan true that be visible spite of thy halberd thou art no doubt rarely gifted and teach to the letter in these game wilt name the character that have just ridden past on the ass -- he that have so well enact the drunkard i mean he name have go out of we mind for the moment though he act never can for a better performance of one overcome by liquor be seldom see lord keep you worshipful bailiff that be antoine giraud the fat butcher of la tour de peil and a better at the cup there be not in all the country of vaud no wonder that he have do he part so readily for while the other have be read in book or drill like so many awkward recruit under the school-master antoine have have little more to perform than to dip into the skin at he elbow when the officer of the abbaye complain lest he should disturb the ceremony he bid they not to make fool of themselves for every swallow he give be just so much do in honor of the representation and he swear by the creed of calvin that there shall be more truth in he act than in that of any other of the whole party ` odds my life the fellow have humor as well as good act in he -- this antoine giraud will you look into the write order they have give as fair adelheid that we may make sure this artisan-halberdier have not deceive we we in authority must not trust a vévaisan too lightly it will be vain i fear herr bailiff since the character and not the name of the actor appear in the list the man in question represent silenus i should think judge from he appearance and all the other circumstance well let it be as thou wilt silenus himself could not play he own part better than it have be do by this antoine giraud the fellow would gain gold like water at the court of the emperor as a mime be he only advise to resort thither i warrant you now he would do pluto or minerva or any other god just as well as he have do this rogue silenus the honest admiration of peter who sooth to say have not much of the learning of the age as the phrase be raise a smile on the lip of the beauteous daughter of the baron and she glance a look to catch the eye of sigismund towards whom all she secret sympathy whether of sorrow or of joy so naturally and so strongly tend but the avert head the fixed attention and the nearly immovable and statue-like attitude in which he stand show that a more powerful interest draw he gaze to the next group though ignorant of the cause of he intense regard adelheid instantly forget the bailiff he dogmatism and he want of erudition in the wish to examine those who approach the more classical portion of the ceremony be now duly observe the council of the abbaye intend to close with a exhibition that be more intelligible to the mass of the spectator than anything which have precede it since it be address to the sympathy and habit of every people and in all condition of society this be the spectacle that so engrossingly attract the attention of sigismund it be term the procession of the nuptials and it be now slowly advance to occupy the space leave vacant by the retreat of antoine giraud and he companion there come in front the customary band play a lively air which use have long appropriate to the festivity of hymen the lord of the manor or as he be term the baron and he lady-partner lead the train both apparel in the rich and quaint attire of the period six ancient couple the representative of happy married life follow by a long succession of offspring of every age include equally the infant at the breast and the husband and wife in the flower of they day walk next to the noble pair then appear the section of a dwelling which be make to portray the interior of domestic economy have its kitchen its utensil and most of the useful and necessary object that may be say to compose the material element of a humble _ ménage _ within this moiety of a house one female ply the wheel and another be occupy in bake the notary bear the register beneath a arm with hat in hand and dress in a exaggerated costume of he profession strut in the rear of the two industrious housemaid he appearance be greet with a general laugh for the spectator relish the humor of the caricature with infinite goût but this sudden and general burst of merriment be as quickly forget in the desire to behold the bride and bridegroom whose station be next to that of the officer of the law it be understand that these party be not actor but that the abbaye have seek out a couple of corresponding rank and mean who have consent to join they fortune in reality on the occasion of this great jubilee thereby lend to it a greater appearance of that genuine joy and festivity which it be the desire of the head of the association to represent such a search have not be make without exciting deep interest in the simple community which surround vévey many requisite have be proclaim to be necessary in the candidate -- such as beauty modesty merit and the submission of she sex in the bride and in she partner those quality which might fairly entitle he to be the repository of the happiness of a maiden so endowed many have be the speculation of the vévaisans touch the individual who have be select to perform these grave and important character which for fidelity of representation be to outdo that of silenus himself but so much care have be take by the agent of the abbaye to conceal the name of those they have select that until this moment when disguise be no longer possible the public be completely in the dark on the interesting point it be so usual to make match of this kind on occasion of public rejoicing and marriage of convenience as they be not unaptly term enter so completely into the habit of all european community -- perhaps we might say of all old community -- that common opinion would not have be violently outrage have it be know that the choose pair see each other for the second or third time in the procession and that they have now present themselves to take the nuptial vow as it be at the sound of the trumpet or the beat of drum still it be more usual to consult the inclination of the party since it give greater zest to the ceremony and these selection of couple on public occasion be generally suppose to have more than the common interest of marriage since they be believe to be the means of unite through the agency of the rich and powerful those whom poverty or other adverse circumstance have hitherto keep asunder rumor speak of many a inexorable father who have listen to reason from the mouth of the great rather than balk the public humor and thousand of pine heart among the obscure and simple be even now gladden at the approach of some joyous ceremony which be expect to throw open the gate of the prison to the debtor and the criminal or that of hymen to those who be richer in constancy and affection than in any other store a general murmur and a common movement betray the lively interest of the spectator as the principal and real actor in this portion of the ceremony draw near adelheid feel a warm glow on she cheek and a gentler flow of kindness at she heart when she eye first catch a view of the bride and bridegroom whom she be fain to believe a faithful pair that a cruel fortune have hitherto keep separate and who be now willing to brave such stricture as all must encounter who court public attention in order to receive the reward of they enduring love and self-denial this sympathy which be at first rather of a abstract and vague nature find its support chiefly in she own peculiar situation and the quality of she gentle nature become intensely heighten however when she get a better view of the bride the modest mien abashed eye and difficult breathing of the girl whose personal charm be of a order much superior to those which usually distinguish rustic beauty in those country in which female be not exempt from the labor of the field be so natural and win as to awaken all she interest and with instinctive quickness the lady of willade bent she look on the bridegroom in order to see if one whose appearance be so eloquent in she favor be likely to be happy in she choice in age personal appearance and apparently in condition of life there be no very evident unfitness though adelheid fancy that the mien of the maiden announce a better breeding than that of she companion -- a difference which she be willing to ascribe however to a greater aptitude in she own sex to receive the first impress of the moral seal than that which belong to man she be fair whisper adelheid slightly bend she head towards sigismund who stand at she side and must deserve she happiness she be good and merit a better fate mutter the youth breathing so hard as to render he respiration audible the startle adelheid raise she eye and strong but suppress agitation be quiver in every lineament of she companion 's countenance the attention of those near be so closely draw towards the procession as to allow a instant of unobserved communication sigismund this be thy sister god so curse she why have a occasion public as this be choose to wed a maiden of she modesty and manner can the daughter of balthazar be squeamish gold the interest of the abbaye and the foolish _ éclat _ of this silly scene have enable my father to dispose of he child to yonder mercenary who have bargain like a jew in the affair and who among other condition have require that the true name of he bride shall never be reveal be we not honor by a connexion which repudiate we even before it be form the hollow stifled laugh of the young man thrill on the nerve of he listener and she cease the steal dialogue to return to the subject at a more favorable moment in the mean time the procession have reach the station in front of the stage where the mummer have already commence they rite a dozen groomsman and as many female attendant accompany the pair who be about to take the nuptial vow behind these come the _ trousseau _ and the _ corbeille _ the first be that portion of the dowry of the bride which apply to she personal want and the last be a offering of the husband and be figuratively suppose to be a pledge of the strength of he passion in the present instance the trousseau be so ample and betoken so much liberality as well as means on the part of the friend of a maiden who would consent to become a wife in a ceremony so public as to create general surprise while on the other hand a solitary chain of gold of rustic fashion and far more in consonance with the occasion be the sole tribute of the swain this difference between the liberality of the friend of the bride and that of the individual who judge from appearance have much the most reason to show he satisfaction do not fail to give rise to many comment they end as most comment do by deduction draw against the weaker and least defend of the party the general conclusion be so uncharitable as to infer that a girl thus bestow must be under peculiar disadvantage else would there have be a greater equality between the gift a inference that be sufficiently true though cruelly unjust to its modest but unconscious subject while speculation of this nature be rife among the spectator the actor in the ceremony begin they dance which be distinguish by the quaint formality that belong to the politeness of the age the song that succeed be in honor of hymen and he votary and a few couplet that extol the virtue and beauty of the bride be chant in chorus a sweep appear at the chimney-top raise he cry in allusion to the business of the ménage and then all move away as have be do by those who have precede they a guard of halberdier close the procession that part of the mummery which be to be enact in front of the estrade be now end for the moment and the different group proceed to various other station in the town where the ceremony be to be repeat for the benefit of those who by reason of the throng have not be able to get a near view of what have pass in the square most of the privileged profit by the pause to leave they seat and to seek such relaxation as the confinement render agreeable among those who entirely quit the square be the bailiff and he friend who stroll towards the promenade on the lake-shore hold discourse in which there be blended much facetious merriment concern what they have just see the bailiff soon draw he companion around he in a deep discussion of the nature of the game during which the signor grimaldus betray a malicious pleasure in lead on the dogmatic peter to expose the confusion that exist in he head touch the character of sacred and profane history even adelheid be compel to laugh at the commencement of this ludicrous exhibition but she thought be not long in recur to a subject in which she feel a nearer and a more tender interest sigismund walk thoughtfully at she side and she profit by the attention of all around they be draw to the laughable dialogue just mention to renew the subject that have be so lightly touch on before i hope thy fair and modest sister will never have reason to repent she choice she say lessen she speed in a manner to widen the distance between herself and those she do not wish to overhear the word while it bring she nearer to sigismund it be a frightful violence to all maiden feeling to be thus drag before the eye of the curious and vulgar in a scene try and solemn as that in which she plight she marriage vow poor christine she fate from infancy have be pitiable a purer or milder spirit than hers one that more sensitively shrink from rude collision do not exist and yet on whichever side she turn she eye she meet with appalling prejudice or opinion to drive a gentle nature like hers to madness it may be a misfortune adelheid to want instruction and to be fate to pass a life in the depths of ignorance and in the indulgence of brutal passion but it be scarcely a blessing to have the mind elevated above the task which a cruel and selfish world so frequently impose thou wast speaking of thy mild and excellent sister -- well hast thou describe she christine be mild and more than modest -- she be meek but what can meekness itself do to palliate such a calamity desirous of avert the stigma of he family from all he could with prudence my father cause my sister like myself to be early take from the parental home she be give in charge to stranger under such circumstance of secrecy as leave she long perhaps too long in ignorance of the stock from which she spring when maternal pride lead my mother to seek she daughter 's society the mind of christine be in some measure form and she have to endure the humiliation of learn that she be one of a family proscribe she gentle spirit however soon become reconcile to the truth at least so far as human observation could penetrate and from the moment of the first terrible agony no one have hear she murmur at the stern decree of providence the resignation of that mild girl have ever be a reproach to my own rebellious temper for adelheid i can not conceal the truth from thee -- i have curse all that i dare include in my wicked imprecation in very madness at this blight on my hope nay i have even accuse my father of injustice that he do not train I at the side of the block that i might take a savage pride in that which be now the bane of my existence not so with christine she have always warmly return the affection of we parent as a daughter should love the author of she be while i fear i have be repine when i should have love we origin be a curse entail by the ruthless law of the land and it be not to be attribute to any at least to none of these later day as a fault and such have ever be the language of my poor sister when she have see a merit in they wish to benefit we at the expense of they own natural affection i would i could imitate she reason and resignation the view take by thy sister be that of a female sigismund whose heart be stronger than she pride and what be more it be just i deny it not ` tis just but the ill-judged mercy have for ever disqualify I to sympathize as i could wish with those to whom i belong ` tis a error to draw these broad distinction between we habit and we affection creature stern as soldier can not bend they fancy like pliant twig or with the facility of female -- duty say adelheid gravely observe that he hesitate if thou wilt

the demigod be shamefully under the influence of too many potation that have be swallow in he own honor we shall not go over the detail of these scene which all who have ever witness a public celebration will readily imagine nor be it necessary to record the different sally of wit that under the inspiration of the warm wine of vévey and the excitement of the revel issue from the group that cluster around the window of the prison all who have ever listen to low humor that be rather deaden than quicken by liquor will understand they character and they who have not will scarcely be loser by the omission at length the different allegory draw from the heathen mythology end and the procession of the nuptials come into the square the meek and gentle christine have appear nowhere that day without awaken strong sympathy in she youth beauty and apparent innocence murmur of approbation accompany she step and the maiden more accustomed to she situation begin to feel probably for the first

brave prejudice to do justice to she worth but as the applause which have be hitherto suppress break out in loud acclamation in the square of the town-house the color mantle brightly on she cheek and she look with modest pride at she companion as if she would say in the silent appeal that he generous choice would not go entirely without its reward the crowd respond to the sentiment and never do votary of hymen approach the altar seemingly under happier auspices the influence of innocence and beauty be universal even the unprincipled and half-intoxicated prisoner be loud in praise of the gentle christine one praise she modesty another extol she personal appearance and all unite with the multitude in shout to she honor the blood of the bridegroom begin to quicken and by the time the

past the town-house and the air be fill with music while a general movement stir the multitude a cry of alarm arise in the building it be immediately succeed by such a rush of body towards the spot as indicate in a throng a sudden and general interest in some new and extraordinary event the crowd be beat back and disperse the procession have disappear and there be a unusual appearance of activity and mystery among the official of the place before the cause of this disturbance begin to be whisper among the few who remain in the square the rumor run that one of the prisoner a athletic italian mariner have profit by the attention of all the other guardian of the place be occupy by the ceremony to knock down the solitary sentinel and to effect he escape follow by all the drunkard who be able to run the evasion of a few lawless blackguard from they prison be not a event likely long to divert the attention of the curious from the amusement of the day especially as it be understand that they confinement would have terminate of itself with the setting sun but when the fact be communicate to peter hofmeister the sturdy bailiff swear fifty harsh oath at the impudence of the knave at the carelessness of they keeper and in honor of the good cause of justice in general after which he incontinently command that the runaway should be apprehend this material part of the process achieve he moreover order that they should be bring forthwith into he presence even should he be engage in the most serious of the ceremony of the day the voice of peter speaking in anger be not likely to be unheard and the stern mandate have scarcely issue from he lip when a dozen of the common thief-taker of vaud set about the affair in good earnest and with the best possible intention to effect they object in the mean time the sport continue and as the day draw on and the hour for the banquet approach the good people begin to collect once more in the great square to witness the closing scene and to be present at the nuptial benediction which be to be pronounce over jacque coli and christine by a real servitor of the altar as the last and most important of the ceremony of that eventful day chapter xvii ay marry now unmuzzle you wisdom rosalind the hour of noon be past when the stage be a second time fill with the privileged the multitude be again dispose around the area of the square and the bailiff and he friend once more occupy the seat of honor in the center of the long estrade procession after procession now begin to reappear for all have make the circuit of the city and each have repeat its mummery so often that the actor grow weary of they sport still as the several group come again into the high presence of the bailiff and the élite not only of they own country but of so many other pride overcome fatigue and the song and dance be renew with the necessary appearance of good will and zeal peter hofmeister and diver other of the magnate of the canton be particularly loud in they plaudit on this repetition of the game for by a process that will be easily understand they who have be revel and take they potation in the marquee and booth while the mummer be absent be more than qualify to supply the deficiency of the actor by the warmth and exuberance of they own warm imagination the bailiff in particular as become he high office and determine character be unusually talkative and decide both as respects the criticism and encomium he utter on the various performance make as light of he own peculiar qualification to deal with the subject as if he be a common hack-reviewer of we own time who be know to keep in view the quantity rather than the quality of he remark and the stipulate price he be to receive per line indeed the parallel would hold good in more respects than that of knowledge for he language be unusually captious and supercilious he tone authoritative and he motive the desire to exhibit he own endowment rather than the wish he affect to manifest of set forth the excellence of other he speech be more frequently than ever direct to the signor grimaldus for whom there have suddenly arise in he mind a still stronger gusto than that he have so liberally manifest and which have already draw so much attention to the deportment of this pleasing but modest stranger still he never fail to compel all within reach of a reasonable exercise of he voice to listen to he oracle those that have pass brother melchior say the bailiff address the baron de willading in the fraternal style of the bürgerschaft while he eye be direct to the genoese in whom in reality he wish to excite admiration for he readiness in heathen lore be no more than shepherd and shepherdess of we mountain and none of you god and demigod the former of which be to be know in this ceremony from all other by the fact that they be carry on man 's shoulder and the latter that they ride on ass or have other convenience natural to they want ah here we have the higher order of the mummer in person -- this comely creature be in reality mariette marron of this country as strap a wench as there be in vaud and as impudent -- but no matter she be now the priestess of flora and i 'll warrant you there be not a horn in all we valley that will bring a louder echo out of the rock than this very priestess will raise with she single throat that yonder on the throne be flora herself represent by a comely young woman the daughter of a warm citizen here in vévey and one able to give she all the equipment she bear without tax the abbaye a doit i warrant you that every flower about she be cull from they own garden thou treatest the poetry of the ceremony with so little respect good peterchen that the goddess and she train dwindle into little more than vine-dresser and milk-maid beneath thy tongue of heaven 's sake friend melchior interrupt the amuse genoese do not rob we of the advantage of the worthy bailiff 's graphic remark you heathen may be well enough in he way but surely he be none the worse for a few note and illustration that would do credit to a doctor of padova i entreat you to continue learn peter that we stranger may lose none of the nicety of the exhibition thou seest baron return the well-warmed bailiff with a look of triumph a little explanation can never injure a good thing though it be even the law itself ah yon be cere and she company and a goodly train they appear these be the harvest-man and harvest-woman who represent the abundance of we country of vaud signor grimaldus which truth to say be a fat land and worthy of the allegory these knave with the stool strap to they nether part and carry tub be cowherd and all the other be more or less concerned with the dairy cere be a personage of importance among the ancient beyond dispute as may be see by the manner in which she be back by the land interest there be no solid respectability herr von willade that be not fairly bottom on broad land ye perceive that the goddess sit on a throne whose ornament be all take from the earth a sheaf of wheat top the canopy rich ear of generous grain be she jewel and she sceptre be the sickle these be but allegory signor grimaldus but they be allusion that give birth to wholesome thought in the prudent there be no science that may not catch a hint from we game politics religion or law -- ` tis all the same for the well-disposed and cunning a ingenious scholar might even find a argument for the bürgerschaft in a allegory that be less clear return the amuse genoese but you have overlook signor bailiff the instrument that cere carry in the other hand and which be full to overflow with the fruit of the earth -- that which so much resemble a bullock 's horn i mean that be out of question some of the utensil of the ancient perhaps a milk vessel in use among the god and goddess for you deity of old be no bad housewife and make a merit of they economy and cere here as be see be not ashamed of a useful occupation by my faith but this affair have be get up with a very creditable attention to the moral but we dairy-people be about to give we some of they air peterchen now put a stop to he classic lore while the follower of cere arrange themselves in order and begin to sing the contagious and wild melody of the ranz des vaches rise in the square and soon draw the absorb and delighted attention of all within hearing which to say the truth be little less than all who be within the limit of the town for the crowd chime in with the more regular artist a sort of musical enthusiasm seize upon all present who come of vaud and she valley the dogmatical but well-meaning bailiff though usually jealous of he bernese origin and alive on system to the necessity of preserve the superiority of the great canton by all the common observance of dignity and reserve yield to the general movement and shout with the rest under favor of a pair of lung that nature have admirably fit to sustain the chorus of a mountain song this condescension in the deputy of berne be often speak of afterwards with admiration the simple-minded and credulous ascribe the exaltation of peterchen to a generous warmth in they happiness and interest while the more wary and observant be apt to impute the musical excess to a previous excess of another character in which the wine of the neighbor côtes be fairly entitle to come in for a full share of the merit those who be nearest the bailiff be secretly much diverted-with he awkward attempt at graciousness which one fair and witty vaudoise liken to the antic of one of the celebrated animal that be still foster in the city which rule so much of switzerland and from whom indeed the town and canton be both vulgarly suppose to have derive they common name for while the authority of berne weigh so imperiously and heavily on its subsidiary country as be usual in such case the people of the latter be much addict to take a impotent revenge by whisper the pleasantest sarcasm they could invent against they master notwithstanding this and many more criticism on he performance the bailiff enact he part in the representation to he own entire satisfaction and he resume he seat with a consciousness of have at least merit the applause of the people for have enter with so much spirit into they game and with the hope that this act of grace might be the means of cause they to forget some fifty or a hundred of he other act which certainly have not possess the same melodious and companionable feature after this achievement the bailiff be reasonably quiet until bacchus and he train again enter the square at the appearance of the laughing urchin who bestride the cask he resume he dissertation with a confidence that all be apt to feel who be about to treat on a subject with which they have have occasion to be familiar this be the god of good liquor say peterchen always speak to any who would listen although by a instinct of respect he chiefly prefer favor the signor grimaldus with he remark as may plainly be see by he seat and these be dance attendant to show that wine gladden the heart -- yonder be the press at work extract the juice and that huge cluster be to represent the grape which the messenger of joshua bring back from canaan when send to spy out the land a history which i make no doubt you signore in italy have at you finger ' end gaetano grimaldus look embarrassed for although well skilled in the lore of the heathen mythology he learning as a male papist and a laic be not particularly rich in the story of the christian faith at first he suppose that the bailiff have merely blunder in he account of the mythology but by tax he memory a little he recover some faint glimpse of the truth a redemption of he character as a book-man for which he be materially indebted to have see some celebrated picture on this very subject a species of instruction in holy writ that be sufficiently common those who inhabit the catholic country of the other hemisphere thou surely hast not overlook the history of the gigantic cluster of grape signore exclaimed peterchen astonish at the apparent hesitation of the italian ` tis the most beautiful of all the legend of the holy book ha as i live there be the ass without he rider -- what have become of the blackguard antoine giraud the rogue have alight to swallow a fresh draught from some booth after drain he own skin to the bottom this come of neglect a sober man or at least one of a harder head should have be put to the part -- for look you ` tis a character that need stand at least a gallon since the rehearsal alone be enough to take a common drinker off he center the tongue of the bailiff run on in accompaniment during the time that the follower of bacchus be go through with they song and pageant and when they disappear it gain a louder key like the rolling river that murmur flow and flow for ever rise again on the ear after the din of any adventitious noise have cease now we may expect the pretty bride and she maid continue peterchen wink at he companion as the ancient gallant be wont to make a parade of he admiration of the fair the solemn ceremony be to be pronounce here before the authority as a suitable termination to this happy day ah my good old friend melchior neither of we be the man he be or these skip hoyden would not go through they pirouette without some aid from we arm now dispose of yourselve friend for this be to be no act but a downright marriage and it be meet that we keep a graver air how what mean the movement among the officer peterchen have interrupted himself for just at that moment the thief-taker enter the square in a body inclosing in they center a group who have the mien of captive too evidently to be mistake for honest man the bailiff be peculiarly a executive officer one of that class who believe that the enactment of a law be a point of far less interest than its due fulfilment indeed so far do he push he favorite principle that he do not hesitate sometimes to suppose shades of meaning in the different ordinance of the great council that exist only in he own brain but which be to do he justice sufficiently convenient to himself in carry out the construction which he see fit to put on he own duty the appearance of a affair of justice be unfortunate for the progress of the ceremony peterchen have some such relish for the punishment of rogue and more especially for such as seem to be a eternal reproach to the action of the bernese system by they incorrigible misery and poverty as a old coachman be proverbially say to retain for the crack of the whip all he judicial sympathy be not fully awaken on the present occasion however : the criminal though far from belong to the more lucky of they fellow-creature not be quite miserable enough in appearance to awaken all those power of magisterial reproach and severity that lay dormant in the bailiff 's moral temperament ready at any time to vindicate the right of the strong against the innovation of the feeble and unhappy the reader will at once have anticipate that the prisoner be maso and he companion who have be more successful in escape from they keeper than fortunate in evade the attempt to secure they person a second time who be these that dare affront the ruling power on this day of general good-will and rejoice sternly demand the bailiff when the minion of the law and they captive stand fairly before he do ye not know knave that this be a solemn almost a religious ceremony at vévey -- for so it would be consider by the ancient at least -- and that a crime be doubly a crime when commit either in a honorable presence on a solemn and dignified occasion like this or against the authority -- this last be always the gravest and greatest of all we be but indifferent scholar worshipful bailiff as you may easily perceive by we outward appearance and be to be judge leniently answer maso we whole offence be a hot but short quarrel touch a dog in which hand be make to play the part of reason and which would have do little harm to any but ourselves have it be the pleasure of the town authority to have leave we to decide the dispute in we own way as you well say this be a joyous occasion and we esteem it hard that we of all vévey should be shut up on account of so light a affair and cut off from the merriment of the rest there be reason in this fellow after all say peterchen in a low voice what be a dog more or less to berne and a public rejoice to produce its end should go deep into the community let the man go of god 's name and look to it that all the dog be beat out of the square that we have no more folly please you these be the man that have escape from the authority after knock down they keeper the officer humbly observe how be this didst thou not say fellow that it be all about a dog i speak of the reason of we be shut up it be true that wearied with breathe pent air and a little heated with wine we leave the prison without permission but we hope this little sally of spirit will be overlook on account of the extraordinary occasion rogue thy plea augment the offence a crime commit on a extraordinary occasion become a extraordinary crime and require a extraordinary punishment which i intend to see inflict forthwith you have insult the authority and that be the unpardonable sin in all community draw nearer friend for i love to let my reason be feel and understand by those who be to be affect by my decision and this be a happy moment to give a short lesson to the vévaisans -- let the bride and bridegroom wait -- draw nearer all that ye may better hear what i have to say the crowd press more closely around the foot of the stage and peterchen assume a didactic air resume he discourse the object of all authority be to find the means of its own support continue the bailiff for unless it can exist it must fall to the ground and you all be sufficiently school to know that when a thing become of indifferent value it lose most of its consideration thus government be establish in order that it may protect itself since without this power it could not remain a government and there be not a man exist who be not ready to admit that even a bad government be better than none but ours be particularly a good government its greatest care on all occasion be to make itself respect and he who respect himself be certain to have esteem in the eye of other without this security we should become like the unbridled steed or the victim of anarchy and confusion ay and damnable heresy in religion thus you see my friend you choice lie between the government of berne or no government at all for when only two thing exist by take one away the number be reduce half and as the great canton will keep its own share of the institution by take half away vaud be leave as naked as my hand ask yourselve if you have any government but this you know you have not be you quit of berne therefore you clearly would have none at all officer you have a sword at you side which be a good type of we authority draw it and hold it up that all may see it you perceive my friend that the officer have a sword but that he have only one sword lay it at thy foot officer you perceive friend that have but one sword and lay that sword aside he no longer have a sword at all that weapon represent we authority which lay aside become no authority leave we with a unarmed hand this happy comparison draw a murmur of applause the proposition of peterchen have most of the property of a popular theory be deficient in neither a bold assertion a brief exposition nor a practical illustration the latter in particular be long afterwards speak of in vaud as a exposition little short of the well-known judgment of solomon who have resort to the same keen-edged weapon in order to solve a point almost as knotty as this settle by the bailiff when the approbation have a little subside the warm peterchen continue he discourse which possess the random and generalize logic of most of the dissertation that be utter in the interest of thing as they be without pay any particular deference to thing as they should be what be the use of teach the multitude to read and write he ask have not franz kauffman know how to write could he have imitate he master 's hand and would he have lose he head for mistake another man 's name for he own a little reflection show we he would not now as for the other art could the people read bad book have they never learn the alphabet if there be a man present who can say to the contrary i absolve he from he respect and invite he to speak boldly for there be no inquisition in vaud but we invite argument this be a free government and a fatherly government and a mild government as ye all know but it be not a government that like reading and write reading that lead to the perusal of bad book and write that cause false signature fellow-citizen for we be all equal with the exception of certain difference that need not now be name it be a government for you good and therefore it be a government that like itself and whose first duty it be to protect itself and its officer at all hazard even though it might by accident commit some seeming injustice fellow canst thou read indifferently worshipful bailiff return maso there be those who get through a book with less trouble than myself i warrant you now he mean a good book but as for a bad one i 'll engage the varlet go through it like a wild boar this come of education among the ignorant there be no more certain method to corrupt a community and to rivet it in beastly practice than to educate the ignorant the enlighten can bear knowledge for rich food do not harm the stomach that be use to it but it be hellebore to the ill-fed education be a arm for knowledge be power and the ignorant man be but a infant and to give he knowledge be like put a loaded blunderbuss into the hand of a child what can a ignorant man do with knowledge he be as likely to use it wrong end uppermost as in any other manner learning be a ticklish thing it be say by festus to have madden even the wise and experienced paul and what may we not expect it to do with you downright ignoramus what be thy name prisoner tommaso santus sometimes know among my friend as san tommaso call by my enemy il maledetto and by my familiar maso thou hast a formidable number of alias the certain sign of a rogue thou hast confess that thou canst read -- nay signor bailiff i would not be take to have say -- by the faith of calvin thou didst confess it before all this goodly company wilt thou deny thine own word knave in the very face of justice thou canst read -- thou hast it in thy countenance and i would go nigh to swear too that thou hast some inkling of the quill be the truth honestly say signor grimaldus i know not how you find this affair on the other side of the alp but with we we greatest trouble come from these well-taught knave who pick up knowledge fraudulently use it with felonious intent without thought of the want and rights of the public we have we difficulty as be the fact wherever man be find with he selfishness and passion signor bailiff but be we not do a ungallant act towards yonder fair bride by give the precedency to man of this cast would it not be better to dismiss the modest christine happy in hymen 's chain before we enter more deeply into the question of the manacle of these prisoner to the amazement of all who know the bailiff 's natural obstinacy which be wont to increase instead of become more manageable in he cup peterchen assent to this proposition with a complaisance and apparent good-will that he rarely manifest towards any opinion of which he do not think himself legitimately the father though like many other who bear that honorable title he be sometimes make to yield the privilege of paternity to other man 's child he have show a unusual deference to the italian however throughout the whole of they short intercourse and on no occasion be it less equivocal than in the promptness with which he receive the present hint the prisoner and officer be command to stand aside but so near as to remain beneath he eye while some of the official of the abbaye be order to give notice to the train which await these arrangement in silent wonder that it might now approach chapter xviii go wiser thou and in thy scale of sense weigh thy opinion against providence call imperfection what thou fanciest such say here he give too little there too much destroy all creature for thy sport or gust and say if man 's unhappy god 's unjust pope it be unnecessary to repeat the list of character that act the different part in the train of the village nuptials all be there at the close of the ceremony as they have appear earlier in the day and as the last of the legal form of the marriage be actually to take place in presence of the bailiff preparatory to the more solemn rite of the church the throng yield to its curiosity break through the line of those who be station to restrain its inroad and press about the foot of the estrade in the stronger interest which reality be know to possess over fiction during the day a thousand new inquiry have be make concern the bride whose beauty and mien be altogether so superior to what might have be expect in one who could consent to act the part she do on so public a occasion and whose modest bearing be in such singular contradiction to she present situation none know however or if it be know no one choose to reveal she history and as curiosity have be so keenly whet by mystery the rush of the multitude be merely a proof of the power which expectation aid by the thousand surmise of rumor can gain over the mind of the idle whatever might have be the character of the conjecture make at the expense of poor christine -- and they be want in neither variety nor malice -- most be compel to agree in commend the diffidence of she air and the gentle sweetness of she mild and peculiar beauty some indeed affect to see artifice in the former which be pronounced to be far too excellent or too much overdo for nature the usual amount of common-place remark be make too on the lucky diversity that be to be find in taste and on the happy necessity there exist of all be able to find the means to please themselves but these be no more than the moral blotch that usually disfigure human commendation the sentiment and the sympathy of the mass be powerfully and irresistibly enlist in favor of the unknown maiden -- feeling that be very unequivocally manifest as she draw nearer the estrade walk timidly through a dense lane of body all of which be press eagerly forward to get a better view of she person the bailiff under ordinary circumstance would have take in dudgeon this violation of the rule prescribe for the government of the multitude for he be perfectly sincere in he opinion absurd as so many of they be and like many other honest man who defeat the effect they would produce by force construction of they principle he be a little apt to run into excess of discipline but in the present instance he be rather pleased than otherwise to see the throng within the reach of he voice the occasion be at best but semi-official and he be so far under the influence of the warm liquor of the côtes as to burn with the desire of put forth still more liberally he flower of eloquence and he store of wisdom he receive the inroad therefore with a air of perfect good-humor a manifestation of assent that encourage still greater innovation on the limit until the space occupy by the principal actor in this closing scene be reduce to the smallest possible size that be at all compatible with they movement and comfort in this situation of thing the ceremony proceed the gentle flow of hope and happiness which be slowly increase in the mild bosom of the bride from the first moment of she appearance in this unusual scene to that in which it be check by the cry of pippo have be gradually lessen under a sense of distrust and she now enter the square with a secret and mysterious dread at the heart which she inexperience and great ignorance of life serve fearfully to increase she imagination magnify the cause of alarm into some prepared and design insult christine fully aware of the obloquy that press upon she race have only consent to adopt this unusual mode of change she condition under a sensitive apprehension that any other would have necessarily lead to the exposure of she origin this fear though exaggerated and indeed causeless be the result of too much brooding of late over she own situation and of that morbid sensibility in which the most pure and innocent be unhappily the most likely to indulge the concealment as have already be explain be that of she intended husband who with the subterfuge of a interested spirit have hope to mislead the little circle of he own acquaintance and gratify he cupidity at the cheapest possible rate to himself but there be a point of self-abasement beyond which the perfect consciousness of right rarely permit even the most timid to proceed as the bride move up the lane of human body she eye grow less disturbed and she step firmer -- for the pride of rectitude overcome the ordinary girlish sensibility of she sex and make she the steadiest at the very instant that the greater portion of female would have be the most likely to betray they weakness she have just attain this forced but respectable tranquillity as the bailiff signing to the crowd to hush its murmur and to remain motionless arise with a manner that he intend to be dignified and which pass with the multitude for a very successful experiment in its way to open the business in hand by a short address the reader be not to be surprise at the volubility of honest peterchen for it be get to be late in the day and he frequent libation throughout the ceremony would have work he up to even a much higher flight of eloquence have the occasion and the company at all suit such a display of he power we have have a joyous day my friend he say one whose excellent ceremony ought to recall to every one of we we dependence on providence we frail and sinful disposition and particularly we duty to the council by the type of plenty and abundance we see the bounty of nature which be a gift from heaven by the different little failure that have be perhaps unavoidably make in some of the nicer part of the exhibition -- and i would here particularly mention the besotted drunkenness of antoine giraud the man who have impudently undertake to play the part of silenus as a fit subject of you attention for it be full of profit to all hard-drinking knave -- we may see we own awful imperfection while in the order of the whole and the perfect obedience of the subordinate do we find a parallel to the beauty of a vigilant and exact police and a well-regulated community thus you see that though the ceremony have a heathen exterior it have a christian moral god grant that we all forget the former and remember the latter as best become we several character and we common country and now have do with the divinity and they legend -- with the exception of that varlet silenus whose misconduct i promise you be not to be so easily overlook -- we will give some attention to mortal affair marriage be honorable before god and man and although i have never have leisure to enter into this holy state myself owe to a variety of reason but chiefly from my be wed as it be to the state to which we all owe quite as much or even greater duty than the most faithful wife owe to she husband i would not have you suppose that i have not a high veneration for matrimony so far from this i have look on no part of this day 's ceremony with more satisfaction than these of the nuptials which we be now call upon to complete in a manner suitable to the importance of the occasion let the bridegroom and the bride stand forth that all may the better see the happy pair at the bidding of the bailiff jacque coli lead christine upon the little stage prepare for they reception where both be more completely in view of the spectator than they have yet be the movement and the agitation consequent on so public a exposure deepen the bloom on the soft cheek of the bride and another and a still less equivocal murmur of applause arise in the multitude the spectacle of youth innocence and feminine loveliness strongly stir the sympathy of even the most churlish and rude and most present begin to feel for she fear and to participate in she hope this be excellent continue the well-pleased peterchen who be never half so happy as when he be officially provide for the happiness of other it promise a happy _ ménage _ a loyal frugal industrious and active groom with a fair and willing bride can drive discontent up any man 's chimney that which be to be do next be legal and binding must be do with proper gravity and respect let the notary advance -- not he who have so aptly play this character but the commendable and upright officer who be rightly charge with these respectable function -- and we will listen to the contract i recommend a decent silence my friend for the true law and real matrimony be at the bottom -- a grave affair at the best and one never to be treat with levity since a few word pronounce now in haste may be repent of for a whole life hereafter every thing be conduct accord to the wish of the bailiff and with great decency of form a true and authorized notary read aloud the marriage-contract the instrument which contain the civic relation and rights of the party and which only wait for the signature to be complete this document require of course that the real name of the contracting party they age birth parentage and all those fact which be necessary to establish they identity and to secure the rights of succession should be clearly set forth in a way to render the instrument valid at the most remote period should there ever arrive a necessity to recur to it in the way of testimony the most eager attention pervade the crowd as they listen to these little particulars and adelheid tremble in this delicate part of the proceedings as the suppress but still audible breathing of sigismund reach she ear lest something might occur to give a rude shock to he feeling but it would seem the notary have he cue the detail touch christine be so artfully arrange that while they be perfectly bind in law they be so dexterously conceal from the observation of the unsuspecting that no attention be draw to the point most apprehend by they exposure sigismund breathe freer when the notary draw near the end of he task and adelheid hear the heavy breath he draw at the close with the joy one feel at the certainty of have pass a imminent danger christine herself seem relieved though hor inexperience in a great degree prevent she from foresee all that the greater practice of sigismund have lead he to anticipate this be quite in rule and naught now remain but to receive the signature of the respective party and they friend resume the bailiff a happy ménage be like a well-ordered state a foretaste of the joy and peace of heaven while a discontented household and a turbulent community may be liken at once to the penalty and the pain of hell let the friend of the party step forth in readiness to sign when the principal themselves shall have discharge this duty a few of the relative and associate of jacque coli move out of the crowd and place themselves at the side of the bridegroom who immediately write he own name like a man impatient to be happy a pause succeed for all be curious to see who claim affinity to the tremble girl on this the most solemn and important event of she life a interval of several minute elapse and no one appear the respiration of sigismund become more difficult he seem about to choke and then yield to a generous impulse he arise for the love of god -- for thine own sake -- for mine be not too hasty whisper the terrify adelheid for she see the hot glow that almost blaze on he brow i can not desert poor christine to the scorn of the world in a moment like this if i die of shame i must go forward and own myself the hand of mademoiselle de willading be lay upon he arm and he yield to this silent but impressive entreaty for just then he see that he sister be about to be relieve from she distressing solitude the throng yield and a decent pair attire in the guise of small but comfortable proprietor move doubtingly towards the bride the eye of christine fill with tear for terror and the apprehension of disgrace yield suddenly to joy those who advance to support she in that moment of intense trial be she father and mother the respectable-looking pair move slowly to the side of they daughter and have place themselves one on each side of she they first venture to cast furtive and subdue glance at the multitude it be doubtless painful to the parent to part with so fair and so dutiful a child resume the obtuse peterchen who rarely see in any emotion more than its most common-place and vulgar character nature pull they one way while the term of the contract and the progress of we ceremony pull another i have often weakness of this sort myself the most sensitive heart be the most liable to these attack but my child be the public and do riot admit of too much of what i may call the detail of sentiment else by the soul of calvin be i but a indifferent bailiff for berne -- thou art the father of this fair and blush maiden and thou she mother we be these return balthazar mildly thou art not of vévey or its neighborhood by thy speech of the great canton mein herr for the answer be in german these contract district possess nearly as many dialect as there be territorial division we be stranger in vaud thou hast not do the worse for marry thy daughter with a vévaisan and more especially under the favor of we renowned and liberal abbaye i warrant I thy child will be none the poorer for this compliance with the wish of those who lead we ceremony she will not go portionless to the house of she husband return the father color with secret pride for to one to whom the chance of life leave so few source of satisfaction those that be possess become doubly dear this be well a right worthy couple and i doubt not a meet companion will you offspring prove monsieur le notaire call off the name of those good people aloud that they may sign at least with a decent parade it be settle otherwise hastily answer the functionary of the quill who be necessarily in the secret of christine 's origin and who have be well bribe to observe discretion it would altogether derange the order and regularity of the proceedings as thou wilt for i would have nothing illegal and least of all nothing disorderly but o ' heaven 's sake let we get through with we penmanship for i hear there be symptom that the meat be likely to be overbaked canst thou write good man indifferently mein herr : but in a way to make what i will bind before the law give the quill to the bride mr notary and let we protract the happy event no longer the bailiff here bent he head aside and whisper to a attendant to hurry towards the kitchen and to look to the affair of the banquet christine take the pen with a tremble hand and pallid cheek and be about to apply it to the paper when a sudden cry from the throng divert the attention of all present to a new matter of interest who dare thus indecently interrupt this grave scene and that too in so great a presence sternly demand the bailiff pippo who with the other prisoner have unavoidably be inclose in the space near the estrade by the pressure of the multitude stagger more into view and remove he cap with a well-managed respect present himself humbly to the sight of peterchen it be i illustrious and excellent governor return the wily neapolitan who retain just enough of the liquor he have swallow to render he audacious without weaken he means of observation it be i pippo a artist of humble pretension but i hope a very honest man and as i know a great reverencer of the law and a true friend to order let the good man speak up boldly a man of these principle have a right to be hear we live in a time of damnable innovation and of most atrocious attempt to overturn the altar the state and the public trust and the sentiment of such a man be like dew to the parched grass the reader be not to imagine from the language of the bailiff that vaud stand on the eve of any great political commotion but as the government be in itself a usurpation and found on the false principle of exclusion it be quite as usual then as now to cry out against the moral throe of violate right since the same eagerness to possess the same selfishness in grasp however unjustly obtain and the same audacity of assertion with a view to mystify pervade the christian world a century since as exist to-day the cunning pippo see that the bait have take and assume a still more respectful and loyal mien he continue : -- although a stranger illustrious governor i have have great delight in these joyous and excellent ceremony they fame will be spread far and near and man will talk of little less for the coming year but of vévey and its festival but a great scandal hang over you honorable head which it be in my power to turn aside and san gennaro forbid that i a stranger that have be well entertain in you town should hesitate about raise he voice on account of any scruple of modesty no doubt great governor you eccellenza believe that this worthy vévaisan be about to wive a creditable maiden whose name could be honorably mention with those of the ceremony and you town before the proudest company in europe what of this fellow the girl be fair and modest enough at least to the eye and if thou knowest aught else whisper thy secret to she husband or she friend but do not come in this rude manner to disturb we harmony with thy raven throat just as we be ready to sing a epithalamium in honor of the happy pair you excessive particularity be the curse of wedlock my friend and i have a great mind to send this knave in spite of all this profession of order which be like enough to produce disorder for a month or two into we vévey dungeon for he pain pippo be stagger for just drunk enough to be audacious he have not all he faculty at he perfect command and he usual acumen be a little at fault still accustom to brave public opinion and to carry himself through the failure of he exhibition by heavier draft on the patience and credulity of he audience he determine to persevere as the most likely way of extricate himself from the menaced consequence of he indiscretion a thousand pardon great bailiff he answer naught but a burning desire to do justice to you high honor and to the reputation of the abbaye 's festival could have lead I so far but -- speak thy mind at once rogue and have do with circumlocution i have little to say signora except that the father of this illustrious bride who be about to honor vévey by make she nuptials a occasion for all in the city to witness and to favor be the common headsman of berne -- a wretch who lately come near to prove the destruction of more christian than the law have condemn and who be sufficiently out of favor with heaven to bring the fate of gomorrah upon you town pippo totter to he station among the prisoner with the manner of one who have deliver himself of a important trust and be instantly lose to view so rapid and unlooked for have be the interruption and so vehement the utterance of the italian while deliver he fact that though several present see they tendency when it be too late none have sufficient presence of mind to prevent the exposure a murmur arise in the crowd which stir like a vast sheet of fluid on which a pass gust have alight and then become fix and calm of all present the bailiff manifest the least surprise or concern for to he the last minister of the law be a object if not precisely of respect of politic good-will rather than of dishonor what of this he answer in the way of one who have expect a far more important revelation what of this should it be true harkee friend -- art thou in sooth the note balthazar he to whose family the canton be indebted for so much fair justice balthazar see that he secret be betray and that it be wiser simply to admit the fact than to have recourse to subterfuge or denial nature moreover have make he a man with strong and pure propensity for the truth and he be never without the innate consciousness of the injustice of which he have be make the victim by the unfeeling ordinance of society raise he head he look around he with firmness for he too unhappily have be accustom to act in the face of multitude and he answer the question of the bailiff in he usual mild tone of voice but with composure herr bailiff i be by inheritance the last avenger of the law by my office i like the title it be a good one the last avenger of the law if rogue will offend or dissatisfied spirit plot there must be a hand to put the finish blow to they evil work and why not thou as well as another harkee officer shut I up yonder italian knave for a week on bread and water for daring to trifle with the time and good-nature of the public in this impudent manner and this worthy dame be thy wife honest balthazar and that fair maiden thy child -- hast thou more of so goodly a race god have bless I in my offspring mein herr ay god have bless thee -- and a great blessing it should be as i know by bitter experience -- that be be a bachelor i understand the misery of be childless -- i would say no more sign the contract honest balthazar with thy wife and daughter that we may have a end of this the family of the proscribe be about to obey this mandate when jacque coli abruptly throw down the emblem of a bridegroom tear the contract in fragment and publicly announce that he have change he intention and that he would not wive a headsman 's child the public mind be usually catch by any loud declaration in favor of the ruling prejudice and after the first brief pause of surprise be past the determination of the groom be receive with a shout of applause that be immediately follow by general coarse and deride laughter the throng press upon the keeper of the limit in a still denser mass oppose a impenetrable wall of human body to the passage of any in either direction and a dead stillness succeed as if all present breathlessly await the result of the singular scene so unexpected and sudden be the purpose of the groom that they who be most affect by it do not at first fully comprehend the extent of the disgrace that be so publicly heap upon they the innocent and unpractised christine stand resemble the cold statue of a vestal with the pen raise ready to affix she as yet untarnished name to the contract in a attitude of suspense while she wonder look follow the agitation of the multitude as the startled bird before it take wing regard a movement among the leaf of the bush but there be no escape from the truth conviction of its humiliating nature come too soon and by the time the calm of intense curiosity have succeed to the momentary excitement of the spectator she be stand a exquisite but painful picture of wound feminine feeling and of maiden shame she parent too be stupify by the suddenness of the unexpected shock and it be longer before they faculty recover the tone proper to meet a insult so unprovoked and gross this be unusual drily remark the bailiff who be the first to break the long and painful silence it be brutal warmly interpose the signor grimaldus unless there have be deception practice on the bridegroom it be utterly without excuse you experience signora have readily suggest the true point in a very knotty case and i shall proceed without delay to look into its merit sigismund resume he seat he hand release the sword-hilt that it have spontaneously grasp when he hear this declaration of the bailiff 's intention for the sake of thy poor sister forbear whisper the terrify adelheid all will ye be well -- all must be well -- it be impossible that one so sweet and innocent should long remain with she honor unavenge the young man smile frightfully at least so it seem to he companion : but he maintain the appearance of composure in the mean time

never before to-day have i be require to decide upon a domestic misunderstanding before the party be actually wed this be a grave interruption of the ceremony of the abbaye as well as a slight upon the notary and the spectator and need be well look to dost thou really persist in put this unusual termination to a marriage-ceremony herr bridegroom jacque coli have lose a little of the violent impulse which lead he to the precipitate and inconsiderate act of destroy a instrument he have legally execute but he outbreaking of feeling be follow by a sullen and fixed resolution to persevere in

that he be come of a ancient and honorable line but have he be take from he castle in infancy and conceal under a feigned name and keep from man 's knowledge as be that he be who would think of he for the deed of he ancestor as the sire de willading would in such a case have lose in the world 's esteem so do christine gain but as opinion would return to the baron when the truth should be publish so

rejoin the signor grimaldus that we may first make sure that we touch the true merit of the case be another to claim the signor de willading 's honor and name thou wouldst scarce grant he suit without question we friend here touch he own rights to the same better and better this be justice while that which fall from the bridegroom be only argument harkee balthazar and thou good woman he wife -- and thou too pretty christine -- what have ye all to answer to the reasonable plea of jacque coli balthazar who by the nature of he office and by he general masculine duty have be so much accustomed to meet with harsh instance of the public hatred soon recover he usual calm exterior even though he feel a father 's pang and a father 's just resentment at witness this open injury to one so gentle and deserving as he child but the blow have be far heavier on marguerite the faithful and long-continued sharer of he fortune the wife of balthazar be past the prime of she day but she still retain the presence and some of the personal beauty which have render she in youth a woman of extraordinary mien and carriage when the word which announce the slight to she daughter first fall on she ear she pale to the hue of the dead for several minute she stand look more like one that have take a final departure from the interest and emotion of life than one that in truth be a prey to one of the strongest passion the human breast can ever entertain that of wounded maternal affection then the blood steal slowly to she temple and by the time the bailiff put he question she entire face be glowing under a tumult of feeling that threaten to defeat its own wish by deprive she of the power of speech thou canst answer he balthazar she say huskily motion for she husband to arouse he faculty thou art use to these multitude and to they scorn thou art a man and canst do we justice herr bailiff say the headsman who seldom lose the mild deportment that characterize he manner there be much truth in what jacque have urge but all present may have see that the fault do not come of we but of yonder heartless vagabond the wretch seek my life on the lake in we late unfortunate passage hither and not content with wish to rob my child of they father he come now to injure I still more cruelly i be bear to the office i hold as you well know herr hofmeister or it would never have be seek by I but what the law will man insist upon as right this girl can never be call upon to strike a head from its shoulder and know from childhood up the scorn that await all who come of my race i seek the means of release she at least from some part of the curse that have descend on we i know not if this be legal interrupted the bailiff quickly what be you opinion she von willading can any in berne escape they heritable duty any more than hereditary privilege can be assume this be a grave question innovation lead to innovation and we venerable law and we sacred usage must be preserve if we would avert the curse of change balthazar have well observe that a female can not exercise the executioner 's office true but a female may bring forth they that can this be a cunning question for the doctors-in-law and it must be examine of all damnable offence heaven keep I from that of a wish for change if change be ever to follow why establish change be the unpardonable sin in politics signor grimaldus since that which be often change become valueless in time even if it be coin the mother have something she would utter say the genoese whose quick but observant eye have be watch the workings of the countenance of the repudiate family while the bailiff be digress in he usual prolix manner on thing in general and who detect the throe of feeling which heave the bosom of the respectable marguerite in a way to announce a speedy birth to she thought hast thou aught to urge good woman demand peterchen who be well enough disposed to hear both side in all case of controversy unless they happen to touch the supremacy of the great canton to speak the truth the reason of jacque coli be plausible and witty and be likely to weigh heavy against thee the color slowly disappear from the brow of the mother and she turn such a look of fondness and protection on she child as speak a complete condensation of all she feeling in the engrossing sentiment of a mother 's love have i aught to urge slowly repeat marguerite look steadily about she at the curious and unfeeling crowd which bent on the indulgence of its appetite for novelty and excite by its prejudice still press upon the halberd of the officer -- have a mother aught to say in defense of she injured and insulted child why hast thou not also ask herr hofmeister if i be human we come of proscribed race i know balthazar and i but like thee proud bailiff and the privileged at thy side we come too of god the judgment and power of man have crush we from the beginning and we be use to the world 's scorn and to the world 's injustice say not so good woman for no more be require than the law sanction thou art now talk against thine own interest and i interrupt thee in pure mercy ` twould be scandalous in I to sit here and listen to one that have bespatter the law with a evil tongue i know naught of the subtlety of thy law but well do i know they cruelty and wrong as respects I and mine all other come into the world with hope but we have be crush from the beginning that surely can not be just which destroy hope even the sinner need not despair through the mercy of the son of god but we that have come into the world under thy law have little before we in life but shame and the scorn of man nay thou quite mistakest the matter dame these privilege be first bestow on thy family in reward for good service i make no doubt and it be long account profitable to be of this office i do not say that in a darker age when oppression stalk over the land and the best be barbarous as the worst to-day some of those of whom we be bear may not have be fierce and cruel enough to take upon themselves this office with good will but i deny that any short of he who hold the universe in he hand and who control a endless future to compensate for the evil of the present time have the power to say to the son that he shall be the heritor of the father 's wrong how dost question the doctrine of descent we shall next hear thee dispute the rights of the bürgerschaft i know nothing herr bailiff of the nice distinction of you rights in the city and wish to utter naught for or against but a entire life of contumely and bitterness be apt to become a life of thoughtfulness and care and i see sufficient difference between the preservation of privilege fairly earn though even these may and do bring with they abuse hard to be bear and the unmerited oppression of the offspring for the ancestor ' fault there be little of that justice which savor of heaven in this and the time will come when a fearful return will be make for wrong so sore concern for thy pretty daughter good marguerite cause thee to speak strongly be not the daughter of a headsman and a headsman 's wife they offspring as much as the fair maiden who sit near thee be the child of the noble at she side be i to love she less that she be despise by a cruel world have i not the same suffering at the birth the same joy in the infant smile the same hope in the childish promise and the same tremble for she fate when i consent to trust she happiness to another as she that bear that more fortunate but not fairer maiden have have in she have god create two nature -- two yearning for the mother -- two longing for we child 's weal -- those of the rich and honor and those of the crushed and despise go to good marguerite thou puttest the matter altogether in a manner that be unusual be we reverenced usage nothing -- we solemn edict -- we city 's rule -- and we resolution to govern and that fairly and with effect i fear that these be stronger than the right and likely to endure when the tear of the oppress be exhaust when they and they fate shall be forget thy child be fair and modest observe the signor grimaldus and will yet find a youth who will more than atone for this injury he that have reject she be not worthy of she faith marguerite turn she look which have be glowing with awaken feeling on she pale and still motionless daughter the expression of she softened and she fold she child to she bosom as the dive shelter its young all she arouse feeling appear to dissolve in the sentiment of love my child be fair herr peter she continue without advert to the interruption but better than fair she be good christine be gentle and dutiful and not for a world would she bruise the spirit of another as hers have be this day bruise humble as we be and despise of man bailiff we have we thought and we wish and we hope and memory and all the other feeling of those that be more fortunate and when i have rack my brain to reason on the justice of a fate which have condemn all of my race to have little other communion with they kind but that of blood and when bitterness have swollen at my heart ay near to burst and i have be ready to curse providence and die this mild affectionate girl have be near to quench the fire that consume I and to tighten the cord of life until she love and innocence have leave I willing to live even under a heavier load than this i bear thou art of a honor race bailiff and canst little understand most of we suffering but thou art a man and shouldst know what it be to be wound through another and that one who be dearer to thee than thine own flesh thy word be strong good marguerite again interrupt the bailiff who feel a uneasiness of which he would very gladly be rid himmel who can like any thing better than he own flesh besides thou shouldst remember that i be a bachelor and bachelor be apt naturally to feel more for they own flesh than for that of other stand aside and let the procession pass that we may go to the banquet which wait if jacque coli will none of thy girl i hove not the power to make he double the dowry good woman and thou shalt have a choice of husband in spite of the axe and the sword that be in thy escutcheon let the halberdier make way for those honest people there who at least be functionary of the law and be to be protect as well as ourselves the crowd obey yield readily to the advance of the officer and in a few minute the useless attendant of the village nuptials and the train of hymen slink away sensible of the ridicule that in a double degree attach itself to folly when it fail of effect even its own absurdity chapter xix the weep blood in woman 's breast be never know to thee nor the balm that drop on wound of woe from woman 's pity e ' e burn a large portion of the curious follow the disconcerted mummer from the square while other hasten to break they fast at the several place select for this important feature in the business of the day most of those who have be on the estrade now leave it and in a few minute the living carpet of head around the little area in front of the bailiff be reduce to a few hundred of those whose better feeling be stronger than they self indulgence perhaps this distribution of the multitude be about in the proportion that be usually find in those case in which selfishness draw in one direction while feeling or sympathy with the wrong pull in another among all mass of human being that be congregate as spectator of some general and indifferent exhibition of interest in which they have no near personal concern the bailiff and he immediate friend the prisoner and the family of the headsman with a sufficient number of the guard be among those who remain the bustling peterchen have lose some of he desire to take he place at the banquet in the difficulty of the question which have arise and in the certainty that nothing material in the way of gastronomy would be attempt until he appear we should do injustice to he heart do we not add also that he have troublesome qualm of conscience which intuitively admonish he that the world have deal hardly with the family of balthazar there remain the party of maso too to dispose of and he character of a upright as well as of a firm magistrate to maintain as the crowd diminish however he and those near he descend from they high place and mixed with the few who occupy the still guard area in front of the stage balthazar have not stir from he rivet posture near the table of the notary for he shrink from encounter in the company of he wife and daughter the insult to which he should be expose now he character be know by mingle with the crowd and he wait for a favorable moment to withdraw unseen marguerite still stand folding christine to she bosom as if jealous of farther injury to she beloved the recreant bridegroom have take the earliest opportunity to disappear and be see no more in vevev during the remainder of the revel peterchen cast a hurry glance at this group as he foot reach the ground and then turn towards the thief-taker he make a sign for they to advance with they prisoner thy evil tongue have balk one of the most engaging rite of this day 's festival knave observe the bailiff address pippo with a certain magisterial reproof in he voice i should do well to send thee to berne to serve a month among those who sweep the city street as a punishment for thy raven throat what in the name of all thy roman saint and idol hadst thou against the happiness of these honest people that thou must come in this unseemly manner to destroy it naught but the love of truth eccellenza and a just horror of the man of blood that thou and all like thee should have a horror of the minister of the law i can understand and it be more than probable that thy dislike will extend to I for i be about to pronounce a just judgment on thee and thy fellow for disturb the harmony of the day and especially for have be guilty of the enormous crime of a outrage on we agent couldst thou grant I a moment 's leave ask the genoese in he ear a hour noble gaetano if thou wilt the two then converse apart for a minute or more during the brief dialogue the signor grimaldus occasionally look at the quiet and apparently contrite maso and stretch he arm towards the leman in a way to give the observer a inkling of he subject the countenance of the herr hofmeister change from official sternness to a expression of decent concern as he listen and ere long it take a decidedly forgiving laxity of muscle when the other have do speak he bow a ready assent to what he have just hear and return to the prisoner as i have just observe he resume it be my duty now to pronounce finally on these man and they conduct firstly they be stranger and as such be not only ignorant of we law but entitle to we hospitality next they have be punish sufficiently for the original offence by be abridged of the day 's sport and as to the crime commit against ourselves in the person of we agent it be freely forgive for forgiveness be a generous quality and become a paternal form of rule depart therefore of god 's name all of ye to a man and remember henceforth to be discreet signora and you herr baron shall we to the banquet the two old friend have already move onward in close and earnest discourse and the bailiff be oblige to seek out another companion none offer at the moment but sigismund who have stand since quit the stage in a attitude of complete indecision and helplessness notwithstanding he great physical energy and he usual moral readiness to act take the arm of the young soldier with the disregard of ceremony that denote a sense of condescension the bailiff draw he away from the spot heedless himself of the other 's reluctance and without observe that in consequence of the general desertion for few be dispose to indulge they compassion unless it be in company with the honor and noble adelheid be leave absolutely alone with the family of balthazar this office of a headsman herr sigismund commence the unobservant peterchen too full of he own opinion and much too sensible of he right to be deliver of they in the presence of he junior and inferior to note the youth 's trouble be at the best but a disgusting affair though we of station and authority be oblige prudently to appear to deem it otherwise before the people in we own interest thou hast have occasion to remark often in the discipline of thy military follower that a false coloring must be put upon thing lest they who be very necessary to the state should not think the state quite so necessary to they what be thy opinion captain sigismund as a man who have yet he hope and he view on the softer sex of this act of jacque coli -- be it conduct to be approve of or to be condemn i deem he a heartless mercenary miscreant the suppress energy with which these unexpected word be utter cause the bailiff to stop and to look up in he companion 's face as if to ask its reason but there all be already calm for the young man have too long be accustom to drill its expression when the sensitive sore of he origin be probe as so frequently happen to permit the momentary weakness long to maintain its ascendency ay this be the opinion of thy year resume peterchen thou art at a time of life when we esteem a pretty face and a mellow eye of more account even than gold but we put on we interested spectacles after thirty and seldom see any thing very admirable that be not at the same time very lucrative here be melchior de willading 's daughter now a woman to set a city in a blaze for she have wit and land and beauty besides good blood -- what for instance be thy opinion of she merit that she be deserving of all the happiness that every human excellence ought to confer hum -- thou art nearer to thirty than i have think thee herr sigismund but touch this balthazar thou art not to believe on account of the few word of grace which fall from I that my aversion for the wretch be less than thine or than that of any other honest man but it would be unseemly and unwise in a bailiff to desert the last minister of the law 's decree in the face of the public there be feeling and sentiment that be natural to we all and among they be to be class respect and honor for the well and nobly bear -lrb- the discourse be in german -rrb- and hatred and contempt for those who be condemn of man these be feeling which belong to human nature itself and god forbid that i a man already past the age of romance should really entertain any sentiment that be not strictly human do they not rather belong to abuse -- to we prejudice the difference be not material in a practical view young man that which be fairly breed into the mind by discipline and habit get to be stronger than instinct or even than one of the sens let there be a unseemly sight or a foul smell near thee and thou hast only to turn thy eye or hold thy nose to be rid of it but i could never find the means to lessen a prejudice that be once fairly seat in the mind thou mayest look whither thou wilt and shut out the unsavory odor of the imagination by all the means thou canst invent but if a man be in truth condemn of opinion he might as well make he appeal to god at once for justice as to any mercy he be likely to receive from man this much have i learn in my experience as a public functionary i should hope that these be not the legal dogma of we ancient canton return the youth conquer he feeling though it cost he a severe effort as far from it as basle be from coire we hold no such discreditable doctrine i challenge the world to show a state that possess a fairer set of maxim than ourselves and we even endeavor to make we practice chime in with we opinion whenever it can be do in safety no in these particulars berne be a paragon of a community and as rarely say one thing and do another as any government you shall see what i now tell thee young man be say to thee in the familiarity of a fête as thou know ` st in which there have be some foolery to open confidence and to loosen the tongue we openly and loudly profess great truth and equality before the law save the city 's rights and take holy heavenly upright justice for we guide in all matter of theory himmel if thou would ` st have thy affair decide on principle go before the council or the magistracy of the canton and thou shalt hear such wisdom and witness such keen-sightedness into chicanery as would have honor solomon himself and notwithstanding this prejudice be a general master how canst thou have it otherwise be not a man a man will he not lean as he have be weigh upon -- do not the tree grow in the way the twig be bent no while i adore justice herr sigismund as become a bailiff i confess to both prejudice and partiality mentally consider now yonder maiden the pretty christine lose some of she grace in my eye as no doubt she do in thine when the truth come to be know that she be balthazar 's child the girl be fair and modest and win in she way but there be something -- i can not tell thee what -- but a certain damnable something -- a taint -- a color -- a hue -- a -- a -- a -- that show she origin the instant i hear who be she parent -- be it not so with thee when she origin be prove but not previously ay of a certainty i mean not otherwise but a thing be not see any the worse because it be see thoroughly although it may be see falsely when there be false cover to conceal its ugliness particularity be necessary to philosophy ignorance be a mask to conceal the little detail that be necessary to knowledge you moor might pass for a christian in a mask but strip he of he cover and the true shade of the skin be see didst thou not observe for instance in all that touch feminine grace and perfection the manifest difference between the daughter of melchior de willading and the daughter of this balthazar there be the difference between a maiden of most honor and happy extraction and a maiden most miserably condemn nay the demoiselle de willading be the fairer nature have certainly be most bountiful to the heiress of willade herr bailiff who be scarcely less attractive for she female grace and goodness than she be fortunate in the accident of birth and condition i know thou couldst not in secret be of a different mind from the rest of man exclaim peterchen in triumph for he take the warmth of he companion 's manner to be a reluctant and half-concealed assent to he own proposition here the discourse end : for the earnest conference between melchior and the signor grimaldus have terminate the bailiff hasten to join he more important guest and sigismund be release from a examination that have harrow every feeling of he soul while he even despise the besotted loquacity of the man who have be the instrument of he torture the separation of adelheid from she father be anticipate and previously provide for since the man be expect to resort to the banquet at this hour she have continue near christine and she mother therefore without attract any unusual attention to she movement even in those who be the object of she sympathy a feeling that be so natural in one of she year and sex a male attendant in the livery of she father 's house remain near she person a protector who certain to insure not only she safety in the throng street of the town but to exact from those whose faculty be begin to yield to the excess of the occasion the testimonial of respect that be due to she station it be under these circumstance then that the more honor and to the eye of the uninstructed the happier of these maiden approach the other when curiosity be so far appease as to have leave the family of balthazar nearly alone in the center of the square be there no friendly roof near to which thou canst withdraw ask the heiress of willading of the mother of the pallid and scarcely conscious christine thou wouldst do better to seek some shelter and privacy for thy unoffending and much injured child if any that belong to I can be of service i pray that thou wilt command as freely as if they be follower of thine own marguerite have never before speak with a female of a rank superior to the ordinary class the ample means of both she father 's and she husband 's family have furnish all that be necessary to the improvement of the mind of one in she station and perhaps she have be the gainer in mere deportment by have be greatly exclude by they prejudice from association with female of she own condition as be often see among those who have the thought without the conventional usage of a better caste in life she be slightly tincture with a exhibition of what might be term a exaggerated manner while at the same time it be perfectly free from vulgarity or coarseness the gentle accent of adelheid fall on she ear soothingly and she gaze long and earnestly at the beautiful speaker without a reply who and what art thou that canst think a headman 's child may receive a insult that be unmerited and who offerest the service of thy menial as if the very vassal would not refuse he master 's bidding in we behalf i be adelheid de willade the daughter of the baron of that name and one much disposed to temper this cruel blow to the feeling of poor christine suffer that my people seek the means to convey thy child to some other place marguerite fold she daughter still closer to she bosom pass a hand across she brow as if to recall some half-obscured idea i have hear of thee lady -- ` tis say that thou art kind to the wrong and of excellent disposition towards the unhappy -- that thy father 's castle be a honor and hospitable abode which those who enter rarely love to quit but hast thou well weigh the consequence of this liberality towards a race that be and have be proscribe of man from generation to generation -- from he who first lend himself to he bloody office with a cruel heart and a greedy desire for gold to he whose courage be scarcely equal to the disgusting duty hast thou bethought thee of this or hast thou yield heedlessly to a sudden and youthful impulse of all this have i think say adelheid eagerly whatever may be the injustice of other thou hast none to fear from I marguerite yield the form of she child to the support of she father 's arm and draw nearer with a gaze of earnest and pleased interest to the blush but still compose adelheid she take the hand of the latter and with a look of recognition and intelligence say slowly as if commune with herself rather than speak to another -- this be get to be intelligible she murmur there be still gratitude and creditable feeling in the world i can understand why we be not revolt to this fair being : she have a sense of justice that be stronger than she prejudice we have do she service and she be not ashamed of the source whence it have come the heart of adelheid throb quick and violently and for a moment she doubt she ability to command she feeling but the please conviction that sigismund have be honorable and delicate even in he most sacred and confidential communication with he own mother come to relieve she and to make she momentarily happy since nothing be so painful to the pure mind as to think those they love have act unworthily or nothing so grateful as the assurance that they merit the esteem we have be induce liberally and confidingly to bestow you do I no more than justice return the pleased listener of this flattering and seemingly involuntary opinion -- we be indeed -- indeed we be truly grateful but have we not reason for the sacred obligation of gratitude i think we could still be just will you not now consent that my people should aid you this be not necessary lady send away thy follower for they presence will draw unpleasant observation on we movement the town be now occupy with feast and as we have not blindly overlook the necessity of a retreat for the hunt and persecute we will take the opportunity to withdraw unseen as for thyself -- i would be near this innocent at a moment so try -- add adelheid earnestly and with that visible sympathy which rarely fail to meet a echo heaven bless thee heaven bless thee sweet girl and heaven will bless thee for few wrong go unrequited in this life and little good without its reward send thy follower away or if thy habit require they watchfulness let they be near unseen whilst thou wateriest we movement and when the eye of all be turn on they own pleasure thou canst follow heaven bless thee -- ay and heaven will marguerite then lead she daughter towards one of the least frequented street she be accompany by the silent balthazar and closely watch by one of the menial of adelheid when fairly house the domestic return to show the spot to he mistress who have appear to occupy herself with the hundred silly device that be invent to amuse the multitude dismiss she attendant with a order to remain at hand however the heiress of willading soon find means to enter the humble abode in which the proscribed family have take refuge and as she be expect she be soon introduce into the chamber where christine and she mother have take refuge the sympathy of the young and tender adelheid be precious to one of the character of christine they weep together for the weakness of she sex prevail over the pride of the former when she find herself unrestrained by the observation of the world and she give way to the torrent of feeling that break through its bound in spite of she endeavor to control it marguerite be the only spectator of this silent but intelligible communion between these two young and pure spirit and she soul be shake by the unlooked-for commiseration of one so honor and who be usually esteem so happy thou hast the consciousness of we wrong she say when the first burst of emotion have a little subside thou canst then believe that a headsman 's child be like the offspring of another and be not to be hunt of man like the young of a wolf mother this be the baron de willading 's heiress say christine : would she come here do she not pity we yes she can pity we -- and yet i find it hard even to be pity sigismund have tell we of she goodness and she may in truth feel for the wretched the allusion to she son cause the temple of adelheid to burn like fire while there be a chill resemble that of death at she heart the first arise from the quick and uncontrollable alarm of female sensitiveness the last be owe to the shock inseparable from be present with this vivid palpable picture of sigismund 's close affinity with the family of a executioner she could have better bear it have marguerite speak of she son less familiarly or with more of that feigned ignorance of each other which without stop to scan its fitness she have be lead to think exist between the young man and he family mother exclaim christine reproachfully and in surprise as if a great indiscretion have be thoughtlessly commit it matter not child it matter not i saw by the kindling eye of sigismund to-day that we secret will not much longer be keep the noble boy must show more energy than those who have go before he he must quit for ever a country in which he be condemn even before he be bear i shall not deny that you connexion with monsieur sigismund be know to I say adelheid summon all she resolution to make a avowal which put she at once into the confidence of balthazar 's family you be acquaint with the heavy debt of gratitude we owe you son and it will explain the nature of the interest i now feel in you wrong the keen eye of marguerite study the crimsoned feature of adelheid till forgetfulness get the better of discretion the search be anxious rather than triumphant the feeling most dread by its subject and when she eye be withdraw the mother of the youth become thoughtful and pensive this expressive communion produce a deep and embarrassing silence which each would gladly have break have they not both be irresistibly tongue-tied by the rapidity and intensity of they thought we know that sigismund have be of service to thee observe marguerite who always address she gay companion with the familiarity that belong to she greater age rather than with the respect which adelheid have be accustom to receive from those who be of a rank inferior to she own the brave boy have speak of it though he have speak of it modestly he have every right to do himself justice in he communication with those of he own family without he aid my father would have be childless and without he brave support the child fatherless twice have he stand between we and death i have hear of this return marguerite again fasten she penetrate eye on the tell-tale feature of adelheid which never fail to brighten and glow whenever there be allusion to the courage and self-devotion of he she secretly love as to what thou say ` st of the intimacy of we poor boy with those of he blood cruel circumstance stand between we and we wish if sigismund have tell thee of whom he come he have also most probably tell thee of the manner in which he pass in the world for that which he be not i believe he have not withhold any thing that he know and which it be proper to communicate to I answer adelheid drop she eye before the attentive expectant look of marguerite he have speak freely and -- thou wouldst have say -- honorably and as become a soldier continue adelheid firmly he have do well this lighten my heart of one burthen at least no god have destine we to this fate and it would have grieve I that a son of mine should have fail of principle in a affair of all other in which it be most wanted you look amaze lady these sentiment in one so situated surprise as much as they delight I if any thing could excuse some looseness in the manner of regard the usual tie of life it would surely be to find oneself so place by no misconduct of we own as to be a but to the world 's dislike and injustice and yet here where there be reason to expect some resentment against fortune i meet with sentiment that would honor a throne thou thinkest as one more accustomed to consider thy fellow-creature through the means of what man fancy than through thing as they be this be the picture of youth and inexperience and innocence but it be not the picture of life ` tis misfortune and not prosperity that chasteneth by prove we insufficiency for true happiness and by lead the soul to depend on a power greater than any that be to be find on earth we fall before the temptation of happiness when we rise in adversity if thou thinkest innocent one that noble and just sentiment belong to the fortunate thou trustest to a false guide there be evil which flesh can not endure it be true but remove from these overwhelming want we be strongest in the right when least tempt by vanity and ambition more starving beggar abstain from steal the crust they crave than pampered glutton deny themselves the luxury that kill they they that live under the rod see and dread the hand that hold it they who riot in earth 's glory come at last to think they deserve the short-lived distinction they enjoy when thou goest down into the depths of misery thou hast naught to fear except the anger of god it be when raise above other that thou shouldst tremble most for thine own safety this be not the manner in which the world be use to reason because the world be govern by those whose interest it be to pervert truth to they own object and not by those whose duty run hand-in-hand with the right but we will say no more of this lady here be one that feel too acutely just now to admit truth to be too freely speak dost feel thyself better and more able to listen to thy friend dear christine ask adelheid take the hand of the repudiate and desert girl with the tenderness of a affectionate sister until now the sufferer have only speak the few word relate in mild reproof of she mother 's indiscretion that little have be utter with parched lip and a choke voice while the hue of she feature be deadly pale and she whole countenance betray intense mental anguish but this display of interest in one of she own year and sex of whose excellency she have be accustom to hear such fervid description from the warm-hearted sigismund and of whose sincerity she be assure by the subtle and quick instinct that unite the innocent and young cause a quick and extreme change in she sensibility the grief which have be struggle and condensed now flow more freely from she eye and she throw herself sob and weep in a paroxysm of gentle but overwhelming feeling on the bosom of this new find friend the experienced marguerite smile at this manifestation of kindness on the part of adelheid though even this expression of satisfaction be austere and regulate in one who have so long stand at bay with the world and after a short pause she leave the room under the belief that such a communion with a spirit pure and inexperienced as she own a communion so unusual to she daughter would be more likely to produce a happy effect if leave to themselves than when restrain by she presence the two girl weep in common for a long time after marguerite have disappear this intercourse chasten as it be by sorrow and render endearing on the one side by a confide ingenuousness and on the other by generous pity cause both to live in that short period as it be month together in a near and dear intimacy confidence be not always the growth of time there be mind that meet each other with a species of affinity that resemble the cohesive property of matter and with a promptitude and faith that only belong to the purer essence of which they be compose but when this attraction of the ethereal part of the be be aid by the feeling that have be warm by a interest so tender as that which the heart of both the maiden feel in a common object its power be not only stronger but quicker in make itself feel so much be already know by each of the other 's character fortune and hope -lrb- always with the exception of adelheid 's most sacred secret which sigismund cherish as a deposit by far too sacred to be share even with he sister -rrb- that the meeting under no circumstance could have be that of stranger and they mutual knowledge come as a assistant to break down the barrier of those form which be so irksome to they longing for a freer interchange of feeling and think adelheid possess too much intellectual tact to have recourse to the every-day language of consolation when she do speak which as become she superior rank and less embarrassed situation she be the first to do it in general but friendly allusion thou wilt go with we to italy in the morning she say dry she eye my father quit blonay in company with the signor grimaldus with to-morrow 's sun and thou wilt be of we company where thou wilt -- anywhere with thee -- anywhere to hide my shame the blood mount to the temple of adelheid she air even appear impose to the eye of the artless and unpractised christine as she answer -- shame be a word that apply to the mean and mercenary to the vile and unfaithful she say with womanly and virtuous indignation but not to thee love o do not do not condemn he whisper christine cover she face with she hand he have find himself unequal to bear the burthen of we degradation and he should be speak of in pity rather than with hatred adelheid be silent but she regard the poor tremble girl whose head now nestle in she bosom with melancholy concern didst thou know he well she ask in a low tone follow rather the chain of she own thought than reflect on the nature of the question she put i have hope that this refusal would bring no other pain than the unavoidable mortification which i fear belong to the weakness of we sex and we habit thou knowest not how dear preference be to the despise -- how cherish the thought of be love become to those who out of they own narrow limit of natural friend have be accustom to meet only with contempt and aversion thou hast always be know and court and happy thou canst not know how dear it be to the despise to seem even to be prefer nay say not this i pray thee answer adelheid hurriedly and with a throb of anguish at she heart there be little in this life that speak fairly for itself we be not always what we seem and if we be and far more miserable than anything but vice can make we there be another state of be in which justice -- pure unalloyed justice -- will be do i will go with thee to italy answer christine look calm and resolve while a glow of holy hope bloom on each cheek when all be over we will go together to a happier world adelheid fold the stricken and sensitive plant to she bosom again they weep together but it be with a milder and sweeter sorrow than before chapter xx i 'll show thee the best spring i 'll pluck thee berry _ tempest _ the day dawn clear and cloudless on the leman the morning that succeed the abbaye des vignerons hundred among the frugal and time-saving swiss have leave the town before the appearance of the light and many stranger be crowd into the bark as the sun come bright and cheerfully over the round and smile summit of the neighbor côtes at this early hour all in and around the rock-seated castle of blonay be astir and in motion menial be run with hurry air from room to room from court to terrace and from lawn to tower the peasant in the adjoining field rest on they utensil of husbandry in gaping admiring attention to the preparation of they superior for though we be not write of a strictly feudal age the event it be we business to record take place long before the occurrence of those great political event which have since so materially change the social state of europe switzerland be then a sealed country to most of those who dwell even in the adjoining nation and the present advanced condition of road and inn be quite unknown not only to these mountaineer but throughout the rest of what be then much more properly call the exclusively civilized portion of the globe than it be to-day even horse be not often use in the passage of the alp but recourse be have to the surer-footed mule by the traveller and not unfrequently by the more practiced carrier and smuggler of those rude path road exist it be true as in other part of europe in the country of the plain if any portion of the great undulating surface of that region deserve the name but once within the mountain with the exception of very inartificial wheel-track in the straitened and glen-like valley the hoof alone be to be trust or indeed use the long train of traveller then that leave the gate of blonay just as the fog begin to stir on the wide alluvial meadow of the rhone be all in the saddle a courier accompany by a sumpter-mule have depart over-night to prepare the way for those who be to follow and active young mountaineer have succeed from time to time charge with different order issue in behalf of they comfort as the cavalcade pass beneath the arch of the great gate the lively spirit-stirring horn sound a fare well air to which custom have attach the signification of good wish it take the way towards the level of the leman by means of a wind and picturesque bridle-path that lead among alpine meadow grove rock and hamlet fairly to the water-side roger de blonay and he two principal guest ride in front the former seat on a war-horse that he have ride year before as a soldier and the two latter well mount on beast prepare for and accustom to the mountain adelheid and christine come next ride by themselves in the modest reserve of they maiden condition they discourse be low confidential and renew at interval a few menial follow and then come sigismund at the side of the signor grimald 's friend and one of the family of blonay the latter of whom be destine to return with the baron after do honor to they guest by see they as far as villeneuve the rear be bring up by muleteer domestic and those who lead the beast that bear the baggage all of the former who intend to cross the alp carry the fire-arm of the period at they saddle-bow and each have he rapier he _ couteau de chasse _ or he weapon of more military fashion so disposed about he person as to denote it be consider a arm for whose use some occasion might possibly occur as the departure from blonay be unaccompanied by any of those leave-takings which usually impress a touch of melancholy on the traveller most of the cavalcade as they issue into the pure and exhilarating air of the morning be sufficiently disposed to enjoy the loveliness of the landscape and to indulge in the cheerfulness and delight that a scene so glorious be apt to awaken in all who be alive to the beauty of nature adelheid gladly point out to she companion the various object of the view as a means of recall the thought of christine from she own particular grief which be heighten by regret for the loss of she mother from whom she be now seriously separated for the first time in she life since they communication though secret have be constant during the year she have dwell under another roof the latter gratefully lend herself to the kind intention of she new friend and endeavor to be please with all she behold though it be such pleasure as the sad and mourning admit with a jealous reservation of they own secret cause of woe yonder tower towards which we advance be châtelard say the heiress of willade to the daughter of balthazar in the pursuit of she kind intention a hold nearly as ancient and honorable as this we have just quit though not so constantly the dwelling of the same family for these of blonay have be a thousand year dweller on the same rock always favorably know for they faith and courage surely if there be anything in life that can compensate for its every-day evil observe christine in a manner of mild regret and perhaps with the perversity of grief it must be to have come from those who have always be know and honor among the great and happy even virtue and goodness and great deed scarce give a respect like that we feel for the sire de blonay whose family have be seat as thou hast just say a thousand year on that rock above we adelheid be mute she appreciate the feeling which have so naturally lead she companion to a reflection like this and she feel the difficulty of apply balm to a wound as deep as that which have be inflict on she companion we be not always to suppose those the most happy that the world most honor she at length answer the respect to which we be accustomed come in time to be necessary without be a source of pleasure and the hazard of incur its loss be more than equal to the satisfaction of its possession thou wilt at least admit that to be despise and shun be a curse to which nothing can reconcile we we will speak now of other thing dear it may be long ere either of we again see this grand display of rock and water of brown mountain and shine glacier we will not prove ourselves ungrateful for the happiness we have by repine for that which be impossible christine quietly yield to the kind intention of she new friend and they ride on in silence pick they way along the wind path until the whole party after a long but pleasant descent reach the road which be nearly wash by the water of the lake there have already be allusion in the earlier page of we work to the extraordinary beauty of the route near this extremity of the leman after climb to the heigh of the mild and healthful montreux the cavalcade again descend under a canopy of nut-tree to the gate of chillon and sweep around the margin of the sheet it reach villeneuve by the hour that have be name for a early morning repast here all dismount and refresh themselves awhile when roger de blonay and he attendant after many exchange of warm and sincere good wish take they final leave the sun be scarcely yet visible in the deep glen when those who be destine for st bernard be again in the saddle the road now necessarily leave the lake traverse those broad alluvial bottom which have be deposit during thirty century by the washing of the rhone aid if faith be to be give to geological symptom and to ancient tradition by certain violent convulsion of nature for several hour we traveller ride amid such a deep fertility and such a luxuriance of vegetation that they path bear more analogy to a excursion on the wide plain of lombardy than to one amid the usual swiss scenery although unlike the boundless expanse of the italian garden the view be limit on each side by perpendicular barrier of rock that be pile for thousand of foot into the heaven and which be merely separate from each other by a league or two a distance that dwindle to mile in its effect on the eye a consequence of the grandeur of the scale on which nature have rear these vast pile it be high-noon when melchior de willading and he venerable friend lead the way across the foam rhone at the celebrated bridge of st maurice here the country of the valai then like geneva a ally and not a confederate of the swiss canton be enter and all object both animate and inanimate begin to assume that mixture of the grand the sterile the luxuriant and the revolt for which this region be so generally know adelheid give a involuntary shudder she imagination have be prepare by rumor for even more than the truth would have give reason to expect when the gate of st maurice swing back upon its hinge literally inclose the party in this wild desolate and yet romantic region as they proceed along the rhone however she and those of she companion to whom the scene be new be constantly wonder at some unlooked-for discrepancy that drive they from admiration to disgust -- from the exclamation of delight to the chill of disappointment the mountain on every side be dreary and without the rich relief of the pastured eminence but most of the valley be rich and generous in one spot a sac d'eau one of those reservoir of water which form among the glacier on the summit of the rock have break and descend like a water-spout it have sweep before it every vestige of cultivation cover wide breadth of the meadow with a débris that resemble chaos a frightful barrenness and the most smile fertility be in absolute contact : patch of green that have be accidentally favor by some lucky formation of the ground sometimes appear like oasis of the desert in the very center of a sterility that would put the labor and the art of man at defiance for a century in the midst of this terrific picture of want sit a crétin with he semi-human attribute the lolling tongue the blunt faculty and the degraded appetite to complete the desolation issue from this belt of annihilated vegetation the scene become again as pleasant as the fancy could desire or the eye crave fountain leap from rock to rock in the sun 's ray the valley be green and gentle the mountain begin to show varied and please form and happy smile face appear whose freshness and regularity be perhaps of a cast superior to that of most of the swiss in short the valai be then as now a country of opposite extreme but in which perhaps there be a predominance of the repulsive and inhospitable it be fairly nightfall notwithstanding the trifling distance they have journey when the traveller reach martigny where disposition have previously be make for they reception during the hour of sleep here preparation be make to seek they rest at a early hour in order to be in readiness for the fatiguing toil of the follow day martigny be situate at the point where the great valley of the rhone change its direction from a north and south to a east and west course and it be the spot whence three of the celebrated mountain path diverge to make as many passage of the upper alp here be the two route of the great and little st bernard both of which lead into italy and that of the col-de-balme which cross a spur of the alp into savoy toward the celebrated valley of chamounus it be the intention of the baron de willading and he friend to journey by the former of these road as have so often be mention in these page they destination be the capital of piedmont the passage of the great st bernard though so long know by its ancient and hospitable convent the most elevated habitation in europe and in these later time so famous for the passage of a conquer army be but a secondary alpine pass consider in reference to the grandeur of its scenery the ascent so inartificial even to this hour be loner and comparatively without danger and in general it be sufficiently direct there be no very precipitous rise like those of the gemmus the grimsel and various other pass in switzerland and italy except at the very neck or col of the mountain where the rock be to be literally climb on the rude and broad step that so frequently occur among the path of the alp and the apennine the fatigue of this passage come therefore rather from its length and the necessity of unremitted diligence than from any excessive labor demand by the ascent and the reputation acquire by the great captain of we age in lead a army across its summit have be obtain more by the military combination of which it form the principal feature the boldness of the conception and the secrecy and promptitude with which so extensive a operation be effect than by the physical difficulty that be overcome in the latter particular the passage of st bernard as this celebrated coup-de-main be usually call have frequently be outdo in we own wild for army have often traverse region of broad stream break mountain and uninterrupted forest for week at a time in which the mere bodily labor of any give number of day would be find to be greater than that endure on this occasion by the follower of napoleon the estimate we attach to every exploit be so dependent on the magnitude of its result that man rarely come to a perfectly impartial judgment on its merit the victory or defeat however simple or bloodless that shall shake or assure the interest of civilized society be always esteem by the world a event of greater importance than the happiest combination of thought and valor that affect only the welfare of some remote and unknown people by the just consideration of this truth we come to understand the value of a nation 's possess confidence in itself extensive power and a unity commensurate to its means since small and divided state waste they strength in act too insignificant for general interest fritter away they mental riches no less than they treasure and blood in support interest that fail to enlist the sympathy of any beyond the pale of they own border the nation which by the adverse circumstance of numerical inferiority poverty of means failure of enterprise or want of opinion can not sustain its own citizen in the acquisition of a just renown be deficient in one of the first and most indispensable element of greatness glory like riches feed itself and be most apt to be find where its fruit have already accumulate we see in this fact among other conclusion the importance of a acquisition of such habit of manliness of think as will enable we to decide on the merit and demerit of what be do among ourselves and of shake off that dependence on other which it be too much the custom of some among we to dignify with the pretend title of deference to knowledge and taste but which in truth possess some such share of true modesty and diffidence as the footman be apt to exhibit when exult in the renown of he master this little digression have induce we momentarily to overlook the incident of the tale few who possess the means venture into the stormy region of the upper alp at the late season in which the present party reach the hamlet of martigny without seek the care of one or more suitable guide the service of these man be useful in a variety of way but in none more than in offer the advice which long familiarity with the sign of the heaven the temperature of the air and the direction of the wind enable they to give the baron de willading and he friend immediately dispatch a messenger for a mountaineer of the name of pierre dumont who enjoy a fair name for fidelity and who be believe to be better acquaint with all the difficulty of the ascent and descent than any other who journey among the glen of that part of the alp at the present day when hundred ascend to the convent from curiosity alone every peasant of sufficient strength and intelligence become a guide and the little community of the lower valai find the transit of the idle and rich such a fruitful source of revenue that it have be induce to regulate the whole by very useful and just ordinance but at the period of the tale this pierre be the only individual who by fortunate concurrence have obtain a name among affluent foreigner and who be at all in demand with that class of traveller he be not long in present himself in the public room of the inn -- a hale florid muscular man of sixty with every appearance of permanent health and vigor but with a slight and nearly imperceptible difficulty of breathing thou art pierre dumont observe the baron study the open physiognomy and well-set frame of the valaisan with satisfaction thou hast be mention by more than one traveller in he book the stout mountaineer raise himself in pride and endeavor to acknowledge the compliment in the manner of he well-meant but rude courtesy for refinement do not then extend its finesse and its deceit among the glen of switzerland they have do I honor monsieur he say : it have be my good fortune to cross the col with many brave gentleman and fair lady -- and in two instance with prince -lrb- though a sturdy republican pierre be not insensible to worldly rank -rrb- the pious monk know I well and they who enter the convent be not the worse receive for be my companion i shall be glad to lead so fair a party from we cold valley into the sunny glen of italy for if the truth must be speak nature have place we on the wrong side of the mountain for we comfort though we have we advantage over those who live even in turin and milan in matter of greater importance what can be the superiority of a valaisan over the lombard or the piedmontese demand the signor grimaldus quickly like a man who be curious to hear the reply a traveller should seek all kind of knowledge and i take this to be a newly-discovered fact liberty signora we be we own master we have be so since the day when we father sack the castle of the baron and compel they tyrant to become they equal i think of this each time i reach the warm plain of italy and return to my cottage a more contented man for the reflection speak like a swiss though it be utter by a ally of the canton cry melchior de willade heartily this be the spirit gaetano which sustain we mountaineer and render they more happy amid they frost and rock than thy genoese on he warm and glowing bay the word liberty melchior be more use than understand and as much abused as use return the signor grimaldus gravely a country on which god have lay he finger in displeasure as on this need have some such consolation as the phantom with which the honest pierre appear to be so well satisfied -- but signor guide have many traveller try the passage of late and what dost thou think of we prospects in make the attempt we hear gloomy tale sometimes of thy alpine path in that italy thou hold ` st so cheap you pardon noble signora if the frankness of a mountaineer have carry I too far i do not undervalue you piedmont because i love we valai more a country may be excellent even though another should be better as for the traveller none of note have go up the col of late though there have be the usual number of vagabond and adventurer the savor of the convent kitchen will reach the nose of these knave here in the valley though we have a long twelve league to journey in get from one to the other the signor grimaldus wait until adelheid and christine who be prepare to retire for the night be out of hearing and he resume he question thou hast not speak of the weather we be in one of the most uncertain and treacherous month of the good season messieur the winter be gather among the upper alp and in a month in which the frost be fly about like uneasy bird that do not know where to alight one can hardly say whether he have need of he cloak or not san francesco dost think i be dally with thee friend about a thickness more or less of cloth i be hint at avalanche and fall rock -- at whirlwind and tempest pierre laugh and shake he head though he answer vaguely as become he business these be italian opinion of we hill signore he say they savor of the imagination we pass be not as often trouble with the avalanche as some that be know even in the melting snow have you look at the peak from the lake you would have see that the hoary glacier except they be still all brown and naked the snow must fall from the heaven before it can fall in the avalanche and we be yet i think a few day from the true winter thy calculation be make with nicety friend return the genoese not sorry however to hear the guide speak with so much apparent confidence of the weather and we be oblige to thee in proportion what of the traveller thou hast name be there brigand on we path such rogue have be know to infest the place but in general there be too little to be gain for the risk you rich traveller be not a every-day sight among we rock and you well know signora that there may be too few as well as too many on a path for you freebooter the italian be distrustful by habit on all such subject and he throw a quick suspicious glance at the guide but the frank open countenance of pierre remove all doubt of he honesty to say nothing of the effect of a well-established reputation but thou hast speak of certain vagabond who have precede we in that particular matter might be better answer the plain-minded mountaineer drop he head in a attitude of meditation so naturally express as to give additional weight to he word many of bad appearance have certainly go up to-day such as a neapolitan name pippo who be anything but a saint -- a certain pilgrim who will be nearer heaven at the convent than he will be at the death -- st pierre pray for I if i do the man injustice -- and one or two more of the same brood there be another that have go up also post haste and with good reason as they say for he have make himself the but of all the joker in vévey on account of some foolery in the game of the abbaye -- a certain jacque coli the name be repeat by several near the speaker the same monsieur it would seem that the sieur coli would fain take a maiden to wife in the public sport and when she birth come to be be know that he bride be no other than the child of balthazar the common headsman of berne a general silence betray the embarrassment of most of the listener and that tale have already reach this glen say sigismund in a tone so deep and firm as to cause pierre to start while the two old noble look in another direction feign not to observe what be pass rumor have a nimbler foot than a mule young officer answer the honest guide the tale as you call it will have travel across the mountain sooner than they who bear it -- though i never know how such a miracle could pass -- but so it be report go faster than the tongue that spread it and if there be a little untruth to help it along the wind itself be scarcely swifter honest jacque coli have bethought he to get the start of he story but my life on it though he be active enough in get away from he mocker that he find it with all the addition safely house at the inn at turin when he reach that city himself these then be all interrupt the signor grimaldus who see by the heave bosom of sigismund that it be time in mercy to interpose not so signore -- there be still another and one i like less than any a countryman of you own who impudently enough call himself il maledetto maso the very same honest courageous maso and he noble dog signora you describe the man so well in some thing that i wonder you know so little of he in other maso have not he equal on the road for activity and courage and the beast be second only to we mastiff of the convent for the same quality but when you speak of the master 's honesty you speak of that for which the world give he little credit and do great disparagement to the brute which be much the best of the two in this respect this may be true enough rejoin the signora grimaldus turn anxiously towards he companion : -- man be a strange compound of good and evil he act when leave to natural impulse be so different from what they become on calculation that one can scarcely answer for a man of maso 's temperament we know he to be a most efficient friend and such a man would be apt to make a very dangerous enemy he quality be not give to he by half and yet we have a strong circumstance in we favor for he who have once do the least service to a fellow-creature feel a sort of paternity in he he have save and would be little likely to rob himself of the pleasure of know that there be some of he kind who owe he a grateful recollection this remark be answer by melchior de willading in the same spirit and the guide perceive he be no longer want withdraw soon after the traveller retire to rest chapter xxi as yet the tremble year be unconfirmed and winter oft at eve resume the breeze chill the pale morn and bid he drive sleet deform the day delightful : -- thomson the horn of pierre dumont be blow beneath the window of the inn of martigny with the peep of dawn then follow the appearance of drowsy domestic the saddling of unwilling mule and the loading of baggage a few minute later the little caravan be assemble for the cavalcade almost deserve this name and the whole be in motion for the summit of the alp the traveller now leave the valley of the rhone to bury themselves amid those pile of misty and confused mountain which form the back-ground of the picture they have study from the castle of blonay and the sheet of the leman they soon plunge into a glen and follow the winding of a brawl torrent be lead gradually and by many turning into a country of bleak upland pasturage where the inhabitant gain a scanty livelihood principally by means of they dairy a few league above martigny the path again separate one incline to the left towards the elevated valley that have since become so celebrated in the legend of this wild region by the formation of a little lake in its glacier which become too heavy for its foundation break through its barrier of ice and descend in a mountain of water to the rhone a distance of many league sweep before it every vestige of civilization that cross its course and even change in many place the face of nature itself here the glittering peak of vélan become visible and though so much nearer to the eye than when view from vévey it be still a distant shine pile grand in its solitude and mystery on which the sight love to dwell as it study the pure and spotless edge of some sleepy cloud it have already be say that the ascent of the great st bernard with the exception of occasional hill and hollow be nowhere very precipitous but at the point at which the last rampart of rock be to be overcome on the contrary the path for league at a time pass along tolerably even valley though of necessity the general direction be upward and for most of the distance through a country that admit of cultivation though the meagreness of the soil and the shortness of the season render but a indifferent return to the toil of the husbandman in this respect it differ from most of the other alpine pass but if it want the variety wildness and sublimity of the splugen the st gothard the gemmus and the simplon it be still a ascent on a magnificent scale and he who journey on its path be raise as it be by insensible degree to a elevation that gradually change all he customary association with the thing of the lower world from the moment of quit the inn to that of the first halt melchior de willading and the signor grimaldus ride in company as on the previous day these old friend have much to communicate in confidential discourse which the presence of roger de blonay and the importunity of the bailiff have hitherto prevent they from freely say both have think maturely too on the situation of adelheid of she hope and of she future fortune and both have reason much as two old noble of that day who be not without strong sympathy for they kind while they be too practice to overlook the world and its tie would be likely to reason on a affair of this delicate nature there come a feeling of regret perhaps i might fairly call it by its proper name of envy observe the genoese in the pursuance of the subject which engross most of they time and thought as they ride slowly along the bridle dangle from the neck of they mule -- there come a feeling of regret when i first see the fair creature that call thee father melchior god have deal mercifully by I in respect to many thing that make man happy but he render my marriage accurse not only in its bud but in its fruit thy child be dutiful and loving all that a father can wish and yet here be this unusual attachment come to embarrass if not to defeat thy fair and just hope for she welfare this be no common affair that a few threat of bolt and a change of scene will cure but a rooted affection that be but too firmly base on esteem -- by san francesco but i think at time thou wouldst do well to permit the ceremony should it be we fortune to meet with the abscond jacque coli at turin he might give we different counsel answer the old baron drily that be a dreadful barrier to we wish be the boy anything but a headsman 's child i do not think thou couldst object melchior have he merely come of a hind or of some common follower of thy family it be far better that he should have come of one like ourselves gaetano i reason but little on the dogma of this or that sect in politics but i feel and think in this affair as the parent of a only child all those usage and opinion in which we be train my friend be so many ingredient in we happiness let they be silly or wise just or oppressive and though i would fain do that which be right to the rest of mankind i could wish to begin to practice innovation with any other than my own daughter let they who like philosophy and justice and natural rights so well commence by set we the example thou hast hit the stumbling-block that cause a thousand well-digested plan for the improvement of the world to fail honest melchior could we toil with other ' limb sacrifice with other ' groan and pay with other ' means there would be no end to we industry we disinterestedness or we liberality -- and yet it be a thousand pity that so sweet a girl and so noble a youth should not yoke ` twould be a yoke indeed for a daughter of the house of willade return the graver father with emphasis i have look at this matter in every face that become I gaetano and though i would not rudely repulse one that have save my life by drive he from my company at a moment when even stranger consort for mutual aid and protection at turin we must part for ever i know not how to approve nor yet how to blame thee poor melchior 'twa a sad scene that of the refusal to wed balthazar 's daughter in the presence of so many thousand i take it as a happy and kind warning of the precipice to which a foolish tenderness be lead we both my friend thou may ` st have reason and yet i wish thou wert more in error than ever christian be these be rugged mountain melchior and fairly pass it might be so arrange that the boy should forget switzerland for ever he might become a genoese in which event dost thou not see the means of overcome some of the present difficulty be the heiress of my house a vagrant signor grimaldus to forget she country and birth i be childless in effect if not in fact and where there be the will and the mean the end should not be want we will speak of this under the warmer sun of italy which they say be apt to render heart tender the heart of the young and amorous good gaetano but unless much change of late it be as apt to harden those of the old as any sun i know of return the baron shake he head though it much exceed he power to smile at he own pleasantry when speak on this painful subject thou knowest that in this matter i act only for the welfare of adelheid without thought of myself and it would little comport with the honor of a baron of a ancient house to be the grandfather of child who come of a race of executioner the signor grimaldus succeed better than he friend in raise a smile for more accustomed to dive into the depths of human feeling he be not slow in detect the mixture of motive that be silently exercise they long-established influence over the heart of he really well-intentioned companion so long as thou speakest of the wisdom of respect man 's opinion and the danger of wreck thy daughter 's happiness by run counter to they current i agree with thee to the letter but to I it seem possible so to place the affair that the world shall imagine all be in rule and by consequence all proper if we can overcome ourselves melchior i apprehend no great difficulty in blind other the head of the bernoi drop upon he breast and he ride a long distance in that attitude reflect on the course it most become he to pursue and struggle with the conflict sentiment which trouble he upright but prejudiced mind as he friend understand the nature of this inward strife he cease to speak and a long silence succeed the discourse it be different with those who follow though long accustom to gaze at they native mountain from a distance this be the first occasion on which adelheid and she companion have ever actually penetrate into they glen or journey on they broken and change face the path of st bernard therefore have all the charm of novelty and they youthful and ardent mind be soon win from meditate on they own cause of unhappiness to admiration of the sublime work of nature the cultivate taste of adelheid in particular be quick in detect those beauty of a more subtle kind which the less instruct be apt to overlook and she find additional pleasure in point they out to the ingenuous and wonder christine who receive these she first lesson in that grand communion with nature which be pregnant with so much unalloyed delight with gratitude and a readiness of comprehension that amply repay she instructress sigismund be a attentive and pleased listener to what be pass though one who have so often pass the mountain and who have see they familiarly on they warmer and more sunny side have little to learn himself even from so skilful and alluring a teacher as they ascend the air become purer and less impregnate with the humidity of its lower current change by a process as fine as that work by a chemical application the hue and aspect of every object in the view a vast hill-side lay basking in the sun which illuminate on its round swell a hundred long stripe of grain in every stage of verdure resemble so much delicate velvet that be throw in a variety of accidental face to the light while the shadow run away to speak technically from this _ foyer de lumière _ of the picture in gradation of dusky russet and brown until the _ colonne de vigueur _ be obtain in the deep black cast from the overhang branch of a wood of larch in the depths of some ravine into which the sight with difficulty penetrate these be the beauty on which adelheid most love to dwell for they be always the charm that soonest strike the true admirer of nature when he find himself raise above the lower and less purify stratum of the atmosphere into the region of more radiant light and brightness it be thus that the physical no less than the moral vision become elevated above the impurity that cling to this nether world attain a portion of that spotless and sublime perception as we ascend by which we be nearly assimilate to the truth of creation a poetical type of the greater and purer enjoyment we feel as morally recede from earth we draw nearer to heaven the party rest for several hour as usual at the little mountain hamlet of lidde at the present time it be not uncommon for the traveller favor by a wheel-track along this portion of the route to ascend the mountain and to return to martigny in the same day the descent in particular after reach the village just name be soon make but at the period of we tale such a exploit if ever make be of very rare occurrence the fatigue of be in the saddle so many hour compel we party to remain at the inn much longer than be now practice and they utmost hope be to be able to reach the convent before the last ray of the sun have cease to light the glittering peak of vélan there occur here too some unexpected detention on the part of christine who have retire with sigismund soon after reach the inn and who do not rejoin the party until the impatience of the guide have more than once manifest itself in such complaint as one in he situation be apt to hazard adelheid see with pain when she friend do at length rejoin they that she have be weep bitterly but too delicate to press she for a explanation on a subject in which it be evident the brother and sister do not desire to bestow they confidence she communicate she readiness to depart to the domestic without the slightest allusion to the change in christine 's appearance or to the unexpected delay of which she have be the cause pierre mutter a ave in thankfulness that the long halt be end he then cross himself with one hand while with the other he flourish he whip among a crowd of gaping urchin and slaver crétins to clear the way for those he guide he follower be in the main of a different mood if the traveller too often reach the inn hungry and disposed to find fault he usually quit it good-humored and happy the restoration as it be well call in france effect by means of the larder and the rest of wearied limb be usually communicate to the spirit and it must be a crusty humor indeed or singularly bad fare that prevent a return to a placid state of mind the party under the direction of pierre form no exception to the general rule the two old noble have so far forget the subject of they morning dialogue as to be facetious and ere long even they gentle companion be dispose to laugh at some of they sally in spite of the load of care that weigh so constantly and so heavily on both in short such be the waywardness of we feeling and so difficult be it to be always sorrowful as well as always happy that the well-satisfied landlady who have in truth receive the full value of a very indifferent fare be ready to affirm as she curtsy she thanks on the dirty threshold that a merrier party have never leave she door we shall take we revenge out of the cask of the good augustine to-night for the sour liquor of this inn be it not so honest pierre demand the signor grimaldus adjust himself in the saddle as they get clear of the stone sinuosity project roof and filth of the village into the more agreeable winding of the ordinary path again we friend the clavier be apprize of the visit and as we have already go through fair and foul in company i look to he fellowship for some compensation for the frugal meal of which we have just partake father xavier be a hospitable and a happy-minded priest signora and that the saint will long leave he keeper of the convent-key be the prayer of every muleteer guide or pilgrim who cross the col i wish we be go up the rough step by which we be to climb the last rock of the mountain at this very moment monsieur and that all the rest of the way be as fairly do as this we have so happily pass dost thou anticipate difficulty friend demand the italian lean forward on he saddle-bow for he quick observation have catch the examine glance that the guide throw around at the heaven difficulty be a meaning not easily admit by a mountaineer signora and i be one of the last to think of it or to feel its dread still we be near the end of the season and these hill be high and bleak and those that follow be delicate flower for a stormy heath toil be always sweeter in the remembrance than in the expectation -- i mean no more if i mean that pierre stop he march as he cease speak he stand on a little eminence of the path whence by look back he command a view of the opening among the mountain which indicate the site of the valley of the rhone the look be long and understanding but when it be end he turn and resume he march with the business-like air of one more disposed to act than to speculate on the future but for the few word which have just escape he this natural movement would have attract no attention and as it be it be observe by none but the signor grimaldus who would himself have attach little importance to the whole have the guide maintain in usual pace as be common in the alp the conductor of the traveller go on foot lead the whole party at such a gait as he think most expedient for man and beast hitherto pierre have proceed with sufficient leisure render it necessary for those who follow to observe the same moderation but he now walk sensibly faster and frequently so fast as to make it necessary for the mule to break into easy trot in order to maintain they proper station all this however be ascribe by most of the party to the formation of the ground for after leave lidde there be a long reach of what among the upper valley of the alp may by comparison be call a level road this industry too be think to be doubly necessary in order to repair the time lose at the inn for the sun be already dip towards the western boundary of they narrow view of the heaven and the temperature announce if not a sudden change in the weather at least the near approach of the periodical turn of the day we travel by a very ancient path observe the signora grimaldus when he thought have revert from they reflection on the movement of the guide to the circumstance of they present situation a very reverend path it might be term in compliment to the worthy monk who do so much to lessen its danger and to its great antiquity history speak often of its use by different leader of army for it have long be a thoroughfare for those who journey between the north and the south whether it be in strife or in amity in the time of augustus it be the route commonly use by the roman legion in they passage to and from helvetium and gaul the follower of cæcinna go by these gorge to they attack upon otho and the lombard make the same use of it five hundred year later it be often tread by armed band in the war of charle of burgundy those of milan and in the conquest of charlemagne i remember a tale in which it be say that a horde of infidel corsair from the mediterranean penetrate by this road and seize upon the bridge of st maurice with a view to plunder as we be not the first so it be probable that we be not to be the last who have trust themselves in these region of the upper air bent on we object whether of love or of strife signora observe pierre respectfully when the genoese cease speak if you eccellenza would make you discourse less learn and more in those familiar word which can be say under a brisk movement it might better suit the time and the great necessity there be to be diligent dost thou apprehend danger be we behind we time -- speak for i dislike concealment danger have a strong meaning in the mouth of a mountaineer signora for what be security on this path might be think alarming lower down in the valley i say it not but the sun be touch the rock as you see and we be draw near to place where a miss-step of a mule in the dark might cost we dear i would that all diligently improve the daylight while they can the genoese do not answer but he urge he mule again to a gait that be more in accordance with the wish of pierre the movement be follow as a matter of course by the rest and the whole party be once more in a gentle trot which be scarcely sufficient however to keep even pace with the long impatient and rapid stride of pierre who notwithstanding he year appear to get over the ground with a facility that cost he no effort hitherto the heat have not be small and in that pure atmosphere all its power be feel during the time the sun 's ray fall into the valley but the instant they be intercept by a brown and envious peak of the mountain they genial influence be succeed by a chill that sufficiently prove how necessary be the presence of the luminary to the comfort of those who dwell at that great elevation the female seek they mantle the moment the bright light be follow by the usual shadow nor be it long before even the more aged of the gentleman be see unstrapp they cloak and take the customary precaution against the effect of the evening air the reader be not to suppose however that all these little incident of the way occur in a time as brief as that which have be consume in the narration a long line of path be travel over before the signor grimaldus and he friend be cloak and diver hamlet and cabin be successively pass the alteration from the warmth of day to the chill of evening also be accompany by a corresponding change in the appearance of the object they pass st pierre a cluster of stone-roofed cottage which bear all the characteristic of the inhospitable region for which they have be construct be the last village though there be a hamlet at the bridge of hudri compose of a few dreary abode which by they aspect seem the connect link between the dwelling of man and the cavern of beast vegetation have long be grow more and more meager and it be now fast melting away into still deeper and irretrievable trace of sterility like the shadow of a picture pass through they several transition of color to the depth of the back-ground the larch and cedar diminish gradually in size and number until the straggling and stint tree become a bush and the latter finally disappear in the shape of a tuft of pale green that adhere to some crevice in the rock like so much moss even the mountain grass for which switzerland be so justly celebrated grow thin and wiry and by the time the traveller reach the circular basin at the foot of the peak of vélan which be call la plaine de prou there only remain in the most genial season of the year and that in isolate spot between the rock a sufficiency of nourishment for the support of a small flock of adventurous nibble and hungry goat the basin just allude to be a opening among high pinnacle and be nearly surround by naked and ragged rock the path lead through its center always ascend on a inclined plane and disappear through a narrow gorge around the brow of a beetle cliff pierre point out the latter as the pass by far the most dangerous on this side the col in the season of the melting snow avalanche frequently roll from its crag there be no cause for apprehend this well-known alpine danger however in the present moment for with the exception of mont-vélan all above and around they lay in the same dreary dress of sterility indeed it would not be easy for the imagination to conceive a more eloquent picture of desolation than that which meet the eye of the traveller as follow the course of the run of water that trickle through the middle of the inhospitable valley the certain indication of the general direction of they course they reach its center the time be get to be that of early twilight but the sombre color of the rock streak and venerable by the ferruginous hue with which time have coat they side and the depth of the basin give to they situation a melancholy gloom pass the duskiness of the hour on the other hand the light rested bright and gloriously on the snowy peak of vélan still many thousand foot above they though in plain and apparently in near view while rich touch of the setting sun be gleam on several of the brown natural battlements of the alp which wear with eternal exposure to the storm still lay in sublime confusion at a most painful elevation in they front the azure vault that canopy all have that look of distant glory and of grand repose which so often meet the eye and so forcibly strike the mind of he who travel in the deep valley and embedded lake of switzerland the glacier of valsorey descend from the upper region nearly to the edge of the valley bright and shine its lower margin streak and dirty with the _ débris _ of the overhang rock as if doom to the fate of all that come upon the earth that of share its impurity there no longer exist any human habitation between the point which the traveller have now attain and the convent though more modern speculation in this age of curiosity and restlessness have be induce to rear a substitute for a inn in the spot just describe with the hope of glean a scanty tribute from those who fail of arrive in season to share the hospitality of the monk the chilliness of the air increase faster even than the natural change of the hour would seem to justify and there be moment when the dull sound of the wind descend to they ear though not a breath be stir a withered and nearly solitary blade of grass at they foot once or twice large black cloud drive across the opening above they resemble heavy-winged vulture sailing in the void preparatory to a swoop upon they prey chapter xxii through this gap on and say nothing lest a word a breath bring down a winter 's snow enough to whelm the armed file that night and day be see wind from cliff to cliff in loose array to conquer at marengo _ italy _ pierre dumont halted in the middle of the sterile little plain while he sign for those he conduct to continue they ascent as each mule pass it receive a blow or a kick from the impatient guide who do not seem to think it necessary to be very ceremonious with the poor beast and have take this simple method to give a general and a brisker impulsion to the party the expedient be so natural and so much in accordance with the practice of the muleteer and other of they class that it excite no suspicion in most of the traveller who pursue they way either meditate on and enjoy the novel and profound emotion that they present situation so naturally awaken or discourse lightly in the manner of the thoughtless and unconcerned the signor grimaldus alone whose watchfulness have already be quicken by previous distrust take heed of the movement when all have pass the genoese turn in he saddle and cast a apparently careless look behind but the glance in truth be anxious and keen pierre stand look steadily at the heaven one hand hold he hat and the other extend with a open palm a glittering particle descend to the latter when the guide instantly resume he place in advance as he pass the italian however meet a inquire look he permit the other to see a snow-drop so thoroughly congeal as to have not yet melt with the natural heat of he skin the eye of pierre appear to impose discretion on he confidant and the silent communion escape the observation of the rest of the traveller just at this moment too the attention of the other be luckily call to a different object by a cry from one of the muleteer of whom there be three as assistant to the guide he point out a party which like themselves be hold the direction of the col there be a solitary individual mount on a mule and a single pedestrian without any guide or other traveller in they company they movement be swift and they have not be more than a minute in view before they disappear behind a angle of the crag which nearly close the valley on the side of the convent and which be the precise spot already mention as be so dangerous in the season of the melting snow dost thou know the quality and object of the traveller before we demand the baron de willading of pierre the latter muse it be evident he do not expect to meet with stranger in that particular part of the passage we can know little of those who come from the convent though few would be apt to leave so safe a roof at this late hour he answer but until i see yonder traveller with my own eye i could have swear there be none on this side of the col go the same way as ourselves it be time that all the other be already arrive they be villager of st pierre go up with supplies observe one of the muleteer none bind to italy have pass lidde since the party of pippo and they by this tine should be well house at the hospice didst not see a dog among they -- 'twa one of the augustine ' mastiff 'twa the dog i note and it be on account of he appearance that i speak return the baron the animal have the air of a old acquaintance gaetano for to I it seem to resemble we try friend nettuno and he at whose heel it keep so close wear much the air of we acquaintance of the leman the bold and ready maso who have go unrequited for he eminent service answer the genoese thoughtfully the extraordinary refusal of that man to receive we money be quite as wonderful as any other part of he unusual and inexplicable conduct i would he have be less obstinate or less proud for the unrequited obligation rest like a load upon my spirit thou art wrong i employ we young friend sigismund secretly on this duty while we be receive the greeting of roger de blonay and the good bailiff but thy countryman treat the escape lightly as the mariner be apt to consider past danger and he would listen to no offer of protection or gold i be therefore more displeased than surprise by what thou hast well enough term obstinacy tell you employer he say add sigismund that they may thank the saint we lady or brother luther as best suit they habit but that they have better forget that such a man as maso live he acquaintance can bring they neither honor nor advantage tell this especially to the signor grimaldus when you be on you journey to italy and we have part for ever as on my suggestion this be say to I in the interview i hold with the i rave fellow after he liberation from prison the answer be remarkable for a man of he condition and the especial message to myself of singular exception i observe that he eye be often on I with peculiar meaning during the passage of the lake and to this hour i have not be able to explain the motive be the signora of genoa -- ask the guide : or be he by chance in any way connect with she authority of that republic and city and certainly of some little interest with the authority answer the italian a slight smile curl he lip as he glance a look at he friend it be not necessary to look farther for maso 's acquaintance with you feature return pierre laughing for of all who live in italy there be not a man who have more frequent occasion to know the authority but we linger in this gossip urge the beast upward etienne -- presto -- presto the muleteer answer this appeal by one of they long cry which have a resemblance to the rattle that be the well-known signal of the venomous serpent of this country when he would admonish the traveller to move quickly and which certainly produce the same startling effect on the nerve of the mule as the signal of the snake be very apt to excite in man this interruption cause the dialogue to be drop all ride onward muse in they several fashion on what have just pass in a few minute the party turn the crag in question and quit the valley or sterile basin in which they have be journey for the last half hour they enter by a narrow gorge into a scene that resemble a crude collection of the material of which the foundation of the world have be originally form there be no longer any vegetation at all or if here and there a blade of grass have put forth under the shelter of some stone it be so meager and of so rare occurrence as to be unnoticed in that sublime scene of chaotic confusion ferruginous streak naked and cheerless rock arise around they and even that snowy beacon the glowing summit of vélan which have so long lain bright and cheer on they path be now hide entirely from view pierre dumont soon after point out a place on the visible summit of the mountain where a gorge between the neigh boring peak admit a view of the heaven beyond this he inform those he guide be the col through whose open the pile of the alp be to be finally surmount the light that still tranquilly reign in this part of the heaven be in sublime contrast to the gathering gloom of the pass below and all hail this first glimpse of the end of they day 's toil as a harbinger of rest and we might add of security for although none but the signor grimaldus have detect the secret uneasiness of pierre it be not possible to be at that late hour amid so wild and dreary a display of desolation and as it be cut off from communion with they kind without experience a humbling sense of the dependence of man upon the grand and ceaseless providence of god the mule be again urge to increase they pace and image of the refreshment and repose that be expect from the convent 's hospitality become general and grateful among the traveller the day be fast disappear from the glen and ravine through which they ride and all discourse cease in the desire to get on the exceed purity of the atmosphere which at that great elevation resemble a medium of thought rather than of matter render object define just and near and none but the mountaineer and sigismund who be use to the deception -lrb- for in effect truth obtain this character with those who have be accustom to the false -rrb- and who understand the grandeur of the scale on which nature have display she power among the alp know how to calculate the distance which still separate they from they goal more than a league of painful and stony ascent be to be surmount and yet adelheid and christine have both permit slight exclamation of pleasure to escape they when pierre point to the speck of blue sky between the hoary pinnacle above and first give they to understand that it denote the position of the convent here and there too small patch of the last year 's snow be discover lie under the shadow of overhang rock and which be likely to resist the power of the sun till winter come again another certain sign that they have reach a height greatly exceed that of the usual habitation of man the keenness of the air be another proof of they situation for all the traveller have hear that the augustine dwelt among eternal frost a report which be nearly literally true at no time during the day have the industry of the party be as great as it now become in this respect the ordinary traveller be apt to resemble he who journey on the great highway of life and who find himself oblige by a tardy and ill-requited diligence in age to repair those omission and negligence of youth which would have render the end of he toil easy and profitable improve as they speed have become it continue to increase rather than to diminish for pierre dumont keep he eye rivet on the heaven and each moment of time seem to bring new incentive to exertion the wearied beast manifest less zeal than the guide and they who ride they be begin to murmur at the unreasonableness of the rate at which they be compel to proceed on the narrow uneven stony path where footing for the animal be not always obtain with the necessary quickness when a gloom deeper that cast by the shadow of the rock fall upon they track and the air fill with snow as suddenly as if all its particle have be form and condensed by the application of some prompt chemical process the change be so unexpected and yet so complete that the whole party check they mule and sit look up at the million of flake that be descend on they head with more wonder and admiration than fear a shout from pierre first arouse they from this trance and recall they to a sense of the real state of thing he be stand on a knoll already separate from the party by some fifty yard white with snow and gesticulate violently for the traveller to come on for the sake of the bless marium quicken the beast he cry for pierre like most who dwell in valai be a catholic and one accustom to bethink he most of he heavenly mediator when most oppressed with present danger quicken they speed if ye value you life this be no moment to gaze at the mountain which be well enough in they way and no doubt both the finest and largest know -lrb- no swiss ever seriously vituperate or lose he profound veneration for he beloved nature -rrb- but which have better be the humblest plain on earth for we occasion than what they truly be quicken the mule then for the love of the bless virgin thou betrayest unnecessary and for one that have need be cool indiscreet alarm at the appearance of a little snow friend pierre observe the signer grimaldus as the mule draw near the guide and speak with a little of the irony of a soldier who have steel he nerve by familiarity with danger even we italian though less use to the frost than you of the mountain be not so much disturb by the change as thou a trained guide of st bernard reproach I as you will signore say pierre turn and pursue he way with increase diligence though he do not entirely succeed in conceal he resentment at a accusation which he know to be unmerited but quicken you pace until you be better acquaint with the country in which you journey you word pass for empty breath in my ear this be no trifle of a cloak double about the person or of ball roll into pile by the sport of child but a affair of life or death you be a half league in the air signor genoese in the region of storm where the wind work they will at time as if infernal devil wear rioting to cool themselves and where the stoutest limb and the firmest heart be bring but too often to see and confess they feebleness the old man have uncover he blanched lock in respect to the italian as he utter this energetic remonstrance and when he end he walk on with professional pride as if disdain to protect a brow that have already weather so many tempest among the mountain cover thyself good pierre i pray thee : urge the genoese in a tone of repentance i have show the intemperance of a boy and intemperance of a quality that little become my year thou art the best judge of the circumstance in which we be place and thou alone shalt lead we pierre accept the apology with a manly but respectful reverence continue always to ascend with unremitted industry ten gloomy and anxious minute succeed during this time the fall snow come faster and in finer flake while occasionally there be fearful intimation that the wind be about to rise at the elevation in which the traveller now find themselves phenomenon that would ordinarily be of little account become the arbiter of fate the escape of the caloric from the human system at the height of six or seven thousand foot above the sea and in the latitude of forty-six be under the most favorable circumstance frequently of itself the source of inconvenience but here be grave additional reason to heighten the danger the absence of the sun 's ray alone leave a sense of chill cold and a few hour of night be certain to bring frost even at midsummer thus it be that storm of trifling import in themselves gain power over the human frame by its reduce means of resistance and when to this fact be add the knowledge that the element be far fiercer in they workings in the upper than in the nether region of the earth the motive of pierre 's concern will be better understand by the reader than they probably wese by himself though the honest guide have a long and severe experience to supply the place of theory man be rarely loquacious in danger the timid recoil into themselves yield most of they faculty to a torment imagination that augment the cause of alarm and diminish the means of security while the firm of mind rally and condense they power to the point necessary to exertion such be the effect in the present instance on those who follow pierre a general and deep silence pervade the party each one see they situation in the color most suit to he particular habit and character the man without a exception be grave and earnest in they effort to force the mule forward adelheid become pale but she preserve she calmness by the sheer force of character christine be tremble and dependent though cheer by the presence of and she confidence in sigismund while the attendant of the heiress of willading cover they head and follow they mistress with the blind faith in they superior that be apt to sustain people of they class in serious emergency ten minute suffice entirely to change the aspect of the view the frozen element could not adhere to the iron-like and perpendicular face of the mountain but the glen and ravine and valley become as white as the peak of vélan still pierre continue he silent and upward march in a way to keep alive a species of tremble hope among those who depend so helplessly upon he intelligence and faith they wish to believe that the snow be merely one of those common occurrence that be to be expect on the summit of the alp at this late season of the year and which be no more than so many symptom of the known rigor of the approach winter the guide himself be evidently dispose to lose no time in explanation and as the secret excitement steal over all he follower he no longer have cause to complain of the tardiness of they movement sigismund keep near he sister and adelheid have a care that they mule do not lag while the other male perform the same necessary office for the beast ridden by the female domestic in this manner pass the few sombre minute which immediately precede the disappearance of day the heaven be no longer visible in that direction the eye see only a endless succession of fall flake and it be get to be difficult to distinguish even the rampart of rock that bound the irregular ravine in which they ride they be know to be however at no great distance from the path which indeed occasionally brush they side at other moment they cross rude stony mountain heath if such a word can be apply to spot without the symbol or hope of vegetation the trace of the beast that have precede they become less and less apparent though the trickle stream that come down from the glacier and along which they have now journeyed-for hour be occasionally see as it be cross in pursue they wind way pierre though still confident that he hold the true direction alone know that this guide be not longer to be rely on for as they draw nearer to the top of the mountain the torrent gradually lessen both in its force and in the volume of its water separate into twenty small rill which come ripple from the vast body of snow that lay among the different peak above as yet there have be no wind the guide as minute after minute pass without bring any change in this respect venture at last to advert to the fact cheer he companion by give they reason to hope that they should yet reach the convent without any serious calamity as if in mockery of this opinion the flake of snow begin to whirl in the air while the word be on he lip and a blast come through the ravine that set the protection of cloak and mantle at defiance notwithstanding he resolution and experience the stout-hearted pierre suffer a exclamation of despair to escape he and he instantly stop in the manner of a man who could no longer conceal the dread that have be collect in he bosom for the last interminable and weary hour sigismund as well as most of the man of the party have dismount a little previously with a view to excite warmth by exercise the youth have often traverse the mountain and the cry no sooner reach he ear than he be at the side of he who utter it at what distance be we still from the convent he demand eagerly there be more than a league of steep and stone path to mount monsieur le capitaine return the disconsolate pierre in a tone that perhaps say more than he word this be not a moment for indecision remember that thou art not the leader of a party of carrier with they beast of burthen but that there be those with we who be unused to exposure and be feeble of body what be the distance from the last hamlet we pass double that to the convent sigismund turn and with the eye he make a silent appeal to the two old noble as if to ask for advice or order it might indeed be better to return observe the signora grimaldus in the way one utter a half-formed resolution this wind be get to be piercingly cut and the night be hard upon we what thinkest thou melchior for with monsieur sigismund i be of opinion that there be little time to lose signora you pardon hastily interrupt the guide i would not undertake to cross the plain of the vélan a hour later for all the treasure of einsideln and loretto the wind will have a infernal sweep in that basin which will soon be boil like a pot while here we shall get from time to time the shelter of the rock the slightest mishap on the open ground might lead we astray a league or more and it would need a hour to regain the course the beast too mount faster than they descend and with far more surety in the dark and even when at the village there be nothing fit for noble while the brave monk have all that a king can need those who escape from these wild rock need not be critical about they fare honest pierre when fairly house wilt thou answer for we arrival at the convent unharmed and in reasonable time signora we be in the hand of god the pious augustine i make no doubt be pray for all who be on the mountain at this moment but there be not a minute to lose i ask no more than that none lose sight of they companion and that each exert he force to the utmost we be not far from the house of refuge and should the storm increase to a tempest as to conceal the danger no longer well may happen in this late month we will seek its shelter for a few hour this intelligence be happily communicate for the certainty that there be a place of safety within a attainable distance have some such cheer effect on the traveller as be produce on the mariner who find that the hazard of the gale be lessen by the accidental position of a secure harbor under he lee repeat he admonition for the party to keep as close together as possible and advise all who feel the sinister effect of the cold on they limb to dismount and to endeavor to restore the circulation by exercise pierre resume he route but even the time consume in this short conference have sensibly alter the condition of thing for the worse the wind which have no fixed direction be a furious current of the upper air divert from its true course by encounter the ragged peak and ravine of the alp be now whirling around they in eddy now aid they ascent by seem to push against they back and then return in they face with a violence that actually render advance impossible the temperature fall rapidly several degree and the most vigorous of the party begin to perceive the benumbing influence of the chill current at they lower extremity especially in a manner to excite serious alarm every precaution be use to protect the female that tenderness could suggest but though adelheid who alone retain sufficient self-command to give a account of she feeling diminish the danger of they situation with the wish not to alarm they companion uselessly she could not conceal from herself the horrible truth that the vital heat be escape from she own body with a rapidity that render it impossible for she much longer to retain the use of she faculty conscious of she own mental superiority over that of all she female companion a superiority which in such moment be even of more account than bodily force after a few minute of silent endurance she check she mule and call upon sigismund to examine the condition of he sister and she maid neither of whom have now speak for some time this startling request be make at a moment when the storm appear to gather new force and when it have become absolutely impossible to distinguish even the whitened earth at twenty pace from the spot where the party stand collect in a shiver group the young soldier throw open the cloak and mantle in which christine be envelop and the half-unconscious girl sink on he shoulder like a drowsy infant that be willing to seek its slumber in the arm of one it love christine -- my sister -- my poor my much-abused angelic sister murmur sigismund happily for he secret in a voice that only reach the ear of adelheid awake christine for the love of we excellent and affectionate mother exert thyself awake christine in the name of god awake awake dearest christine exclaim adelheid throw herself from the saddle and folding the smile but benumb girl to she bosom god protect I from the pang of feeling that thy loss should be owe to my wish to lead thee amid these cruel and inhospitable rock christine if thou hast love or pity for I awake look to the maid hurriedly say pierre who find that he be fast touch on one of those mountain catastrophe of which in the course of he life he have be the witness of a few of fearful consequence look to all the female for he who now sleep die the muleteer soon strip the two domestic of they outer covering and it be immediately proclaim that both be in imminent danger one have already lose all consciousness a timely application of the flask of pierre and the effort of the muleteer succeed so far in restore life as to remove the grounds of immediate apprehension though it be apparent to the least instruct of they all that half a hour more of exposure would probably complete the fatal work that have so actively and vigorously commence to add to the horror of this conviction each member of the party not except the muleteer be painfully conscious of the escape of that vital warmth whose total flight be death in this strait all dismount they feel that the occasion be one of extreme jeopardy that nothing could save they but resolution and that every minute of time be get to be of the last importance each female adelheid include be place between two of the other sex and support in this manner pierre call loudly and in a manful voice for the whole to proceed the beast be drive after they by one of the muleteer the progress of traveller feeble as adelheid and she companion on a stony path of very uneven surface and of a steep ascent the snow cover the foot and the tempest cut they face be necessarily slow and to the last degree toilsome still the exertion increase the quickness of the blood and for a short time there be a appearance of recall those who most suffer to life pierre who still keep he post with the hardihood of a mountaineer and the fidelity of a swiss cheer they on with he voice continue to raise the hope that the place of refuge be at hand at this instant when exertion be most need and when apparently all be sensible of its importance and most disposed to make it the muleteer charge with the duty of urge on the line of beast desert he trust prefer to take he chance of regain the village by descend the mountain to struggle uselessly and at a pace so slow to reach the convent the man be a stranger in the country who have be adventitiously employ for this expedition and be unconnected with pierre by any of those tie which be the best pledge of unconquerable faith when the interest of self press hard upon we weakness the wearied beast no longer drive and indispose to toil first stop then turn aside to avoid the cut air and the ascent and be soon wander from the path it be so vitally necessary to keep as soon as pierre be inform of the circumstance he eagerly issue a order to collect the

all the effect of the traveller be on the beast and after some ten minute of delay blended with a excitement which help to quicken the blood and to awaken the faculty of even the female the mule be all happily regain they be secure to each other head and tail in the manner so usual in the drove of these animal and pierre turn to resume the order of the march but on seek the path it be not to be find search be make on every side and yet none could meet with the smallest of its trace break rough fragment of rock be all that reward the most anxious investigation and after a few precious minute uselessly waste they all assemble around the guide as if by common consent to seek he counsel the truth be no longer to be conceal -- the party be lose chapter xxiii let no presume railer tax creative

gradation of courage from the calm energy of reflection which be render still more effective by physical firmness to the headlong precipitation of reckless spirit : from the resolution that grow more

that come over the heart when accidental cause rob we suddenly and without notice of those resource on which we have be habitually accustom to rely the mariner without he course or compass lose he audacity and coolness though the momentary danger be the same the soldier will fly if you deprive he of he arm and the hunter of we own forest who have lose he landmark be transform from the bold and determine foe of its tenant into a anxious and dependent fugitive timidly seek the means of retreat in short the customary association of the mind be rudely and suddenly destroy we be make to feel that reason while it elevate we so far above the brute as to make man they lord and governor become a quality less valuable than instinct when the connect link in its train of cause and effect be sever it be no more than a natural consequence of he greater experience that pierre dumont understand the horror of they present situation far better than any with he it be true there yet remain enough light to enable he to pick he way over the rock and stone but he have sufficient experience to understand that there be less risk in remain stationary than in move for while there be only one direction that lead towards the refuge all the rest would conduct they to a greater distance from the shelter which be now the only hope on the other hand a very few minute of the intense cold and of the search wind to which they be expose would most probably freeze the current of life in the feebler of those intrust to he care hast thou aught to advise asked melchior de willade folding adelheid

be return impossible by always descend we must in time reach the village below that time would be fatal answer pierre i know of only one resource that remain if the party will keep together and answer my shout i will make another effort to find the path this proposal be gladly accept for energy and hope go hand-in-hand and the guide be about to quit the group when he feel the strong grasp of sigismund on he arm i will be thy companion say the soldier firmly thou hast not do I justice young man answer pierre with severe reproach in he manner have i be base enough to desert my trust these limb and this strength be yet sufficient to carry I safely down the mountain but though a guide of the alp may freeze like another man the last throb of he heart will be in behalf of those he serve a thousand pardon brave old man -- a thousand pardon still will i be thy companion the search that be conduct by two will be more likely to succeed than that on which thou go alone the offended pierre who like the spirit of the youth as much as he dislike he previous suspicion meet the apology frankly he extend he hand and forget the feeling that even amid the tempest of those wild mountain be excite by a distrust of he honesty after this short concession to the ever-burning though smother volcano of human passion they leave the group together in order to make a last search for they course the snow by this time be many inch deep and as the road be at best but a faint bridle-path that could scarcely be distinguish by day-light from the débris which strew the ravine the undertaking would have be utterly hopeless have not pierre know that there be the chance of still meet with some sign of the many mule that daily go up and down the mountain the guide call to the muleteer who answer he cry every minute for so long as they keep within the sound of each other 's voice there be no danger of they become entirely separated but amid the hollow roaring of the wind and the incessant pelting of the storm it be neither safe nor practicable to venture far asunder several little stony knoll be ascended and descend and a ripple rill be find but without bring with it any trace of the path the heart of pierre begin to chill with the decrease warmth of he body and the firm old man overwhelm with he responsibility while he truant thought would unbidden recur to those whom he have leave in he cottage at the foot of the mountain give way at last to he emotion in a paroxysm of grief wring he hand weep and call loudly on god for succor this fearful evidence of they extremity work upon the feeling of sigismund until they be work up nearly to frenzy he great physical force still sustain he and in a access of energy that be fearfully ally to madness he rush forward into the vortex of snow and hail as if determine to leave all to the providence of god disappear from the eye of he companion this incident recall the guide to he sens he call earnestly on the thoughtless youth to return no answer be give and pierre hasten back to the motionless and shiver party in order to unite all they voice in a last effort to be hear cry upon cry be raise but each shout be answer merely by the hoarse rush of the wind sigismund sigismund call one after another in hurry and alarm succession the noble boy will be irretrievably lose exclaim the signor grimaldus in despair the service already render by the youth together with he manly quality have insensibly and closely wind themselves around he heart he will die a miserable death and without the consolation of meet he fate in communion with he fellow-sufferer a shout from sigismund come whirling past as if the sound be embody in the gale bless ruler of the earth this be alone the mercy exclaim melchior de willading -- he have find the path and honor to thee marium -- thou mother of god murmur the italian at that moment a dog come leap and bark through the snow it immediately be scent and whine among the frozen traveller the exclamation of joy and surprise be scarcely utter before sigismund accompany by another join the party honor and thanks to the good augustine cry the delighted guide this be the third good office of the kind for which i be they debtor i would it be true honest pierre answer the stranger but maso and nettuno be poor substitute in a tempest like this for the servant and beast of st bernard i be a wanderer and lose like yourselve and my presence bring little other relief than that which be know to be the fruit of companionship in misery the saint have bring I a second time into you company when matter be hang between life and death maso make this last remark when by draw nearer the group he have be able to ascertain by the remains of the light of whom the party be compose if it be to be as useful now as thou hast already be answer the genoese it will be happier for we all thyself include : bethink thee quickly of thy expedient and i will make thee a equal sharer of all that a generous providence have bestow il maledetto rarely listen to the voice of the signor grimaldus without a manner of interest and curiosity which as already mention have more than once strike the latter himself but which he quite naturally attribute to the circumstance of he person be know to one who have declare himself to be a native of genoa even at this terrible moment the same manner be evident and the noble think it a favorable symptom renew the already neglect offer of fortune with a view to quicken a zeal which he reasonably enough suppose would be most likely to be awaken by the hope of a substantial reward be there question here illustrious signora answer maso of steer a barge of shortenning sail or of handle a craft of any rig or construction in gale squall hurricane or a calm among breaker my skill and experience might be turn to good account but set aside the difference in we strength and hardihood even that lily which be in so much danger of be nip by the frost be not more helpless than i be myself at this moment i be no better than yourselve signor and though a better mountaineer perhaps i rely on the favor of the saint to be succore or my time must finish among the snow instead of in the surf of a sea-shore as until now i have always believe would be my fate but the dog -- thy admirable dog ah eccellenza nettuno be but a useless beast here god have give he a thicker mantle and a warmer dress than to we christian but even this advantage will soon prove a curse to my poor friend the long hair he carry will quickly be cover with icicle and as the snow deepen it will retard he movement the dog of st bernard be smoother have longer limb a truer scent and possess the advantage of be train to the path a tremendous shout of sigismund 's interrupted maso -- the youth on finding that the accidental meeting with the mariner be not likely to lead to any immediate advantage have instantly accompany by pierre and one of he assistant renew the search the cry be echo from the guide and the muleteer and then all three be see fly through the snow precede by a powerful mastiff nettuno who have be crouch with he bushy tail between he leg bark seem to arouse with renew courage and then leap with evident joy and good-will upon the back of he old antagonist uberto the dog of st bernard be alone but he air and all he action be those of a animal whose consciousness be work up to the highest pitch permit by the limit nature have set to the intelligence of a brute he run from one to another rub he glossy and solid side against the limb of all wag he tail and betray the usual sign that creature of he species manifest when they instinct be most alive luckily he have a good interpreter of he meaning in the guide who know the habit and if it may be so express the intention of the mastiff feeling there be not a moment to lose if they would still preserve the feebler member of they party beg the other to hasten the necessary disposition to profit by this happy meeting the female be support as before the mule fasten together and pierre place himself in front call cheerfully to the dog encourage he to lead the way be it quite prudent to confide so implicitly to the guidance of this brute ask the signor grimaldus a little doubtingly when he see the arrangement on which by the increase gloom and the grow intensity of the cold it be but too apparent even to one as little accustomed to the mountain as himself that the life of the whole party depend fear not to trust to old uberto signora answer pierre move onward as he speak for to think of further delay be out of the question fear nothing for the faith or the knowledge of the dog these animal be train by the servant of the convent to know and keep the path even when the snow lie on they fathom deep god have give they stout heart long limb and short hair expressly as it have often seem to I for this end and nobly do they use the gift i be acquaint with all they way for we guide commonly learn the ravine of st bernard by first serve the clavier of the convent and many a day have i go up and down these rock with a couple of these animal in training for this very purpose the father and mother of uberto be my favorite companion and they son will hardly play a old friend of the family false the traveller follow they leader with more confidence though blindly uberto appear to perform he duty with the sobriety and steadiness that become he year and which indeed be very necessary for the circumstance in which they be place instead of bound ahead and become lose to view as most probably would have happen with a younger animal the noble and half-reasoning brute maintain a pace that be suit to the slow march of those who support the female occasionally stop to look back as if to make sure that none be leave the dog of st bernard be or it might perhaps be better to say be -- for it be affirm that the ancient race be lose -- choose for they size they limb and the shortness of they coat as have just be state by pierre the former be necessary to convey the succor with which they be often charge as well as to overcome the difficulty of the mountain and the two latter that they might the better wade through and resist the influence of the snow they training consist in render they familiar with and attach to the human race in teach they to know and to keep the path on all occasion except such as call for a higher exercise of they instinct and to discover the position of those who have be overwhelm by the avalanche and to assist in disinter they body in all these duty uberto have be so long exercise that he be universally know to be the most sagacious and the most trusty animal on the mountain pierre follow he step with so much greater-reliance on he intelligence from be perfectly acquaint with the character of the dog when therefore he see the mastiff turn at right angle to the course he have just be take the guide on reach the spot imitate he example and first remove the snow to make sure of the fact he joyfully proclaim to those who come after he that the lose path be find this intelligence sound like a reprieve from death though the mountaineer well know that more than a hour of painful and increase toil be still necessary to reach the hospice the chill blood of the tender being who be fast drop into the terrible sleep which be the forerunner of death be quicken in they vein however when they hear the shout of delight that spontaneously break from all they male companion on learn the glad tiding the movement be now faster though embarrassed and difficult on account of the incessant pelting of the storm and the influence of the bite cold which be difficult to be withstand by even the strongest of the party sigismund groan inwardly as he think of adelheid and he sister 's be expose to a tempest which shake the stoutest frame and the most manly heart among they he encircle the latter with a arm rather carry than lead she along for the young soldier have sufficient knowledge of the locality of the mountain to understand that they be still at a fearful distance from the col and that the strength of christine be absolutely unequal to the task of reach it unsupported occasionally pierre speak to the dog nettuno keep close to the side of uberto in order to prevent separation since the path be no longer discernible without constant examination the darkness have so far increase as to reduce the sight to very narrow limit each time the name of the latter be pronounce the animal would stop wag he tail or give some other sign of recognition as if to reassure he follower of he intelligence and fidelity after one of these short halt old uberto and he companion unexpectedly refuse to proceed the guide the two old noble and at length the whole party be around they and no cry or encouragement of the mountaineer could induce the dog to quit they track be we again lose ask the baron de willade press adelheid closer to he beat heart nearly ready to submit to they common fate in despair have god at length forsake we -- my daughter -- my beloved child this touching appeal be answer by a howl from uberto who leap madly away and disappear nettuno follow bark wildly and with a deep throat pierre do not hesitate about follow and sigismund believe that the movement of the guide be to arrest the flight of the dog be quickly on he heel maso move with greater deliberation nettuno be not apt to raise that bark with nothing but hail and snow and wind in he nostril say the calculate italian we be either near another party of traveller for such be on the mountain as i know god forbid art sure of this demand the signor grimaldus observe that the other have suddenly check himself sure that other _ be _ signora return the mariner deliberately as if he measure well the meaning of each word ah here come the trusty beast and pierre and the captain with they tiding be they good or be they evil the two just name rejoin they friend a maso cease speak they hurriedly inform the shiver traveller that the much desire refuge be near and that nothing but the darkness and the drive snow prevent it from be see it be a bless thought and one that come from st augustine himself which lead the holy monk to raise this shelter exclaim the delighted pierre no longer consider it necessary to conceal the extent of the danger they have run i would not answer even for my own power to reach the hospice in a time like this you be of mother church signora being of italy i be one of she unworthy child return the genoese this unmerited favor must have come from the prayer of st augustine and a vow i make to send a fair offering to we lady of einsiedeln for never before have i know a dog of st bernard lead the traveller to the refuge they business be to find the frozen and to guide the traveller along the path to the hospice even uberto have he doubt as you see but the vow prevail or i know not -- it might indeed have be the prayer the signor grimaldus be too eager to get adelheid under cover and in good sooth to be there himself to waste the time in discuss the knotty point of which of two means that be equally orthodox have be the most efficacious in bring about they rescue in common with the other he follow the pious and confide pierre in silence make the best of he way after the credit lous guide the latter have not yet see the refuge himself for so these place be well term on the alpine pass but the information of the ground have satisfy he of its proximity once reassure as to he precise position all the surround locality present themselves to he mind with the familiarity the seaman manifest with every cord in the intricate maze of he rigging in the darkest night or to produce a parallel of more common use with the readiness which all manifest in the intricacy of they own habitation the broken chain of association be repair and join every thing become clear again to he apprehension and in diverge from the path on this occasion the old man hold he way as directly toward the spot he seek as if he be journey under a bright sun there be a rough but short descent a similar rise and the long-desired goal be reach we shall not stop to dwell upon the emotion with which the traveller first touch this place of comparative security humility and dependence on the providence of god be the pre-dominant sensation even with the rude muleteer while the pearly exhaust female be just able to express in murmur they fervent gratitude to the omnipotent power that have permit its agent so unexpectedly to interpose between they and death the refuge be not see until pierre lay he hand on the roof now white with snow and proclaim its character with a loud warm and devout thanksgiving enter and thank god he say another hopeless half-hour would have bring down from he pride the stoutest among we -- enter and thank god as be the fact with all the edifice of that region the building be entirely of stone even to the roof have the form of those vaulted cellar which in this country be use for the preservation of vegetable it be quite free from humidity however the clearness of the atmosphere and the entire absence of soil prevent the accumulation of moisture and it offer no more than the naked protection of its wall to those who seek its cover but shelter on such a night be everything and this it effectually afford the place have only one outlet be simply form of four wall and the roof but it be sufficiently large to shelter a party twice as numerous as that which have now reach it the transition from the bite cold and pierce wind of the mountain to the shelter of this inartificial building be so great as to produce something like a general sensation of warmth the advantage gain in this change of feeling be judiciously improve by the application of friction and of restorative under the direction of pierre uberto carry a small supply of the latter attach to he collar and before half a hour have pass adelheid and christine be sleep sweetly side by side muffle in plenty of the spare garment and pillow on the saddle and housing of the mule the brute be bring within the refuge and as no party mount the st bernard without carry the provender necessary for its beast of burthen that sterile region afford none of its own the very fuel be transport league on the back of mule the patient and hardy animal too find they solace after the fatigue and exposure of the day the presence of so many live body in lodgings so confine aid in produce warmth and after all have eat of the scanty fare furnish by the foresight of the guide drowsiness come over the whole party chapter xxiv side by side within they lie a mournful company roger the sleep of the weary be sweet in after-life adelheid when dwelling in a palace repose on down and canopy by the rich stuff of a more generous climate be often hear to say that she have never take rest grateful as that she find in the refuge of st bernard so easy natural and refreshing have be she slumber unalloyed even by those dream of precipice and avalanche which long afterwards haunt she slumber that she be the first to open she eye on the follow morning awake like a infant that have enjoy a quiet and healthful repose she movement arouse christine they throw aside the cloak and coat that cover they and sit gaze about the place in the confusion that the novelty of they situation would be likely to produce all the rest of the traveller still slumber and arise without noise they pass the silent and insensible sleeper the quiet mule which have stretch themselves near the entrance of the place and quit the hut without the scene be wintry : but as be usual in the alp let what may be the season its feature of grand and impose sublimity be prominent the day be among the peak above they while the shades of night still lay upon the valley form a landscape like that exquisite and poetical picture of the lower world which guido have give in the celebrated al-fresco painting of aurora the ravine and glen be cover with snow but the side of the rugged rock be bare in they eternal hue of ferruginous brown the little knoll on which the refuge stand be also nearly naked the wind have drive the light particle of the snow into the ravine of the path the air of the morning be keen at that great height even in midsummer and the shiver girl draw they mantle about they though they breathe the clear elastic inspiring element with pleasure the storm be entirely past and the pure sapphire-colored sky be in lovely contrast with the shadow beneath raise they thought naturally to that heaven which shine in a peace and glory so much in harmony with the ordinary image we shadow forth of the abode of the bless adelheid press the hand of christine and they kneel together bow they head to a rock as fervent pure and sincere orison ascend to god from these pious and innocent spirit as it belong to poor mortality to offer this general and in they peculiar situation especial duty perform the gentle girl feel more assure relieved of a heavy and imperative obligation they venture to look about they with greater confidence another building similar in form and material to that in which they companion be still sleep stand on the same swell of rock and they first inquiry naturally take that direction the entrance or outlet to this hut be a orifice that resemble a window rather than a door they move cautiously to the spot look into the gloomy cavern-like room as timidly as the hare throw he regard about he before he venture from he cover four human form be repose deep in the vault with they back sustain against the wall they sleep profoundly too for the curious but startled girl gaze at they long and retire without cause they to awake we have not be alone on the mountain in this terrible night whisper adelheid gently urge the tremble christine away from the spot thou seest that other traveller have be take they rest near we most probably after peril and fatigue like we own christine draw closer to the side of she more experienced friend like the young of the dive hover near the mother-bird when first venture from the nest and they return to the refuge they have quit for the cold be still so intense as to render its protection grateful at the door they be meet by pierre the vigilant old man have awaken as soon as the light cross he eye we be not alone here say adelheid point to the other stone-covered roof -- there be traveller sleep in yonder building too they sleep will be long lady answer the guide shake he head solemnly with two of they it have already last a twelvemonth and the third have sleep where you see he since the fall of the avalanche in the last day of April adelheid recoil a step for he meaning be too plain to be misunderstand after look at she gentle companion she demand if those they have see be in truth the body of traveller who have perish on the mountain of no other lady return pierre this hut be for the living -- that for the dead so near be the two to each other when man journey on these wild rock in winter i have know he who pass a short and troubled night here begin a sleep in the other before the turn of the day that be not only deep enough but which will last for ever one of the three that thou hast just see be a guide like myself : he be bury in the fall snow at the spot where the path leave the plain of vélan below we another be a pilgrim that perish in as clear a night as ever shine on st bernard and merely for have take a cup too much to cheer he way the third be a poor vine-dresser that be come from piedmont into we swiss valley to follow he call when death overtake he in a ill-advised slumber in which he be so unwise as to indulge at nightfall i find he body myself on that naked rock the day after we have drunk together in friendship at aoste and with my own hand be he place among the other and such be the burial a christian get in this inhospitable country what would you lady -- ` tis the chance of the poor and the unknown those that have friend be seek and find but those that die without leave trace of they origin fare as you see the spade be useless among these rock and then it be better that the body should remain where it may be see and claim than it should be put out of sight the good father and all of note be take down into the valley where there be earth and be decently bury while the poor and the stranger be house in this vault which be a better cover than many of they know while live ay there be three christian there who be all lately walk the earth in the flesh gay and active as any the body be four in number pierre look surprised he muse a little and continue he employment then another have perish the time may come when my own blood shall freeze this be a fate the guide must ever keep in mind for he be expose to it at a hour and a season that he know not adelheid pursue the subject no farther she remember to have hear that the pure atmosphere of the mountain prevent that offensive decay which be usually associate with the idea of death and the usage lose some of its horror in the recollection in the mean time the remainder of the party awake and be collect before the refuge the mule be lead forth and saddle the baggage be load and pierre be call upon the traveller to mount when uberto and nettuno come leap down the path in company run side by side in excellent fellowship the movement of the dog be of a nature to attract the attention of pierre and the muleteer who predict that they should soon see some of the servant of the hospice the result show the familiarity of the guide with he duty for he have scarce venture this opinion when a party from the gorge on the summit of the mountain be see wade through the snow along the path that lead towards the refuge with father xavier at its head the explanation be brief and natural after conduct the traveller to the shelter and pass most of the night in they company at the approach of dawn uberto have return to the convent always attend by he friend nettuno here he communicate to the monk by sign which they who be accustom to the habit of the animal be not slow in interpret that traveller be on the mountain the good clavier know that the party of the baron de willade be about to cross the col for he have hurry home to be in readiness to receive they and foresee the probability that they hod be overtake by the storm of the previous night he be foremost in join the servant who go forth to they succor the little flask of cordial too have be remove from the collar of uberto leave no doubt of its contents have be use and as nothing be more probable than that the traveller should seek a cover they step be direct to ward the refuge as a matter of course the worthy clavier make this explanation with eye that glisten with moisture occasionally interrupt himself to murmur a prayer of thanksgiving he pass from one of the party to the other not even neglect the muleteer examine they limb and more especially they ear to see that they have quite escape the influence of the frost and be only happy when assure by he own observation that the terrible danger they have run be not likely to be attend by any injurious consequence we be accustom to see many accident of this nature he say smilingly when the examination be satisfactorily end and practice have make we quick of sight in these matter the bless marium be praise and adoration to she holy son that you have all get through the night so well there be a warm breakfast in readiness in the convent kitchen and one solemn duty perform we will go up the rock to enjoy it the little building near we be the last earthly abode of those who perish on this side the mountain and whose remains be unclaimed none of we canon pass the spot without offer a prayer in behalf of they soul kneel with I then you that have so much reason to be grateful to god and join in the petition father xavier knelt on the rock and all the catholic of the party unite with he in the prayer for the dead the baron de willade he daughter and they attendant stand uncovered the while for though they protestant opinion reject such a mediation as useless they deeply feel the solemnity and holy character of the sacrifice the clavier arise with a countenance that be beam and bright as the morning sun which just at that moment appear above the summit of the alp cast its genial and bland warmth on the group the brown hut and the mountain side thou art a heretic he say affectionately to adelheid in whom he feel the interest to which she youth and beauty and the great danger they have so lately run in company very naturally give birth thou art a impenitent heretic but we will hot cast thee off notwithstanding thy obstinacy and crime thou seest that the saint can interest themselves in the behalf of obstinate sinner or thou and all with thee would have surely be lose this be say in a way to draw a smile from adelheid who receive he accusation as so many friendly and playful reproach as a token of peace between they she offer she hand to the monk with a request that he would aid she in get into the saddle dost thou remark the brute say the signor grimaldus point to the animal who be gravely seat before the window of the bone-house with relax jaw keep they eye rivet on its entrance or window thy st bernard dog father seem train to serve a christian in all way whether living or dead they quiet attitude and decent attention might indeed justify such a remark didst thou ever note such conduct in uberto before return the augustine address the servant of the convent for the action of the animal be a study and a subject of great interest to all of st bernard they tell I that another fresh body have be put into the house since i last come down the mountain remark pierre who be quietly dispose of a mule in a manner more favorable for adelheid to mount : the mastiff scent the dead it be this that bring he to the refuge last night heaven be praise for the mercy this be say with the indifference that habit be apt to create for the usage of leave body uninterred have no influence on the feeling of the guide but it do not the less strike those who have descend from the convent thou art the last that come down thyself say one of the servant nor have any come up but those who be now safe in the convent take they rest after last night 's tempest how canst utter this idle nonsense henrus when a fresh body be in the house this lady count they but now and there be four three be the number that i show the piedmontese noble whom i lead from aoste the day thou meanest look to this say the clavier turn abruptly away from adelheid whom he be on the point of help into the saddle the man enter the gloomy vault whence they soon return bear a body which they place with its back against the wall of the building in the open air a cloak be over the head and face as if the garment have be thus arrange to exclude the cold he have perish the past night mistake the bone-house for the refuge exclaim the clavier : marium and she son intercede for he soul be the unfortunate man truly dead ask the genoese with more of worldly care and with greater practice in the investigation of fact the frozen sleep long before the current of life cease entirely to run the augustine command he follower to remove the cloak though with little hope that the suggestion of the other would prove true when the cloth be raise the collapsed and pallid feature of one in whom life be unequivocally extinct be expose to view unlike most of those that perish of cold who usually sink into the long sleep of eternity by a gradual numbness and a slowly increase unconsciousness there be a expression of pain in the countenance of the stranger which seem to announce that he parting struggle have be severe and that he have resign he hold of that mysterious principle which connect the soul to the body with anguish a shriek from christine interrupt the awful gaze of the traveller and draw they look in another direction she be cling to the neck of adelheid she arm appear to writhe with the effort to incorporate heir two body into one it be he it be he mutter the frightened and half frantic girl bury she pale face in the bosom of she friend oh god -- it be he of whom art thou speak dear demand the wonder but not the less awe-struck adelheid believe that the weakened nerve of the poor girl be unstrung by the horror of the spectacle -- it be a traveller like ourselves that have unhappily perish in the very storm from which by the kindness of providence we have be permit to escape thou shouldst not tremble thus for fearful as it be he be in a condition to which we all must come so soon so soon so suddenly -- oh it be he adelheid alarm at the violence of christine 's feeling be quite at a loss to account for they when the relapsed grasp and the die voice show that she friend have faint sigismund be one of the first to come to the assistance of he sister who be soon restore to consciousness by the ordinary application in order to effect the cure she be bear to a rock at some little distance from the rest of the party where none of the other sex presume to come with the exception of she brother the latter staid but a moment for a stir in the little party at the bone-house induce he to go thither he return be slow thoughtful and sad the feeling of we poor christine have be unhinge and she be too easily excite to undergo the vicissitude of a journey observe adelheid after have announce the restoration of the sufferer to she sens have you see she thus before no angel could be more tranquil and happy than my cruelly treat sister be until this last disgrace -- you appear ignorant yourself of the melancholy truth adelheid look she surprise the dead man be he who be so lately intend to be the master of my sister 's happiness and the wound on he body leave little doubt that he have be murder the emotion of christine need no further explanation murder repeated adelheid in a whisper of that frightful truth there can be no question you father and we friend be now employ in make the examination which may hereafter be useful in discover the author of the deed sigismund what wouldst thou adelheid thou hast feel resentment against this unfortunate man i deny it not : could a brother feel otherwise but now -- now that god have so fearfully visit he from my soul i forgive he have we meet in italy whither i know he be go -- but this be foolish worse than that sigismund from my inmost soul i pardon he i never think he worthy of she whose simple affection be win by the first sign of he pretended into rest but i could not wish he so cruel and sudden a end may god have mercy on he as he be pardon by I adelheid receive the silent pressure of the hand which follow with pious satisfaction they then separate he to join the group that be collect around the body and she to take she station again near christine the former however be meet by the signor grimaldus who urge he immediate departure with the female for the convent promise that the rest of the traveller should follow as soon as the present melancholy duty be end as sigismund have no wish to be a party in what be go on and there be reason to think he sister would be spare much pain by quit the spot he gladly acquiesce in the proposal immediate step be take for its accomplishment christine mount she mule in obedience to she brother 's desire quietly and without remonstrance but she death-like countenance and fix eye betray the violence of the shock she have receive during the whole of the ride to the convent she speak not and as those around she feel for and understand she distress the little cavalcade could not have be more melancholy and silent have it bear with it the body of the slay in a hour they reach the long seek for and so anxiously desire place of rest while this disposition of the feebler portion of the party be make a different scene have take place near what have be already so well call the house of the living and the dead as there exist no human habitation within several league of the abode of the augustine on either side of the mountain and as the path be much frequent in the summer the monk exercise a species of civil jurisdiction in such case as require a prompt exercise of justice or a necessary respect for those form that might be important in its ad ministration hereafter before the more regular authority it be no sooner known therefore that there be reason to suspect a act of violence have be commit than the good clavier set seriously about take the necessary step to authenticate all those circumstance that could be accurately ascertain the identity of the body as that of jacque coli a small but substantial proprietor of the country of vaud be quickly establish to this fact not only several of the traveller could testify but he be also know to one of the muleteer of whom he have engage a beast to be leave at aoste and it will also be remember he have be see by pierre at martigny while make he arrangement to puss the mountain of the mule there be no other trace than a few natural sign around the building but which might equally be attribute to the beast that still await the leisure of the traveller the manner in which the unhappy man have come by he death admit of no dispute there be several wound in the body and a knife of the sort then much use by traveller of a ordinary class be leave sticking in he back in a position to render it impossible to attribute the end of the sufferer to suicide the clothes too exhibit proof of a struggle for they be tear and soil but nothing have be take away a little gold be find in the pocket and though in no great plenty still enough to weaken the first impression that there have also be a robbery this be wonderful observe the good clavier as he note the last circumstance the dross which lead so many soul to damnation have be neglect while christian blood have be shed this seem a act of vengeance rather than of cupidity let we now examine if any proof be to be find of the scene of this tragedy the search be unsuccessful the whole of the surrounding region be compose of ferruginous rock and they _ débris _ it would not indeed have be a easy matter to trace the march of a army by they footstep the stain of blood however be nowhere discoverable except on the spot where the body have be find the house itself furnish no particular evidence of the bloody scene of which it have be a witness the bone of those who have die long before be lie on the stone it be true broken and scattered but as the curious be wont to stop and sometimes to enter among and handle these remains of mortality there be nothing new or peculiar in they present condition the interior of the dead-house be obscure and suit in this particular at least to its solemn office while make the latter part of they examination the monk and the two noble who begin to feel a lively interest in the late event stand before the window gaze in at the gloomy but instructive scene one body be so place as to receive a few of the direct ray of the morning light and it be consequently much more conspicuous than the rest though even this be a dark and withered mummy that present scarcely a vestige of the be it have be like all the other whose part still cling together it have be place against the wall in the attitude of one that be seat with the head fall forward the latter circumstance have bring the blacken and shrivel face into the line of light it have the ghastly grin of death the feature be distort by the process of evaporation and be altogether a revolting but salutary monitor of the common lot ` tis the body of the poor vine-dresser remark the monk more accustomed to the spectacle than he companion who have shrink from the sight he unwisely sleep on yonder naked rock and it prove to he the sleep of death there have be many mass for he soul but what be leave of he material remain still lie unclaimed but -- how be this pierre thou hast lately pass this place what be the number of the body at thy last visit three reverend clavier and yet the lady speak of four i look for the fourth when in the building but there appear none fresh except this of poor jacque coli come hither and say if there do not appear to be two in the far corner -- here where the body of thy old comrade the guide be place from respect for he call surely there at least be a change in its position pierre approach and take off he cap in reverence he lean forward in the building so as to exclude the external light from he eye father he say draw back in surprise there be truly another though i overlook it when we enter the place this must be examine into the crime may be greater than we have believe the servant of the convent and pierre whose long service render he a familiar of the brotherhood now re-enter the building while those without impatiently await the result a cry from the interior prepare the latter for some fresh subject of horror when pierre and he companion quickly reappear drag a living man into the open air when the light permit those who know he recognize the mild demeanor the subdue look and the uneasy distrustful glance of balthazar the first sensation of the spectator be that of open amazement but dark suspicion follow the baron the two genoese and the monk have all be witness of the scene in the great square of vévey the person of the headsman have become so well know to they by the passage on the lake and the event just allude to that there be not a moment of doubt touch he identity and couple with the circumstance of that morning there remain little more that the clue be now find to the cause of the murder we shall not stop to relate the particulars of the examination it be short reserve and have the character of a investigation institute more for the sake of form than from any incertitude there could exist on the subject of the fact when the necessary-inquiry be end the two noble mount father xavier lead the way and the whole party proceed towards the summit of the pass lead balthazar a prisoner and leave the body of jacque coli to its final rest in that place where so many human form have evaporate into air before he unless those who have feel a interest in he in life should see fit to claim he remain the ascent between the refuge and the summit of st bernard be much more severe than on any other part of the road the end of the convent overhang the northern brow of the gorge and look like a mass of that ferruginous and melancholy rock which give the whole region so wild and so unearthly a aspect soon become visible carve and mould into the shape of a rude human habitation the last pitch be so steep as to be form into a sort of stair-way up which the groan mule toil with difficulty this labor overcome the party stand on the highest point of the pass another minute bring they to the door of the convent chapter xxv ------ hadst thou not be by a fellow by the hand of nature mark would note and sign have to do a deed of shame this murder have not come into my mind shakspeare the arrival of sigismund 's party at the hospice precede that of the other traveller more than a hour they be receive with the hospitality with which all be then welcome at this celebrated convent the visit of the curious and the vulgar not have blunt the benevolence of the monk who mostly accustom to entertain the low-born and ignorant be always happy to relieve the monotony of they solitude by intercourse with guest of a superior class the good clavier have prepare the way for they reception for even on the wild ridge of st bernard we do not fare the worse for carry with we a prestige of that rank and consideration that be enjoy in the world below although a mild christian-like good-will be manifest to all the heiress of willade a name that be generally know and honor between the alp and the jura meet with those proof of _ empressement _ and deference which betray the secret thought in despite of conventional form and which tell she plainer than the word of welcome that the retire augustine be not sorry to see so fair and so noble a specimen of they species within they dreary wall all this however be lose on sigismund he be too much occupy with the event of the morning to note other thing and first commit adelheid and he sister to the care of they woman he go into the open air in order to await the arrival of the rest as it have be mention the existence of the venerable convent of st bernard date from a very remote period of christianity it stand on the very brow of the precipice which form the last steep ascent in mount to the col the building be a high narrow but vast barrack-looking edifice build of the ferruginous stone of the region have its gable place toward the valai and its front stretch in the direction of the gorge in which it stand immediately before its principal door the rock rise in a ill-shapen hillock across which run the path to italy this be literally the highest point of the pass as the building itself be the most elevated habitable abode in europe at this spot the distance from rock to rock span the gorge may be a hundred yard the wild and reddish pile rise on each side for more than a thousand foot these be merely dwarf however among they sister pile several of which in plain view of the convent reach to the height of eternal snow this point in the road attain the path begin immediately to descend and the dripping of a snow-bank before the convent door which have resist the greatest heat of the past summer run partly into the valley of the rhone and partly into piedmont the water after a long and devious course through the plain of france and italy meeting again in the common basin of the mediterranean the path on quit the convent run between the base of the rock on its right and a little limpid lake on its leave the latter occupy nearly the entire cavity of the valley of the gorge it then disappear between natural palisade of rock at the other extremity of the col this be the point where the superfluous water of the lake find they outlet descend swiftly in a brawl little brook on the sunny side of the alp the frontier of italy be meet on the margin of the lake a long musket-shot from the abode of the augustine and near the site of a temple that the roman have raise in honor of jupiter in he attribute of director of storm such be the outline of the view which present itself to sigismund when he leave the building to while away the time that must necessarily elapse before the arrival of the rest of the party the hour be still early though the great altitude of the site of the convent have bring it beneath the influence of the sun 's ray a hour before he have learn from a servant of the augustine that a number of ordinary traveller of whom in the fine season hundred at a time frequently pass the night in they dormitory be now break they fast in the refectory of the peasant and he be willing to avoid the question that they curiosity might prompt when they come to hear what have occur lower down on the mountain one of the brotherhood be caress four or five enormous mastiff that be leap about and bark with deep throat in front of the convent while old uberto move among they with a gravity and respect that better suit he year perceive he guest the augustine quit the dog and lift he eastern-looking cap he give he the salutation of the morning sigismund meet the frank smile of the canon who like himself be young with a fit return the occasion be such as sigismund desire and a friendly discourse succeed while they pace along the margin of the lake hold the path that lead across the col you be young in you charitable office brother remark the soldier when familiarity be a little established this will be among the first of the winter you will have pass at you benevolent post it will make the eighth as novice and as canon we be early train to this kind of life though no practice will enable any of we to withstand the effect

below the past night so angry that we thank god it be over and that we be leave to share you hospitality be there many on the mountain besides ourselves or do any come up from italy there be none but those who be now in the common refectory and none come from aoste the season for the traveller be over this be a month in which we see only those who be much press and who have they reason for trust the weather in the summer we sometimes lodge a thousand guest they whom ye receive have reason to be thankful reverend augustine for in sooth this do not seem a region that abound in its fruit sigismund and the monk look around at the vast pile of ragged naked rock and they smile as they eye meet nature give literally nothing answer the augustine : even the fuel that warm we be transport league on the back of mule and thou wilt readily conceive that of all other this be a necessary we can not forego happily we have some of we ancient and what be once rich endowment and -- the young canon hesitate to proceed you be about to say father that they who have the means to show gratitude be not always unmindful of the want of those who share the same hospitality without possess the same ability to manifest they respect for the institution the augustine bow and he turn the discourse by point out the frontier of italy and the site of the ancient temple both of which they have this time reach a animal move among the rock and attract they attention can it be a chamoix exclaim sigismund whose blood begin to quicken with a hunter 's eagerness : i would i have arm it be a dog though not of we mountain breed the mastiff of the convent have fail in hospitality and the poor beast have be drive to take refuge in this retired spot in wait for he master who probably make one of the party in the refectory see they come they approach footstep have bring the cautious animal from he cover sigismund see in truth that a party of three pedestrian be quit the convent take the path for italy a sudden and painful suspicion flash upon he mind the dog be nettuno most probably drive by the mastiff as the monk have suggest to seek a shelter in this retreat and one of those who approach by he gait and stature be no other than he master thou knowest father he say with a clammy tongue for he be strangely agitate between reluctance to accuse maso of such a crime and horror at the fate of jacque coli that there have be a murder on the mountain the monk quietly assent one who live on that road and in that age be not easily excite by a event of so frequent occurrence sigismund hastily recount to he companion all the circumstance that be then know to himself and related the manner in which he have first meet the italian on the lake and he general impression concern he character all come and go unquestioned here return the augustine when the other have end we convent have be found in charity and we pray for the sinner without inquire into the amount of he crime still we have authority and it be especially we duty to keep the road clear that we own purpose may not be defeat i leave thee to do what thou judgest most prudent and proper in a matter so delicate sigismund be silent but as the pedestrian be draw near he resolution be soon and sternly form the obligation that he owe to maso make he more prompt for it excite a jealous distrust of he own power to discharge what he conceive to be a duty even those late event in which he sister be so wrong have they share too on the decision of a mind so resolute to be upright place himself in the middle of the path he await the arrival of the party while the monk stand quietly at he side when the traveller be within speak distance the young man first discover that the companion of il maledetto be pippo and conrad they several rencontre have make he sufficiently acquaint with the person of the two latter to enable he to recognize they at a glance and sigismund begin to think the undertaking in which he have embark more grave than he have at first imagine should there be a disposition to resist he be but one against three buon giorno signor capitano cry maso salute with he cap when sufficiently near to

fortune whereas we be more happy in this particular and thou hast be and art still in haste to depart while the discovery of the foul deed be owe to we alone thou must return to the convent that this grave matter may at least be examine il maledetto seem troubled once or twice he glance he eye at the quiet athletic frame of the young man and then turn they on the path in reflection although sigismund narrowly watch the workings of he countenance give a little of he attention also from time to time to the movement of pippo and the pilgrim he preserve himself a perfectly calm exterior firm in he purpose accustom to make extraordinary exertion in he manly exercise and conscious of he great physical force he be not a man to be easily daunt it be true that the companion of maso conduct themselves in a way to excite no additional apprehension on they account for on the announcement of the murder they move away from he person a little as by a natural horror of the hand that could have do the deed they now consult together and profit by they situation behind the back of the italian they make sign to sigismund of they readiness to assist should it be necessary he receive the signal writh satisfaction for though he know they to be knave he sufficiently understand the difference between audacious crime and mere roguery to believe they might in this instance at least prove true

to be a imperious duty : this pilgrim and he friend will be of we party in order that when we quit the mountain all may leave it blameless and unsuspected signor sigismondo the proposal be fair it have a touch of reason i allow but unluckily it do not suit my interest i be engage in a delicate mission and too much time have be already lose by the way to waste more without good cause i have great pity for poor jacque coli -- ha thou knowest the sufferer 's name then thy unlucky tongue have betray thee maso il maledetto be again trouble he feature betray it for he frown like a man who

italian grow livid and he smile with the contempt and hatred of a inveterately angered man assemble all he force he suddenly exert it with the energy and courage of a lion shouting -- nettuno the struggle be short but fierce when it terminate pippo lay bleeding among the rock with a broken head and the pilgrim be gasp near he under the tremendous gripe of the animal maso himself stand firm though pale and frown like one who have collect all he energy both physical and moral to meet this emergency be i a brute to be set upon by the scum of the earth he cry : if thou wouldst aught with I

that strife be afoot nettuno immediately release the pilgrim and stand at bay too faithful to desert he master in he need and yet too conscious of the force oppose to he to court a contest so unequal luckily for the noble dog the friendship of old uberto prove he protection when the younger animal see they patriarch dispose to amity they forbear they attack wait at least for another signal to be give in the mean while maso have time to look about he and to form he decision less under the influence of surprise and feeling than have be previously the case signora he answer since it be you pleasure i will return among the augustine but i ask as simple justice that if i be to be hunt by dog as a beast of prey all who be in the same circumstance as myself may become subject to the same rule this pilgrim and the neapolitan come up the mountain yesterday as well as myself and i demand they arrest until they too can give a account of themselves it will not be the first time that we have be inhabitant of the same prison conrad cross himself in submission neither he nor pippo raise any objection to the step on the contrary each frankly admit it be no more than equitable on its face we be poor traveller on whom many accident have already alight and we may well be press to reach the end of we journey say the pilgrim but that justice may be do we shall submit without a murmur i be load with the sin of many besides my own however and st peter he know that the last be not light this holy canon will see that mass be say in the convent chapel in behalf of those for whom i travel this duty do i be a infant in you hand the good augustine profess the perfect readiness of the fraternity to pray for all who be in necessity with the single proviso that they should be christian with this amicable understanding then the peace be make between they and the party immediately take the path that lead back to the convent on reach the building maso with the two traveller who have be find in he company be lace in safe keep in one of the of the solid edifice until the return of the clavier should enable they to vindicate they innocence satisfy with himself for the part he have act in the late affair sigismund stroll into the chapel where at that early hour some of the brother hood be always occupy in say mass in behalf of the soul of the living or of the dead he be here when he receive a note from the signor grimaldus apprize he of the arrest of he father and of the dark suspicion that be so naturally connect with the transaction it be unnecessary to dwell on the nature of the shock he receive from this intelligence after a few moment of bitter anguish he perceive the urgency of make he sister acquaint with the truth as speedily as possible the arrival of the party from the refuge be expect every moment and by delay he increase the risk of christine 's hear the appalling fact from some other quarter he seek a audience therefore with adelheid the instant he have summon sufficient self-command to undertake the duty mademoiselle de willading be strike with the pale brow and agitate air of the young soldier at the first glance of she eye thou hast permit this unexpected blow to affect thee unusually sigismund she say smile and offer she hand for she feel that the circumstance be those in which cold and heartless form should give place to feeling and sincerity thy sister be tranquil if not happy she do not know the worst -- she have yet to learn the most cruel part of the truth adelheid they have find one conceal among the dead of the bone-house and be now lead he here as the murderer of poor jacque coli another say adelheid turn pale in alarm we appear to be surround by assassin no it can not be true i know my poor father 's mildness of disposition too well he habitual tenderness to all around he he horror at the sight of blood even for he odious task sigismund thy father the young man groan conceal he face with he hand he sink into a seat the fearful truth with all its cause and consequence begin to dawn upon adelheid sinking upon a chair herself she sit long look at the convulse and work frame of sigismund in silent horror it appear to she that providence for some great but secret purpose be dispose to visit they all with more than a double amount of its anger and that a family which have be accurse for so many generation be about to fill the measure of its woe still she own true heart do not change on the contrary its long-cherished and secret purpose rather grow stronger under this sudden appeal to its generous and noble property and never be the resolution to devote herself she life and all she envied hope to the solace of he unmerited wrong so strong and rivet as at that try moment in a little time sigismund regain enough self-command to be able to commence the narrative of what have pass they then concerted together the best means to make christine acquaint with that which it be absolutely necessary she should now know tell she the simple truth add sigismund ` it can not long be conceal and it be better that she know it but tell she also my firm dependence on we father 's innocence god for one of those inscrutable purpose which set human intelligence at defiance have make he a common executioner but the curse have not extend to he nature trust I dearest adelheid a more gentle dove-like nature do not exist in man than that of the poor balthazar -- the despise and persecute balthazar i have hear my mother dwell upon the night of anguish and suffering that have precede the day on which the duty of he office be to be discharge and often have i hear that admirable woman whose spirit be far more equal to support we unmerited fortune declare she have often pray that he and all that be hers might die so that they die innocently rather than one of a temper so gentle and harmless should again be bring to endure the agony she have witness it be unhappy that he should be here at so luckless a moment what unhappy motive can have lead thy father to this spot at a time so extra ordinary christine will tell thee that she expect to see he at the convent we be a race proscribe mademoiselle de willading but we be human dearest sigismund -- i feel my injustice and can only pray to be forgive but there be moment of feeling so intense that i be ready to believe and treat all of my species as common enemy christine be a only daughter and thou thyself beloved adelheid kind dutiful and good as i know thee to be art not more dear to the baron de willading than my poor sister be among we she parent have yield she to thy generous kindness for they believe it for she good but they heart have be wring by the separation thou didst not know it but christine take she last embrace of she mother here on the mountain at lidde and it be then agree that she father should watch she in safety over the col and bestow the final blessing at aoste mademoiselle de willading you move in pride surround by many protector who be honor in do you service but the abased and the hunt must indulge even they best affection stealthily and without obtrusion the love and tenderness of balthazar would pass for mockery with the vulgar such be man in he habit and opinion when wrong usurp the place of right adelheid saw that the moment be not favorable for urge consolation and she abstain from a reply she rejoice however to hear the presence of the headsman so satisfactorily account for though she could not quiet herself from a apprehension that the universal weakness of human nature which so suddenly permit the perversion of the best of we passion to the worst and the dreadful probability that balthazar suffering intensely by this compel separation from he daughter on accidentally encounter the man who be its cause might have listen to some violent impulse of resentment and revenge she see also that sigismund in despite of he general confidence in the principle of he father have fearful glimmering of some such event and that he fearfully anticipate the worst even while he most profess confidence in the innocence of the accuse the interview be soon end and they separate each endeavor to invent plausible reason for what have happen the arrival of the party from the refuge take place soon afterwards it be follow by the necessary explanation and a more detailed narrative of all that have pass a consultation be hold between the chief of the brotherhood and the two old noble and the course it be most expedient to pursue be calmly and prudently discuss the result be not know for some hour later it be then generally proclaim in the convent that a grave and legal investigation of all the fact be to take place with the least possible delay the col of st bernard as have be state already lie within the limit of the present canton but what then the ally state of the valai the crime have consequently be commit within the jurisdiction of that country but as the valai be thus league with switzerland there exist such a intimate understanding between the two that it be rare any grave proceedings be have against a citizen of either in the dominion of the other without pay great deference to the feeling and the rights of the country of the accuse messenger be therefore dispatch to vévey to inform the authority of that place of a transaction which involve the safety of a officer of the great canton -lrb- for such be balthazar -rrb- and which have cost a citizen of vaud he life on the other hand a similar communication be send to sion the two place be about equidistant from the convent with such press invitation to the authority to be prompt as be deem necessary to bring on a immediate investigation melchior de willading in a letter to he friend the bailiff set forth the inconvenience of he return with adelheid at that late season and the importance of the functionary 's testimony with such other statement as be likely to effect he wish while the superior of the brotherhood charge himself with make representation with a similar intent to the head of he own republic justice in that age be not administer as frankly and openly as in this later period its agent in the old world exercise even now a discretion that we be not accustom to see confide to they she proceedings be envelop in darkness the blind deity be far more know in she decree than in she principle and mystery be then deem a important auxiliary of power with this brief explanation we shall shift the time to the third day from that on which the traveller reach the convent refer the reader to the succeed chapter for a account of what it bring forth chapter xxvi anon a figure enter quaintly neat all pride and business bustle and conceit with look unalter would by these scene of woe with speed that ent ` ring speak he haste to go he bid the gaze throng around he fly and carry fate and physic in he eye crabbe there be another receptacle for those who die on the great st bernard hard by the convent itself at the close of the time mention in the last chapter and near the approach of night sigismund be pacing the rock on which this little chapel stand bury in reflection to which he own history and the recent event have give birth the snow that fall during the late storm have entirely disappear and the frozen element be now visible only on those airy pinnacle that form the higher peak of the alp twilight have already settle into the lower valley but the whole of the superior region be glowing with the fairy-like lustre of the last ray of the sun the air be chill for at that hour and season whatever might be the state of the weather the evening invariably bring with it a positive sensation of cold in the gorge of st bernard where frost prevail at night even in midsummer still the wind though strong be balmy and soft blow athwart the heated plain of lombardy and reach the mountain charge with the moisture of the adriatic and the mediterranean as the young man turn in he walk and face this breeze it come over he spirit with a feeling of hope and home the greater part of he life have be past in the sunny country whence it blow and there be moment when he be lull into forgetfulness by the grateful recollection impart by its fragrance but when compel to turn northward again and he eye fall on the misty hoary pile that distinguish he native land rude and ragged face of rock frozen glacier and deep ravine-like valley and glen seem to he to be type of he own stormy unprofitable and fruitless life and to foretell a career which though it might have touch of grandeur be doom to be barren of all that be genial and consolatory all in and about the convent be still the mountain have a impose air of deep solitude amid the wildest natural magnificence few traveller have pass since the storm and luckily for those who under the peculiar circumstance in which they be place so much desire privacy all of these have diligently go they several way none be leave therefore on the col but those who have a interest in the serious investigation which be about to take place a officer of justice from sion wear the livery of the valai appear at a window a sign that the regular authority of the country have take cognizance of the murder but disappear the young man to all external appearance be leave in the solitary possession of the pass even the dog have be kennel and the pious monk be healthfully occupy in the religious office of the vespers sigismund turn he eye upward to the apartment in which adelheid and he sister dwelt but as the solemn moment in which so much be to be decide draw nearer they also have withdraw into themselves cease to hold communion even by means of the eye with aught that might divert they holy and pure thought from ceaseless and intense devotional reflection until now he have be occasionally favor with a answering and kind look from one or the other of these single hearted and affectionate girl both of whom he so warmly love though with sentiment so different it seem that they too have at last leave he to he isolate and hopeless existence sensible that this pass thought be weak and unmanly the young man renew he walk and instead of turn as before he move slowly on stop only when he have reach the opening of the little chapel of the dead unlike the building lower down the path the bone-house at the convent be divide into two apartment the exterior and one that may be call the interior though both be open to the weather the former contain pile of disjointed human bone bleached by the storm that beat in at the window while the latter be consecrate to the covering of those that still preserve in they outward appearance at least some of the more familiar trace of humanity the first have its usual complement of dissevered and confound fragment in which the remains of young and old of the two sex the fierce and the meek the penitent and the sinner lay in indiscriminate confusion -- a eloquent reproach to the pride of man while the wall of the last support some twenty blacken and shrivel effigy of the race to show to what a pass of disgusting and frightful deformity the human form can be reduce when deprive of that noble principle which liken it to its divine creator on a table in the center of a group of black and grinning companion in misfortune sit all that be leave of jacque coli who have be remove from the bone-house below to this at the convent for purpose connect with the come investigation the body be accidentally place in such a attitude that the face be bring within the line of the parting light while it have no other cover than the clothes worn by the murder man in life sigismund gaze long at the pallid lineament they be still distort with the agony produce by separate the soul from the body all feeling of resentment for he sister 's wrong be lose in pity for the fate that have so suddenly overtake one in whom the passion the interest and the complicated machinery of this state of be be so actively at work then come the bitter apprehension that he own father in a moment of ungovernable anger excite by the accumulate wrong that bear so hard on he and he might really have be the instrument of effect the fearful and sudden change sicken with the think the young man turn and walk away towards the brow of the declivity voice ascend to he ear recall he to the actual situation of thing a train of mule be climb the last acclivity where the path take the broken precipitous appearance of a flight of step the light be still sufficient to distinguish the form and general appearance of the traveller sigismund immediately recognize they to be the bailiff of vévey and he attendant for whose arrival the formal proceedings of the examination have alone be stay a fair evening herr sigismund and a happy meeting cry peterchen so soon as he weary mule which frequently halt under its unwieldy burthen have bring he within hear little do i think to see thee again so quickly and less still to lay eye on this holy convent for though the traveller might have return in thy person nothing short of a miracle -- here the bailiff wink for he be one of those protestant whose faith be most manifest in these side-hit at the opinion and practice of rome -- nothing but a miracle i say and that too a miracle of some saint whose bone have be dry these ten thousand year until every morsel of we weak flesh have fairly disappear could bring down old st bernard 's abode upon the shore of the leman i have know many who have leave vaud to cross the alp come back and winter in vévey but never do i know the stone that be place upon another in a workman-like manner quit its bed without help from the hand of man they say stone be particularly hard-hearted and yet you saint and miracle-monger have a way to move they peterchen chuckle at he own pleasantry as man in authority be apt to enjoy that which come exclusively of they own cleverness and he wink round among he follower as if he would invite they to bear witness to the rap he have give the papist even on they own exclusive ground when the platform of the col be attain he check the mule and continue he address for want of wind have nip he wit as it might be in the bud a bad business this herr sigismund a thoroughly bad affair it have draw I far from home at a ticklish season and it have unexpectedly stop the herr von willading -lrb- he speak in german -rrb- in he journey over the mountain and that too at a moment when all have need be diligent among the alp how do the keen air of the col agree with the fair adelheid god be thank herr bailiff in bodily health that excellent young lady be never better god be thank right truly she be a tender flower and one that might be suddenly cut off by the frost of st bernard and the noble genoese who travel with so much modest simplicity in a way to reprove the vain and idle -- i hope he do not miss the sun among we rock he be a italian and must think of we and we climate accord to he habit though in the way of health he seem at he ease well this be consolatory herr sigismund be the truth know rejoin peterchen bend as far forward on he mule as a certain protuberance of he body would permit and then suddenly draw himself up again in reserve -- but a state secret be a state secret and least of all should it escape one who be truly and legitimately a child of the state my love and friendship for melchior von willading be great and of right excellent quality but i should not have visit this pass be it not to do honor to we guest the genoese i would not that the noble stranger go down from we hill with a unsavory opinion of we hospitality have the honorable châtelain from sion reach the hill he have be among we since the turn of the day mein herr and be now in conference with those you have just name on matter connect with the object of you common visit he be a honest magistrate and like ourselves master sigismund he come of the pure german root which be a foundation to support merit though it might better be say by another have he a comfortable ride i have hear no complaint of he ascent ` tis well when the magistrate go forth to do justice he have a right to look for a fair time all be then comfortable -- the noble genoese the honorable melchior and the worthy châtelain -- and jacque coli you know he unhappy fate herr bailiff return sigismund briefly for he be a little vexed with the other 's phlegm in a matter that so nearly touch he own feeling if i do not know it herr steinbach dost think i should now be here instead of prepare for a warm bed near the great square of vévey poor jacque coli well he do the ceremony of the abbaye a ill turn in refuse to buckle with the headsman 's daughter but i do not know that he at all deserve the fate with which he have meet god forbid that any who be hurt and that perhaps not without reason by he want of faith should think he weakness merit a punishment so heavy thou speakest like a sensible youth a very sensible youth -- ay and like a christian herr sigismund answer peterchen and i approve of thy word to refuse to wive a maiden and to be murder be very different offence and should not be confound dost think these augustine keep kirschwasser among they store it be strong work to climb up to they abode and strong toil need strong drink well should they not be so provide we must make the best of they other liquor herr sigismund do I the favor to lend I thy arm the bailiff now alight with stiffened limb and take the arm of the other he move slowly toward the building it be damnable to bear malice and doubly damnable to bear malice against the dead therefore i beg you to take notice that i have quite forget the recent conduct of the decease in the matter of we public game as it become a impartial and upright judge to do poor jacque coli ah death be awful at any time but it be tenfold terrible to die in this sudden manner posthaste as it be and that too on a path where we put one foot before the other with so much bodily pain this be the ninth visit i have make the augustine and i can not flatter the holy monk on the subject of they road much as i wish they well be the reverend clavier back at he post again he be and have be active in take the usual examination activity be he strong property and he need be that herr steinbach who passeth the life of a mountaineer the noble genoese and my ancient friend melchior and he fair daughter the beautiful adelheid and the equitable châtelain thou sayest be all fairly repose and comfortable herr bailiff they have reason to thank god that the late storm and they mental trouble have do they no harm so -- i would these augustine keep kirschwasser among they liquor peterchen enter the convent where he presence alone be want to proceed to business the mule be house the guide receive as usual in the building and then the preparation for the long-delayed examination be seriously commence it have already be mention that the fraternity of st bernard be of very ancient origin it be found in the year 962 by bernard de menthon a augustine canon of aoste in piedmont for the double purpose of bodily succor and spiritual consolation the idea of establish a religious community in the midst of savage rock and at the highest point trod by the foot of a man be worthy of christian self-denial and a benevolent philanthropy the experiment appear to have succeed in a degree that be commensurate with its noble intention for century have go by civilization have undergo a thousand change empire have be form and upturned throne destroy and one-half the world have be rescue from barbarism while this piously-founded edifice still remain in its simple and respectable usefulness where it be first erect the refuge of the traveller and a shelter for the poor the convent building be necessarily vast but as all its other material have to be transport to the place it occupy on the back of mule they be construct chiefly of the ferruginous hoary-looking stone that be quarry from the native rock the cell of the monk the long corridor refectory for the different class of traveller and suit to the number of the guest as well as those for the canon and they servant and lodge room of different degree of magnitude and convenience with a chapel of some antiquity and of proper size compose then as now the internal arrangement there be no luxury some comfort in behalf of those in whom indulgence have become a habit and much of the frugal hospitality that be address to the personal want and the decency of life beyond this the build the entertainment and the brotherhood be mark by a severe monastic self-denial which appear to have receive a character of barren and stern simplicity from the unvarying nakedness of all that meet the eye in that region of frost and sterility we shall not stop to say much of the little courtesy and the ceremonious asseveration of mutual good-will and respect that pass between the bailiff of vévey and the prior of st bernard on the occasion of they present meeting peterchen be know to the brotherhood and though a protestant and one too that do not forbear to deliver he jest or he witticism against rome and its flock at will he be sufficiently well esteem in all the quêtes or collection of the convent the well-meaning bernoi have really show himself a man of bowels and one that be dispose to favor humanity even while it help the cause of he arch enemy the pope the clavier be always well receive not only in he bailiwick but in he château and in spite of numberless little skirmish on doctrine and practice they always meet with a welcome and generally part in peace this feeling of amity and good-will extend to the superior and to all the other of the holy community for in addition to a certain heartiness of character in the bailiff there be mutual interest to maintain it at the period of which we write the vast possession with which the monk of st bernard have formerly be endow be already much reduce by sequestration in different country that of savoy in particular and they be reduce then as now to seek supplies to meet the constant demand of traveller in the liberality of the well-disposed and charitable and the liberality of peterchen be think to be cheaply purchase by he joke while on the other hand he have so many occasion either in he own person or those of he friend to visit the convent that he always forbear to push contention to a quarrel welcome again herr bailiff and for the ninth time welcome continue the prior as he take the hand of peterchen lead the way to he own private parlor thou art always a welcome guest on the mountain for we know that we entertain at least a friend and a heretic add peterchen laughing with all he might though he utter a joke which he now repeat for the ninth time we have meet often herr prior and i hope we shall meet finally after all we clambering of mountain as well as we clamber after worldly benefit be end and that where honest man come together in spite of pope or luther book sermon ave or devil this thought cheer I whenever i offer thee my hand shake that of the other with a hearty good-will for i should not like to think father michael that when we set out on the last long journey we be to travel for ever in different way thou may ` st tarry awhile if thou seest fit in thy purgatory which be a lodging of thine own invention and should therefore suit thee but i trust to continue on until fairly house in heaven miserable and unhappy sinner that i be peterchen speak in the confident voice of one accustomed to utter he sentiment to inferior who either dare not or do not deem it wise to dispute he oracle and he end with another deep-mouthed laugh that fill the vaulted apartment of the smile prior to the ceiling father michael take all in good part answering as be he wont in mildness and good-tempered charity for he be a priest of much learning deep reflection and rebuke opinion the community over which he preside be so far worldly in its object as to keep the canon in constant communion with man and he would not now have meet for the first time one of those self-satisfied authoritative boisterous well-meaning being of whose class peterchen form so conspicuous a member have this be the first of the bailiff 's visit to the col as it be however the prior not only understand the species but he well know the individual specimen and he be well enough disposed to humor the noisy pleasantry of he companion disburthen of he superfluous clothing deliver of he introductory joke and have achieve he salutation to the several canon with suitable word of recognition to the three or four novice who be usually find on the mountain peterchen declare he readiness to enter on the duty of what the french call restoration this want have be foresee and the prior lead the way to a private refectory where preparation have be make for a sufficient supper the bailiff be very generally know to be a huge feeder thou wilt not fare as well as in thy warm and cheerful town of vévey which outdo most of italy in its pleasantness and fruit but thou shalt at least drink of thine own warm wine observe the superior as they go along the corridor and a right goodly company await thee to share hot only thy repast but thy good companionship hast ever a drop of kirschwasser brother michael in thy convent we have not only that but we have the baron de willading and a noble genoese who be in he company they be ready to set to the moment they can see thy face a noble genoese a italian gentleman of a certainty i think they call he a genoese peterchen stop lay a finger on he nose and look mysterious but he forbore to speak for by the open simple countenance of the monk he see that the other have no suspicion of he meaning i will hazard my office of bailiff against that of thy worthy clavier that he be just what he seemeth -- that be to say a genoese the risk will not be great for so he have already announce himself we ask no question here and be he who or what he may he be welcome to come and welcome to depart in peace ay this be well enough for a augustine on the top of the alp -- he have attendant a menial and a friend the latter however leave the convent for italy when the noble genoese determine to remain until this inquiry be over there be something say of heavy affair which require that some explanation of the delay should be send to other peterchen again look steadily at the prior smile as in pity of he ignorance look thou good prior much as i love thee and thy convent and melchior von willading and he daughter i would have spare myself this journey but for that same genoese let there be no question however between we : the proper time to speak will come and god forbid that i should be precipitate thou shalt then see in what manner a bailiff of the great canton can acquit himself at present we will trust to thy prudence the friend have go to italy in haste that the delay may not create surprise well each one to he humor on the highway : it be mine to journey in honor and security though other may have a different taste let there be little say good michael : not so much as a imprudent look of the eye -- and now o ' heaven 's sake thy glass of kirschwasser they be at the door of the refectory and the conversation cease on enter peterchen find he friend the baron the signor grimaldus and the châtelain of sion a grave ponderous dignitary of justice of german extraction like himself and the prior but whose race from a long residence on the confines of italy have imbibe some peculiarity of the southern character sigismund and all the rest of the traveller be preclude from join the repast to which it be the intention of the prudent canon to give a semi-official character the meeting between peterchen and those who have so lately quit vévey be not distinguish by any extraordinary movement of courtesy but that between the bailiff and the châtelain who represent the authority of friendly and adjoining state be mark by a profusion of politic and diplomatic civility various personal and public inquiry be exchange each appear to strive to outdo the other in manifest interest in the smallest detail on those point in which it be proper for a stranger to feel a interest though the distance between the two capital be fully fifteen league every foot of the ground be travel over by one or the other of the party either in commendation of its beauty or in question that touch its interest we come equally of teutonic father herr châtelain conclude the bailiff as the whole party place themselves at table after the reverence and homage be thoroughly exhaust though providence have cast we fortune in different country i swear to thee that the sound of thy german be music to my ear thou hast wonderfully escape corruption though compel to consort so much with the bastard of roman celt and burgundian of whom thou hast so many in this portion of thy state it be curious to observe -- for peterchen have a little of a antiquarian flavor among the other crude element of he character -- that whenever a much-trodden path traverse a country its people catch the blood as well as the opinion of those who travel it after the manner that tare be scatter and sow by the pass wind here have the st bernard be a thoroughfare since the time of the roman and thou wilt find as many race among those who dwell on the way-side as there be village between the convent and vévey it be not so with you of the upper valai herr châtelain there the pure race exist as it come from the other side of the rhine and honor and preserve may it continue for another thousand year there be few people so debased in they own opinion as not to be proud of they peculiar origin and character the habit of always view ourselves we motive and even we conduct on the favorable side be the parent of self-esteem and this weakness carry into community commonly get to be the cause of a somewhat fallacious gauge of merit among the population of entire country the châtelain melchior de willading and the prior all of whom come from the same teutonic root receive the remark complacently for each feel it a honor to be descend from such ancestor while the more polished and artificial italian succeed in conceal the smile that on such a occasion would be apt to play about the mouth of a man whose parentage run through a long line of sophisticated and politic noble into the consul and patrician of rome and most probably through these again into the wily and ingenious greek a root distinguish for civilization when these patriarch of the north lay bury in the depths of barbarism this little display of national vanity end the discourse take a more general turn nothing occur during the entertainment however to denote that any of the company bethink he of the business on which they have meet but just as twilight foiled and the repast be end the prior invite he guest to lend they attention to the matter in hand recall they from they friendly attack they time-worn joke and they attenuate logic in all of which peterchen melchior and the châtelain have indulge with some freedom to a question involve the life or death of at least one of they fellow-creature the subordinate of the convent be occupy during the supper with the arrangement that have be previously command and when father michael arise and intimate to he companion that they presence be now expect elsewhere he lead they to a place that have be completely prepare for they reception chapter xxvii be ever tale with such a gallant modesty rehearse home purpose of convenience as well as other that be naturally connect with the religious opinion not to say the superstition of most of the prisoner have induce the monk to select the chapel of the convent for the judgment-hall this consecrate part of the edifice be of sufficient size to contain all who be accustom to assemble within its wall it be decorate in the manner that be usual to church of the romish persuasion have its master-altar and two of smaller size that be dedicate to esteem saint a large lamp illuminate the place though the great altar lay in doubtful light leave play for the imagination to people and adorn that part of the chapel within the railing of the choir there stand a table : it hold some object that be conceal from view by a sweeping pall immediately beneath the lamp be place another which serve the purpose of the clavier who act as a clerk on this occasion they who be to fill the office of judge take they station near a knot of female be cluster within the shadow of one of the side-altars hover around each other in the way that they sensitive sex be know to interpose between the exhibition of its peculiar weakness and the rude observation of the world stifle sob and convulsive movement occasionally escape this little group of acutely feel and warm-hearted being betray the strength of the emotion they would fain conceal the canon and novice be range on one side the guide and muleteer form a back-ground to the whole while the fine form of sigismund stand stern and motionless as a statue on the step of the altar which be opposite to the female he watch the minutest proceeding of the investigation with a steadiness that be the result of severe practice in self-command and a jealous determination to suffer no new wrong to be accumulate on the head of he father when the little confusion produce by the entrance of the party from the refectory have subside the prior make a signal to one of the officer of justice the man disappear and shortly return with one of the prisoner the investigation be intend to embrace the case of all who have be detain by the prudence of the monk balthazar -lrb- for it be he -rrb- approach the table in he usual meek manner he limb be unbound and he exterior calm though the quick unquiet movement of he eye and the workings of he pale feature whenever a suppress sob from among the female reach he ear betray the inward struggle he have to maintain in order to preserve appearance when he be confront with he examiner father michael bow to the châtelain for though the other be admit by courtesy to participate in the investigation the right to proceed in a affair of this nature within the limit of the valai belong to this functionary alone thou art call balthazar abruptly commence the judge glancing at he note the answer be a simple inclination of the body and thou art the headsman of the canton of berne a similar silent reply be give the office be hereditary in thy family it have be so for age balthazar erect he frame breathing heavily like one oppress at the heart but who would bear down he feeling before he answer herr châtelain he say with energy by the judgment of god it have be so honest balthazar thou throwest too much emphasis into thy word interpose the bailiff all that belong to authority be honorable and be not to be treat as a evil hereditary claim when venerable by time and use have a double estimation with the world since it bring the merit of the ancestor to sustain that of the descendant we have we rights of the bürgerschaft and thou thy rights of execution the time have be when thy father be well content with they privilege balthazar bow in submission but he seem to think any other reply unnecessary the finger of sigismund writhe on the hilt of he sword and a groan which the young man well know have be wrest from the bosom of he mother come from the woman the remark of the worthy and honorable bailiff be just resume the valaisan all that be of the state be for the good of the state and all that be for the comfort and security of man be honorable be not ashamed therefore of thy office balthazar which be necessary be not to be idly condemn but answer faithfully and with truth to the question i be about to put -- thou hast a daughter in that much at least have i be bless the energy with which he speak cause a sudden movement in the judge they look at each other in surprise for it be apparent they do not expect these touch of human feeling in a man who live as it be in constant warfare with he fellow-creature thou hast reason return the châtelain recover he gravity for she be say to be both dutiful and comely thou wert about to marry this daughter balthazar acknowledge the truth of this by another inclination didst thou ever know a vévaisan of the name of jacque coli mein herr i do he be to have become my son the châtelain be again surprise for the steadiness of the reply denote innocence and he study the countenance of the prisoner intently he find apparent frankness where he have expect to meet with subterfuge and like all who have great acquaintance with crime he distrust increase the simplicity of one who really have nothing to conceal unlike that appearance of firmness which be assume to affect innocence set he shrewdness at fault though familiar with most of he expedient of the guilty this jacque coli be to have wive thy daughter continue the châtelain grow more wary as he think he detect greater evidence of art in the accuse it be so understand between we do he love thy child the muscle of balthazar 's mouth play convulsively the twitching of the lip seem to threaten a loss of self-command mein herr i believe it yet he refuse to fulfil the engagement he do even marguerite be alarm at the deep emphasis with which this answer be give and for the first time in she life she tremble lest the accumulate load of obloquy have indeed be too strong for she husband 's principle thou feel anger at he conduct and at the public manner in which he disgrace thee and thine herr châtelain i be human when jacque coli repudiate my daughter he bruise a tender plant in the girl and he cause bitterness in a father 's heart thou hast receive instruction superior to thy condition balthazar we be a race of executioner but we be not the unnurtured herd that people fancy ` tis the will of berne that make I what i be and no desire nor want of my own the charge be honorable as be all that come of the state repeat the other with the formal readiness in which set phrase be utter the charge be honorable for one of thy birth god assign to each he station on earth and he have fix thy duty when jacque coli refuse thy daughter he leave he country to escape thy revenge be jacque coli live he would not utter so foul a lie i know he honest and upright nature exclaim marguerite with energy god pardon I that i ever doubt it the judge turn inquisitive glance towards indistinct cluster of female but the examination do not the less proceed thou knowest then that jacque coli be dead how can i doubt it mein herr when i see he bleeding body balthazar thou seemest dispose to aid the examination though with what view be better know to he who see the inmost heart than to I i will come at once therefore to the most essential fact thou art a native and a resident of berne the headsman of the canton -- a creditable office in itself though the ignorance and prejudice of man be not apt so to consider it thou wouldst have marry thy daughter with a substantial peasant of vaud the intended bridegroom repudiate thy child in face of the thousand who come to vévey to witness the festivity of the abbaye he depart on a journey to avoid thee or he own feeling or rumor or what thou wilt he meet he death by murder on this mountain he body be discover with the knife in the recent wound and thou who shouldst have be on thy path homeward be find pass the night near the murder man thine own reason will show thee the connexion which we be lead to form between these several event and thou art now require to explain that which to we seem so suspicious but which to thyself may be clear speak freely but speak truth as thou reverest god and in thine own interest balthazar hesitate and appear to collect he thought he head be lower in a thoughtful attitude and then look he examiner steadily in the face he reply he manner be calm and the tone in which he speak if not that of one innocent in fact be that of one who well know how to assume the exterior of that character herr châtelain he say i have foresee the suspicion that would be apt to fasten on I in these unhappy circumstance but use to trust in providence i shall speak the truth without fear of the intention of jacque coli to depart i know nothing he go he way privately and if you will do I the justice to reflect a little it will be see that i be the last man to whom he would have be likely to let he intention be know i come up the st bernard draw by a chain that you own heart will own be difficult to break if you be a father my daughter be on the road to italy with kind and true friend who be not ashamed to feel for a headsman 's child and who take she in order to heal the wound that have be so unfeelingly inflict this be true exclaim the baron de willading balthazar surely say naught but truth here this be know and allow crime be not always the result of cool determination but it come of terror of sudden think the angry mood the dire temptation and a fair occasion though thou leave ` st vévey ignorant of jacque coli ' departure didst thou hear nothing of he movement by the way balthazar change color there be evidently a struggle in he bosom as if he shrink from make a acknowledgment that might militate against he interest but glance a eye at the guide he recover he proper tone of mind and answer firmly : i do pierre dumont have hear the tale of my child 's disgrace and ignorant that i be the injured parent he tell I of the manner in which the unhappy man have retreat from the mockery of he companion i know therefore that we be on the same path and yet thou perseveredst in what herr châtelain be i to desert my daughter because one who have already prove false to she stand in my way thou hast well answer balthazar interrupted marguerite thou hast answer as become thee we be few and we be all to each other thou wert not to forget we child because it pleased other to despise she the signor grimaldus bent towards the valaisan and whisper near he ear this have the air of nature he observe and do it not account for the appearance of the father on the road take by the murder man we do not question the probability or justness of such a motive signora but revenge may have suddenly mount to the height of ferocity in some wrangle : one accustom to blood yield easily to he passion and he habit the truth of these suggestion be plausible and the noble genoese draw back in cold disappointment the châtelain consult with those about he and then desire the wife to come forth in order to be confront with she husband marguerite obey she movement be slow and she whole manner that of one who yield to a stern necessity thou art the headsman 's wife and a headsman 's daughter marguerite be a well-disposed and a sensible woman put in peterchen she understand that a office under the state can never bring disgrace in the eye of reason and wish no part of she history or origin to be conceal the glance that flash from the eye of balthazar 's wife be wither but the dogmatic bailiff be by far too well satisfy with he own wisdom to be conscious of its effect and a headsman 's daughter continue the examine judge why art thou here because i be a wife and a mother as the latter i come upon the mountain and as a wife i have mount to the convent to be present at this examination they will have it that there be blood upon the hand of balthazar and i be here to repel the lie and yet thou hast not be slow to confess thy connexion with a race of executioner -- they who be accustom to see they fellow die might have less warmth in meet a plain inquiry of justice herr châtelain thy meaning be understand we have be weigh upon heavily by providence but until now they whom we have be make to serve have have the policy to treat we with fair word thou hast speak of blood that which have be shed by balthazar by he and by mine lie on the conscience of those who command it to be spill the unwilling instrument of thy justice be innocent before god this be strange language for people of thy employment dost thou too balthazar speak and think with thy consort in this matter nature have give we man sterner feeling mein herr i be bear to the office i hold teach to believe it right if not honorable and i have struggle hard to do its duty without murmur the case be different with poor marguerite she be a mother and live in she child she have see one that be near she heart publicly scorn and she feel like a mother and thou who art a father what have be thy manner of think under this insult balthazar be meek by nature and as he have just say he have be train to the exercise of he function but he be capable of profound affection the question touch he in a sensitive spot and he writhe under he feeling but accustom to command himself before the public eye and alive to the pride of manhood he mighty effort to suppress the agony that load he heart be reward with success sorrow for my unoffending child sorrow for he who have forget he faith and sorrow for they who have be at the root of this bitter wrong be the answer this man have be accustom to hear forgiveness preach to the criminal and he turn he schooling to good account whisper the wary judge to those near he we must try he guilt by other means he may be readier in reply than steady in he nerve sign to the assistant the valaisan now quietly await the effect of a new experiment the pall be remove and the body of jacque coli expose he be seat as in life on the table in front of the grand altar the innocent have no dread of those whose spirit have desert the flesh continue the châtelain but god often sorely prick the conscience of the guilty when they be make to see the work of they own cruel hand approach and look upon the dead balthazar thou and thy wife that we may judge of the manner in which ye face the murder and wrong man a more fruitless experiment could not well have be attempt with one of the headsman 's office for long familiarity with such sight have take off that edge of horror which the less accustomed would be apt to feel whether it be owe to this circumstance or to he innocence balthazar walk to the side of the body unshaken and stand long regard the bloodless feature with unmoved tranquillity he habit be quiet and meek and little give to display the feeling which crowd he mind therefore do not escape he in word though a gleam of something like regret cross he face not so with he companion marguerite take the hand of the dead man and hot tear begin to follow each other down she cheek as she gaze at he shrunken and altered lineament poor jacque coli she say in a manner to be hear by all present thou hadst thy fault like all bear of woman but thou didst not merit this little do the mother that bear thee and who live in thy infant smile -- she who fondle thee on she knee and cherish thee in she bosom foresee thy fearful and sudden end it be happy for she that she never know the fruit of all she

mein herr none could hate thee innocent and abused child murmur the signor grimaldus you forget that i be balthazar 's daughter mein herr none of we race be view with favor thou at least must be a exception leave this aside continue the châtelain i would know if thy parent show resentment at the misconduct of thy betroth whether aught be say in thy presence that can throw light on this unhappy affair the officer of the valai turn he head aside for he meet the surprised and displeased glance of the genoese whose eye express a gentleman 's opinion at hear a child thus question in a matter that so nearly touch she father 's life but the look and the improper character of the examination escape the notice of christine she rely with filial confidence on the innocence of the author of she being and so far from be shock she rejoice with the simplicity and confidence of the undesigning at be permit to say anything that might vindicate he in the eye of he judge herr châtelain she answer eagerly the blood that have mount to she cheek from female weakness deepen to and warm she very temple with a holier sentiment : herr châtelain we weep together when alone we pray for we enemy as for ourselves but naught be say to the prejudice of poor jacque -- no not a whisper weep and pray repeat the judge look from the child to the father in the manner of a man that fancy he do not hear aright i say both mein herr if the former be a weakness the latter be a duty this be strange language in the mouth of a leadsman 's child christine appear at a loss for a moment to comprehend he meaning but

you may condemn we to do you office and to bear you dislike but you can not rob we of we trust in the justice of heaven in that at least we be the equal of the proudest baron in the canton the examination have better rest here say the prior advance with glisten eye to interpose between the maiden and she interrogator thou knowest herr bourrit that we have other prisoner the châtelain who feel he own practiced obduracy of feeling strangely give way before the innocent and guileless faith of christine be not unwilling himself to change the direction of the inquiry the family of balthazar be direct to retire and the attendant be command to bring forward pippo and conrad chapter xxviii and when thou thus shalt stand implead at the high tribunal of hoodwink would justice who shall tell thy audit cotton the buffoon and the pilgrim though of a general appearance likely to excite distrust present themselves with the confidence and composure of innocence they examination be short for the account they give of they movement be clear and connected circumstance that be know to the monk too greatly aid in produce a conviction that they could have have no agency in the murder they have leave the valley below some hour before the arrival of jacque coli and they reach the convent weary and foot-sore as be usual with all who ascend that long and toilsome path shortly after the commencement of the storm measure have be take by the local authority during the time lose in wait the arrival of the bailiff and the châtelain to ascertain all the minute fact which it be suppose would be useful in ferret out the truth and the result of these inquiry have also be favorable to these itinerant whose habit of vagabondism might otherwise very justly have bring they within the pale of suspicion the flippant pippo be the principal speaker in the short investigation and he answer be give with a ready frankness that under the circumstance do he and he companion infinite service the buffoon though accustom to deception and fraud have sufficient mother-wit to comprehend the critical position in which he be now place and that it be wiser to be sincere than to attempt effect he end by any of the usual means of prevarication he answer the judge therefore with a simplicity which he ordinary pursuit would not have give reason to expect and apparently with some touch of feeling that do credit to he heart this frankness be thy friend add the châtelain after he have nearly exhaust he question the answer have convince he that there be no ground of suspicion beyond the adventitious circumstance of they have be traveller on the same road as the decease it have do much towards convince I of thy innocence and it be in general the best shield for those who have commit no crime i only marvel that one of thy habit should have have the sense to discover it suffer I to tell you signor castellano or podestà whichever may be you eccellenza 's proper title that you have not give pippo credit for the wit he really have it be true i live by throw dust into man 's eye and by make other think the wrong be the right : but mother nature have give we all a insight into we own interest and mine be quite clear enough to let I know when the true be better than the false happy would it be if all have the same faculty and the same disposition to put it in use i shall not presume to teach one as wise and as experience as yourself eccellenza but if a humble man might speak freely in this honorable presence he would say that it be not common to meet with a fact without find it a very near neighbor to a lie they pass for the wisest and the most virtuous who best know how to mix the two so artfully together that like the sweet we put upon healing bitters the palatable may make the useful go down such at least be the opinion of a poor street buffoon who have no better claim to merit than have learn he art on the mole and in the toledo of bellissima napolus which as everybody know be a bit of heaven fall upon earth the fervor with which pippo utter the customary eulogium on the site of the ancient parthenope be so natural and characteristic as to excite a smile in the judge in spite of the solemn duty in which he be engage and it be believe to be a additional proof of the speaker 's innocence the châtelain then slowly recapitulate the history of the buffoon and the pilgrim to he companion the purport of which be as follow pippo naively admit the debauch at vévey implicate the festivity of the day and the known frailty of the flesh as the two influence cause conrad however stand upon the purity of he life and the sacred character of he call justify the company he keep on the respectable plea of necessity and on that of the mortification to which a pilgrimage should of right subject he who undertake it they have quit vaud together as early as the evening of the day of the abbaye 's ceremony and from that time to the moment of they arrival at the convent have make a diligent use of they leg in order to cross the col before the snow should set in and render the passage dangerous they have be see at martigny at lidde and st pierre alone and at proper hour make the best of they way towards the hospice and though of necessity they progress and action for several hour after quit the latter place be not bring within the observation of any but of that all-seeing eye which command a view of the recess of the alp equally with those of more frequented spot they arrival at the abode of the monk be sufficiently seasonable to give reason to believe that no portion of the intervene time have be waste by the way thus far they account of themselves and they movement be distinct while on the other hand there be not a single fact to implicate either beyond the suspicion that be more or less common to all who happen to be on the mountain at the moment the crime be commit the innocence of these two man would seem so clear and they readiness to appear and answer to we question be so much in they favor observe the experienced châtelain that i do not deem it just to detain they longer the pilgrim in particular have a heavy trust i understand he perform he penance as much for other as for himself and it be scarce decent in we who be believer and servant of the church to place obstacle in he path i will suggest the expediency therefore of give he at least permission to depart as we be near the end of the inquiry interrupt the signor grimaldus gravely i would suggest with due deference to a better opinion and more experience the propriety that all should remain ourselves include until we have come to a better understanding of the truth both pippo and the pilgrim meet this suggestion with ready declaration of they willingness to continue at the convent until the follow morning this little concession however have no great merit for the lateness of the hour render it imprudent to depart immediately and the affair be finally settle by order they to retire it be understand that unless previously call for they might depart with the reappearance of the dawn maso be the next and the last to be examine il maledetto present himself with perfect steadiness of nerve he be accompany by nettuno the mastiff of the convent have be kennel for the night it have be the habit of the dog of late to stray among the rock by day and to return to the convent in the evening in quest of food the sterile st bernard possess nothing whatever for the support of man or beast except that which come from the liberality of the monk every animal but the chamoix and the lämmergeyer refuse to ascend so near the region of eternal snow in he master however nettuno find a steady friend never fail to receive all that be necessary to he want from the portion of maso himself for the faithful beast be admit at he periodical visit to the temporary prison in which the latter be confine the châtelain wait a moment for the little stir occasion by the entrance of the prisoner to subside when he pursue the inquiry thou art a genoese of the name of thomaso santus he ask consult he note by this name signora be i generally know thou art a mariner and it be say one of courage and skill why hast thou give thyself the ungracious appellation of il maledetto man call I thus it be a misfortune but not a crime to be accurse he that be so ready to abuse he own fortune should not be surprise if other be lead to think he merit he fate we have some account of thee in valai ` ti say thou art a free-trader the fact can little concern valai or she government since all come and go unquestioned in this free land it be true we do not imitate we neighbor in all they policy neither do we like to see so often those who set at naught the law of friendly state why art thou journey on this road signora if i be what you say the reason of my be here be sufficiently plain it be probably because the lombard and piedmontese be more exacting of the stranger than you of the mountain you effect have be examine and they offer nothing to support the suspicion by all appearance maso thou hast not much of the goods of life to boast of but in spite of this thy reputation cling to thee ay signora this be much after the world 's humor let it fancy any quality in a man and he be sure to get more than he share of the same whether it be for or against he interest the rich man 's florin be quickly coin into a sequin by vulgar tongue while the poor man be lucky if he can get the change of a silver mark for a ounce of the better metal even poor nettuno find it difficult to get a living here at the convent because some difference in coat and instinct have give he a bad name among the dog of st bernard thy answer agree with thy character thou art say to have more wit than honesty maso and thou art describe as one that can form a desperate resolution and act up to its decision at need i be as heaven will at the birth signor castellano and as the chance of a pretty busy life have serve to give the work its finish that i be not want in manly quality on occasion perhaps these noble traveller will be willing to testify in consideration of some activity that i may have show on the leman during they late passage of that treacherous water though this be say carelessly the appeal to the recollection and gratitude of those he have serve be too direct to be overlook melchior de willade the pious clavier and the signor grimaldus all testify in behalf of the prisoner freely admit that without he coolness and skill the winkelry and all she hold would irretrievably have be lose sigismund be not content with so cold a demonstration of he feeling he owe not only the life of he father and he self to the courage of maso but that of one dearer than all one whose preservation to he youthful imagination seem a service that might nearly atone for any crime and he gratitude be in proportion i will testify more strongly to thy merit maso in face of this or any tribunal he say grasp the hand of the italian one who show so much bravery and so strong love for he fellow would be little likely to take life clandestinely and like a coward thou mayest count on my testimony in this strait -- if thou art guilty of this crime who can hope to be innocent maso return the friendly grasp till they finger seem to grow into each other he eye too show he be not without wholesome native sympathy though education and he habit might have warped they from they true direction a tear in spite of he effort to suppress the weakness start from its fountain roll down he sunburnt cheek like a solitary rivulet trickle through a barren and rugged waste this be frank and as become a soldier signora he say and i receive it as it be give in kindness and love but we will not lay more stress upon the affair of the lake than it deserve this keen-sighted châtelain need not be tell that i could not be of use in save you life without save my own and unless i much mistake the meaning of he eye he be about to say that we be fashion like this wild country in which chance have bring we together with we spot of generous fertility mingle with much unfruitful rock and that he who do a good act to-day may forget himself by do a evil turn to-morrow thou givest reason to all who hear thee to mourn that thy career have not be more profitable to thyself and the public answer the judge one who can reason so-well and who have this clear insight into he own disposition must err less from ignorance than wantonness there you do I injustice signor castellano and the law more credit than they deserve i shall not deny that justice -- or what be call justice -- and i have some acquaintance i have be the tenant of many prison before this which have be furnish by the holy canon and i have see every stage of the rogue 's progress from he who be still startle by he first crime dream heavy dream and fancy each stone of he cell have a eye to reproach he to he who no sooner do a wrong than it be forget in the wish to find the means of commit another and i call heaven as a witness that more be do to help along the scholar in he study of vice by those who be style the minister of justice than by he own natural frailty the want of he habit or the strength of he passion let the judge feel a father 's mildness the law possess that pure justice which be of thing that be not pervert and society become what it claim to be a community of mutual support and my life on it châtelain thy function will be lessen of most of they

the solitary horseman who be now know to be jacque coli be see to proceed in the same direction and he admit that he be overtake by the latter just as he reach the upper extremity of the plain beneath vélan where they be see in company though at a considerable distance and by a doubtful light by the traveller who be conduct by pierre thus far the account give of himself by maso be in perfect conformity with what be already know to the châtelain but after turn the rock already mention in a previous chapter all be bury in mystery with the exception of the incident that have be regularly relate in the narrative the italian in he further explanation add that he soon part with he companion who impatient of delay and desirous of reach the convent before night have urge he beast to greater speed while he himself have turn a little aside from the path to rest himself and to make a few preparation that he have deem necessary before go directly to the convent the whole of this short history be deliver with a composure as great as that which have just be display by pippo and the pilgrim and it be impossible for any present to detect the slightest improbability or contradiction in the tale the meeting with the other traveller in the storm maso ascribe to the fact of they have pass he while he be stationary and to he greater speed when in motion two circumstance that be quite as likely to be true as all the rest of the account he have leave the refuge at the first glimpse of dawn because he be behind he time and it have be he intention to descend to aoste that night a exertion that be necessary in order to repair the loss this may be true resume the judge but how dost thou account for thy poverty in search thy effect thou art find to be in a condition

confession as indeed in a certain degree prove to be the fact should i clear myself of the charge of poverty signor castellano he demand when all the inferior have leave the place shall i stand acquit

nettuno and seat himself on the step of one of the side-altar he proceed to make he revelation with great method and coolness remove some of the long shaggy hair of the dog il maledetto show the attentive and curious spectator that a belt of leather have be ingeniously place about the body of the animal next its skin it be so conceal as to be quite hide from the view of those who do not make particular search a process that nettuno judge by the scowling look he throw at most present and the manner in which he show he tooth would not be likely to permit to a stranger the belt be open and maso lay a glitter necklace of precious stone in which ruby and emerald vie with other gem of price with some of a dealer 's coquetry under the strong light of the lamp there you see the fruit of a life of hazard and hardship signor châtelain he say if my purse be empty it be because the jewish calvinist of geneva have take the last liard in payment of the jewel this be a ornament of rare beauty

shed blood for the trifle that would be find on the person of jacque coli thou hast more observe the judge signing with he hand as he speak let we see all thou hast not a brooch or so much as a worthless garnet nay i see the belt which contain they among the hair of the dog maso either feel or feign a well-acted surprise nettuno have be place in a convenient attitude for he master to unloosen the belt and as it be the intention of the latter to replace it the animal still lay quietly in the same position a circumstance which displace he shaggy coat and allow the châtelain to detect the object to which he have just allude signora say the smuggler change color but endeavor to speak lightly of a discovery which all the other present evidently consider to be grave it would

reverence for truth which the despise headsman not only entertain himself but inculcate in all in whom he have any interest the revelation he have just make seem too improbable to resist the doubt of

of she strong and masculine quality and then when deep silence have follow she remark he proceed we want not for wealth all we ask be to be like other in the world 's respect with we money it be very easy to find those in another canton who be willing to take the little sigismund into they keep after which a feigned death and a private burial do the rest the deceit be easily practice for as few care for the grief as for the happiness of the headsman 's family the child have draw near the end of its first year when i be call upon to execute my office on a stranger the criminal have take life in a drunken brawl in one of the town of the canton and he be say to be a man that have trifle with the precious gift of birth it be suspect that he be noble i go with a heavy heart for never do i strike a blow without pray god it might be the last but it be heavier when i reach the place where the culprit await he fate the tiding of my poor son 's death reach I as i put foot on the threshold of the desolate prison and i turn aside to weep for my own woe before i enter to see my victim the condemn man have great unwillingness to die he have send for I many hour before the fatal moment to make acquaintance as he say with the hand that be to dispatch he to the presence of he last and eternal judge balthazar pause he appear to meditate on a scene that have probably leave indelible impression on he mind shudder involuntarily he raise he eye from the pavement of the chapel and continue the recital always in the same subdue and tranquil manner i have be the unwilling instrument of many a violent death -- i have see the most reckless sinner in the agony of sudden and compel repentance but never have i witness so wild and fearful a struggle between earth and heaven -- the world and the grave -- passion and the rebuke of providence -- as attend the last hour of that unhappy man there be moment in which the mild spirit of christ win upon he evil mood ` tis true but the picture be in general that of revenge so fierce that the power of hell alone could give it birth in a human heart he have with he a infant of a age just fit to be take from the breast this child appear to awaken the fiercest conflicting feeling he both yearn over it and detest its sight though hatred seem most to prevail this be horrible murmur the doge it be the more horrible herr doge that it should come from one who be justly condemn to the axe he reject the priest he would have naught of any but I my soul lothe the wretch -- yet so few ever show a interest in we -- and it would have be cruel to desert a die man at the end he place the child in my care furnish more gold than be sufficient to rear it frugally to the age of manhood and leave other valuable which i have keep as proof that might some day be useful all i could learn of the infant 's origin be simply this it come from italy and of italian parent its mother die soon after its birth -- a groan escape the doge -- its father still live and be the object of the criminal 's implacable hatred as its mother have be of he ardent love its birth be noble and it have be baptize in the bosom of the church by the name of gaetano it must be he -- it be -- it must be my beloved son -- exclaim the doge unable to control himself any longer he spread wide he arm and sigismund throw himself upon he bosom though there still remain fearful apprehension that all he hear be a dream go on -- go on -- excellent balthazar add the signor grimaldus dry he eye and struggle to command himself i shall have no peace until all be reveal to the last syllable of thy wonderful thy glorious tale there remain but little more to say herr doge the fatal hour arrive and the criminal be transport to the place where he be to give up he life while seat in the chair in which he receive the fatal blow he spirit undergo infernal torment i have reason to think that there be moment when he would gladly have make he peace with god but the demon prevail he die in he sin from the hour when he commit the little gaetano to my keep i do not cease to entreat to be put in possession of the secret of the child 's birth but the sole answer i receive be a order to appropriate the gold to my own use and to adopt the boy as my own the sword be in my hand and the signal to strike be give when for the last time i ask the name of the infant 's family and country as a duty i could not neglect ` he be thine -- he be thine -- ' be the answer ` tell I balthazar be thy office hereditary as be wont in these region ' i be compel as ye know to say it be ` then adopt the urchin rear he to fatten on the blood of he fellow ' it be mockery to trifle with such a spirit when he head fall if still bad on its fierce feature trace of the infernal triumph with which he spirit depart the monster be a just sacrifice to the law of the canton exclaim the single-minded bailiff thou seest herr melchior that we do well in arm the hand of the executioner in spite of all the sentiment of the weak-minded such a wretch be surely unworthy to live this burst of official felicitation from peterchen who rarely neglect a occasion to draw a conclusion favorable to the exist order of thing like most of those who reap they exclusive advantage and to the prejudice of innovation produce little attention all present be too much absorb in the fact relate by balthazar to turn aside to speak or think of other matter what become of the boy demand the worthy clavier who have take as deep a interest as the rest in the progress of the narrative i could not desert he father nor do i wish to he come into my guardianship at a moment when god to reprove we repining at a lot that he have choose to impose have take we own little sigismund to heaven i fill the place of the dead infant with my live charge i give to he the name of my own son and i can say confidently that i transfer to he the love i have bear my own issue though time and use and a knowledge of the child 's character be perhaps necessary to complete the last marguerite never know the deception though a mother 's instinct and tenderness take the alarm and raise suspicion we have never speak freely on this together and like you she now heareth the truth for the first time 'twa a fearful mystery between god and my own heart murmur the woman i forbore to trouble it -- sigismund or gaetano or whatever you will have he name fill my affection and i strove to be satisfy the boy be dear to I and ever will be though you seat he on a throne but christine -- the poor stricken christine -- be truly the child of my bosom sigismund go and kneel at the foot of she whom he have ever believe he mother and earnestly beg she blessing and continue affection the tear stream from marguerite 's eye as she willingly bestow the first and promise never to withhold the last hast thou any of the trinket or garment that be give thee with the child or canst render a account of the place where they be still to be find demand the doge whose whole mind be too deeply set on appease he doubt to listen to aught else they be all here in the convent the gold have be fairly commit to sigismund to form he equipment as a soldier the child be keep apart receive such education as a learn priest could give till of a age to serve and then i send he to bear arm in italy which i know to be the country of he birth though i never know to what prince he allegiance be due the time have now come when i think it due to the youth to let he know the real nature of the tie between we but i shrink from pain marguerite and myself and i even do he heart the credit to believe that he would rather belong to we humble and despise though we be than find himself a nameless outcast without home country or parentage it be necessary however to speak and it be my purpose to reveal the truth here at the convent in the presence of christine for this reason and to enable sigismund to make inquiry for he family the effect receive from the unhappy criminal with the child be place among he baggage secretly they be at this moment on the mountain the venerable old prince tremble violently for with the intense feeling of one who dread that he dearest hope might yet be disappoint he fear while he most wish to consult these mute but veracious witness let they be produce -- let they be instantly produce and examine he whisper eagerly to those around he then turn slowly to the immovable maso he demand -- and thou man of falsehood and of blood what dost thou reply to this clear and probable tale il maledetto smile as if superior to a weakness that have blind the other the expression of he countenance be fill with that look of calm superiority which certainty give to the well-informed over the doubt and deceive i have to reply signora and honor father he coolly answer that balthazar have right cleverly relate a tale that have be ingeniously devise that i be bartolo i repeat to thee can be prove by a hundred living tongue in italy -- thou best knowest who bartolo continus be doge of genoa ' he speak the truth return the prince drop he head in disappointment oh melchior i have have but too sure proof of what he intimate i have long be certain that this wretched bartolo be my son though never before have i be curse with he presence bad as i be teach to think he my worst fear have not paint he as i now find the truth would warrant have there not be some fraud -- art thou not the dupe of some conspiracy of which money have be the object the doge shake he head in a way to prove that he could not possibly flatter himself with such a hope never : my offer of money have always be reject why should i take the gold of my father add il maledetto my own skill and courage more than suffice for my want the nature of the answer and the compose demeanor of maso produce a embarrassing pause let the two stand forth and be confront say the puzzle clavier at length nature often reveal the truth when the uttermost power of man be at fault -- if either be the true child of the prince we should find some resemblance to the father to support he claim the test though of doubtful virtue be eagerly adopt for the truth have now become so involve as to excite a keen interest in all present the desire to explain the mystery be general and the slightest means of attain such a end become of a value proportionate to the difficulty of effect the object sigismund and maso be place beneath the lamp where its light be strongest and every eye turn eagerly to they countenance in order to discover or to fancy it discover some of those secret sign by which the mysterious affinity of nature be to be trace a more puzzling examination could not well have be essay there be proof to give the victory to each of the pretender if such a term may be use with propriety as it concern the passive sigismund and much to defeat the claim of the latter in the olive-colored tint the dark rich rolling eye and in stature the advantage be altogether with maso whose outline of countenance and penetrate expression have also a resemblance to those of the doge so marked as to render it quite apparent to any who wish to find it the habit of the mariner have probably diminish the likeness but it be too obviously there to escape detection that harden and rude appearance the consequence of exposure which render it difficult to pronounce within ten year of he real age contribute a little to conceal what might be term the latent character of he countenance but the feature themselves be undeniably a rude copy of the more polished lineament of the prince the case be less clear as respects sigismund the advantage of ruddy and vigorous youth render he such a resemblance of the doge -- in the point where it exist -- as we find between the aged and those portrait which have be paint in they younger and happier day the bold outline be not unlike that of the noble feature of the venerable prince but neither the eye the hair nor the complexion have the hue of italy thou seest say maso tauntingly when the disappointed clavier admit the difference in the latter particulars this be a imposition that will not pass i swear to you as there be faith in man and hope for the die christian that so far as any know they parentage i be the child of gaetano grimaldus the present doge of genoa and of no other man may the saint desert I -- the bless mother of god be deaf to my prayer -- and all man hunt I with they curse if i say aught in this but holy truth the fearful energy with which maso utter this solemn appeal and a certain sincerity that mark he manner and perhaps we might even say he character in spite of the dissolute recklessness of he principle serve greatly to weaken the grow opinion in favor of he competitor and this noble youth ask the sorrowing doge -- this generous and elevated boy whom i have already hold next to my heart with so much of a father 's joy -- who and what be he eccellenza i wish to say nothing against the signor sigismondo he be a gallant swimmer and a staunch support in time of need be he swiss or genoese either country may be proud of he but self-love teach we all to take care of we own interest before those of another it would be far pleasanter to dwell in the palazzo grimaldus on we warm and sunny gulf honor and esteem as the heir of a noble name than to be cut

or of marguerite 's family in he person or feature balthazar pause that there might be a examination of this fact and in truth the most ingenious fancy could not have detect the least affinity in look between either of those whom he have so long think he parent and the young soldier let the doge of genoa question he memory and look farther than himself can he find no sleep smile no color of the hair nor any other common point of appearance between the youth and some of those whom he once know and love the anxious prince turn eagerly towards sigismund and a gleam of joy light he face again as

mine the debt shall form a tie between we little short of that to which nature herself could give birth herr doge return the earnest headsman let we not be too hasty if there be strong fact in favor of the claim of maso there be many circumstance also in favor of those of sigismund to I the history of the last be probably more clear than it can be to any other the time the country the age of the child the name and the fearful revelation of the criminal be all strong proof in sigismund 's behalf here be the effect that be give I with the child it be possible that they too may throw weight into he scale balthazar have take means to procure the package in question from among the luggage of sigismund and he now proceed to expose its contents while a breathless silence betray the interest with which the result be expect he first lay upon the pavement of the chapel a collection of child 's clothing the article be rich and accord to the fashion of the time but they contain no positive proof that could go to substantiate the origin of the wearer except as they raise the probability of he have come of a elevated rank in life as the different object be place upon the stone adelheid and christine kneel beside they each too intently absorb with the progress of the inquiry to bethink themselves of those form which in common throw a restraint upon the manners of they sex the latter appear to forget she own sorrow for a moment in a new-born interest in she brother 's fortune while the ear of the former drink in each syllable that fall from the lip of the different speaker with a avidity that she strong sympathy with the youth could alone give here be a case contain trinket of value add balthazar the condemn man say they be take through ignorance and he be accustom to suffer

have speak she hair have fall in wild profusion over she shoulder as she still kneel over the article on the pavement and she hand be clasp entreatingly as if she deprecate the rude interruption which have so often dash the cup from they lip as they be about to yield to the delight of believe sigismund to be the child of the prince of genoa thou art another of a fond and weak sex to swell the list of confide spirit that have be betray by the selfishness and falsehood of man answer the mock mariner go to girl -- make thyself a nun thy sigismund be a impostor adelheid by a quick but decide

's authority when i say he belong to we melchior be this true cry the doge the girl 's word be but a echo of what my heart feel answer the baron look about he proudly as if he would browbeat any who should presume to think that he have consent to corrupt the blood of willading by the measure i have watch thine eye maso as one nearly interested in the truth continue adelheid and i now appeal to thee as thou lovest thine own soul to disburthen thyself while thou may ` st have tell some truth the jealous affection of a woman have reveal to I that thou hast keep back part speak then and relieve the soul of this venerable prince from torture and deliver my own body to the wheel this may be well to the warm imagination of a love-sick girl but we of the contraband have too much practice in man

to deny that thou hast sympathy continue the maiden steadily thou hast in secret more pleasure in serve than in injure thy race thou canst not have be in such strait in company with the signor sigismondo without imbibe some touch of he noble generosity you have struggle together for we common good you come of the same god have the same manly courage be equally stout of heart strong of hand and willing to do for other such a heart must have enough of noble and human impulse to cause you to love justice speak then and i pledge we sacred word that thou shalt fare better for thy candor than

give we truth holy sacred truth and we pardon the past il maledetto be move by the beautiful earnestness of the speaker she ingenuous interest in the result with the solemnity of she appeal shake he purpose thou know ` st not what thou say ` st lady thou ask ` st my life he answer after ponder in a way to give a new impulse to the die hope of the doge though there be no quality more sacred than justice interpose the châtelain who alone could speak with authority in the valai it be fairly within the province of she servant to permit she to go unexpiated in order that greater good may come of the sacrifice if thou wilt prove aught that be of grave importance to the interest of the prince of genoa valai owe it to the love it bear he republic to requite the service maso listen at first with a cold ear he feel the distrust of one who have sufficient knowledge of the world to be acquaint with the thousand expedient that be resort to by man in order to justify they daily want of faith he question the châtelain closely as to he meaning nor be it until a late hour and after long and weary explanation on both side that the party come to a understanding on the part of those who on this occasion be the representative of that high attribute of the deity which among man be term justice it be sufficiently apparent that they understand its exercise with certain reservation that might be make at pleasure in favor of they own view and on the part of maso there be no attempt to conceal the suspicion he entertain to the last that he might be a sufferer by lessen in any degree the strength of the defence by which he be at present shield as the son real or fancied of a person so powerful as the prince of genoa as usually happen when there be a mutual wish to avoid extremity and when conflict interest be manage with equal address the negotiation terminate in a compromise as the result will be show in the regular course of the narrative the reader be refer to the closing chapter for the explanation chapter xxxi speak oh speak and take I from the rack young it will be remember that three day be pass in the convent in that interval which occur between the arrival of the traveller and those of the châtelain and the bailiff the determination of admit the claim of sigismund so frankly announce by adelheid in the precede chapter be take during this time separate from the world and amid that magnificent solitude where the passion and the vulgar interest of life sink into corresponding insignificance as the majesty of god become hourly more visible the baron have be gradually win upon to consent love for he child aid by the fine moral and personal quality of the young man himself which here stand out in strong relief like one of the stern pile of those alp that now appear to he eye so much superior in they eternal bed to all the vine-clad hill and teem valley of the lower world have be the immediate and efficient agent in produce this decision it be not pretend that the bernese make a easy conquest over he prejudice which be in truth no other than a conquest over himself he be morally consider little other than a collection of the narrow opinion and exclusive doctrine which it be then the fashion to believe necessary to high civilization on the contrary the struggle have be severe nor be it probable that the gentle blandishments of adelheid the eloquent but silent appeal to he reason that be constantly make by sigismund in he deportment or the argument of he old comrade the signor grimaldus who with a philosophy that be more often make apparent in we friendship than in we own practice dilate copiously on the wisdom of sacrifice a few worthless and antiquated opinion to the happiness of a only child would have prevail have the baron be in a situation less abstracted from the ordinary circumstance of he rank and habit than that in which he have be so accidentally throw the pious clavier too who have obtain some claim to the confidence of the guest of the convent by he service and by the risk he have run in they company come to swell the number of sigismund 's friend of humble origin himself and attach to the young man not only by he general merit but by he conduct on the lake he neglect no good occasion to work upon melchior 's mind after he himself have become acquaint with the nature of the young man 's hope as they pace the brown and naked rock together in the vicinity of the convent the augustine discourse on the perishable nature of human hope and on the frailty of human opinion he dwell with pious fervor on the usefulness of recall the thought from the turmoil of daily and contract interest to a wider view of the truth of existence point to the wild scene around they he liken the confused mass of the mountain they sterility and they ruthless tempest to the world with its want of happy fruit its disorder and its violence then direct the attention of he companion to the azure vault above they which see at that elevation and in that pure atmosphere resemble a benign canopy of the softest tint and color he make glowing appeal to the eternal and holy tranquillity of the state of be to which they be both fast hastening and which have its type in the mysterious and impose calm of that tranquil and inimitable void he draw he moral in favor of a measure enjoyment of we advantage here as well as of render love and justice to all who merit we esteem and to the disadvantage of those iron prejudice which confine the best sentiment in the fetter of opinion found in the ordinance and provision of the violent and selfish it be after one of these interesting dialogue that melchior de willade he heart soften and he soul touch with the hope of heaven listen with a more indulgent ear to the firm declaration of adelheid that unless she become the wife of sigismund she self-respect no less than she affection must compel she to pass she life unmarried we shall not say that the maiden herself philosophize on premise as sublime as those of the good monk for with she the warm impulse of the heart lay at the bottom of she resolution but even she have the respectable support of reason to sustain she cause the baron have that innate desire to perpetuate he own existence in that of he descendant which appear to be a property of nature alarm at a declaration which threaten annihilation to he line while at the same time he be more than usually under the influence of he better feeling he promise that if the charge of murder could be remove from balthazar he would no longer oppose the union we should be give the reader a opinion a little too favorable of the herr von willading be we to say that he do not repent have make this promise soon after it be utter he be in a state of mind that resemble the vane of he own tower which change they direction with every fresh current of air but he be by far too honorable to think seriously of violate a faith that he have once fairly plighted he have moment of unpleasant misgiving as to the wisdom and propriety of he promise but they be of that species of regret which be know to attend a unavoidable evil if he have any expectation of be release from he pledge they be bottom on certain vague impression that balthazar would be find guilty though the constant and earnest asseveration of sigismund in favor of he father have greatly succeed in shake he faith on this point adelheid have stronger hope than either the fear of the young man himself prevent he from fully participate in she confidence while she father share she expectation on that torment principle which cause we to dread the worst when therefore the jewelry of jacque coli be find in the possession of maso and balthazar be unanimously acquit not only from this circumstance which go so conclusively to criminate another but from the want of any other evidence against he than the fact of he be find in the bone-house instead of the refuge a accident that might well have happen to any other traveller in the storm the baron resolutely prepare himself to redeem he pledge it be scarcely necessary to add how much this honorable sentiment be strengthen by the unexpected declaration of the headsman concern the birth of sigismund notwithstanding the asseveration of maso that the whole be a invention conceive to fervor the son of balthazar it be support by proof so substantial and palpable to say nothing of the natural and veracious manner in which the tale be relate as to create a strong probability in the mind of the witness that it might be true although it remain to be discover who be the real parent of sigismund few now believe that he owe he existence to the headsman a short summary of the fact may aid the reader in better understand the circumstance on which so much dénouement depend it have be reveal in the course of the narrative that the signor grimaldus have wed a lady younger than himself whose affection be already in the possession of one that in moral quality be unworthy of she love but who in other respects be perhaps better suit to become she husband than the powerful noble to whom she family have give she hand the birth of they son be soon follow by the death of the mother and the abduction of the child year have pass when the signor grimaldus be first apprize of the existence of the latter he have receive this important information at a moment when the authority of genoa be most active in pursue those who have long and desperately trifle with the law and the avowed motive for the revelation be a appeal to he natural affection in behalf of a son who be likely to become the victim of he practice the recovery of a child under such circumstance be a blow severer than he loss and it will readily be suppose that the truth of the pretension of maso who then go by the name of bartolomeo continus be admit with the greatest caution reference have be make by the friend of the smuggler to a die monk whose character be above suspicion and who corroborate with he latest breath the statement of maso by affirm before god and the saint that he know he so far as man could know a fact like this to be the son of the signer grimaldus this grave testimony give under circumstance of such solemnity and support by the production of important papers that have be steal with the child remove the suspicion of the doge he secretly interpose he interest to save the criminal though after a fruitless attempt to effect a reformation of he habit by means of confidential agent he have never consent to see he such then be the nature of the conflict statement while hope and the pure delight of find himself the father of a son like sigismund cause the aged prince to cling to the claim of the young soldier with fond pertinacity he cooler and more deliberate judgment have already be form in favor of another in the long private examination which succeed the scene in the chapel maso have gradually draw more into himself become vague and mysterious until he succeed in exciting a most painful state of doubt and expectation in all who witness he deportment profit by this advantage he suddenly change he tactic he promise revelation of importance on the condition that he should first be place in security within the frontier of piedmont the prudent châtelain soon see that the case be get to be one in which justice be expect to be blind in the more politic signification of the term he therefore draw off he loquacious coadjutor the bailiff in a way to leave the settlement of the affair to the feeling and wish of the doge the latter by the aid of melchior and sigismund soon effect a understanding in which the condition of the mariner be admit when the party separate for the night il maledetto on whom weigh the entire load of jacque coli ' murder be again commit to he temporary prison while balthazar pippo and conrad be permit to go at large as have successfully pass the ordeal of examination day dawn upon the col long ere the shades of night have desert the valley of the rhone all in the convent be in motion before the appearance of the sun it be generally understand that the event which have so much disturb the order of its peaceful inmate ' life be to be bring finally to a close and that they duty be about to return into the customary channel orison be constantly ascend to heaven from the pass of st bernard but on the present occasion the stir in and about the chapel the manner in which the good canon hurry to and fro through the long corridor and the general air of excitement proclaim that the office of the matins possess more than the usual interest of the regular daily devotion the hour be still early when all on the pass assemble in the place of worship the body of jacque coli have be remove to a side chapel where cover with a pall it await the mass for the dead two large church candle stand light on the step of the great altar and the spectator include pierre and the muleteer the servant of the convent and other of every rank and age be draw up in double file in its front among the silent spectator appear balthazar and he wife maso in truth a prisoner but with the air of a liberated man the pilgrim and pippo the good prior be present in he robe with all of he community during the moment of suspense which precede the rite he discourse civilly with the châtelain and the bailiff both of whom return he courtesy with interest and in the manner in which it become the dignified and honor to respect appearance in the presence of they

the opening of the door a little procession enter head by the clavier melchior de willading lead he daughter sigismund come next follow by marguerite and christine and the venerable doge bring up the rear simple as be this wedding train it be impose from the dignity of the principal actor and from the evidence of deep feeling with which all in it advance to the altar sigismund be firm and self-possessed still he carriage be lofty and proud as if he feel that a cloud still hang over that portion of he history to which the world attach so much importance and he have fall back on he character and principle for support adelheid have lately be so much the subject of strong emotion that she present herself before the priest with less trepidation than be usual for a maiden but the fix regard the colorless cheek and a air of profound reverence announce the depth and solemn character of the feeling with which she be prepare to take the vow the marriage rite be celebrate by the good clavier who not content with persuade the baron to make this sacrifice of he prejudice have ask permission to finish the work he have so happily commence by pronounce the nuptial benediction melchior de willading listen to the short ceremony with silent self-approval he feel disposed at that instant to believe he have wisely sacrifice the interest of the world to the right a sentiment that be a little quicken by the uncertainty which still hang over the origin of he new son who might yet prove to be all that he could hope as well as by the momentary satisfaction he find in manifest he independence by bestow the hand of he daughter upon one whose merit be so much better ascertain than he birth in this manner do the best deceive themselves yield frequently to motive that would not support investigation when they believe themselves the strongest in the right the good-natured clavier have observe the wavering and uncertain character of the baron 's decision and he have be induce to urge he particular request to be the officiate priest by a secret apprehension that descend again into the scene of the world the relent father might become like most other parent of these nether region more disposed to consult the temporal advancement than the true happiness of he child as one of the party be a protestant no mass be say a omission however that in no degree impair the legal character of the engagement adelheid plight she unvarying love and fidelity with maiden modesty but with the steadiness of a woman whose affection and principle be superior to the little weakness which on such occasion be most apt to unsettle those who have the least of either of these great distinctive essential of the sex the vow to cherish and protect be utter by sigismund in deep manly sincerity for at that moment he feel as if a life of devotion to she happiness would scarcely requite she single-minded feminine and unvarying truth may god bless thee dearest murmured old melchior as

and a new lord the young man exchange embrace with the baron whose character he know to be kind in the main and for whom he feel the regard which be natural to he present situation he then turn with a hesitating eye to the signor grimaldi the doge succeed he friend in pay the compliment of affection to the bride and have just release adelheid with a warm paternal kiss i pray marium and she holy son

arm and the soul of marguerite yearn to mingle she tear with those she love so well but stern in she resolution she stay the torrent of feeling which would have be so terrible in its violence have it broken loose and follow she husband with a dry and glowing eye they descend the mountain with a vacuum in they heart which teach even this persecute pair that there be grief in nature that surpass all the artificial woe of life the scene just related do not fail to disturb the spectator maso dash he hand across he eye and seem touch with a stronger working of sympathy than it accord with he present policy to show while both conrad and pippo do credit to they humanity by fairly shed tear the latter indeed show manifestation of a sensibility that be not altogether incompatible with ordinary recklessness and looseness of principle he even beg leave to kiss the hand of the bride wish she joy with fervor as one who have go through great danger in she company the whole party then separate with a exchange of cordial good feeling which prove that however much man may be dispose to jostle and discompose they fellow in the great highway of life nature have infuse into they composition some great redeeming quality to make we regret the abuse by which they have be so much pervert on quit the chapel the whole of the traveller make they disposition to depart the bailiff and the châtelain go down towards the rhone as well satisfy with themselves as if they have discharge they trust with fidelity by commit maso to prison and discourse as they ride along on the singular chance which have

witness of maso 's promise revelation conrad and pippo have be advise to quit the mountain before the rest of the party and the muleteer be request to keep a little in the rear at the point where the path leave the lake the whole dismounted pierre go ahead with the beast with a view to make the first precipitous pitch from the col on foot maso now take the lead when he reach the spot where the convent be last in view he stop and turn to gaze at the venerable and storm-beaten pile thou hesitate observe the baron de willading who suspect a intention to escape signora the look at even a stone be a melancholy office when it be know to be the last i have often climb to the col but i shall never dare do it again for though the honorable and worthy châtelain and the most worthy bailiff be willing to pay they homage to a doge of genoa in he own person they may be less tender of he honor when he be absent addio caro san bernardo like I thou art solitary and weather-beaten and like I

its first sudden descent the spot be favorable to the purpose of il maledetto though still on the level of the lake the convent the col and all it contain with the exception of a short line of its stony path be shut from they view by the barrier of intervene rock the ravine lay beneath ragged ferruginous and riven into a hundred face by the eternal action of the season all above beneath and
