venture to give they to the world i have no other aim in write but to occupy as rationally as i could the hour of travel and no other object in publishing but to impart to other as plainly as i could a portion of the pleasure i myself experience it have somewhere be remark to this effect that if every man of common understanding be to put down the daily thought and occurrence of he life candidly and unaffectedly as he experience they he must necessarily produce something of interest to he fellow man and make a book which though not enliven by wit dignified by profundity of reasoning nor valuable by extent of research yet no man perhaps should throw aside with either weariness or disgust whether i shall prove fortunate enough not to excite these sensation in such reader as may honor my book with a perusal i fear to conjecture but it be my good fortune during a season of uncommon beauty to make a tour through some of the most interesting part of france and to meet with person who from situation and talent be highly calculate to give my journey every charm of society and information the natural face of the country through which i pass be peculiarly beautiful : i could scarcely move a step without some novelty of picturesque enchantment and have the most perfect opportunity of contemplate nature in all she varied poetry from the grand and terrible grace of savage sublimity to the soft and playful loveliness of cultivate luxuriance there be scarcely a town or village where i arrive which romance or history religion or politics have not invest and adorn with every interest of mental association under such impression and with such opportunity it be scarcely possible to resist record something of what i saw and feel and if the publication of my hasty record be a error it will be deem by my friend i hope a pardonable one my book can scarcely demand the serious attention of the critic nor could criticism well expect a better style from one whose profession be seldom suppose to allow much leisure to acquire nicety in the art of composition i claim no other merit for my note than have follow the advice -lrb- of gray i believe -rrb- that ten word put down at the moment upon the spot be worth a whole cart load of recollection i have not seek to add to they attraction -lrb- if they should possess any -rrb- by the embellishment of my invention or the grace of my period -- the decorative artifice of execution can never give value to falsehood and truth need they not a simple landscape simply describe from nature have always a charm above the most high-finished composition of mere fancy and like a moderate painting from the same source still impart a feeling of reality i hope therefore i shall be excuse for attempt some description slight and unskilful as it may be of place and scenery where the human mind have exhibit some of its most curious and powerful feature and which awaken reflection of the deepest interest -- i allude particularly to the monastery of _ la trappe _ and to the country of _ la vendée _ the former have dwell among the earliest impression of youth with something like the wild and wonderful force of a romantic tale and i be anxious to become a eye-witness of what have so long be one of the most powerful object of my imagination the gloomy and almost inaccessible situation choose by this strange fraternity for they convent -- they rigid separation from human intercourse -- the infringible taciturnity impose upon themselves -- and the terrible severity of they penance be certainly circumstance more resemble the visionary indulgence of fantasy and fiction than actual reality to be meet with among live man and in the present day with regard to the department of _ la vendée _ whatever serve trivial as it may be to recall or illustrate the history of its war and the character of its inhabitant must ever possess a charm for those who delight to sympathize with the noble struggle of a gallant people conscientiously devote themselves to the cause of a fall and persecute monarchy and resist the cruel and destructive ferocity of a licentious enemy who have break down the most sacred fence of society and trample upon the dearest tie of human nature in these note slight as they be i can truly promise the reader that he will find nothing wilfully misrepresent nor advance without just authority and if the rapid and cursory character of the observation allusion and anecdote shall enable a hour to pass agreeably that have no better employment i be content and gratify with the attainment of all i ever hope or design by a unpretending publication which i cheerfully dedicate to all who love to unbend they mind from a critical attitude and can lounge goodnaturedly over leaf write by a traveller as idle and careless as themselves and who assure they that no one can think more humbly of he production than himself march 1818 contents chapter i route from pari to mortagne -- excursion to la

since the restoration in 1814 -- its foundation and rule under the abbe de rance i perform this journey during the month of June July August and September a distance of near one thousand mile and have the singular good fortune to enjoy the finest weather possible the perusal of madame de la roche-jaquelin 's interesting work on the vendean war first give I the idea of visit the country call le bocage the theater of so many event and suffering of the brave royalist and as the province of le perche in which be situate the ancient convent of la trappe be in my route to bretagne i resolve to make a excursion there in order to satisfy myself of the truth of those austerity which i have read of in the memoirs of the count de comminge the route from pari to mortagne in le perche lead through marly versaille saint cyr pont chartrain la queue houdon marrolle dreux nonancourt tillières verneuil and saint maurice the road be excellent and the country beautiful the first post out of pari be nanterre two league and a half from the barriere the village of ruel and the park of malmaison form a continuation of neat building at nanterre in the campaign of 1815 the prussian after a severe engagement with the retreat troops of the french have one regiment of cavalry cut to piece at ruel the celebrated cardinal richelieu have a palace which at the revolution become national property and be purchase by massena duc de rivoli prince d'essle lately decease the duchess still reside there it be take possession of by the ally in 1815 and like malmaison plunder by the troops there be extensive barracks for cavalry at this place at present occupy by the swiss guard a little farther between malmaison and marly be a beautiful château formerly belong to general count bertrand who accompany napoleon to saint helena it be now the property of m ouverard the banker : nearly opposite be the residence of the celebrated abbé sieyès who live in great retirement whatever may have be the political transgression of bertrand there be something so noble in he devotion to the fall fortune of he master that it be impossible not to respect he character at marly the water-works and aqueduct for convey the water from the river seine to the palace and garden of versaille be very curious the palace of marly be destroy but the basin which be construct by order of loui xiv be still to be see though in ruin delille the poet in he description of the château and beautiful grounds of marly say : c'est là que tout est grand que l'art n'est point timide là tout est enchanté : c'est le palais d'armide c'est le jardin d'alcine ou plutôt d'un héros noble dans sa retraite et grand dans son repo qui cherche encore à vaincre à dompter des obstacle et ne marche jamais qu'entouré de miracle on quit paris i have procure a letter of introduction from count la cou to madame de bellou at mortagne a charming old lady of a ancient and noble family in that province who have never quit the seat of she ancestor but remain quiet and respect during all the storm of the revolution she receive I with kindness and politely introduce I to the sub-prefect monsieur lamorelie who give I a letter of introduction to the père don augustin grand prior of la trappe the mayor of the commune of solignié who happen to be at the inn and learn from the _ aubergiste _ that a stranger intend visit la trappe very civilly introduce himself to I and give I every necessary direction how to proceed through the forest at the same time express he surprise that a englishman should take the trouble and undergo the fatigue of penetrate through such a country a attempt which few of he own countryman have ever venture to make it be singular enough that only one person in the town could be find to accompany I as a guide or who know any thing of the track through the forest although the abbey be distant only twenty-five mile i set out with the guide just at day-break mount on a small norman horse and arm with pistol and a sword-cane in case of meeting with wolf which the mayor of solignié have caution I against as abound throughout the country we travel after leave the main road at the distance of a league through a country scarcely appear to be inhabit here and there a lone cot a mere speck meet the eye amidst a landscape compose of nothing but barren waste and thick forest nearly impervious to the light we have penetrate about half a mile through one of the latter my attention occupy with the romantic wildness of the scene when we be alarm by the howling of a wolf my guide cross himself and begin crack he whip with the noise and singular dexterity peculiar to the french postillion and as we enter a part of the forest impenetrable but for trace know only to those who be accustom to they he related -lrb- by way of consolation i suppose -rrb- several story of the peasantry have be recently attack and some destroy by wolf and one instance of a woman have have she infant tear from she arm only a short time since in the neighborhood on quit the forest the track be now and then diversify by the ruin of a solitary cottage or the mouldering remain of a crucifix raise by pious hand to mark some event or to guide the traveller and after traverse a rocky plain cover with heath and wild thyme where some herd of sheep and goat be browse attend by the shepherd we enter the forest of bellegarde this forest spread over a large extent of country and be so dark and intricate that those best acquaint with it frequently lose they way no vestige of human footstep or of the track of animal appear a mark here and there on some of the tree be the only direction pursue we way through turning and winding the most perplexing we find ourselves to be on the overhang brow of a hill the descent of which be so precipitous that we be under the necessity of dismount and by a wind path hollow out in its side descend through a sort of labyrinth towards the valley whose side be clothe with lofty wood rise one above the other the valley itself be intersperse with three lake connect with each other and form a sort of moat around the ground in the center of which appear the venerable abbey of la trappe with its dark gray tower the deep tone of whose bell have previously announce to we that we have nearly reach we journey 's end the situation of this monastery be well adapt to the founder 's view and to suggest the name it originally receive of la trappe from the intricacy of the road which descend to it and the difficulty of access or egress which exist even to this day though the wood have be very much thin since the revolution perhaps there never be any thing in the whole universe better calculate to inspire religious awe than the first view of this monastery it be impose even to breathlessness the total solitude -- the undisturbed and chilling silence which seem to have ever sleep over the dark and ancient wood -- the still lake reflect the deep solemnity of the object around they -- all impress a powerful image of utter seclusion and hopeless separation from live man and appear form at once to court and gratify the sternest austerity of devotion -- to nurse the fanaticism of diseased imagination -- to humor the wildest fancy -- and promote the gloomiest scheme of penance and privation in descend the steep and intricate path the traveller frequently lose sight of the abbey until he have actually reach the bottom then emerge from the wood the follow inscription be see carve on a wooden cross : c'est ici que la mort et que la vérité elèvent leurs flambeaux terribles c'est de cette demeure au monde inaccessible que l'on passe à l'éternité a venerable grove of oak tree which formerly surround the monastery be cut down in the revolution in the gateway of the outer court be a statue of saint bernard which have be mutilate by the republican : he be hold in one hand a church and in the other a spade -- the emblem of devotion and labor this gateway lead into a court which open into a second enclosure and around that be the granary stable bakehouse and other office necessary to the abbey which have all be happily preserved owe to the fatigue of the journey the heat of the weather and have frequently be oblige to retrace we step from lose we way in the wood it be late before we arrive at the abbey to the west under the glow of the setting sun the forest be still tinge with the warmest yet softest color that fade fast away and as we descend towards the convent quicken we pace to reach it before the last gleam of evening depart there be a silence around we which at such a moment and in such a spot sink sorrowfully upon the heart just as i reach the gate the bell toll in so solemn and melancholy a tone that it vibrate through my whole frame and call strongly to mind the beautiful line in parisina : the convent bell be ring but mournfully and slow in the gray square turret swing with a deep sound to and fro heavily to the heart they go on enter the gate a lay-brother receive I on he knee and in a low and whisper voice inform I they be at vespers the stillness and gloom of the building -- the last ray of the sun scarcely penetrate through its window -- the deep tone of the monk chant the response which occasionally break the silence fill I with reverential emotion which i feel unwilling to disturb : it be necessary however to present my letter of introduction and frère charle the secrétaire soon after come out and receive I with great civility he appear a young man about five-and-twenty with a handsome and prepossessing countenance he inform I that the père abbé be then absent visit a convent of female trappiste a few league distant but that he should be happy to show I every attention and request that in go over the convent i would neither speak nor ask he any question in those place where i see he kneel or in the presence of any of the monk i follow he to the chapel where as soon as the service be over the bell ring to summon they to supper range in double row with they head envelop in a large cowl and bent down to the earth they chant the grace and then seat themselves during the repast one of they stand read passage from scripture remind they of death and of the shortness of human existence another go round the whole community and on he knee kiss they foot in succession throw himself prostrate on the floor at interval before the image of we savior a third remain on he knee the whole time and in that attitude take he repast these penitent have commit some fault or neglect they religious duty of which accord to the regulation they have accuse themselves and be in consequence doom to the above mode of penance the refectory be furnish with long wooden table and bench each person be provide with a trencher a jug of water and a cup have on it the name of the brother to whom it be appropriate as frère paul frère françois & c which name they assume on take the vow they supper consist of bread soak in water a little salt and two raw carrot place by each water alone be they beverage the dinner be vary with a little cabbage or other vegetable : they very rarely have cheese and never meat fish or egg the bread be of the coarsest kind possible they bed be a small truckle board with a single cover generally a blanket no mattress nor pillow and as in the former time no fire be allow but one in the great hall which they never approach within these three year a small cabaret have be build near the convent for the accommodation of those who may occasionally visit it the building that remain be but barely sufficient for they own member which have be rapidly increase since its restoration in this cabaret i take up my abode for the night in preference to the accommodation very kindly offer I by frère charle and retire to rest wearied with the day 's excursion and fully satisfied that all i have hear all i have imagine of la trappe be infinitely short of the reality and that no adequate description could be give of its awful and dreary solitude monsieur elzéar de sabran in a poem call le repentir lately publish describe this monastery say very justly témoins d'une commune et secrète souffrance ces frères de douleur martyr de l'espérance d'une lente torture épuisant les degrés constamment réunis constamment séparés l'un à l'autre étrangers à côté l'un de l'autre joignent tout ce malheur encore à tout le nôtre jamais dans ses pareils cherchant un tendre appuus un coeur ne s ` ouvre aux coeur qui souffrent comme lui the follow morning the matin bell summon I to the convent and frère charle attend I to the burial ground here have be deposit the remains of two of the brother decease since the restoration of they order in 1814 another grave be ready prepare as soon as a interment take place one be always open for the next that may die the two grave be mark with simple wooden cross bear the follow inscription : f nicolas frère donné décédé le 24 février 1816 \* \* \* \* \* on the other : f augustinus novitius die 26 mensis novembris anno 1816 decessit requiescat in pace aman \* \* \* \* \* in the center of the cemetery be the grave of m de rancé he monument with he figure carve at full length in a recumbent posture be remove when the destruction of the old church take place it be now a complete ruin and a few stone alone mark the spot of its ancient founder 's grave which be keep free from weed with pious reverence and care the revolution which like a torrent sweep all before it do not even spare the dead -lrb- illustration : ruin of the ancient church of la trappe -rrb- while i be contemplate the ruin around I and watch the motion of a venerable figure in silent prayer at one of the angle the bell toll when both frère charle and the monk drop instantly on they knee how forcibly be the follow line of pope recall to my mind lo the strike deer in some sequester would part lie down to die -lrb- the arrow in he heart -rrb- there hide in shades and waste day by day inly he bleed and pants he soul away the number of monk who have take the vow be not in proportion to the other who be lay brother and _ frères donnés _ in all there be about one hundred besides novice who be principally compose of boy and who do not wear the same habit the trappiste who compose the first order be clothe in dark brown with brown mantle and hood the other be in white with brown mantle and hood i occasionally catch a glimpse of they face but it be only momentarily and i can easily believe with they perpetual silence that two people well know to each other might inhabit the same spot without ever be aware of it so completely be they face hide by they large cowl the trappiste or first order be distinguish by the appellation of _ frères conver _ the other by that of _ religieux de coeur _ the hardship undergo by these monk appear almost insupportable to human nature and notwithstanding the immense number of death occasion by they rigorous austerity the cénobites of la trappe at the suppression of they order amount to one hundred monk sixty-nine lay brother and fifty-six _ frères donnés _ the inmate be class under these three head but the lay brother who take the same vow and follow the same rule be principally employ as servant and in transact the temporal concern of the abbey the _ frères donnés _ be brother give for a time these last be not properly belong to the order they be rather religious person whose business or connexion prevent they join the order absolutely but who wish to renew serious impression or to retire from the world for a give period come here and conform strictly to the regulation while they remain without wish to join the order for life many person on they first conversion or after some peculiar dispensation of providence retire here for a season in the refectory i observe a board hang up with _ table pour l'office divin _ write over it and under it the regulation or order of service to be perform for that week which be occasionally varied but never diminish in they rigor frère charle say that the whole be strictly observe and be frequently much more severe for the père abbé have institute more austere regulation than formerly with the only one exception of the sick being allow medicine and in case of great debility a small quantity of meat the table _ pour l'office divin _ be as follow dimanche12 leçons et communion lundi 3 leçons mardi12 leçons -- à jeun -- travail mercredi12 leçons jeudi 3 leçons vendredi12 leçons -- à jeun -- travail samedi12 leçons -- à jeun -- travail they mode of life and regulation exist nearly in the same state as establish by the founder in recite they such horrible perversion of human nature and reason make it almost difficult to believe the existence of so severe a order and lead we to wonder at the artificial misery which the ingenuity of pious but morbid enthusiasm can inflict upon itself the abstinence practice at la trappe allow not the use of meat fish egg or butter and a very limited quantity of bread and vegetable they only eat twice a day which meal consist of a slender repast at about eleven in the morning and two ounce of bread and two raw carrot in the evening : both together do not at any time exceed twelve ounce the same spirit of mortification be observable in they cell which be very small and have no other furniture than a bed of board a human skull and a few religious book silence be at all time rigidly maintain conversation be never permit : should two of they even be see standing near each other though pursue they daily labor and preserve the strictest silence it be consider as a violation of they vow and highly criminal each member be therefore as completely insulate as if he alone exist in the monastery none but the père abbé know the name age rank or even the native country of any member of the community : every one at he first entrance assume another name as i before observe and with he former appellation each be suppose to abjure not only the world but every recollection and memorial of himself and connexion : no word ever escape from he lip by which the other can possibly guess who he be or where he come from and person of the same name family and neighborhood have often live together in the convent for year unknown to each other without have suspect they proximity the abstraction of mind practice at la trappe and the prevention of all external communication with the world be such that few but the superior know any thing of what be pass in it it have be relate that so little information of the affair of mankind do these people receive that the death of loui xiv be not know there for year except by the father abbé and such be they state of seclusion that a nobleman have take a journey of five hundred mile purposely to see the monastery could scarcely find in the neighbouring village one person who know where it be situate indeed at the present day it be quite astonishing how little be know of this place and how very few even among those in its immediate vicinity have ever visit it -lrb- 1 -rrb- on the great festival they rise at midnight otherwise they be not call until three quarter past one : at two they assemble in the chapel where they perform different service public and private until seven in the morning accord to the regulation of the week as exemplify in the _ table pour l'office divin _ at this hour they go out to labor in the open air they work be of the most fatiguing kind be never intermit winter or summer and admit of no relaxation from the state of the weather -lrb- footnote 1 : among the most frequent visitor of la trappe be the unfortunate jame the second he first visit be on the 20th November 1690 where he be receive by m de rancé whose account of it be very interesting -rrb- when they labor be over they go into chapel for a short time until eleven o'clock the hour of repast at a quarter after eleven they read till noon and afterwards lie down to rest for a hour : they be then summon into the garden where they again work until three then read again for three quarter of a hour and retire for another quarter to they private meditation by way of preparation for vespers which begin at four and end at six at seven they again enter the chapel and at eight they leave it and retire to rest at the hour of they first repast i again attend frère charle to the eating-room where nearly the same form be observe as at they evening-meal a small basin of boil cabbage two raw carrot and a small piece of black bread with a jug of water constitute they solitary meal a monk during the whole time read sentence from scripture and a small hand-bell fill up the interval of he silence and proclaim a cessation from eat or movement of any sort over the door of the refectory i observe the follow inscription in latin : -- better be a dinner of herb where love be than a stall ox and hatred therewith frère charle invite I to partake of the frugal fare of he order he say you will forgive my lay before you a vegetable repast it be all that i have in my power to offer you but you will confer a pleasure by accept it it be impossible to refuse for i feel i should appear ungrateful after the attention that have be show I if i have frère charle conduct I into a apartment in which i be gratify to observe a well execute portrait of the abbé de rancé which at the destruction of the monastery have be preserve by the surgeon of the ancient fraternity who continue to reside there until the period of he death four or five year since this person be greatly respect by all the people round the country and resort to by all who seek relief either from sickness or misery -- have the other brother follow he example of remain in all probability they convent might have be spare for the accumulation of wealth could not be lay to they charge and as they monastic vow oblige they to remain within the monastery they be most unlikely to incur the suspicion of any political intrigue -- how indeed could man whose whole existence be pass in solitude and penance and who never converse even among themselves have be dangerous to those turbulent spirit who have overturn the government and all the religious institution of they country in the portrait the abbé be dress in the habit of the order a white gown and hood and sit with a book before he in which he appear to be write on the same table before he be a crucifix and a skull the follow inscription be paint in one corner by the artist : arm would le boutthillier de rance s ' r scauant et célèbre abbé réformateur de la trappe mort en 1700 à près de 77 an et de 40 an de la plus austère pénitence the monastery of

found under the auspices of saint bernard the first abbot of clairvaux the celebrated preacher in favor of the crusade many age however have elapse since its first institution when the father abbot de rancé the celebrated reformer of he time determine to become a member whose singular history and conversion be the subject of a poem by monsieur barthe the abbé de rancé become a monk of the benedictin order of la trappe in 1660 and he conversion be attribute to a lady whom he tenderly love they have be separate for some time by she parent she have write to he to remove she for the purpose of become unite in marriage he set off but during he journey she be seize with a fever and die totally ignorant of the circumstance he approach the house under cover of the night and get into she apartment through the window the first object he behold be the coffin which contain the body of he beloved mistress it have be make of lead but be find to be too short they have with unheard of brutality sever she head from she body horror-struck with the shocking spectacle he from that hour renounce all connexion with the world and impose upon himself the most rigid austerity which he continue until he death forty year after when m de rancé undertake the superintendance of the monastery it exhibit a melancholy picture of the greatest declension and it be curious to peruse the step by which he effect so wonderful a change -lrb- 2 -rrb- and how man could ever feel it either a inclination or a duty to enter upon a mode of life so different from the common way of think or feeling -lrb- footnote 2 : règlements de l'abbaye la maison-dieu notre dame de la trappe par dom armand de rancé -rrb- the monk of la trappe be not only immerse in luxury and sloth but be abandon to the most

de rancé live forty year at the head of this singular society and the same ardor and piety continue to distinguish he to the last the excess of self-denial and discipline exercise by this order which might readily be doubt become more known especially to this country at the time of the french revolution when they share the fate of dissolution with the various religious order in france on that occasion many of they seek a asylum in england and be settle in dorsetshire where they receive the kind protection and benevolent assistance of mr weld until the restoration enable most of they to return and surprising as it may appear in the present age notwithstanding the perpetual violence impose by they regulation on every human feeling many be find anxious to enter the establishment when i be about to take my leave of frère charle he say he hope i be please with my humble fare : to such as it be i have be truly welcome indeed he have treat I with the kindest most unaffected hospitality he have lay the table spread the dish before I stand the whole time by the side of my chair and press I to eat : how could i not be thankful i request he would be seat but he observe that it be not proper for he to be so he manners and general deportment bespeak he a well-bred gentleman and when i venture to ask if i might make a memorandum of he name he bow he head with meekness and resignation and say i have now no other but that which be bestow on I when i take the vow which sever I from the world for ever it be impossible not to be affect at the manner and tone of voice in which he utter this when i say that perhaps he would like that i should leave a acknowledgment in write expressive of the gratitude i feel at my kind and hospitable reception he appear much pleased and instantly procure I paper i leave with he the follow line : convent of la trappe July 20 1817 i have this day visit the convent of la trappe and in the absence of the grand prior to whom i bring a letter of introduction from monsieur lamorelie sub-prefect of mortagne i be receive and have be entertain by frère charle marie he secretary it be quite impossible that i can do justice to the kind polite and hospitable reception i have meet with from he by any expression in write i can only observe that it have make a impression on my mind never to be efface if these worthy and pious people have abandon the world for the solitude and austerity of la trappe they have not forget in they own self-denial the benevolence and benignity due to stranger may they self-devotion meet with its reward i now take my leave of the convent with feeling which i will not pretend to describe but which together with the impression i receive when i first enter it and the whole circumstance of my visit i be conscious of retain while memory hold she seat the follow line by p mandard on quit la trappe convey a very faithful and poetical picture of this extraordinary solitude : -- saint désert séjour pur et paisible solitude profonde au vice inaccessible impétueux torren et vous sombres forêts recevez mes adieux comme aussi mes regret toujor épris de vous respectable retraite puissé-je dan le cours d'une vie inquiète dans ce flux éternel de folie et d'erreur où flotte tristement notre malheureux coeur puissé-je pour charmer me ennuis et mes peines souvent fuir en esprit au bord de vos fontaines egarer ma

day after my arrival there for the val-dieu which lie three league to the east of mortagne take the village of rinrolle and prepotin in my way the latter stand in the midst of a forest by this road so bad that it scarcely deserve the name a great distance be save but the romantic scenery of the approach to la trappe be lose the one we take through the forest of bellegarde more than double the distance but the abbey be see as in the center of a lake beneath and the continual beauty and wildness of the landscape render it far preferable until the revolution this be the only road the other have be make when the land become national property and be sell to the peasantry after pass through the above village we come round by tourouvre a village on a height which have a manufactory for glass i do not stop to view it have several league to go through a wooded country soon after cross the main road lead into bretagne we ride by the side of cultivate land and orchard resemble the western part of devonshire of which the narrow lane and high hedge remind I very much until we enter the forest lead to the val-dieu between eight and nine in the evening we come to the edge bound that part of the vale by which it be approach in the direction we have take it be very considerably out of we way owe to the guide have mistake he road and turn to the leave instead of the right after rest a few minute on the brow of the hill we begin we descent by a steep and narrow pathway when we be midway down the glen the ruin of the ancient chartreuse suddenly burst upon the view at this moment all the terror of the declivity and the momentary expectation of meet some of the wolf with which the forest abound vanish from my mind before the feeling of delight which the enchanting scene call forth the almost perpendicular view of the vale beneath have a effect tremendous yet please : on the left be a lake seem to encircle a ancient convent embosome in a wood a thick forest cover the surround height and before I stand the remains of the ancient priory with its gateway and lodge so perfect as to create no suspicion of the destruction within -lrb- illustration : ruin of the gateway of the ancient chartreuse -rrb- this have be the hottest day and finest weather i have experience during my journey it be a sweet evening and the rich tint of the depart sun-beam among the wood with the solitary calmness of the scenery around be circumstance that make a strong impression on my feeling those who have never traverse the forest of this country can form but a very imperfect idea of what they be or of the death-like awful stillness that reign within they for many mile together they form a dense shade which like a dark awning completely conceal the sun from the view : even on the brightest day the sun 's ray be only visible as from the bottom of a deep well the forest in le perche be reckon the most extensive in france and every where abound with vast quantity of game i be receive on alight from my horse by a m boderie a good humored hospitable man who with he family be the only inhabitant of this lonesome spot i find afterwards that he have see better day : he inform I the val-dieu property be purchase at the dissolution of the monastery by the present proprietor who reside at paris and allow he be he friend to occupy that part of the building which have not be destroy he make many apology for the badness of the accommodation and the homeliness of the fare he have to offer I which i consider as unnecessary as what he possess be tender with unaffected cheerfulness the prussian in 1815 occupy this country and notwithstanding m boderie be absent at that time serve in the body guard of loui xviii whom he have accompany in he retreat to ghent they plunder he of every article not even leave he wife a change of linen the numerous account i have hear from people of respectability and loyalty of the treatment experience from the prussian excite the greatest regret that they be not able to distinguish the innocent from the guilty many family have be ruin or greatly distressed in they circumstance who be devote to the cause of they sovereign such be the inevitable consequence of war the val-dieu extend upward of three mile in length surround by almost impenetrable wood except where path have be cut it have three lake one communicate with the other contain great quantity of fish the monastery it be evident from the remains of its ruin and from the boundary wall still entire must have be of prodigious extent m boderie inform I that the plan of which he have see a engraving show it to have be one of the most considerable in the kingdom : some idea may be form of its former celebrity and extent by the remains of six hundred fire-place be still traceable a colonnade surround the whole form a oblong square in the center of which be a jet d'eau with several smaller one the basin of which be still to be see the space within form a garden with delicious walk resemble those in the palais royal the gate-way remain perfect except only that the image over the side door have be mutilate the one in the center -lrb- over the great entrance -rrb- be still in excellent preservation and appear to be finely execute : it be the figure of the virgin mary in gray marble the size of life seat with the infant jesus in she arm on a scroll beneath be these letter : -- ecce mater tva 1760 several old chesnut tree and elm still remain which once form a fine avenue in front of the building from whence the prospect be strikingly beautiful the eye pass over rock rugged broken and abrupt towards they summit crown and darken with wood and the narrow road wind between the tree until it lose itself in the forest form a feature very gratifying to the traveller the solitude of the place as i view it at the close of day occasion mingled sensation of pleasure and pain it be impossible to resist the impose power of a situation where every natural object be deeply tinged with the poetical character and every remnant of architecture associate with the romance of religious feeling i recall and dwelt upon various passage of the poet inspire by similar scene and thought of the holy and enthusiastic mind which have here devote themselves to the sublimest duty and severest sacrifice of the altar and feel that have i live in those day i perhaps could have become a inmate of wall which seem to have be erect to exclude the evil of life and to nurture only the enchanting abstraction of unpolluted virtue and happiness : but the present day have bring with it a general philosophy and knowledge of human nature which lessen the delight of contemplate the calm repose of such a seclusion and have teach that these retreat from the world be not always retreat from vice that the sacrifice of monkish privacy be not always those of selfish feeling and that the austerity once practice here as now at la trappe might perhaps arise more frequently from disappointed pride and ambition than from the pure feeling of pious resignation in the overthrow of the monarchy and that of the priesthood this venerable pile become the object of popular vengeance and have the revolution do no more than effect the dissolution of the different order of monk and nun every reflect mind must have be please : the removal of those abuse like the division of land property into smaller portion -lrb- whereby the country in general become more cultivate and productive -rrb- be serviceable to france and if any circumstance can restore permanent tranquillity it will be the interest which the different landholder have in the soil and the representative system which will serve to check the ambition of its future governor already the good effect of these be to be perceive and the excessive abuse insolence and profligacy of ancient ministerial oppression which pave the way for the downfall of the monarchy and like a pestilence destroy that which be good with that which be evil will be prevent in future it be nevertheless melancholy to observe the trace of devastation visible in all direction : the people themselves appear not to regard it but this may arise partly from the long and habitual feeling generate by the scene to which the revolution daily give rise and partly from the constitutional cheerfulness of the native who seldom view object through the same dark medium that ours be suppose to do and who though they be not celebrate for patience be of all mankind the least liable to despondency when i speak to m boderie of my regret at the destruction of a ancient structure like the one in question he answer be immediately oui c'est bien malheureux mais enfin que voulez-vous he be desolé or have le coeur très sensible à tout celum but finish by il faut se consoler with this sort of philosophy they be always ready to view the past and accept of consolation and in amusement seek to bear or dissipate the calamity inseparable from such a state of event without even appear to repine none of they will ever enter into conversation on the subject if it can be avoid the follow day have take leave of my hospitable host who refuse any compensation i return to mortagne by another route through the forest of val-dieu more dark and difficult to penetrate than the other but the guide be better acquaint with it and take the road by saint maure and saint elous through a fine country highly cultivate and abound in beautiful scenery and distant landscape it be late at night before i reach mortagne greatly fatigue from the excessive

clisson vallet and loroux along the bank of the loire by pursue this route i have every where the interesting opportunity of explore the scene of that destructive warfare which have ravage the town and village of this part of france at one period the war of la vendée extend to the north of the loire as far as renne form a triangle the eastern point of which rest on the town of anger to the south of the loire it spread nearly as far as la rochelle and as in this part also it extend nearly to anger the tract over which it spread its ravages form nearly a square the district call loroux run

vendée les deux sèvres la loire inférieure and mayenne and loire la vendée be a extremely interesting district not merely on account of the singular and heroic warfare that be carry on there so long but also from the appearance of the country and the manners opinion and general character of its inhabitant and le bocage be in all these respects the most interesting part of la vendée in le bocage the war be carry on with most wonderful vigor and pertinacity as well as with almost unparalleled destruction and cruelty those who be acquaint only with the other part of france can form no idea of the aspect of this district or of the manners of its inhabitant they differ so widely and essentially that they seem to belong to another portion of the globe it have always be regard as the most fertile country in france and before the revolution it be undoubtedly one of the most populous there be only two road in the whole country : one of they run from nante to la rochelle and the other from bordeaux to tour through poitou : all the rest of this district be a complete labyrinth : there be indeed numerous pathway so very wind and narrow that they be much more calculate to harass and mislead than to assist a traveller in he journey : these pathway be flank by wide and deep ditch and almost render completely dark by lofty hedge on each side of they the tree of which meet at top and thus form a arch : hence they be rough and uneven in summer besides be intolerably hot and deep and miry in winter to add to these inconvenience the bed of a rivulet flow along they frequently constitute the only passage even when the traveller after toiling along these dreadful pathway come near a town or village he generally find that the approach to it be practicable only by ascend irregular step cut out of the solid rock on which they be build the inhabitant themselves even be frequently puzzle by these pathway and after wander for a considerable length of time at last find out that they have be travel in a wrong direction the whole country bear the appearance of a extensive and thick forest : this arise from the nature of the enclosure they be extremely small often not more than fifty or sixty perch surround with strong hedge plant in the bank these circumstance alone would give the appearance just notice but the effect be much increase from other cause on each side of the bank on which the tree be plant there be ditch and drain and the moisture which they constantly supply to they root render they growth very rapid and luxuriant so that when we consider the number of the tree and they great size we shall not be surprise that the country look like a immense forest sometimes the tree be so disposed as to answer the purpose of a palisade and this purpose they

favor by every natural advantage have a peculiar tactic which they know perfectly well how to apply to they position and local circumstance and adopt a mode of fight hitherto unknown and practicable in that country alone confident in the superiority which they mode of attack give they they never suffer themselves to be anticipate they never engage but when and where they please they dexterity in the use of fire arm be such that no people however well skilled in manoeuvring could make such good use of a gun the huntsman of loroux and the poacher of le bocage have be always proverbial as

while at the plough the latter unable from the distance to recognize he son and see only the uniform of a enemy fire and shoot he they attack be always dreadful sudden and almost unforeseen because it be very difficult to reconnoitre or obtain information so as to guard against surprise they order of battle be generally in the form of a crescent they wing be compose of the most expert marksman who never fire without take aim and seldom ever miss they retreat be so precipitate that it be difficult to come up with they as they disperse themselves through rough field hedge wood and bush know all

particularly to the inhabitant the canal be in general from thirty to forty foot wide on the upper extremity of the bank the vendean carry he musket in a bandoleer and lean upon a long pole leap from one bank to the other with amazing facility when the pressure of the enemy would not admit of he do this without expose himself to they fire he throw himself into a niole -lrb- a kind of small boat -rrb- very flat and light and cross the canal with great rapidity be always sufficiently shut up to hide himself from he pursuer : but he soon appear again and firing at he enemy again disappear the republican soldier to whom this mode of fighting be unknown be oblige to be continually upon he guard to march along the shore of the canal and to follow slowly they circuitous track support at the same time frequent skirmish while it take he several hour to traverse a space which the vendean commonly accomplish in a few minute among the difficulty which the execution of all military plan meet with in la vendée the nature and degree of which may be judge of from the local disposition and the kind of warfare carry on by the royalist there be one which be invincible and which singularly retard the operation of the republican whenever they be desirous of send a order from head quarter to a division at the distance of twelve or fifteen league the messenger be often oblige to travel fifty or sixty in order to avoid pass through the revolted country hence the impossibility of attempt any expedition however necessary or desirable which require to be execute without delay the vendean would appear one day at a certain point to the number of several thousand man measure be concerted for attack they the next day but before that arrive they be eight or ten league distant from the place where they have show themselves the day before thus be the republican expose to fruitless victory or disastrous check which exhaust they man and resource master of the field of battle they find say one of they general nothing but wooden shoe and some slay never any arm or ammunition the vendean when perceive would either hide or break he gun and in surrender he life seldom leave he weapon be well acquaint with the country and more dexterous than the republican they carry scarcely any artillery with they four or five piece suffice for a army of thirty or forty thousand man these be generally light field piece equally spare of ammunition they take but few waggon one alone serve the piece as they well know it be not artillery that would procure they the victory thence when the republican meet with any disastrous affair they lose from twenty to thirty piece of cannon and waggon in proportion whereas when they gain a victory they acquire only two or three piece of cannon with scarcely any ammunition from this slight sketch of the nature of the country so disadvantageous to the invader and of the mode in which the vendean carry on this unfortunate war we surprise will cease at the determine and protracted resistance make to the republican by this loyal and brave people for many year they defend they beloved country and endure privation and accumulate misery such as human nature have seldom be expose to to use the word of a republican general a girdle of fire envelop the revolt country fire terror and death precede the march but the principal cause of the long resistance of the vendean must be seek for in they moral character they be most honourably distinguish by a inviolable attachment to they party and unlimited and unshaken confidence in they chief and a earnest warm but steady zeal which supply the place of discipline they invincible courage both active and passive be proof against every kind of danger fatigue and want it have be well observe that irregular and undisciplined war be naturally far more prolific of extraordinary incident unexpected turn of fortune and striking display of individual talent of vice and virtue than the more solemn movement of national hostility where every thing be in a great measure provide and foresee and where the inflexible subordination of rank and the severe exaction of a limited duty not only take away the inducement but the opportunity for those exaltation of personal feeling and adventure which produce the most lively interest and lead to the most animating result in the unconcerted proceedings of a insurgent population all be experiment and all be passion the heroic daring of a simple peasant lift he at once to the rank of a leader and kindle a general enthusiasm to which all thing become possible from the operation of these cause the vendean be enable to send forth formidable army : and such be the confidence of the chief in the troops that they never would have be subdue if they have not lose they leader in the various hard fight action or be deprive of they service by they mutual jealousy another circumstance prove equally fatal to they after the fall of the gallant lescure they most imprudently quit the strong country for the open plain on the left bank of the loire chap vii river loire from nante to anger the loire be one of the finest river in france and perhaps there be no river in the world that equal that part of it which flow from anger to nante : the breadth of the stream the island of wood the boldness culture and richness of its bank all conspire to render it worthy of this character as a useful river it be equally celebrate : its bank be border by rich and populous city and the benefit it render to industry and commerce be incalculable its stream be so
