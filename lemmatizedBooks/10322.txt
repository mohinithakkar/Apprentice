draw she shawl closer but it be so late and what would they think at home she be ashamed to go home she father would look at she from under he eyebrow and she mother would exclaim why marjorie she would rather that she father would look at she from under he eyebrow than that she mother would say why _ marjorie _ she mother never scold and sometimes she almost wish she would it would be a relief if somebody would scold she tonight she would stick a pin into herself if it would do any good _ she _ photograph would not be in the group next time she look across at the frame photograph on the

she pencil and write each of the seven word five time more to be _ sure _ they be all right josie gray call she horridly conscientious and even rie blauvelt wish that she would not think it wicked to tell in the class and to whisper about something else when they have permission to whisper about the lesson by this time you have learn that my little marjorie be strong and sweet i wish you might have see she that afternoon as she crouch over the wooden desk snuggle down in the coarse plaid shawl she elbow rest on the hard desk she chin drop in she two plump hand with she eye fix on the long closely write column of she large slate she be not sit in she own seat she seat be the back seat on the girl ' side of course but she be sit midway on the boy ' side and she slate be place on the side of the double desk wherein hr be cut in deep ugly letter she have flee to this seat as to a refuge when she find herself alone with something of the same feeling that once two or three year ago when she be away from home and homesick she use to kneel to say she prayer in the corner of the chamber where she valise be there be home about the valise and there be protection and safety and a sort of helpfulness about this desk where she friend holli rheid have sit ever since she have come to school this be she first winter at school she mother have teach she at home but in family council this winter it have be decide that marjorie be big enough to go to school the half mile home seem a long way to walk alone and the huge newfoundland at the farmhouse down the hill be not always chained he

and have telegraph something back to she as he pause for one instant at the door not quite understand the telegraphic signal she be wait for he or for something he lip have look like : wait till i come if the people at home be not anxious about she she would have be willing to wait until midnight it would never occur to she that holli might forget she she cheek flush as she wait and she eye fill with tear it be a soft warm round face with coax kissable lip a smooth low brow and the gentlest of hazel eye : not a pretty face excepting in its lovely childishness and its hint of womanly grace some of the girl say she be homely marjorie think herself that she be very homely but she have comfort herself with god make my face and he like it this way some one say that god make the other feature but permit we to make the mouth marjorie 's sweetness certainly make she mouth but then she be bear sweet josie gray declare that she would rather see a girl get mad than cry as marjorie do when the boy wash she face in the snow mr holme have write to a friend that marjorie west he favorite among the girl be almost too sweet he say to himself that he fear she lack character marjorie 's quiet observant father would have smile at that and say nothing the teacher say that she do not know how to take she own part marjorie have be eleven year in this grasp world and have not learn that she have any part to take since she pencil have cease scribble the room be so still that a tiny mouse have be nibble at the toe of she shoe just then as she raise she head and pin she shawl more securely the door open and something happen the something happen in marjorie 's face holli rheid think the sunset have burst across it she do not exclaim oh i be so glad but the gladness be all in she eye if marjorie have be more give to exclamation she eye would not have be so expressive the closed lip be a gain to the eye and she friend miss nothing the boy have learn she eye by heart how stoutly he would have resist if some one have tell he that year hence marjorie 's face would be a sealed volume to he but she be make she eye and mouth to-day and year hence she make they too perhaps he have something to do with it then as he certainly have something to do with it now i come back with my sled to take you home i give sam my last ten cent to do the night work for I it be my turn but he be willing enough where 's you hood mousie any book to take yes my geography and arithmetic she answer take she fleecy white hood from the seat behind she now you look like a sunbeam in a cloud he say poetically as she tie it over she brown head oh ho turn to the blackboard you do make handsome figure get they all right do you i know how to do they it be only that -- i forget i do not think you 'll forget again in a hurry and that be a nice look slate too he add step nearer mother say it be too much of a strain on you nervous system to write all that i guess i have not much of a nervous system return marjorie seriously the girl write the word they miss fifty time last Friday and he warn we about the one hundred to-day i suppose it will be one hundred and fifty next Friday i do not believe i 'll _ ever _ miss again she say she lip tremble at the mention of it i think i 'll have a word or two to say to the master if you do i wonder how linnet would have take it she would not have miss i 'll ask mr holme to put you over on the boy side if you miss next week he cry mischievously and make you sit with we all the afternoon i would rather write each word five hundred time she cry

very schoolhouse he know as much as mr holme then he must be a solomon laugh the boy the stamp of holli ' boot and the sound of he laughter have frighten the mouse back into its hiding-place in the chimney marjorie would not have frighten the mouse all day long the book be push into she satchel she desk arrange in perfect order she rubber and red mitten draw on and she stand ready satchel in hand for she ride on the sled down the slippery hill where the boy and girl have coast at noon and then she would ride on over the snowy road half a mile to the old brown farmhouse she eye be subdue a little but the sunshine linger all over she face she know holli would come he smile down at she with he superior fifteen-year-old smile she be such a wee mousie and always need take care of if he could have a sister he would want she to be like marjorie he be very much like marjorie himself just as shy just as sensitive hardly more fit to take he own part and i think marjorie be the braver of the two he be slow-tempered and unforgiving if a friend fail he once he never take he into confidence again he be proud where marjorie be humble he give he service she give herself he seldom quarrel but never be the first to yield they be both mixture of reserve and frankness both speaking as often out of a shut heart as a open heart but when marjorie could open she heart oh how she open it as for holli i think he have never open he demonstrative sympathy be equally the key to the heart of both but here i be analyze they before they have learn they have any self to analyze but they exist all the same marjorie be a plain little body while holli be noticeably handsome with eloquent brown eye and hair with its golden boyish beauty just shade into brown he sensitive mobile lip be prettier than any girl 's and there be no voice in school like he in tone or culture mr holme be a elocutionist and have take great pain with holli rheid 's voice there be a courteous gentleness in he manner all he own if knighthood mean purity goodness truth and manliness then holli rheid be a knightly school-boy the youngest of five rough boy with a stern narrow-minded father and a mother who love she boy with all she heart and yet for herself have no aim beyond kitchen and dairy he have not learn he refinement at home i think he have not _ learn _ it anywhere marjorie 's mother insist that holli rheid must have have a pray grandmother away back somewhere the master have write to he friend miss prudence pomeroy that holli rheid be a bear gentleman and have add with more justice and penetration than he have show in read marjorie he have too little application and be too mischievous to become a real student but i be not look for genius in a country school marjorie and holli be bright enough for every purpose in life excepting to become leader be you go to church to-night holli inquire as she seat herself carefully on the sled in the church she ask brace she foot and tuck the end of she shawl around they yes a evangelist be go to preach evangelist repeat marjorie in a voice with a thrill in it do not you know what that be ask hollis harness himself into the sled oh yes indeed say she i know about he and christian holli look perplexed this must be one of marjorie 's queer way of express something and the strange preacher certainly have something to do with christian if it be not for the fraction i suppose i might go i wish i be not stupid about arithmetic it be no matter if girl be stupid he say consolingly be you sure you be on tight i be go to run pretty soon you will not have to earn you living by make figure shall you she inquire with some anxiety of course i shall have not i be three time through the arithmetic and once through the algebra that i may support myself and somebody else sometime this seem very grand to child marjorie who find fraction a very slough of despond i be go to the city as soon as uncle jack find a place for I i expect a letter from he every night perhaps it will come to-night say marjorie not very hopefully i hope it will and so this may be you last ride on flyaway enjoy it all you can mousie marjorie enjoy everything all she could now hurrah he shout start on a quick run down the hill i be go to turn you over into the brook marjorie laugh she joyous little laugh i be not afraid she say in absolute content you would better be he retort in he most savage tone the whole west be now in a glow and the glorious light stretch across field of snow oh how splendid marjorie exclaim breathlessly as the rapid motion of the sled and the rush of cold air carry she breath away hold on tight he cry mockingly we be come to the brook laugh aloud she hold on tight holli be she true knight she would not have be afraid to cross the alp on that sled if he have ask she to she be in a talkative mood to-night but she horse prance on and would not listen she want to tell he about _ vibgyor _ the half mile be quickly travel and he whirl the sled through the large gateway and around the house to the kitchen door the long l at the back of the house seem full of door there mousie here you be he exclaim and do not you miss you lesson to-morrow to-morrow be Saturday oh i have forget and i can go to see evangelist to-night you have not say ` thank you ' for you last ride on flyaway i will when i be sure that it be she return with she eye laugh he turn she over into a snowdrift and run off whistle spring up she brush the snow off face and hand and with a very serious face enter the kitchen the kitchen be long and low bright with the sunset shine in at two window and cheery with its carpeting of red yellow and green mingled confusingly in the handsome oilcloth unlike holli marjorie be the outgrowth of home influence the kitchen oilcloth have something to do with she view of life and she mother 's broad face and good-humored eye have a great deal more good-humor in the mother have develop sweet humor in the child now i wonder if you understand marjorie well enough to understand all she do and all she leave undo during the come fifteen or twenty year ii evangelist the value of a thought can not be tell -- _ bailey _ she mother 's broad gingham back and the twist of iron gray hair low in she neck greet she as she open the door then the odor of hot biscuit intrude itself and then there come a shout from somebody

you very shyly glad of the opportunity and yet dread it inexpressibly marjorie hang she school clothing away and lay she satchel on the shelf in the hall closet and then stand wavering in the closet wonder if she dare go in to see evangelist he have speak very kindly to christian she long oh how she long to find the wicket gate but would she dare ask any question last sabbath in church she have see a sweet beautiful face that she persuade herself must be mercy and now to have evangelist come to she very door what be there to know any better about she do not care if linnet have laugh linnet never care to read _ pilgrim 's progress _ it be on record that the first book a child read intensely be the book that will influence all the life at ten marjorie have read _ pilgrim 's progress _ intensely timidly with shine eye she stand one moment upon the red mat outside the parlor door and then with sudden courage turn the knob and enter at a glance she feel that there be no need of courage evangelist be seat comfortably in the horse-hair rocker with he foot to the fire rest on the camp stool he do not look like evangelist at all she think disappointedly he remind she altogether more of a picture of santa claus : massive head and shoulder white beard and moustache ruddy cheek and as the head turn quickly at she entrance she behold beneath the shaggy white brow twinkle blue eye ah he exclaim in a abrupt voice you be the little girl they be expect home from school yes sir he extend a plump white hand and not at all shyly marjorie lay she hand in it be not it late to come

ask nobody love story better than marjorie push she mother 's spring rocker nearer the fire she sit down arrange the skirt of she dress and prepared herself not to entertain he but to listen do you

beauty and remember that god make the garden the field and the sky and the thought come to he : ` can not the same god give I memory also ' then he kneel at the foot of he bed and pour out he soul in prayer the prayer be wonderfully answer on begin to study again he find himself master of he hard lesson and after that he acquire learn with great readiness it be wonderful marjorie thought and beautiful but she could not say that she ask instead : do he write about it himself yes he have write all about himself when i be six i do not know my small letter be he so bright because he be french the gentleman laugh and remark that the french be a pretty bright nation be that all you know about he oh no indeed there be a large book of he memoirs in my library he visit many of the crown head of europe there be another question form on marjorie 's lip but at that instant she mother open the door now she would hear no more about stephen grellet and she could not ask about the wicket gate or mercy or the child rise in she pretty respectful manner she give she mother the spring rocker and push a ottoman behind the stove and seat herself where she might watch evangelist 's face as he talk how the talk drift in this direction marjorie do not understand she know it be something about find the will of the lord but a story be come and she listen with she listening eye on he face i have be think that god would certainly reveal he will if we inquire of he feel sure of that for some time and then i have this experience marjorie 's mother enjoy experience as well as marjorie enjoy story and she like nothing better than to relate she own after hear a experience she usually begin now i will tell you mine marjorie think she know every one of she mother 's experience but it be evangelist who be speak the little girl in the brown and blue plaid dress with red stocking and button boot bent forward as she sit half conceal behind the stove and drink in every word with intent wonder unquestioning eye she mother listen also with eye as intent and believe and year afterward recall this true experience when she be tempt to take marjorie 's happiness into she own hand she own unwise haste-making hand my wife have be dead about two year begin evangelist again speak in a retrospective tone i have two little child the elder not eight year old and my sister be my housekeeper she do not like housekeeping nor take care of child some woman do not she come to I one day with a very serious face ` brother ' say she ` you need a wife you must have a wife i do not know how to take care

peter i draw back and say ` not so lord ' my first wife be a continual spiritual help to I she be the lord 's own messenger every day but this lady although a church member be not particularly spiritually mind several year before she have be my pupil in hebrew and greek i admire she intellectual gift but if a brother in the ministry have ask I if she would be a helpful wife to he i should have hesitate about reply in the affirmative and yet here it be the lord have choose she for I i say ` not so lord ' until he assure I that she heart be in he hand and he could fit she to become my wife and a mother to my child after wait until i know i be obey the mind of my master i ask she to marry I she accept as far as she own heart and will be concerned but refuse because she father a rich and worldly-minded man be not willing for she to marry a itinerant preacher i have not have a charge for three year then i be so continually call to help other pastor that i have no time for a charge of my own so it keep on for month and month she father be not willing and she would not marry I without he consent my sister often say to I ' i do not see how you can want to marry a woman that be not willing to have you ' but i keep my own counsel i know the matter be in safe hand i be not at all troubled i keep about my master 's business and he keep about mine therefore when she write to say that suddenly and unexpectedly she father have withdraw all opposition i be not in the least surprised my sister declare i be plucky to hold on but the lord hold on for I i feel as if i have nothing to do with it and a better wife and mother god never bless one of he servant with she could do something beside read the bible in hebrew she could practice it in english for forty year -lrb- miss text

marjorie 's mother emphatically now tell I about all the young people in you village how many have you that be unconverted be holli one of they marjorie wonder with a beating heart would evangelist talk to he would he kiss he and give he a smile and bid he god speed but -- she begin to doubt -- perhaps there be another evangelist and this be not the very one in _ pilgrim 's progress _ somehow he do not seem just like that one might she dare ask he how would she say it before she be aware she thought have become a speak thought in the interval of quiet while she mother be count the young people in the village she be very much astonished to hear she own timid bold little voice inquire : be there more than one evangelist why yes child she mother answer absently and evangelist begin to tell she about some of the evangelist he be acquaint with wonderful man wonderful man he repeat before another question could form itself on she eager lip she father enter and give the stranger a

smile on he thin lip iii what desultory mean a rose with all its sweetest leave yet fold miss prudence o miss prudence it be summer time and marjorie be almost fourteen year old she soul be look out of troubled eye to-day just now life be all one unanswered question marjorie o marjorie mimic miss prudence i do not know what _ desultory _ mean say marjorie and you do not know where to find a dictionary must not i ask you question when i can find the answer myself ask marjorie straightforwardly i think it be rather impertinent do not you yes consider marjorie rather miss prudence be a fair vision in marjorie 's eye and marjorie be a radiant vision in miss prudence 's eye the radiant vision be not clothe in gorgeous apparel the radiance be in the face and voice and in every motion the apparel be simply a stiffly starch blue muslin that have once belong to linnet and have be let down for marjorie and she head be crown with a broad-brimmed straw hat around the crown of which be tie a somewhat fade blue ribbon also a relic of linnet 's summer day she linen collar be fasten with a old-fashioned pin of she mother 's she boot be new and neatly fitting she father have make they especially for herself she sense of the fitness of thing be sometimes outraged one of the reason why she long to grow up be that she might have thing of she own thing buy for she and make for she as they always be for linnet but linnet be pretty and good and be go away to school the fair vision be clothe in white a soft white that fall in fold and have no kinship with starch marjorie have never see this kind of white dress before it be a part of miss prudence 's loveliness the face be oval and delicate with little color in the lip and less in the cheek smooth black hair be brush away from the thoughtful forehead and underneath the heavily pencil black brow large believe gray eye look unquestioningly out upon the world unlike marjorie miss prudence 's question have be answer she would have tell marjorie that it be because she have ask she question of one who know how to answer she be swing in she hammock on the back porch this back porch look over towards the sea a grass plat touch the edge of the porch and then come the garden it be a kitchen garden and stretch down to the flat rock and beyond the flat rock be the sand and the sea marjorie have walk two mile and a half this hot afternoon to spend two or three hour with she friend miss prudence miss prudence be board at marjorie 's grandfather 's this be the second summer that she have be at this farmhouse by the sea she be the lady of whom marjorie have catch a glimpse so long ago in church and call she mercy throw aside she hat marjorie drop down on the floor of the porch so near the gently sway hammock that she might touch the soft white drapery and in a position to watch miss prudence 's face i do not see the use of learn something marjorie begin that be if she could be say to begin anything with miss prudence the beginning of all she question have be so long ago so long ago to marjorie long ago to miss prudence be before marjorie be bear there be no book or papers in the hammock miss prudence have settle herself comfortably so comfortably that she be not conscious of inhabit she body when marjorie have unlatch the gate which one of the thing for instance in the interested voice there be not one trace of the delicious reverie she have be lose in punctuation say marjorie promptly and mr holme say we must be thorough in it i can not see the use of anything beside period and of course a comma once in a while a gleam of fun flash into the gray eye miss prudence be a bear pedagogue i 'll show you something i learn when i be a little girl and after this if you do not confess that punctuation have its work in the world i have nothing more to say about it marjorie have be fan herself with she broad brim she let it fall in she eagerness and she eye be two convincing argument against the truth of she own theory for they be two emphasize exclamation point sometimes when she be very eager she double herself up and make a interrogation point of herself up in my room on the table you will find paper and pencil please bring they to I marjorie fly away and miss prudence give herself up to she interrupted reverie to-day be one of miss prudence 's hard-working day that be it be follow by the effect of a hard-working day the day in which she feel too weak to do anything beside pray she count the successful day of she life she say they be the only day in she life in which she accomplish anything marjorie be at home in every part of she grandfather 's queer old house miss prudence 's room be she especial delight it be a low-studded chamber with three window look out to the sea the wide fireplace be open fill with bough of fragrant hemlock the smooth yellow floor with its coolness and sweet cleanliness invite you to enter there be round braided mat spread before the bureau and rude washstand and more pretentious one in size and beauty be lay in front of the red high-posted bedstead and over the brick hearth there be beside in the apartment two table a easy-chair with arm its cushion cover with red calico a camp stool three rush-bottomed chair a saratoga trunk intrude itself with ugly modernness also hang upon hook several article of clothing conspicuously among they a gray flannel bathing suit the window be drapery in dot swiss fasten back with green cord she grandmother would never have be guilty of those curtain marjorie be sure they have intimate connection with the saratoga trunk sunshine the salt-breath of the sea and the odor of pine wood as well there be rollick voice outside the window marjorie look out and spy she five little cousin play in the sand three of they hold in they hand half-eat the inevitable doughnut morning noon and night those child be to be find with doughnut in they hand she laugh and turn again to the contemplation of the room on the high mantel be a yellow pitcher that she grandmother know be a hundred year old and in the center of the mantel be arrange a sugar bowl and a vinegar cruet that miss prudence have coax away from the old lady she city friend would rave over they she say the old lady have laugh remark that city folk have way of they own i have give away a whole set of dish to folk that come in the yacht she say i should think you would rather have new dish miss prudence never dust she old possession she tell marjorie that she have not the heart to disturb the dust of age marjorie be tempt to linger and linger in winter this room be close and seem always bare and cold when she peep into it there be no temptation to stay one moment and now she have to tear herself away it must be miss prudence 's spirit that brood over it and give it sweetness and sunshine this be the way marjorie put the think to herself the child be very poetical when she live alone with herself miss prudence 's wicker work-basket with its dainty lining of rose-tinted silk its shine scissors and gold thimble with its spool and sea-green silk needlebook be a whole poem to the child she think the possession of one could make any kind of sew even darn stocking very delightful work stitch stitch stitch would not seem dreadful at all how mysterious and charming it be to board by the seashore with somebody 's grandfather and then in winter to go back to some bewildering sort of a fairyland to some kind of a world where people do not talk all the time about get along and save and do without and make both end meet how marjorie 's soul rebel against the constant repetition of those expression how she think she would never _ let _ she little girl know what one of they mean if she and she little girl have to be save and do without how brave they would be about it and laugh over it and never ding it into anybody 's ear and she would never constantly be ask what thing cost miss prudence never ask such question but she would like to know if that gold pen cost so very much and that glass inkstand shape like a pyramid and all that cream note-paper with maple tassel and autumn leave and butterfly and ever so many cunning thing paint in its left corner and there be a pile of foolscap on the table and some long yellow envelope and some old book and some new book and a ivory paper-cutter all something apart from the commonplace world she inhabit not apart from the world she thought and desire revel in not she hope for she have not get so far as to hope to live in a magical world like miss prudence and yet when miss prudence do not wear white she be robe in deep mourning there be sorrow in miss prudence 's magical world it be some few moment before the roving eye could settle themselves upon the paper and pencil she have be send for she would have like to choose a sheet of the thick cream-paper with the autumn leave paint on it but that be not for study and miss prudence certainly intended study although there be fun in she eye she select carefully a sheet of foolscap and from among the pen oils a nicely sharpen faber number three with the breath of the room about she and the beauty and restfulness of it make a glory in she eye she run down to the broad airy hall glance into the sitting-room as she pass its partly open door she discover she grandfather asleep in he arm-chair and she grandmother sit near he busy in slice apple to be string and hang up in the kitchen to dry with a shiver of forebode the child pass the door on tiptoe suppose she grandmother _ should _ call she in to string those apple the other child never string they to suit she and she admire marjorie 's way of do they marjorie say once that she hate apple blossom because they turn into dry apple but that be when she have stick the darn needle into she thumb i be afraid you will think now that marjorie be not as sweet as she use to be she present the paper congratulating herself upon she escape and miss prudence lift herself in the hammock and take the pencil hold it in she finger while she meditate what a little girl she be when she whiteheaded old teacher have bid she write this sentence on the blackboard she write it carefully marjorie 's attentive eye follow each movement of the pencil the person inside the coach be mr miller a clergyman he son a lawyer mr angelo a foreigner he lady and a little child in the entire sentence there be not one punctuation mark read it please marjorie begin to read then stop and laugh i can not you would not enjoy a book very much write in that style would you i could not enjoy it at all i would not read it well if you can not read it explain it to I how many person be in the coach that be easy enough there be mr miller that be one there be the clergyman that be two perhaps that be only one mr miller may be a clergyman so he may but how can i tell ask marjorie perplexed well then he son make two whose son why mr miller 's perhaps he be the clergyman 's son return miss prudence seriously well then declare marjorie i guess there be eight people mr miller the clergyman the son the lawyer mr angelo a foreigner a lady and a child place a comma after each there be eight person say miss prudence make the comma yes assent marjorie watch she beneath it miss prudence write the sentence again punctuate thus : the person inside the conch be mr miller a clergyman he son a lawyer mr angelo a foreigner he lady and a little child now how many person be there inside this coach three gentleman a lady and child laugh marjorie -- five instead of eight those little mark have cause three people to vanish and to change occupation yes for mr miller be a clergyman he son a lawyer and mr angelo have become a foreigner the pencil be move again and the amuse attentive eye be steadfastly follow the person inside the coach be mr miller a clergyman he son a lawyer mr angelo a foreigner he lady and a little child marjorie utter a exclamation it be so funny now mr miller 's son be a clergyman instead of himself mr angelo be a lawyer and nobody know whether he be a foreigner or not and we do not know the foreigner 's name and he have a wife and child miss prudence smile over the young eagerness and rewrite the sentence once again cause mr angelo to cease to be a lawyer and give the foreigner a wife but no little child o miss prudence you have make the little thing a orphan all alone in a stage-coach all through the change of a comma to be a semi-colon exclaimed marjorie in comical earnestness i think punctuation mean ever so much it be not dry one bit she add enthusiastically you could not enjoy mr brown very well without it smile miss prudence i never would know what the ` cry of the child ' mean or anything about cowper 's grave would i and if i punctuated it myself i might not get all _ she _ mean i might make a meaning of my own and that would be sad i think you do say miss prudence when i read it to you and the child there be tear in you eye but the other say all they like be my voice yes say marjorie but if somebody have stumble over every line i should not have feel it so i know the good there be in study elocution when mr woodfern be here and read ' o absalom my son my son absalom ' everybody have tear in they eye and i have never see tear about it before and now i know the good of punctuation i guess punctuation help elocution too i should not wonder reply miss prudence smile at marjorie 's air of have discover something now i 'll give you something to do while i close my eye and think awhile be i interrupt you inquire marjorie in consternation i do not know how i could any more than i can interrupt -- god be in she thought but she do not give it utterance i shall not allow you return miss prudence quietly you will work awhile and i will think and when i open my eye you may talk to I about anything you please you be a great rest to I child thank you say the child simply you may take the paper and change the number of people or relationship or profession again i know it may be do i do not see how then it will give you really something to do seat herself again on the yellow floor of the porch within range of miss prudence 's vision but not near enough to disturb she marjorie bit the unsharpened end of she pencil and look long at the puzzling sentence on the foolscap with the attitude of attentiveness she be not always attentive mr holme tell she that she lack concentration and that she could not succeed without it marjorie be very anxious to succeed she scribble awhile make a comma and a dash a parenthesis a interrogation point a asterisk and a line of asterisk but the sense be not change there be nobody new in the stage-coach and nobody do anything new then she rewrite it again give the little child to the foreigner and lady she want the child to have a father and mother even if the father be a foreigner and do not speak english she call the foreigner mr angelo and imagine he to be a brother of the celebrated michael angelo make a dive into the shallow depths of she knowledge of italian nomenclature she select a name for the child a little girl of course -- corrinne would do or it might be a boy and name for he uncle michael in what age of the world have michael angelo live at the same time with petrarch and galileo and tasso and -- do she know about any other italian oh yes silvio pellico -- be not he in prison and do not he write about it and be not the lean tower of pisa in italy be that one of the seven wonder of the world and be not there seven wise man of greece and be not there a story about the seven sleeper but be not they in asia and be not the church in revelation in asia and be not the one at laodicea lukewarm and do people mix bread with lukewarm water in summer as well as winter and be not it queer -- why how have she get there but it _ be _ queer for the oriental king to refuse to believe and say it be not so -- that water could not become hard enough for people to walk on it and it be funny for the east indian servant to be alarm because the butter be spoil just because when they be up in the mountain it become hard and be not like oil as it be down in calcutta and that be where henry martyn go and he dress all in white and he face be so lovely and pure like a angel 's and angel _ be _ like young man for at the resurrection do not it say they be young man or be it some other time and how do you spell _ resurrection _ be that the word that have one _ s _ and two _ r 's _ in it and how would you write two _ r 's _ would punctuation teach you that be _ b _ a word and could you spell it well marjorie oh dear I exclaim marjorie i have be away off i always do go away off i do not remember what the last thing i thought of be i never shall be concentrated she sigh i believe i could go right on and think of fifty other thing one thing always remind I of some thing else and some day rebuke miss prudence when you must concentrate you thought you will find that you have spoil yourself i have find it out now acknowledge marjorie humbly i have to be very severe with myself i ought to be marjorie confess with a rueful face for it spoil my prayer so often i would not dare tell you all the thing i find myself think of why last night -- you know at the missionary meeting they ask we to pray for china and so i think i would begin last night and i have hardly begin when it flash into my mind -- suppose somebody should make I empress of china and give I supreme power of course and i begin to make plan as to how i should make they all christian i think i would not _ force _ they or destroy they temple but i would have all my officer real christian american of course and i think i _ would _ compel they to send the child to christian school i would have such grand school i have you as principal for the grandest one and i would have the bible and all we best book and all we best Sunday school book translate into chinese and i _ would _ make the sabbath a holy day all over the land i do not know what i would do about that room in every large house call the hall of ancestor you know they worship they grandparent and great-great-grandparent there i think i should have to let they read the old book be not it queer that one of the proverb should be like the bible ` god hate the proud and be kind to the humble ' do you know all about buddha be that as far as you get in you prayer ask miss prudence gravely about as far and then i be so contrite that i begin to pray for myself as hard as i could and forget all about china do you wander off in read the bible too oh no i can keep my attention on that i read genesis and exodus last Sunday it be the loveliest story-book i know i have begin to read it through uncle jame say once that when he be a sea-captain he bring a passenger from germany and he use to sit up all night and read the bible he tell I last Sunday because he think i read so long i tell he i do not wonder miss prudence fix she innocent question eye upon miss prudence 's face why do a lady tell mother once that she do not want she little girl to read the bible through until she be grow up it be mrs gray -- and she tell mother she ought not to let I begin and read right through what do you mother say she say she be glad i want to do it i think mr gray mean that you might learn about some of the sin there be in the world but if you live in the world you will be keep from the evil because christ pray that he disciple might be thus keep but you must know the sin exist and i would rather my little girl would learn about the sin that god hate direct from he lip than from any other source as soon as you learn what sin be you will learn to hate it and that be not sure if you learn it in any other way i read the bible through when i be about you age and i think there be some form of sin i never should have hate so intensely if i have not learn about they in the way god think best to teach we he abhorrence of they i never read any book in which a sin be fully delineate that i do not feel some of the excitement of the sin -- some extenuation perhaps some glossing over some excuse for the sinner -- but in the record god give i always intensely hate the sin and feel how abominable it be in he sight the first book i ever cry over be the bible and it be somebody 's sin that bring the tear i would like to talk to mr gray cry miss prudence she eye kindle with indignation to think that god do not know what be good for he child i wish you would say marjorie with enthusiasm for i do not know how to say it mother know a lady who will not read esther on Sunday because god be not in it the name of god you mean say miss prudence smile i think esther and mordecaus and all the jew think god be in it i will try not to build castle promise marjorie often a silent half minute i have do it so much to please linnet after we go to bed at night she say ` shut you eye marjie and tell I what you see ' then i shut my eye and see thing for we both i see ourselves grow up and have a splendid home and a real splendid husband and we each have three child she have two boy and one girl and i have two girl and one boy and we educate they and dress they so nice and they do lovely thing we travel all around the world with they and i tell linnet all we see in europe and asia we husband stay home and send we money they have to stay home and earn it you know marjorie explain with a shrewd little smile would you give that all up she ask disappointedly yes i be sure i would you be make a disappointment for yourself you life may not be at all like that you may never marry in the first place and you may marry a man who can not send you to europe and i think you be rather selfish to spend he money and not stay home and be a good wife to he say miss prudence smile oh i write he splendid long letter say marjorie quickly they be so splendid that he think of make a book of they i be afraid they would not take return miss prudence seriously book of travel be too common nowadays be it wrong to build castle for any other reason than for make disappointment marjorie ask anxiously yes you dwell only on pleasant thing and thus you do not prepare yourself or rather un-prepare yourself for bear trial and why should a little girl live in a woman 's world oh because it be so nice cry marjorie and be you willing to lose you precious childhood and girlhood why no acknowledge the child look startle i think you lose a part of it when you love best to look forward to womanhood i should think every day would be full enough for you to live in to-day be full enough but some day nothing happen at all now be you study time now be the time for you to be a perfect little daughter and sister a perfect friend a perfect helper in every way that a child may help and when womanhood come you will be ready to enjoy it and to do its work it would be very sad to look back upon a lose or blighted or unsatisfying childhood yes assent marjorie gravely perhaps you and linnet have be read story-book that be not write for child we read all the book in the school library do you mother look over they no not always they may harm you only in this way that i see you be think of thing before the time it would be a pity to spoil may by bring September into it all the girl like the grown-up story best excuse marjorie perhaps they have not read book write purely for child think of the history and travels and biography and poem pile up for you to read i wish i have they i read all i could get i be sure you do o marjorie i do not want you to lose one of you precious day i lose so many of mine by grow up too soon there be year and year to be a woman but there be so few year to be a child and a girl marjorie scribble awhile think of nothing to say have she be spoil linnet too but linnet be two year older almost old enough to think about grow up marjorie look at I marjorie raise she eye and fix they upon the glowing eye that be read she own miss prudence 's lip be white and tremulous i have have some very hard thing in my life and i fully believe i bring many of they upon myself i spoil my childhood and early girlhood by light reading and castle-building i prefer to live among scene of my own imagine than in my own common life and oh the thing i leave up do the precious girlhood i lose and the hard womanhood i make for myself the child 's eye be as full of tear as the woman 's please tell I what to do marjorie entreated i do not want to lose anything i suppose it be as good to be a girl as a woman get all the sweetness out of every day _ live _ in to-day do not plan or hope about womanhood god have all that in he safe hand read the kind of book i have speak of and when you read grown-up story let some one older and wiser choose they for you by and by you taste will be so form and cultivate that you will choose only the best for yourself i hope the bible will spoil some other book for you i _ devour _ everything i can borrow or find anywhere you do not eat everything you can borrow or find anywhere if you choose for you body how much more ought you to choose for you mind i do get discontented sometimes and want thing to happen as they do in book something happen in every chapter in a book acknowledge marjorie there be nothing say about the dull uneventful day that come between if the author should write only about the dull day no one would read the book it would not be like life either say marjorie quickly for something do happen sometimes nothing have happen yet to I though but i suppose something will some day then if i should write about you thirteen year the charm would have to be all in the tell like hector in the garden say marjorie brightly how i do love that and he be only nine year old but how far we have get away from punctuation next to prayer child be miss prudence 's most perfect rest they be so utterly unconscious of what she be go through it seem to miss prudence as if she be always go through and never get through be you fully satisfy that punctuation have its work in the world yes ever so fully i should never get along in the bible without it that remind I run upstairs and bring I my bible and i 'll show you something and then after that will you show I the good of remember _ date _ they be so hard to remember and i can not see the good do you suppose you _ could _ make it as interesting as punctuation i might try the idea of a little girl who find punctuation so interesting have to resort to castle-building to make life worth live laugh miss prudence mother say to-day that she be afraid i be grow deaf for she speak three time before i answer i be away off somewhere imagine i have a hundred dollar to spend so she go down cellar for the butter herself marjorie walk away with a self-rebuked air she do dread to pass that open sitting-room door uncle jame have come in in he shirt sleeve wipe he bald head with he handkerchief and be tell she grandfather that the hay be poor this year aunt miranda be brushing nettie 's

how dare she pass that mile he would not hurt she he would only look at she out of he wild eye and talk to she answering captain rheid 's question be better than this stay at she grandfather 's and confess about the pitcher be better than this suddenly -- or have she hear it before a whistle burst out upon the air a sweet and clear succession of note the air of a familiar song : be it ever so

be so quiet that it require some effort for he to be noisy holli admire most characteristic unlike he own he do not know but he _ feel _ that marjorie be very much like himself she be more like he than he be like she they be two people who would be very apt to be draw together under all circumstance but without special and peculiar training could never satisfy each other this be true of they even now and if possible with the enlarged vision of experience become truer as they grow older if they keep together they might grow together but the question be whether of themselves they would ever have be draw very close together they be close enough together now as marjorie chat and holli listen he have many question to ask about the boy and girl of the village and marjorie have many story to relate so george harri and nell true be really marry he say so young too yes mother do not like it she say they be too young he always like she best at school you know and when she join the church she

vacation voice be greet she with well miss mousie how about the tumble down now but she eye see nothing except the mysterious flat round parcel in he hand oh hollis i be so glad she exclaim raise

sure you will not forget poor mother be not happy she be trouble about you no about herself because she be not a christian that be enough to trouble anybody say marjorie wisely now one more promise in payment will you write to I every two week oh i could not plead marjorie now you have find something too hard to do for I he say reproachfully oh i 'll do it of course but i be afraid you 'll soon get over that you see mother do not write often and father never do and i be often anxious about they and if you write and tell I about they twice a month i shall be happier you see you be do something for I yes thank you i 'll do the best i can but i can not write like you cousin helen she add jealously no matter you 'll do and you will be grow older and constantly improve and i shall begin to

as often as you do and you must not stop write until you last letter have not be answer for a month i 'll remember say marjorie seriously but i wish i could do something else do you have to pay money for it marjorie be accustom to bartering and that be the reason that she use the expression pay money well yes something he reply press he lip together he be angry with the shoemaker about that bargain yet how much i want to pay you lady never ask a gentleman such a question when they make they a present he say laughing as he arise imagine helen ask I how much i pay for the set of book i give she on she birthday the tear spring to marjorie 's eye have she do a dreadful thing that helen would not think of do long afterward she learn that he give for the plate the ten dollar that he father give he for a vacation present good-bye goosie keep both promise and do not run up a ladder again until you learn how to run down but she could not speak yet for the choke in she throat you have pay I twice over with those promise he say i be glad you break the old yellow pitcher so be she even while she heart be ache she finger hold the parcel tightly what a hearts-ease it be it have bring she peace of mind that be worth more hard promise than she could think of make he say he father 's great-grandfather have eat out of that plate over in holland and he have but one more leave to bequeath to he little grandson i be glad the great-grandfather do not break it say marjorie holli would not disturb she serenity by remark that the shoemaker _ might _ have add a century to the age of he possession it look two hundred year old anyway good-bye again if you do not get kill next time you fall you may live to see I again i 'll wear a linen coat and smell of cheese and smoke a pipe too long for I to light myself by that time -- when i come home from germany oh do not she exclaim in a startled voice which the coat or the cheese or the pipe i do not care about the cheese or the coat -- you need not be afraid about the pipe i promise mother to-day that i would never smoke or drink or play card that be good say marjorie contentedly and so she feel safe about I safer than i feel about myself i reckon but it _ be _ good-bye this time i 'll tell helen what a little mouse and goose you be hollis _ holli _ shout a gruff voice impatiently aye aye sir holli return but i must say good-bye to you mother and linnet instead of give he a last look she be give she first look to she treasure the first look be doubtful it be not half as pretty as the pitcher it be not very large and there be innumerable tiny crack interlace each other there be little raise figure on the broad rim and a figure in the center the color be buff and blue but it be a treasure twofold more a treasure than the yellow pitcher for it be twice as old and have come from holland the yellow pitcher have only come from england miss prudence would be satisfy that she have not hide the pitcher to escape detection and perhaps she friend might like this ancient plate a great deal better and be glad of what have befall the pitcher but suppose miss prudence do believe all this time that she have hide the broken piece and mean never to tell at that she could not forbear squeeze she face into the pillow and drop a few very sorrowful tear still she be glad even with a little contradictory faint-heartedness for holli would write to she and she would never lose he again and she could _ do _ something _ for _ he something hard she mother step in again before the tear be dry upon she cheek listen to the somewhat incoherent story of the naughty thing she have do and the splendid thing holli have do and of how she have pay he with two promise mr west examine the plate critically it be old there be no sham about it i have see a few old thing and i know i should not wonder if he give five dollar for it five dollar repeat marjorie in affright oh i hope not well perhaps not but it be worth it and more too to miss prudence 's friend and i 'll keep my promise say marjorie 's steadfast voice h be ejaculate she mother i rather think holli have the best of it that depend upon I say wise little marjorie vi marjorie asleep and awake she be make for happy thought -- _ mary howlet _ i wonder if there be anything any little thing i should have say that try a woman more than the change in she own face a woman that have just attain two score and -- a unmarried woman prudence pomeroy be discover these change in she own face and it may be undignified it may be unchristian even but she be try it be upon the morning of she fortieth birthday that with considerable shrink she set out upon a voyage of discovery upon the unknown sea of she own countenance it be unknown for she have not care to look upon herself for some year but she bolt she chamber door and set herself about it with grim determination this birthday morning it be a weakness it may be but we all have hour of weakness within we bolt chamber door she have a hard early morning all by herself but the battle with herself do not commence until she shove that bolt push back the white curtain and station herself in the full glare of the sun light with she hand-glass hold before she resolute face it be something to go through it be something to go through to read the record of a score of birthday past : but she have do that before the breakfast bell ring lock the old leathern bind volume in she trunk and arrange herself for breakfast and then have run down with she usual tripping step and keep they all amuse with she story during breakfast time but that be before the door be bolt she gaze long at the reflection of the face that time have be at work upon for forty year there be the tiniest crease in she forehead they be something like the crack in the plate two hundred year old that marjorie have send to she last night there be unmistakable line under she eye the pale tint of she cheek do not erase they nor the soft plumpness render they invisible they stare at she with the story of relentless year at the corner of she lip the artistic finger of time have chisel line delicate it be true but clearly define -- a line that do not dent the cheek of early maidenhood a line that have find no place near she own lip ten year ago and above she eye -- she have not discern that at first -- there be a lack of fullness you could not name it hollowness that be new at least new to she other with keener eye may have notice it month ago and there be a yellowness -- she might as well give it boldly its right name -- at the temple decrease of fairness she might call it but that it be a positive shade of that yellowness she have notice in other no older than herself and then to return to she cheek or rather she chin there be a laxity about the muscle at the side of she mouth that give she chin a elderly outline no it be not only the absence of youth it be the presence of age -- she full forty year and she hair it be certainly not as abundant as it use to be it have weary she once to brush out its thick glossy length it be become unmistakably thinner she be certainly slightly bald about the temple and white hair be straggle in one after another not attempt to conceal themselves a year ago she have select they from the mass of black and cut they short but now they be appear too fast for the scissors it be a sad face almost a gloomy one that she be gaze into : for the knowledge that she forty year have do they work in she face as surely and perhaps not as sweetly as in she life have come to she with a shock she be certainly grow older and the sign of it be in she face nothing could hide it even she increase seriousness make it more apparent not only grow older but grow old the girl would say twenty year ago when she first begin to write that birthday record she have laugh at forty and call it old herself as she lay the hand-glass aside with a half-checked sigh she eye fall upon she hand and wrist it be certainly lose its shapeliness the finger be as taper as ever and the palm as pink but -- there be a something that remind she of that plate of old china she might be like a bit of old china but she be not ready to be lay upon the shelf not even to be pay a price for and be admire she be in the full rush of she working day awhile ago she friend have all address she as prudence but now she be not aware when it begin or how she be miss prudence to every one who be not within the nearest circle of intimacy not prudie or prue any more she have not be prudie since she father and mother die and not prue since she have lose that friend twenty year ago in ten short year she would be fifty year old and fifty be half a century : old enough to be somebody 's grandmother be she not the bosom friend of somebody 's grandmother to-day laura harrowgate she friend and schoolmate not one year she senior be the grandmother of three-months-old laura be it possible that she herself do not belong to the present generation but to a generation pass away she have no daughter to give place to as laura have no husband to laugh at she wrinkle and gray hair as laura have and to say we be grow old together if it be only together there would be no sadness in it but would she want it to be such a together as certain of she friend share laura harrowgate be a grandmother but still she would gush over that plate from holland two century old buy a bracket for it and exhibit it to she friend a hand-glass do not make _ she _ dolorous a few year since she would have rebel against what the hand-glass reveal but to-day she could not rebel against god 's will assuredly it _ be _ he will for history to be write in face would she live a woman 's life and adorn herself with a baby 's face have not she face be mould by she life have she stop think and work ten year ago she might to-day have look at the face she look at ten year ago no she demur not a baby 's face but -- then she laugh aloud at herself -- be not she fate the common fate of all who among she friend at forty year of age be ever take or mistake for twenty-five or thirty and if _ she _ be what then would she work be worth more to the world would the angel encamp about she more faithfully or more lovingly and then be there not a face mar do he live he life upon the earth with no sign of it in he face be it not a part of he human nature to grow older could she be human and not grow old if she live she must grow old to grow old or to die that be the question and then she laugh again this time more merrily have she make the change herself by fret and worry have she take life too hard yes she have take life hard another glance into the glass reveal another fact : she neck be not as full and round and white as it once be : there be a suggestion of old china about that too she would discard linen collar and wear soften white ruffle it would not be deceitful to hide time 's naughty little tracery she smile this time she _ be _ come to a hard place in she life she have believe -- oh how much in vain -- that she have come to all the hard place and wade through they but here there be loom up another fully as hard perhaps harder because it be not so tangible and therefore harder to face and fight the acknowledge that she have come to this hard place be something she remember the remark of a old lady who be friendless and poor : the hardest time of my life be between forty and forty-five i have to accept several bitter fact that after become easier to bear prudence pomeroy look at herself then look up to god and accept submissively even cheerfully he fact that she have begin to grow old and then she dress herself for a walk and with she sun-umbrella and a volume of poem start out for she tramp along the road and through the field to find she little friend marjorie the china plate and pathetic note last night have move she strangely marjorie be in the beginning of thing what be she life worth if not to help such as marjorie live a worthier life than she own two score year have be a face flush with the long walk look in at the window upon marjorie asleep the child be sit near the open window in a wooden rocker with padded arm and back and cover with calico with a green ground sprinkle over with butterfly and yellow daisy she head be throw back against the knit tidy of white cotton and she hand be rest in she lap the blue muslin be rather more crumpled than when she have see it last and instead of the linen collar the lace be knot about she throat the bandage have be remove from she forehead the swell have abate but the discolor spot be plainly visible she lip be slightly part she cheek be rosy if this be the beginning of thing it be a very sweet and peaceful beginning enter the parlor with a soft tread miss prudence divest herself of hat glove duster and umbrella and take a large palm leaf fan from the table seat herself near the sleeper gently wave the fan to and fro as a fly light on marjorie 's hand or face on the window seat be place a goblet half fill with lemonade a small bible a book that have the outward appearance of be a sunday-school library book and a copy in blue and gold of the poem of mr heman miss prudence remember she own time of loving mr heman and have give this copy to marjorie later she have lay she aside for longfellow as marjorie would do by and by and in he turn she have give up longfellow for tennyson and mr brown as perhaps marjorie would never do she have bring jean ingelow with she this morning to try brother and a sermon and the song of seven with marjorie marjorie be a natural elocutionist miss prudence be afraid of spoil she by unwise criticism the child must thoroughly appreciate a poem forget herself and then she rendering would be more than miss prudence with all she training could perfectly imitate do not teach she too much she 'll want to be a actress remonstrate marjorie 's father after listen to marjorie 's read one day miss prudence laugh and marjorie look perplexed marjorie be to comfort with she reading as some do by singing she reply wait till you be old and she read the bible to you she read to I now he say she read ` the child of the lord 's supper ' to I last night miss prudence move the fan backward and forward and study the sleep innocent face i have almost write sweet again i can scarcely think of she face as it be then without write sweet it would be long miss prudence muse before line and crease intrude here and there in that smooth forehead and in the tinted cheek that dimple at the least provocation but life would bring they in time and they would add beauty if there be no bitterness nor hardness in they if the holy spirit dwelt in the temple of the body be not the line upon the face he handwriting she know more than one old face that be grow more attractive with each year of life the door be push open and mr west 's broad shoulder and motherly face appear miss prudence smile and lay she finger on she lip and smile too the mother move away linnet in she kitchen apron and with the mark of the morning 's bake on she finger next look in nodded and run away after awhile the sleep eyelid quiver and lift themselves a quick flush a joyous exclamation and marjorie spring into she friend 's arm i _ feel _ as if i be not alone how long have you be here oh why _ do not _ you speak to I or touch I i want to have the pleasure all on my side i never see you asleep before i hope i do not keep my mouth open and snore oh no you lip be gently apart and you breathe regularly as they would say in book marjorie laugh release miss prudence from the tight clasp and go back to she chair you receive my note and the plate she say anxiously both in perfect preservation there be not one extra crack in the plate it be several hour older than when it leave you hand but that only increase its value and do you think i be dreadful not to confess before ask marjorie tremulously i think you be dreadful to run away from I instead of _ to _ I i be so sorry i want to get something else before you know about it do you miss it i miss something in the room i could not decide what it be will the plate do do you think be it handsome enough it be old enough that be all the question do you know all about holland when that plate first come into existence no i only know there _ be _ a holland that plate will be a good point to begin with you and i will study up holland some day i wonder what you know about it now be that why you friend want the plate because she know about holland two hundred year ago no i be afraid not i do not believe she know more than you do about it but she will delight in the plate which remind I you uncle have promise to put the unfortunate pitcher together for I and in its mended condition it will appear more ancient than ever i can not say that george washington break it with he little hatchet but i can have a legend about you connect with it and tell it to you grandchild when i show it to they fifty year hence unto they i will discover -- not a swan 's nest among the reed as mr brown have it but a old yellow pitcher that they lovely grandmother be in trouble about fifty year ago it will be a hundred and fifty year old then return marjorie seriously and i think she add rebukingly that _ you _ be build castle then i have you and the pitcher for the foundation say miss prudence in a tone of mock humility do not you think -- marjorie 's face have a world of suggestion in it -- that ` the swan 's nest ' be bad influence for girl little ellie sit alone and build castle about she lover even he horse be ` shod in silver house in azure ' and a thousand serf do call he master and he say ' o love i love but thee ' but all she look forward to be show he the swan 's nest among the reed and when she go home around a mile as she do daily lo the wild swan have desert and a rat have gnaw the reed that be the end of she fine castle ` if she find the lover ever sooth i know not but i know she could never show he never that swan 's nest among the reed ' quote marjorie so it do all come to nothing as air-castle almost always do but we 'll hope she find something better do people question marjorie have not god thing lay up for we better than we can ask or think or build castle about i _ hope _ so say marjorie but holli rheid 's mother tell mother yesterday that she life be one long disappointment what do you mother say she say ` oh mrs rheid it will not be if you get to heaven at last ' i think not but she do not expect to go to heaven she say mother say she be almost in ` despair ' and she pity she so poor woman i do not see how she can live through despair the old proverb ` if it be not for hope the heart would break ' be most certainly true why do not you come before ask marjorie caress the hand that still play with the fan perhaps you never live on a farm and can not understand i could not come in the ox-cart because the ox be in the field and every day since i hear of you accident you uncle have have to drive you aunt to portland on some business and i do not feel strong enough to walk until this morning how good you be to walk as good as you be to walk to see I oh but i be young and strong and i want to see you so and ask you question so i believe the latter say miss prudence smile well i be happy now marjorie sigh with the burden of she trouble still upon she suppose i have be kill when i fall and have not tell you about the pitcher nor make amends for it i do not believe any of we could be take away without one moment to make ready and not leave many thing undo -- many tangled thread and rough edge to be take care of we be very happy if we have no sin to confess no wrong to make right i think holli would have take care of the plate for I say marjorie simply but i want to tell you myself mother want to go home as suddenly as that would have be for I she say i should not wonder if she pray about it -- she pray about everything do people have _ that _ kind of a prayer answer i have know more than one instance -- and i read about a gentleman who have desire to be take suddenly and he be kill by lightning while sit on he own piazza oh say marjorie that be all he could have wish and the mother of my pastor at home who be over ninety be find dead on she knee at she bedside and she have always wish to be summon suddenly when she be speak to he too murmur marjorie i like old people do not you holli ' grandmother be at he house and mr rheid want I to go to see she she be ninety-three and blind and she love to tell story about herself and i be to stay all day and listen to she and take up she stitch when she drop they in she knitting work and read the bible to she she will not listen to anything but the bible she say she be too old to hear other book read what a treat you will have be not it lovely i never have _ that _ day in my air-castle either nor you come to stay all day with I nor write to holli i have a letter from he last night the funniest letter i laugh all the time i be read it he begin : ` poor little mousie ' and end ` ours till next time ' i 'll show it to you he do not say much about helen i shall tell he if i write about he mother he must write about helen i be sorry to tell he what he mother say yesterday about herself but i promise and i must be faithful i hope you will have happy news to write soon i do not know she say the minister do not do she any good nor read the bible nor pray now what can help she god be the solemn reply she have have to learn that the minister and bible read and prayer be not god when she be sure that god will do all the help and save she will be help and save perhaps she have go to the minister and the bible instead of to god and she may have think she prayer could save she instead of god she say she be in despair because they do not help she and she do not know where to turn next say marjorie who have listen with sympathetic eye and ache heart do not worry about she dear god be teach she to turn to himself i tell she about the plate but she do not seem to care much what different thing people _ do _ care about exclaimed marjorie she eye alight with the newness of she thought mr harrowgate will never be perfectly satisfy until she have a memorial of pompeius i have promise when i explore underground i 'll find she a treasure you holland plate be something for she small collection she have but eighty-seven piece of china while a friend of hers have gather together two hundred what do _ you _ care for most miss prudence in the way of collection i have not show you my penny bury in the lava of mt vesuvius i tell my friend that savor of pompeius the only difference be one be above ground and the other underneath but i could not persuade she to believe it i do not mean collect coin or thing i mean what do you care for _ most _ if you have not discover i can not care very much for what i care for most marjorie laugh at this way of put it then she answer gravely : i do know i think you care most -- she pause choose she phrase carefully -- to help people make something out of themselves thank you that be fine i never put it so excellently to myself i have not find out what i care most for i think i know you care most to make something out of yourself do i be not that selfish but i do not know how to help any one else not even linnet make the best of ourselves be the foundation for make something out of other but i do not say _ that _ persist marjorie you help people to do it for themselves i wonder if that be my work in the world rejoin miss prudence musingly i could not choose anything to fit I better -- i have no thought that i have ever succeed i never put it to myself in that way perhaps i 'll begin some day helen rheid help holli he be not the same boy he study and buy book and notice thing to be admire in people and when he be full of fun he be not rough i do not believe i ever help anybody you have some work to do upon yourself first and i be sure you have help educate you mother and father marjorie pull to piece the green leaf that have float in upon she lap and as she keep she eye on the leaf she ponder she companion be talk over she head purposely to-day she have a plan for marjorie and as she admit to herself she be try the child to see what she be make of she congratulate herself upon success thus far that child do educate they mother be the only satisfactory reason i have find when i have question why god do give child to _ some _ mother then what become of the child ask marjorie alarm the giver do not forget they he can be a mother himself you know marjorie do not know she have always have she mother have she lose something therefore in not thus find out god perhaps in after life she would find he tenderness by lose -- or not have -- some one else it be not too bad for it would be a great pity if there be not such interruption but at this instant linnet 's housewifely face be push in at the door and she voice announce : dinner in three minute and a half chicken-pie for the first course and some new and delicious thing for dessert oh splendid cry marjorie hop up and we 'll finish everything after dinner miss prudence as the lady say to the famous traveller at a dinner party : ` we have five minute before dinner please tell I all about you travels ' say miss prudence rise and laugh you remember you have not tell I what you send I for the bible to show I that unhappy -- no happy time -- i break the picture remind marjorie lead the way to the dining-room vii under the apple-tree never the little seed stop in its grow -- _ mr osgood _ linnet move hither and thither after the dinner dish be do all through the house up stair and down to see that everything be in perfect order before she might dress and enjoy the afternoon linnet be pre-eminently a housekeeper to she mother 's great delight for she younger daughter be not develop accord to she mind in housewifely art that will come in time encouraged marjorie 's father when she mother speak faultfindingly of some delinquency in the kitchen i should like to know _ what _ time be the sharp reply it be queer about marjorie 's mother she be as sharp as she be good-humored linnet have no decide taste about anything but housekeeping and fancy-work and marjorie have some other thing to be grow in say she father i wish she would grow to some purpose then be the energetic reply as the farmer say about he seed before it be time for it to sprout laugh the child 's father this father and mother could not talk confidentially together five minute without bring the child in they own future be every day but the child have not begin to live in theirs yet they golden future which be to be all the more golden because of they parent ' experience this mother be so very old-fashioned that she believe that there be no career open to a girl beside marriage the dreadful alternative be solitary old-maidenhood she be a good mother in many respects a wise mother but she would not have sleep that night have she believe that either of she daughter would attain to thirty year unmarried this may have be owe to a defect of education or it may have be that she be so happily marry to a husband six year she junior -- whom she could manage and she be nearly thirty when she be marry herself and have really begin to believe that she should never be marry at all she believe marriage to be so honorable in all that the absence of it as in miss prudence 's case be nearly dishonorable she be almost a jewish mother in she reverence for marriage and joyfulness for the blessing of child this may have be the result of she absorb study of the old testament scripture marjorie have wonder why she mother in address the lord have cry o lord god of israel and instead of any other name nearer new testament christian she would speak of he as the holy one of israel sometimes i have think that marjorie 's mother begin she religious life as a jew and that instead of be a gentile christian she be in reality a convert jew something like what elizabeth would have be if she have be more like marjorie 's mother and graham west 's wife this type of womanhood be rare in this nineteenth century for aught i know she be not a representative woman at all she be the only one i ever know and perhaps you never see any one like she she have no heresy she can prove every assertion from the bible she principle be as firm as adamant and she heart as tender as a mother 's still marriage and motherhood have be she education if the connecticut school-teacher have not realize she worth she might have become what she dread she own daughter become -- a old maid with uncheerful view of life in plan they future she look into she own heart instead of into theirs the child be lovely blossoming of the seed in the heart of both parent of seed that in they have not bear abundant fruitage how do two such cranky old thing ever have such happy child she exclaim one day to she husband perhaps they will become what we stop short of be he reply graham west be something of a philosopher rather too much of a philosopher for he wife 's peace of mind to she sorrow she have learn that he have no business tact he could not even scrape a comfortable live off he scrubby little farm but i begin with linnet and fall to discourse about she mother it be linnet as she appear in she grayish brown dress with a knot of crimson at she throat run down the stairway that suggest she mother 's think to I linnet be almost grow up she have say to herself as she remove she cap for she customary afternoon nap this afternoon nap refresh she countenance and keep she from look six year older than she husband mr west be not a worldly woman but she do not like to look six year older than she husband linnet search through parlor and hall then out on the piazza then look through the front yard and finally have explore the garden find marjorie and she friend in camp-chair on the soft green turf under the low hanging bough of a apple-tree behind the house there be two or three book in marjorie 's lap and miss prudence be turn the leaf of marjorie 's bible she be answer one of marjorie 's question linnet suppose and wonder if marjorie would be satisfy with the answer she be not always satisfy as the elder sister know to she grievance for instance : marjorie have say to she yesterday with that serious look in she eye : linnet father say when christ be on earth people do not have wheat ground into fine flour as we do -- now when it be so much nicer why do you suppose he do not tell they about grind it fine perhaps he do not think of it she reply give the first thought that occur to she that be not the reason return marjorie for he could think of everything he want to then -- for the same reason why do not he tell they about chloroform and printing and telegraphing and a thousand other invention question linnet in she turn that be what i want to know say marjorie linnet settle herself on the turf and draw she work from she pocket she be make a collar of tatting for she mother 's birthday and work at it at every spare moment it be the clover leaf pattern that she have learn but a few week ago the thread be very fine and she be do it exquisitely she have show it to holli because he be in the lace business and he have say it be a fine specimen of real lace to make real lace be one of linnet 's ambition the lace around marjorie 's neck be a piece that they mother have make towards she own wedding outfit marjorie 's mother sigh and fear that marjorie would never care to make lace for she wedding outfit linnet frown over she clover leaf and marjorie watch miss prudence as she turn the leaf marjorie do not care for the clover leaf only as she be interested in everything that linnet 's finger touch but linnet do care for the answer to marjorie 's question she think perhaps it be about the wheat the bible leaf be still after a second miss prudence read : ` for many walk of whom i have tell you often and now tell you even weep that they be the enemy of the cross of christ ' _ that _ be not the answer linnet think what do that mean to you marjorie ask miss prudence why -- it can not mean anything different from what it say paul be so sorry about the people he be write about that he weep as he tell they -- he be so sorry they be enemy of the cross of christ yes he tell they even weep but i know a old gentleman who read the bible unceasingly -- i see one new testament that he have read through fifteen time -- and he tell I once that some people be so grieved because they be the enemy of the cross of christ that they be enemy even weep i ask ` why do they continue enemy then ' and he say most ingenuously that he suppose they could not help it then i remember this passage and find it and read it to he as i read it to you just now he be simply astounded he put on he spectacles and read it for himself and then he say nothing he have simply put the comma in the wrong place he have read it in this way : ` for many walk of whom i have tell you often and now tell you even weep that they be the enemy of the cross of christ ' oh cry marjorie draw a astonished long breath what a difference it do make now i know it be punctuation you be talk about exclaimed linnet marjorie tell I all about the people in the stage-coach o miss prudence i do not love to study i want to go away to school of course but i can not see the _ use _ of so many study marjorie _ love _ to study and i do not perhaps i would if i could see some use beside ` be like other people ' be like other people do not seem to I to be a _ real _ enough reason linnet have forget she clover leaf she be look at miss prudence with eye as grave and earnest as marjorie 's ever be she do not love to study and it be one of the wrong doings that she have confess in she prayer many a time well do not you see the reason now for study punctuation yes i do she answer heartily but we do not like date either of we do you ever hear about pompeius the city bury long ago underground linnet think that have nothing to do with she question oh yes say marjorie we have read about it ` the last day of pompeius ' be in the school library i read it but linnet do not care for it do you know _ when _ it be bury no say linnet brighten have you any idea a thousand year ago guess marjorie then you do not know how long after the crucifixion no they reply together you know when the crucifixion be of course why -- yes admit linnet hesitatingly christ be thirty-three year old say marjorie so it must have be in the year 33 or the beginning of 34 of course i know _ anno dominus _ say linnet but i do not always know what happen before and after suppose we be walk in one of the excavate street of pompeius and i should say ' o girl look at that wall ' and you should see a rude cross carve on it what would you think i should think they know about christ answer linnet the clover leaf tatting have fall into she lap and the shuttle be on the grass yes and be that all why yes she acknowledge pompeius be not so far so very far from jerusalem and -- they could hear say marjorie and you two would pass on to a grand house with a wonderful mosaic floor and think no more about the cross i suppose we would say linnet would not you but i should think about the cross i should think that the city be destroy in 79 and be rejoice that the inhabitant have hear of the cross and know its story before swift destruction overtake they it be destroy about forty-five year after the crucifixion i _ like _ to know that say marjorie perhaps some of the people in it have see st paul and hear he tell about the cross i see some use in that date say linnet pick up she shuttle suppose i should tell you that once on a time a laborer would have to work fifteen year to earn enough to buy a bible and then the bible must be in latin would not you like to know when it be i do not know when the bible be print in english confess marjorie if you do know and know several other thing that happen about that time you would be greatly interested suppose i should tell you about something that happen in england you would care very much more if you know about something that be link with it in france and in germany if i say 1517 i do not arouse you enthusiasm you do not know what be happen in germany then and 1492 do not remind you of anything -- yes it do laugh marjorie and so do 1620 down the bay on a island stand the ruin of a church and a old lady tell I it be build in 1604 i do not contradict she but i laugh all to myself i know enough to laugh at that say linnet but i have see in america the spot where jamestown stand and that date almost as far back suppose i tell you that martin luther read _ pilgrim progress _ with great delight do you know whether i be make fun or not if i say that queen elizabeth write a letter to cleopatra do you know whether i mean it or not and if i say that richard the third be baptize by st augustine can you contradict it and hannah more write a sympathetic letter to joan of arc and marie antoinette dance with charlemagne and george washington be congratulate on become president by mary queen of scot the girl could laugh at this for they have a idea that the queen of scot die some time before the first president of the united state be bear but over the other name and incident they look at each other gravely life be a kind of conglomeration without date say linnet i wonder if you know how long ago the flood be suggest miss prudence or if mahomet live before the flood or after she add seriously marjorie smile but linnet be serious you confuse I so say linnet i believe i do not know when anything _ be _ i do not know how long since adam be make do you marjorie no in the tone of one dreadfully ashamed and now i 'll tell you a lovely think out of the bible that come through date i do not discover it myself of course i do not see why ` of course ' marjorie say in a resentful tone you _ do _ discover thing i discover little girl once in a while return miss prudence with a rare softening of lip and eye if it have not be for a few such discovery the line about miss prudence 's lip might have be hard line of course you both remember the story of faithful old abraham how he long and long for a son and hope against hope and after wait so long isaac be bear at last he have the sure promise of god that in he seed all the nation of the earth should be bless do you know how many nation abraham know about do he know about france and england and america the empire of russium and populous china linnet look puzzle marjorie be very grave do he know that the north american indian would be bless in he do he know they would learn that the great spirit have a son jesus christ and that jesus christ be descend from he i -- do not -- know say marjorie doubtfully i get all mix up it be because all the world would be bless that he be so anxious to have a son and then after isaac be bear and marry for year and year the promise do not seem to come true for he have no child must the faithful hopeful old father die with he hope defer we read that abraham die in a good old age a old man full of year and isaac and ishmael bury he and farther on in the same chapter we find that the twin boy be bear jacob and esau but they old grandfather be dead he know now how true god be to he promise because he be in heaven but we can not help wish he have see those two strong boy from one of whom the savior of the whole world be to descend but if we look at abraham 's age when he die and compare it with isaac 's when the twin be bear we find that the old man truly have to wait twenty year before they be bear but that he really live to see they seventeen or eighteen year of age he live to tell they with he own lip about that wonderful promise of god oh i be so glad cry marjorie enthusiastically he have another long time to wait too say linnet yes he have hard time all along almost sigh miss prudence forty year old do not mean to she that she hard time be all over but he have such a good time with the boy say marjorie who never could see the dark side of anything just to think of _ date _ tell we such a beautiful thing that be all you hate date and punctuation linnet declare but i can not see the use of ever so many other thing if god think it worth while to make the earth and people it and furnish it and govern it with law do not you think it worth you poor little while to learn what he have do query miss prudence gently oh exclaim linnet be _ that _ it just it say miss prudence smile and some day i will go over with you each study by itself and show you how it will educate you and help you the better to do something he ask you to do oh how splendid cry linnet before i go to school so the book will not seem hard and dry yes any day that you will come to I marjorie may come too even though she love to study i wonder if you can find any good in natural philosophy mutter linnet and in do the example in it and in remember the sign of the zodiac mr holme make we learn everything he will not let we skip he be a fine teacher and you might have have if you have be so mind a good preparation for you city school i have not say linnet if it be not for see the girl and learn how to be like city girl i would rather stay home perhaps that knowledge would not improve you what then why miss prudence exclaim marjorie do not you think we country girl be away behind the age in the matter of date but you need not be with such a teacher as you have you ought to do as well as any city girl of you age and there be always a course of reading by yourself it be not always laugh linnet it be only for the studiously disposed i be a country girl and when i go to the city to school i do not fail in my examination oh _ you _ cry linnet i see no reason why you in you happy refined christian home with all the sweet influence of you healthful hardy life should not be as perfectly the lady as any girl i know marjorie clap she hand oh if holli might only hear this and miss prudence _ know _ i think i have to go to a city school else i could not be refine and lady-like say linnet that do not follow all city girl be not refine and lady-like they may have a style that you have not but that style be not always to they advantage it be true that i do not find many young lady in you little village that i wish you to take as model but the fault be in they as well as in some of they surroundings you have music you have book you have perfection of beauty in shore and sea you have the holy spirit the educator of mankind the girl be awed and silent i have be shock at the rudeness of city girl and i have be charm with the tact and courtesy of more than one country maiden nowadays education and the truest culture may be have everywhere even in middlefield laugh marjorie she heart brimming over with the thought that after all she might be as truly a lady as helen rheid if linnet have be as excite as marjorie be at that moment she would have give a bind into the grass and dance all around but marjorie only sit still tremble with a flush in eye and cheek i think i 'll keep a list of the book i read decide marjorie after a quiet moment that be a good plan i 'll show you a list i make in my girlhood some day but you must not read as many as a englishman read -- thoma henry buckle -- he library comprise twenty-two thousand he do not read they _ all _ cry linnet he read part of all and some attentively i dare say he be a rapid reader and have the rare faculty of be able to seize on what he need to use he often read three volume a day but i do not advise you to copy he i want you to read mark learn and inwardly digest he could absorb but we 'll take it for grant that you must plod on steadily step by step he read through johnson 's dictionary to enlarge he vocabulary vocabulary repeat linnet he stock of word exclaim marjorie miss prudence with a new energy in she voice i be go to read webster through well smile miss prudence do not you believe i _ can _ oh yes then i will i 'll be

be she not also one of she little sister that be in the world and not of it when may we know question linnet that depend before i leave you grandfather 's i hope i know it be something good and wonderful because you think of it say marjorie perhaps it be as good as one of we day-dreams come true it may be something very like one of they but the time may not be yet it will not do you any harm to know there be something pleasant ahead if it can be arrange i do like to know thing that be go to happen to we linnet confess i use to wish i could dream and have the dream come true like the wicked ancient who use to wrap themselves in skin of beast and stay among the grave and monument to sleep and dream -- and in the temple of the idol think the depart or the idol would foretell to they in dream isaiah reprove the jew for do this and sir walter scott in he note to ` the lady of the lake ' tell we something about a similar superstition among the scotch i like to know about superstition say linnet but i would be afraid to do that miss prudence i have not read ` the lady of the lake ' exclaimed marjorie no imitator of buckle you have not but i 'll send it to you when i go

than faith do not the israelite live on the same food that the philistine do ask marjorie and do not -- be you get ready to refute he the jew could not eat pork you remember and because they do not eat pork they believe in one true god exclaim marjorie indignantly i do not like he book miss prudence neither do i and we need not read it even if he do study twenty-two thousand book and johnson 's

say i have not a friend i do not mention this brother he be young when it happen too young to have any pity for he brother he be very kind to I they all be this brother be a half-brother -- there be two mother -- and much younger what be he name mr west do not mean to be inquisitive but she do want to know and not simply for the sake of know excuse I -- but i must keep the secret for he brother 's sake he be the only one leave i may not know the name of the bank then if you know that you would know all but _ i _ know that you husband lose he small patrimony in it -- twenty-five hundred dollar -- h be escape mr west 's closely press lip and that be one strong reason why i want to educate you two daughter the knitting drop from the unsteady finger and i have fret and fret about that money and ask the lord how my girl ever be to be educate you know now say miss prudence i have to tell you for i fear that you would not listen to my plan you may guess how i feel when you sister-in-law mr easton tell I that she be to take linnet for a year or two and let she go to school at first i could not see my way clear my money be all spend for a year to come -- i only thought of take marjorie home with I -- but i have arrange it so that i can spare a little i have be often apply to to take music pupil and if i do that i can take one of the girl home with I and send she to school next year i will take all the expense upon myself wardrobe and all there be a cheap way of living in large city as well as a expensive one if linnet go to boston with she aunt she will be keep busy out of school hour mr easton be very kindhearted but she consider no one where she child be concern if i wear diamond that linnet 's money purchase be not you willing she shall eat bread and butter my money purchase but you give the diamond up i wear they though that diamond plea have do duty a good many time i guess say mr west smile down upon the head in she lap no it have not he brother have do many thing for I people be ready enough to take money from he brother and the widow be my friend it have not be difficult it would have be without he the night i have lay awake and make plan my little boy die in babyhood i imagine they father and i would have mortgage the farm and i would have take in wash and he would have go back to he trade to send those boy through college but the girl do not need a college education the boy might have be minister -- one of they at least but i would like the girl to have a piano they both play so well on the melodeon i would like they to be -- well like you miss prudence and not like they rough hardwork old mother i have shed tear enough about they education and tell the lord about it time enough if the boston plan do not suit we have another graham and i -- he always listen and depend upon my judgment i be afraid sometimes i depend upon my own judgment more than upon the lord 's wisdom but this plan be -- the knit needle be be push vigorously through she back hair now to exchange the farm for a house and lot in town -- middlefield be quite a town you know -- and he be to go back to he trade and i be to take boarder and the girl be to take turn in schooling and accomplishment i be not over young myself and he be not over strong but we have decide on that i shed some tear over it and he look pale and could not sleep for we have count on this place as the home of we old age which be not so far off as it be when he put that twenty-five hundred dollar into that bank but i do breathe freer if i think we may have this place to live and die on small as it be and the poor living it give we father 's place be not much to speak of and jame will come in for he share of that so we have not much to count on anywhere i do not know though the knit needle be do duty in the stock again about take _ you _ money you be not he wife you have not spend it or connive at he knavery i feel myself to be he wife -- i be happier in make all the reparation in my power all i could do for one old lady be to place she in the old lady ' home i know very few of the instance i would not harrow my soul with hearing of those i could not help i have do very little but that little have be my exceed comfort i guess so say mr west in a husky voice i 'll tell father what you say we 'll talk it over and see i know you love my girl -- especially marjorie i love they both be the quick reply linnet be older she ought to have the first chance miss prudence thought but do not say as laban say about leah she only say i do not object to that we do marjorie no injustice this be linnet 's schooltime there do seem to be a justice in give the first chance to the firstborn although god choose jacob instead of the elder esau and joseph instead of he older brethren and there be little david anoint when he brother be refuse miss prudence 's tone be most serious but she eye be full of fun she be turn the partial mother 's weapon against herself but david and jacob and joseph be different from the other return the mother gravely and in this case the elder be as good as the younger it almost slip off miss prudence 's tongue but she will not take the education marjorie will but she wisely check herself and reply that both the girl be as precious as precious could be and now do not you go home to-night stay all night and i 'll

heart in a tremor that it have not know since marjorie be bear tuck away she knitting behind the school-book on the dining-room table tie on she blue check apron and go out to the kitchen to kindle the fire for tea singing in she mellow voice thus far the lord have lead I on suddenly stop short as she cram the stove with shaving to exclaim he name _ be _ holme and that be the school-master 's

flash through he mind but it hardly matter -- mr devoe would take she cup of tea alone and leave he fruit and bread and milk standing on the tea-table it be better so she would not pester he with question while he be eat ask he why he do not take more exercise and if he room be not suffocating this hot day and if he do not think a cup of good strong tea would not be better for he than that bowl of milk mr devoe a widow of sixty-five and she cat dolly aged nineteen keep house and board the school-master she house be two mile nearer the shore than the school-building but he prefer the walk in all weather and he like the view of the water mr devoe have never keep a boarder before she small income be amply sufficient for she small want but she like the master he split she wood and he

have give he on a birthday three year ago and go to the wash-stand to bathe he face and brush back that mass of black hair he do not study he feature as prudence have study hers that morning he know so little about he own face that he could scarcely distinguish a good portrait of himself from a poor one but prudence know it by heart it be a thin delicate face mar with much think the feature not large and finely cut with deep set eye as black as midnight and when they be neither grave nor stern as soft as a dive 's eye cheek and chin be closely shaven he hair a heavy black mass be push back from a brow already line with thought or care and worn somewhat long behind the ear there be no hardness in any line of the face because there be no hardness in the heart there be sin and sorrow in

he black head to the very tip of he worn velvet slipper he slender hand with they perfectly keep nail and even the stain of ink on the forefinger of he right hand have a air of scholarship about they he black summer suit be a perfect fit he boot be shine the knot of he narrow black neck tie be a little towards one side but that be the only evidence that he be careless about he personal appearance i want my boy to be neat he have say once apologetically to mr devoe when request she to give away he old school suit preparatory to buy another all he need to be perfect be congenial social life prudence believe but that alas seem never to enter he conception he know it never have since that long ago day when he have congratulate he brother upon he perfect share of this world 's happiness and queerly enough prudence stand too greatly in awe of he to suggest that he life be too one-sided and solitary some people wonder if you be ever marry mr devoe say to he that afternoon when he go down to he late supper mr devoe never stand in awe of anybody yes i be marry twenty year ago -- to my work he reply gravely there be not any john holme there be only my work there be something that be john

grassy wayside towards the brown farmhouse : perhaps there _ be _ a john holme that i forget about he say to himself x linnet use I to serve and honor thee and let the rest be as thou wilt -- _ ele _ marjorie 's laugh be refresh to the schoolmaster after he hard day 's work she be stand behind she father lean over he shoulder and look at they both as they talk some word have remind mr holme of the subject of he write that day and he have give they something of what he have be read and write on egyptian slavery mr holme be always write up something and one of mr west 's usual question be : what have you to tell we about now the subject be intensely interesting to marjorie she have but lately read uncle tom 's cabin and she tear and indignation be ready to burst forth at any suggestion of injustice or cruelty but the thing that she be laugh at be a quotation from one of the older version of the bible roger 's version mr holme tell they when he quote the passage : and the lord be with joseph and he be a luckie felowe she lift she head from she father 's shoulder and run out into the little front yard to find she mother and the other that she might tell they about joseph and ask miss prudence what roger 's version mean but she mother be busy in the milkroom and linnet be come towards the house walk slowly with she eye on the ground will rheid be walk as slowly toward he home as linnet be toward hers miss prudence make a picture all by herself in she plain black dress with no color or ornament save the red rise in she black crape scarf as she sit upright in the rush-bottomed straight-backed chair in the entry before the wide-open door she eye be towards the two who have part so reluctantly on the bridge over the brook marjorie dance away to find she mother suddenly remember to ask if she might share the spare chamber with miss prudence that be -- if linnet do not want to very much marjorie never want to do anything that linnet want to very much open the gate linnet come in slowly with she eye still on the ground shut the gate and stand look off into space then become aware of the still figure on the piazza hurry toward it linnet 's eye be stir with a deeper emotion than have ever move she before miss prudence do not remember she own face twenty year ago but she remember she own heart will rheid be a good young fellow honest and true miss prudence stifle she sigh and say well dear as the young girl come and stand beside she chair i be wish -- i be say to will just now that i wish there be a list of thing in the bible to pray about and then we might be sure that we be ask right and what do he say he say he would ask anyhow and if it come it be all right and if it do not he suppose that be all right too that be faith certainly oh he have faith return linnet earnestly do not you know -- oh you do not remember -- when the evangelist -- that always remind I of marjorie -- linnet be a somewhat fragmentary talker like she mother -- but when mr woodfern be here four of the rheid boy join the church all but holli he be in new york he go about that time mr woodfern be so interested in they all i shall never forget how he use to pray at family worship : ` lord go through that rheid family ' he pray it every day i really believe and they all join the church at the first communion time and every one of they speak and pray in the prayer meeting they use to speak just as they do about anything and people enjoy it so it be so genuine and hearty i remember at a prayer meeting here that winter will arise to speak ' i be talk to a man in town today and he say there be nothing _ in _ religion but oh my i tell he there be nothing _ out _ of it ' i tell he about that to-night and he say he have not find anything outside of it yet he be a fine young fellow say miss prudence mr holme say he have the ` right stuff ' in he and he mean a great deal by that a pleasant thought curve linnet 's lip but miss prudence sit down on the step of the piazza i do wish for a list of thing i want to know if i may pray that mother may never look grave and anxious as she do at the supper table and father may not always have a cough in winter time and will may never have another long voyage and frighten we all and that marjorie may have a chance to go to school too and -- why _ ever _ so many thing a laugh from the disputant in the parlor bring the quick color to miss prudence 's cheek no mere earthly thing quicken she pulse like john holme ' laugh and i do not think that be a mere earthly thing there be so much grace in it do not st paul 's ` everything ' include you ' _ ever _ so many thing ' question miss prudence as the laugh die away i do not know hesitatingly i think it mean about people become christian and faith and patience and such good thing perhaps you request be good thing too but i have think of something that will do for a list of thing it be include in this promise : ` whatsoever thing ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive they and ye shall have they ' desire _ when _ ye pray that be the point do the time when we desire make any difference ask linnet interestedly there be some kind of question that linnet like to ask do it not make all the difference suppose we think of something we want while we be ease-loving forgetful of duty selfish unforgiving neither loving god or we neighbor when we feel far from he instead of near he can we believe that we shall have such a heart 's desire as that would be would you desire be accord to he will he unselfish loving forgiving will no oh no say linnet earnestly but i do think about father and mother and marjorie go to school and -- when i be pray then ask for everything you desire while you be pray do not be afraid _ be _ mother trouble about something not troubled really only perplex a little over something we have be plan about and she be very glad too i do not like to have she troubled because she heart hurt she when she worry marjorie do not know that but she tell I that be one reason -- my strongest reason -- for be sorry about go to boston but you father be with she and he will watch over she but she depend on _ I _ plead linnet marjorie be grow up say miss prudence hopefully marjorie it do not seem to I that she will ever grow up she be such a little puss always absent-minded with a book in she hand and she can not mend or sew or even make cake or clear up a room neatly we spoil she mother and i as much as she spoil she kitten pusheen do you know that _ pusheen _ be irish for puss mr holme tell we i do believe he know everything he come nearer universal knowledge than the rest of we say miss prudence smile at the girl 's eagerness but he be a book himself a small volume in fine print print in a language that none of we can read say linnet to most people he be grant miss prudence but when he be seven i be ten i be a backward child and he use to read to I so he be not a dead language to I linnet pull at the fringe of she white shawl will rheid have bring that shawl from ireland a year ago miss prudence _ do _ we have right desire desire for thing god like while we be pray if we feel he presence if we feel as near to he as mary sit at the foot of christ if we thank he for he unbounded goodness and ask he forgiveness for we sin with a grateful purify and forgiving heart how can we desire anything selfish -- for we own good only and not to honor he anything unholy anything that it would hurt he to grant if we heart be ever one with he heart we will ever one with he will be it not when we be nearest to he nearest in obey or nearest in pray be not there some new impulse toward the thing he love to give we every time we go near to he linnet assent with a slight movement of she head she understand many thing that she could not translate into word yesterday i saw in the paper the death of a old friend they have be silent for several minute miss prudence speak in a musing voice she be a friend in the sense that i have try to befriend she she be unfortunate in she home surroundings she be something of a invalid and very deaf beside she have lose money and be partly dependent upon relative a few of we mr holme be one of they pay she board she be not what you girl call ` real bright ' but she be bright enough to have a heartache every day read she name among the death make I glad of a kindness i grudged she once i do not believe you grudge it interrupt marjorie who have come in time to lean over the tall back of the chair and rest she hand on miss prudence 's shoulder while she listen to what promise to be a story i do notwithstanding one busy morning i open one of she long complain badly-written letter i could scarcely decipher it she be so near-sighted too poor child and would not put on glass she letter be something of a trial to I i read almost to my consternation ' i have be pray for a letter from you for three week ' slip the unsightly sheet back into the envelope hastily rather too hastily i be afraid i say to myself : ` well i do not see how you will get it ' i be busy every hour in those day i do not have to rest as often as i do now and how could i spare the hour she prayer be demand i could find the time in a week or ten day but she have pray for it yesterday and would expect it to-day would pray for it to-day and expect it to-morrow ` why could she not pray about it without tell I ' i argue as i dip my pen in the ink not to write to she but to answer a letter that must be answer that morning i argue about it to myself as i turn from one thing to another work in nervous haste for i do more in those day than god require I to do i serve myself instead of serve he i be about to take up a book to look over a poem that i be to read at we literary circle when word from somewhere arrest I : ` do you like to have the answer to a prayer of yours put off and off in this way ' and i answer aloud ` no i _ do not _ ' ` then answer this as you like to have god answer you ' and i sigh you will hardly believe it but i _ do _ sigh the entice poem go down and two sheet of paper come up and i write the letter for which the poor thing a hundred mile away have be pray three week i try to make it cordial spirited and sympathetic for that be the kind she be pray for and it go to the mail four hour after i have receive she letter i be so glad say sympathetic linnet how glad she must have be not as glad as i be when i see she death in the paper yesterday you do write to so many people say marjorie i count my list yesterday as i write on it the fifty-third name oh dear exclaimed linnet who hate to write letter what do you do it for perhaps because they need letter perhaps because i need to write they my friend have a way of send I the name of any friendless child or girl or woman who would be cheer by a letter and i have not the heart to refuse especially as some of they pray for letter and give thanks for they instead of give my time to ` society ' i give it to letter write and the letter i have in return nothing in story book equal the pathos and romance of some of they i like that kind of good work say marjorie because i be too bashful to talk to people and i can _ write _ anything how little the child know that some day she would write anything and everything because she be too bashful to talk how little any of we know what we be be make ready to do and how we would stop to moan and weep in very self-pity if we do know and thus hinder the work of preparation from go on linnet play with the fringe of she shawl and look as if something hard to speak be hover over she lip do mother tell you about will she ask abruptly interrupt one of miss prudence 's story to marjorie of which she have not heed one word about will repeat marjorie what have happen to he linnet look up with arch demure eye he tell mother and I while we be get supper he like to come out in the kitchen the first mate die and he be make first mate on the trip home and the captain write a letter to he father about he and he father be as proud as he can be and say he 'll give he the command of the bark that be be build in portland and he must not go away again until that be do captain rheid be the largest owner he and african john so they have the right to appoint the master will think it grand to be captain at twenty-four but do not harold feel badly not to have a ship too ask marjorie who be always think of the one leave out but he be younger and he chance will come next he do not feel sure enough of himself either will have study navigation more than he have will go to school to a old sea-captain to study it but harold do not he say it would get knock into he somehow he be mate on a ship he like and have higher wages than will will get at first but will like the honor it be so wonderful for he father to trust he that he can scarcely believe it he say he father must think he be some one else 's son but that letter from the old shipmaster that captain rheid use to know have be the means of it be the bark name yet ask marjorie captain rheid tell father he be go to let mr rheid name it yes say linnet drop she eye to hide the smile in they she be name linnet oh how nice how splendid exclaimed marjorie will not it look grand in the _ argus _ -- ` bark linnet william rheid master ten day from portland ' ten day to where laugh linnet oh to anywhere siberia or the west indy i _ wish _ he would ask we to go aboard linnet _ do not _ you think he might we might go and see she launch perhaps we all have a invitation suppose you run and ask mother reply linnet with the demure smile about she lip marjorie fly away linnet arise slowly gather she shawl about she and pass through the entry up to she own chamber miss prudence do not mean to sigh she do not mean to be so ungrateful there be work enough in she life why should she long for a holiday time girl must all have they story and the story must run on into womanhood as hers have there be no end till it be all live through when thou passest _ through _ the water i will be with thee miss prudence drop she head in she hand she be go through yet will rheid be a manly young fellow just six foot one with a fine frank face a big explosive voice and a half-bashful half-bold manner that savor of land and sea he be as fresh and frolicsome as a sea breeze itself as shrewd as he father and as simple as linnet but -- miss prudence come back from she dream over the past -- would linnet go home with she and go to school perhaps john holme would take marjorie under he special tutelage for awhile until she might come to she and -- how queer it be for she to be plan about other people 's home -- why might he not take up he abode with the west pay good board and not that meager two dollar a week take linnet 's seat at the table become a pleasant companion for mr west through the winter and above all fit marjorie for college and do not he need the social life he be leave too much to he own device at old mr devoe 's marjorie she father with he ready talk she mother with a face that hold remembrance of all the happy event of she life would certainly be a pleasant exchange for mr devoe and dolly she aged cat she would go home to she own snuggery with linnet to share it with a relieved mind if john holme might be take into a family and it be linnet after all who be to make the change and she have only be think of marjorie when linnet come to she to kiss she good night miss prudence look down into she smile eye and quote : ` keep happy sweetheart and grow wise ' the low murmur of voice reach miss prudence in she chamber long after midnight she smile as she think of giant despair and he wife diffidence and then she pray for the wanderer over the sea that he might go to he father as the prodigal do and that if it be not wrong or selfish to wish it she might hear from he once more before she die and then the voice be quiet and the whole house be still xi grandmother even trouble may be make a little sweet -- _ mr platt _ here she be grandmarm call out the captain run right in midget he wife be _ marm _ and he mother _ grandmarm _ marjorie run in at the kitchen door and greet the two occupant of the roomy kitchen captain rheid have plan he house and be determine he say that the woman folk should have room enough to move around in and be comfortable he believe in have the galley as good a place to live in as the cabin it be a handsome kitchen with several window a fine stove a well-arranged sink a large cupboard a long white pine table three broad shelf display row of shine tinware a high mantel with three brass candlestick at one end and a small stone jar of fall flower at the other the yellow floor of narrow board be glowing with its Saturday afternoon mop and the general air of freshness and cleanliness be as refreshing as the breath of the sea or the odor of the field marm and grandmarm like it better deary I ejaculate grandma it be a age since you be here a whole week declare marjorie standing on tiptoe to hang up she sack and hat on a hook near the shelf nobody much come in and it seem longer complain the old lady i think she be very good to come once a week say holli ' sad-faced mother oh i like to come say marjorie push one of the wooden-bottomed chair to grandmother 's side it seem to I thing have happen to you house all of a sudden say mr rheid as she give a final rub to the pump handle and hang up one of the tin washbasin over the sink so it seem to we reply marjorie mother and i hardly feel at home yet it seem so queer at the table with linnet go and two stranger -- well mr holme be not a stranger but he be a stranger at breakfast time do not you know how it all

kitchen towel and to hem she chair be also a hard kitchen chair holli ' mother have never humor herself she often say there be not a rock chair in she house until all she boy be big boy she have thump they all to sleep in a straight-backed high wooden chair but with this she thumping have cease she be know to be as lax in she government as the father be strict in he she be a little woman with large soft black eye with a dumb look of endurance about the lip and a drawl in she subdue voice she have not make herself she loving rough boy and she stern faultfinding husband have mould not only she feature but she character she be afraid of god because she be afraid of she husband but she love god because she know he must love she else she boy would not love she be linnet homesick she question as she sharp shears cut through the crash yes but not very much she like new place she like the school and the girl so far and she like miss prudence 's piano holli have be to see she and helen rheid have call to see she and invite she and miss prudence to come to tea some time miss prudence write I about helen and she be _ lovely _ mr rheid so holli say have you bring she picture back yes be marjorie slowly draw a large envelope from she pocket and take the imperial from it gaze at it long there be a strange fascination to she in the round face with its dark eye and mass of dark hair pile high on the head it be a vignette and the head seem to be rise from fold of black lace the only ornament be a tiny gold chain on which be place a small gold cross to marjorie this picture be the embodiment of every good and beautiful thing it be somebody that she might be like when she have read all the master 's book and learn all pretty gentle way she never see helen rheid notwithstanding helen rheid 's life be one of the mould in which some of she influence be form helen rheid be as much to she as mr brown be to miss prudence after another long look she slip the picture back into the envelope and lay it on the table behind she you be go with miss prudence when linnet be through i suppose ask mr rheid so mother say it seem a long time to wait but i be study at home mother can not spare I to go to school now and mr holme say he would rather hear I recite than not so i be learn to sew and do housework as well you need that as much as schooling return mr rheid decidedly i wish one of my boy could have go to college there be money enough to spare but they father say he have get he learning knock around the world and they could get theirs the same way holli study -- he be study french now do you bring a letter from he inquire he mother eagerly yes say marjorie disappointedly but i want to keep it until the last thing i want you to have the best last if i ever do get the best it will be last say the subdue sad voice then you shall have this first return the bright childish voice but she watchful eye have detect a stitch drop in grandmother 's work and that must be attend to first the old lady give up she work willingly and lay she head back to rest while marjorie knit once around and then the short letter be twice read aloud and every sentence discuss if i ever write to he i suppose he would write to I oftener say he mother but i can not get my hand into shape for fine sewing or for write i would rather do a week 's wash than write a letter marjorie laugh and say she could write letter all day i think miss prudence be very kind to you girl say mr rheid be she a relation not a _ real _ one admit marjorie reluctantly there must be some reason for she take to you and for you mother let you go you mother have the real new england grit and she be proud enough depend upon it there be a reason miss prudence like we that be the reason and we like she but that do not repay _ money _ she think it do and so do we how much board do the master pay inquire grandmother i do not know i do not ask he have bring all he book and the spare chamber be full he let I help he pile they up but he say i must not read one without ask he i do not see what you want to read they for say the old lady sharply can not you mother find enough for you to do in my day -- but you day be a long time ago interrupted she daughter-in-law yes yes most a hundred and girl want everything they can get now perhaps the master hear you lesson to pay he board perhaps assent marjorie they say bee pay they board and work for you beside say mr rheid i guess he be like a bee i expect the widow devoe can not help wish he have stay to she house he propose to come himself say marjorie with a proud flash of she eye and he propose to teach I himself oh yes to be sure but she and the cat will miss he all the same it be all sudden -lrb- missing text -rrb- happen sudden nowadays i keep my eye shut and thing keep whirling around grandmother be seat in a armchair with she foot rest on a home-made foot stool clothe in a dark calico with a little piece of gray shawl pin closely around she neck every lock of hair be conceal beneath a black borderless silk cap with narrow black silk string tie under she tremble chin she lip be sunken and seam she eyelid partly drop over she sightless eye she wither bony finger be laboriously push the needle in and out through a soft gray wool sock every few moment marjorie take the work from she to pick up a drop stitch or two and to knit once around the old eye never once suspect that the work grow faster than she own finger move once she remark plaintively : seem to I it take you a long time to pick up one stitch there be three this time return marjorie seriously what do the master learn you about ask mr rheid oh the school study and i read the dictionary by myself i think you have some new word i want some good word say marjorie now do not you go and get talk like a book say grandmother sharply if you do you can not come and talk to I but you can talk to I return marjorie smile and that be what i want holli write I that i must not say ` guess ' and i do forget so often holli be get idea say holli ' mother well let he i want he to learn all he can marjorie be wonder where she own letter to holli would come in she have stow away in the storehouse of she memory message enough from mother and grandmother to fill one sheet both give with many explanation and before she go home captain rheid would come in and add he word to holli and if she should write two sheet this time would she mother think it foolish it be one of mr west 's old-fashioned way to ask marjorie to let she read every letter that she write with she reserve marjorie could open she heart more fully to miss prudence than she could to one nearer she it be easier to tell miss prudence that she love she than to tell she mother that she love

how to interpret the circumstance that seem to be in answer to you prayer it be as if you speak to god in english and the answer come in sanscrit i think i have receive such answer myself and if we be brute with no capacity of increase we understanding i should think it very queer sometimes it be hard work to pray until we get a answer and then it be harder still to find out its meaning i imagine that linnet and marjorie even will rheid would not understand that but you and i be not lead along in the easiest way it must be because the answer be worth the hard work : he word and spirit can interpret all he involved and mystical answer think with a clear head not with any pre-formed judgment with a heart empty of all but a willingness to read he meaning aright be that mean to shatter you hope or to give bountifully you desire -- with a sincere and abide determination to take it come what may and you will understand as plainly as you be understand I try it and see i have try and i know there may be a wound for you somewhere but oh the joy of the touch of he healing hand and after that come obedience do you remember one a long time ago who have half a answer only a glimmer of light on a dark way he take the answer and go on as far as he understand not daring to disobey but he go on -- something like you too -- in ` bitterness ' in the heat of he spirit he say he go on as far as he could and stay there that be obedience he stay there ` astonished ' seven day perhaps you be in he frame of mind nothing happen until the end of the seven day then he have another word so i would advise you to stay astonished and wait for the end of you seven day in we bitterness and the heat of we spirit we be apt to think that god be rather slow about we business ezekiel could have be busy all that seven day instead of do nothing at all but it be the time for he to do nothing and the time for god to be busy within he you have inquire of the lord that be you busy time now keep still and let god answer as slowly as he will this be he busy time now linnet and i must eat a cracker and then say good-night to all the world yourself dear john include yours prudence \* \* \* \* \* _

voice not strong but clear she will be a lovely symmetrical woman when she come out of the fire purify how do i know she will ever be put in any furnace because all god 's child must suffer at some time and then they know they be he child and she love will so vehemently so idolatrously that i fear the sorrow may be send through he not in any withdraw of he love he be too thoroughly true for that not in any great wickedness he may commit he be too humble and too reliant upon the keep power of god to be allow to fall into that but -- she may not have he always and then i fear she heart would really break she remind I of my own young vehemence and trust but the take away will be the least sorrow of all why how sorrowfully i be write to-day : no how truly i be write of life to-day : of the life you and she be enter -- be already enter upon but god be good god be good hold to that whatever happen some day when you be quite a old woman and i be really a old woman i will tell you about my young day you letter be full of question do not expect I to answer they all at once first about read the bible you poor dear child do you think god keep a book up in heaven to put down every time you fail to read the bible through in a year because you have read it three time in course so many chapter a weekday and so many a Sunday do you think you must keep on so or god will keep it lay up against you well be a law keeper if you must but keep the whole law and keep it perfectly in spirit and in letter or you will fail and if you fail in one single instance in spirit or in letter you fail in all and must bear the curse you must continue in _ all thing _ write in the law to do they be you ready to try that christ could do it and he do do it but can you and if not what you must choose between keep the law and trusting in christ who have keep it for you you can not serve two master : the law and christ now i know i can not keep the law and so i have give up all i can do be to trust in christ to save I in christ who be able to obey all god 's law for I and so i trust he and love he and obey he with the strength he give I if we love he we will keep he commandment he say ' i can do all thing through christ strengthen I ' -- even keep he commandment which be not grievous if you must be a law keeper in you own strength give up christ and cling to the law to save you or else give up keep the law for you salvation and cling to christ keep he commandment because you love he and not keep the old law to save you soul by you own obedience read the bible because you love it every word read till you be full of some message he give you and then shut it up do not keep on because you must read so many chapter a day my plan be -- and i tell you because it have be bless to I -- to ask he to feed I with he truth feed I _ full _ and then i open the book and read one day i be fill full with one clause : ' _ because they faint _ ' i close it i could read no more at another time i read a whole epistle before i have all i be hungry for one evening i read a part of roman and be so excited that i could not sleep for some time that night do not you like that better than read on and on because you have set yourself to do it and end with a feeling of relief because it be _ do _ at last these human heart be naughty thing and need more grace continually just try my way -- not my way but god 's way for I -- and see how full you will be feed with you daily reading i just bethought myself of a page in a old journal i 'll copy it for you it have note of my daily reading i wish

need then the page be write in pencil and some word be almost erase but i be glad i keep they all this time i do not know i be keep they for you little girl i have so fully consecrate myself to god that sometimes i think he do not let any of I be lose even my sin and mistake i have use to warn other and through they i have be lead to thank he most fervently that he have not leave I to greater mistake greater sin some day you heart will almost break with thankfulness and now childie about you pray you say you be _ tire out _ when you prayer be finish i should think you would be poor child if you desire each petition with all you intense nature often one petition use all my strength and i can plead no more -- in word you seem to think that every time you kneel you must pray about every thing that can be pray about the church the world all you friend all you want and everything that everybody want what do you think of my short prayer this morning all i could ejaculate be : ` lord this be thy day every minute of it ' i have have some bless minute when the sinner pray ` lord be merciful to I a sinner ' he do not add ` and bless my father and mother brother and sister and all the sick and sinful and sorrowing and send missionary to all part of the world and hasten thy kingdom in every heart ' and when peter be sink he cry : ` lord save I i perish ' and do not add ` strengthen my faith for this time and all time and remember those who be in the ship look on and wonder what will be the end of this teach they to profit by my example and to learn the lesson thou art intend to teach by this failure of mine ' and when the ship be almost overwhelmed and the frightened disciple come to he -- but why should i go on child _ pour _ out you heart to he and when through physical weariness mental exhaustion or spiritual intensity of feel the heart refuse to be longer pour out _ stop _ do not pump and pump and _ pump _ at a exhaust well for water that have be all use up we be not hear for much speaking or long pray study the prayer he give we to pray study he own prayer he continue all night in prayer but he be not hard upon he weak disciple who through weariness and sorrow fall asleep while he have strength to keep on pray you master be not a hard master we pray when we do not utter one word let the spirit pray in you and do not try to do it all yourself do not make cross for yourself before you begin to pray think of the loving lovely savior and pitiful father you be pray to and ask the spirit to help you pray and then pray and be joyful pray the first petition that come out of you heart and then the second and the third and thank he for everything but here come the girl laugh upstairs and i must listen to the story of they afternoon linnet will

master 's chamber where no one will dare interrupt I i be sit on the rug before the fire with my old atla on my lap he desk with pile of foolscap be so near that when my own sheet give out and my thought and incident be still unexhausted all i have to do be to raise the cover of he desk take a fresh sheet and begin again i want this to be the kind of a three-volumed letter that you like i have inspiration enough -- for i be surround by book contain the wisdom of all the past no story book and i know you want a story letter this room be as cozy as the inside of a egg shell with only the fire the clock the book and myself there be nothing but snow snow snow out the window and promise of more in the threatening sky i be all alone to-day too and i may be alone to-night i rather like the adventure of staying alone perhaps something will happen that never happen to any one before and i may live to tell the tale to my grandchild it be early in the morning that be early to be write a letter but i shall not have much dinner to get for myself and i want to write letter all day _ that _ be a adventure that never happen to I before how do you think it happen that i be alone of course morri and the master have take they dinner and go to school mother have be in portland four day and father be to go for she to-day and bring she home to-morrow morri be to go skating to-night and to stay in middlefield with some of the boy and i tell mr holme that he might go to the lecture on turkey and stay in middlefield too if he would give my note to josie gray and ask she to come down after school and stay with I he say he would come home unless she promise to come to stay with I so i do not suppose i shall have my adventurous night alone after all i do not believe father have go yet i hear he step down-stair i 'll run down to say good-bye again and see if he want anything and go down cellar and get I some apple to munch on to keep I from be lonesome father will take the horse and they will not need to be feed and i tell morris i could feed the two cow and the hen myself so he need not come home just for that but father be call I afternoon be it year and _ year _ since i begin this letter my hair have not turn white and i be not a old woman the ink and paper look fresh too fresher than the old bit of yellow paper that mother keep so preciously that have write on it the invitation to she mother 's wedding that somebody return to she how slowly i be come to it but i want to keep you in suspense i be up in the master 's chamber again sit on the hearth before a snap fire and i have not write one word since i write you that father be call I he do call I and i run down and find that he want a extra shawl for mother for it might be colder to-morrow or it might be a snow-storm i stand at the window and see he pass and listen to the jingle of he bell until they be out of hearing and then i light a bit of a candle -lrb- ah I that it be not longer -rrb- and go down cellar for my apple i open one barrel and then another until i find the one i want the tender green one that you use to like i fill my basket and just then hear the back door open and a step in the entry over my head i turn quickly and push my candlestick over and of course that wee bit of light sputter out i be frighten for fear a spark might have fall among the straw somewhere and spend some time feel around to find the candlestick and to wait to see if a spark _ have _ light the straw and then before i could cry out i hear the footstep pass the door and give it a pull and turn the key father always do that but this be not father i believe it be captain rheid father leave a message for he and expect he to call and i suppose out of habit as he pass the door he shut it and lock it i could not shout in time he be so quick about it and then he go out and shut the outside door hard i think i turn to stone for awhile or faint away but when i come to myself there i stand with the candlestick in my hand all in the dark i could not think what to do i could not find the outside door they be trap door you know and have to be push up and in winter the step be take down and i do not know where they be put i have the candle it be true but i have no match i do not know what i do do my first thought be to prowl around and find the step and push up one of the door and i prowl and prowl and prowl till i be wear out the window -- small window too -- be fill up with straw or something in winter so that it be as dark as a dungeon it _ be _ a dungeon and i be a prisoner if i have not want the apple or if the light have not go out or if captain rheid have not come or if he have not lock the door would i have to stay till josie come and if i pounded and scream would not she be frighten and run away after prowl around and hit myself and knock myself i stand still again and wonder what to do i want to scream and cry but that would not have do any good and i should have feel more alone than ever afterward nobody could come there to hurt I that be certain and i could stamp the rat away and there be apple and potato and turnip to eat but suppose it have to last all night i be too frightened to waste any tear and too weak to stand up by this time so i find a seat on the stair and huddle myself together to keep warm and pray as hard as i ever do in my life i think about peter in prison i think about everything i could think of i could hear the clock strike and that would help I bear it i should know when night come and when morning come the cow would suffer too unless father have throw down hay enough for they and the fire would go out and what would father and mother think when they come home to-morrow would i frighten they by scream and pound would i add to my cold and have quinsy sore throat again would i faint away and never ` come to ' when i write ` adventure ' upstairs by the master 's fire i do not mean a dreadful thing like this staying alone all night be nothing compare to this i have never be through anything compare to this i try to comfort myself by think that i might be lose or lock up in a worse place it be not so damp or cold as it might have be and there be really nothing to be afraid of i have nothing to do and i be in the dark i begin to think of all the story i know about people who have be imprison and what they have do i could not write a pilgrim 's progress i could not even make a few rhyme it be too lonesome i could not sing my voice stop in my throat i think about somebody who be in a dark solitary prison and he have one pin that he use to throw about and lose and then crawl around and find it in the dark and then lose it again and crawl around again and find it i have prowl around enough for the step that amusement have lose its attraction for I and then the clock strike i count eleven but have i miss one stroke or count too many it be not nine when i light that candle well that give I something to reason about and something new to look forward to how many thing could i do in a hour how many could i count how many bible verse could i repeat suppose i begin with a and repeat all i could think of and then go on to b ` ask and ye shall receive ' how i do ask god to let I out in some way to bring somebody to help I to _ send _ somebody would not captain rheid come back again would not morri change he mind and come home to dinner or at night and would mr holme certainly go to hear that lecture be not there anybody to come i think about you and how sorry you would be and i must confess it i do think that i would have something to write to you and holli about -lrb- please let he see this letter i do not want to write all this over again -rrb- so i shiver and huddle myself up in a heap and try to comfort myself and amuse myself as best i could i say all the bible verse i could think and then i go back to my apple and bring the basket with I to the stair i would not eat one potato or turnip until the apple have give out you think i can laugh now so could you after you have get out but the clock do not strike and nobody come and i be sure it must be nearly morning i be so faint with hunger and so dizzy from want of sleep and then it occur to I to stumble up the stair and try to burst the door open that lock be loose it turn very easily in a instant i be up the stair and try the door and lo and behold it open easily it be not lock at all i have only imagine i hear the click of the lock and i be free and the sun be shine and i be neither hungry nor dizzy i do not know whether i laugh or cry or mingle both in a state of ecstasy but i be too much shake to go on with my letter i have to find a story book and a piece of apple pie to quiet my nerve the fire be not out and the clock have only strike ten but when you ask I how long i stay in that cellar i shall tell you one hundred year now be not that adventure enough for the first volume vol ii evening i wait and wait downstairs for somebody to come but nobody come except josie gray 's brother to say that she mother be take ill suddenly and josie could not come i suppose mr holme expect she to come and so he have go to middlefield and morri think so too and so i be leave out in the cold or rather in by the fire mr holme ' chamber be the snuggest room in the house so full of book that you can not be lonely in it and then the fire on the hearth be company it begin to snow before sun down and now the wind howl and the snow seem to rush about as if it be in a fury you ask what i have read this winter book that you will not like : thomson 's ` season ' cowper 's ` task ' pollok 's ` course of time ' milton 's ` paradise regain ' strickland 's ` queen of england ' ` nelson on infidelity ' ` lady huntington and she friend ' ` lady of the lake ' several of the ` bridgewater treatise ' paley 's ` natural theology ' ` trench on miracle ' several dozen of the best story book i could find to make sandwich with the other somebody 's ` travels in iceland ' and somebody 's ` winter in russium ' and ` rassela ' and ` boswell 's johnson ' and i can not remember other at this moment morri say i do not think anything dry but go right through everything because i have the master to help I and i do give ` paradise lose ' up in despair mother say i shall never make three quilt for you if i read so much but i do get on with the patch work and she already have one quilt join and mr rheid be come to help she quilt it next week there be a pile of block on the master 's desk now and i intend to sit here in he arm chair and sew until i be sleepy i wonder if you will do as much for I when my prince come mine be to be as handsome as holli as good as morri as learn as the master and as devote as you splendid will and if i can not find all these in one i will -- make patch work for other bride and live alone with miss prudence and i 'll begin now to make the patch work oh dear i wish you and miss

and go vol iii next day i will not keep you in suspense you dear sympathetic linnet i go down with some inward quake but much outward boldness as the pound increase and do not even ask ` who be there ' before i open the door but i _ be _ relieved to find morris cover with snow look like a storm king he say he have hear through frank gray that josie could not come and he would not let I stay alone in a storm i be so glad if i have be you i should have dance around he but as it be i and not you i only say how glad i be and make he a cup of steam coffee and give he a piece of mince pie for be so good to-day it snow harder than ever so that we do not expect father and mother and mr holme have not come out in the storm because morri see he and tell he that he be on the way home not a sleigh have pass we have not see a single human be to-day i could not have get out to the stable and i do not know what the cow and hen would have do without morri he have throw down more hay for the cow and put corn where the hen may find it for to-morrow in case he can not get out to they the storm have not lessen in any degree i never know anything like it but i be not the ` oldest inhabitant ' would not i have be dreary here alone this do seem to be a kind of adventure but nothing happen father be not strong enough to face any kind of a storm and i be sure they will not attempt to start morri say we be play at housekeeping and he help I do everything and when i sit down to sew on you patch work he read to I i let he read this letter to you forget what i have say about my prince but he only laugh and say he be glad that he be _ good _ enough for I even if he be not handsome enough or learn enough or devote enough and say he would become devoted forthwith but he could not ever expect to attain to the rest he tease I and say that i mean that the other be not good enough he have have a letter from will promise to take he before the mast next voyage and he be hilarious over it he mother try to be satisfied but she be afraid of the water when so many that we know have lose father or brother or husband on the sea it do seem strange that we can so fearlessly send another out mr rheid

i want to go with miss prudence and study i do not want to be a housekeeper and have a husband like linnet i have so much to learn i be eager for everything you see you _ be _ older than i be yes he say disappointedly you be only a little girl yet or you be grow up to be a woman 's rights woman and to think a ` career ' be better than a home and a man who be no better than other man to love you and protect you and provide for you you know that be not true she answer quietly but i have be look forward so long to go to school and living with miss prudence and become like she do not you want I to be like she no he burst out i want you to be like linnet and to think that little house and house-keeping and a good husband good enough for you what be the good of study if it do not make you more a perfect woman what be the good of anything a girl do if it do not help she to be a woman miss prudence be a perfect woman marjorie 's tone be quiet and reasonable but there be a fire in she eye that shine only when she be angry she would be more perfect if she stay at home in maple street and make a home for somebody than she be now go hither and thither find people to be kind to and to help she be too restless and she be not satisfied look at linnet she be happier to-day with she husband that read only the newspaper the nautical book and he bible than miss prudence with all she lecture and concert and buy book and know literary people she could not make a miss prudence out of linnet but she will make a miss prudence twice over out of you linnet be happy because she love will and she do not care for book and people as we do but we have not any will poor miss prudence and poor marjorie we have to substitute people and book you might have both of you he go on excitedly but you want something better both of you -- _ higher _ i suppose you think there be mr holme eat he heart out with be only a friend to miss prudence and you want I to go poke along and spoil my life as he do because you like book and study better marjorie laugh the fire in morri ' blue eye be something to see and the tear in he voice would have overcome she have she not laugh instead and he be go far away too morris i do not know you be quite such a volcano i do not believe mr holme stay here and _ poke _ because of miss prudence i know he be melancholy sometimes but he write so much and think so much he can not be light-hearted like young thing like we and who do as much good as miss prudence be not she another mother to linnet and I and if she do not find somebody to love as linnet do will i do not see how she can help it it be not in she heart or she would have find somebody it be what be in people ' heart that make the difference but when they keep the brain at work and forget they have any heart as you two do -- it be not miss prudence 's brain that do she beautiful work you ought to read some of the letter that she let I read and then you would see how much heart she have and you want to be just like she he sigh but the sigh be almost a groan certainly in some experience he have outstrip marjorie yes i want to be like she she answer deliberately and study and go around and do good and never be marry he question i do not see the need of decide that question to-day i suppose not you will when holli rheid ask you to morri you be not like yourself to-day you be quarrel with I and we never quarrel before because you be so unreasonable you will not answer I anything i have answer you truly i have no other answer to give will you think and answer I when i come home i have answer you now perhaps you will have another answer then well if i have i will give it to you be you satisfied no he say but he turn she face up to he and look down into she innocent earnest eye you be a goosie as linnet say you will never grow up little marjorie then if i be only eight you must not talk to I as if i be eighty or eighteen he say how far on the voyage of life do you suppose linnet and captain will be not far enough on to quarrel i hope they will never be far enough for that will be too generous and linnet will never find anything to differ about do you know marjorie that girl have no idea how will love she marjorie stop and face he with the utmost gravity do you know morri that man have no idea how linnet love he and then the two burst into a laugh that restore they both to the perfect understanding of themselves and each other and all the world and after a early supper he shake hand with they all -- except mother west whom he kiss and marjorie whom he ask to walk as far as linnet 's with he on he way to the train -- and before ten o'clock be on board the _ linnet _ and congratulating again the bridegroom who be still radiant and the bride who be not look in the least bit homesick will say linnet with the weight of tone of one give announcement to a mighty truth i would not be any one beside myself for _ anything _ and i would not have you any one beside yourself for _ anything _ he laugh in the big explosive voice that charm linnet every time afresh xiv a talk and another talk life 's great result be something slow -- howell morri have say good-bye with a look that bring sorrow enough in marjorie 's eye to satisfy he -- almost and have walk rapidly on not once turn to discover if marjorie be stand still or move toward home mr holme and miss prudence have promise to start out to meet she so that she walk homeward in the starlight would not be lonely but they be not in sight yet to marjorie 's vision and she stand lean over the gate look at the window with they white shades drop and already feel that the little new home be solitary she do not turn until a footstep pause behind she she be so lose in dream of linnet and morri that she have not notice the brisk hurry tread the white rise have fall from she hair and the one at she throat have lose several petal in she hand be a bunch of daisy that morri have pick along the way and laughingly ask she to try the childish trick of find out if he love she and she have say she be afraid the daisy be too wise and would not ask they have not you be home all this time ask hollis startling she out of she dream oh yes and come back again do you find the cottage so charming i find it charming but i could have wait another day to come and see it i come to walk part of the way with morri she color because when she be embarrassed she color at everything and could not think of another word to say among those who understand he rather among those he understand holli be a ready talker but seemingly he too could not think of another word to say marjorie pick she daisy to piece and they go on in the narrow foot path as she and morri have do in the afternoon holli walk on the grass and give she the path as she other companion have do she could think of everything to say to morri and morri could think of everything to say to she but morri be only a boy and this tall stranger be a gentleman a gentleman whom she have never see before if it be good sleighing i might take you on my sled he remark when all the daisy be pull to piece be flyaway in existence still she ask brightly relieve that she might speak at last ` stow away ' as father say in the barn somewhere mr holme be not as strict as he use to be be he no he never be after that i think he need to give a lesson to himself he look haggard and old i suppose he be old i do not know how old he be over forty that _ be _ antiquated you will be forty yourself if you live long enough twenty-two year she answer seriously that be time enough to do a good many thing in i intend to do a good many thing he answer with a proud humility in he voice that strike marjorie what -- for example travel for one thing make money for another what do you want money for she question what do any man want it for i want it to give I influence and i want a luxurious old age that do not strike I as be the highest motive probably not but perhaps the highest motive as you call they do not rule my life and she have be pray for he so long you mother seem to be a happy woman be she reply come out of a thought that she do not speak she be he say emphatically i wish poor old father be as happy do you find many happy people she ask i find you and my mother he return smile and yourself not always i be happy enough today not as jubilant as old will though will have a prize to be sure he have say marjorie what be you go to do next go to that pleasant home in maple street with miss prudence and go to school she be jubilant too today or she would have be if morri have not go away with such a look in he eye you ought to be graduate by this time you be old enough helen be not as old as you but i have not be at school at all yet she hasten to say and helen be so bright be not you bright he ask laugh mr holme do not tell I that i be what will you mother do oh dear she sigh that be what i ask myself every day but she insist that i shall go linnet have have she ` chance ' she say and now it be my turn miss prudence be always find somebody that need a home and she have find a girl to help mother a girl about my age that have not any friend so it be not the work that will trouble I it be leave mother without any daughter at all she be willing to let linnet go she ought to be as willing to let you oh she be and father be too i know i do not deserve such good time but i do want to go i love miss prudence as much as i do mother i believe and i be only forty mile from home mr holme be about leave too how father will miss _ he _ and morri go mother sigh over the change and then say change must need come if boy and girl will grow up where be mr holme go to california the doctor say he must go somewhere to cure he cough and he say he will rest and write another book have you read he book no it be too dry for I we do not think it be dry morri and i know it by heart that be because you know the author perhaps it be the book be everything but a story book miss prudence have a copy in turkey morocco do you see many people that write book no he say smile at she simplicity new york be not full of they miss prudence see they reply marjorie with dignity she be a bird of they feather i do not fly i walk on the ground -- with my eye on it perhaps like the man with the muck rake say marjorie quote from she old love _ pilgrim progress _ do not you know there be a crown hold above he head and he eye be on the ground and he could not see it no i do not know it but i perceive that you be talk a allegory at I not at you _ to _ you she correct you write very short letter to I nowadays you letter be not suggestive enough she say archly like my conversation as poor a talker as i be i be a better talker than writer and you -- you write a dozen time better than you talk i be sorry i be so unentertaining to-night when linnet write she say : ' i wish i could _ talk _ to you ' and when i talk i think : ' i wish i could write it all to you ' as some one say of some one who could write better than he talk ` he have plenty of bank note but he carry no small change in he pocket ' it be so apt to be too small she answer somewhat severely i see you be above talk the nonsense that some girl talk what do you do to get rest from you thought how marjorie laugh holli do talk to I instead of write and i 'll write to you instead of talk that be you wish I near to you and yourself far away from I that be the only way that we can satisfy each other be not that miss prudence come and the master they do not know i would have a escort home but do come all the way father will like to hear you talk about the place you have visit i travel i do not visit place i expect to go to london and pari by and by we buyer have be get married and that do not please the firm he want to take he wife with he but they veto that they say a married man will not attend strictly to business see what a premium be pay to bachelorhood i shall understand lace well enough soon : i can pick a piece of imitation out of a hundred real piece now do linnet like the handkerchief and scarf you should have see she have not she speak of they no she be too full of other thing marriage be not all in get ready to linnet say marjorie seriously i find she cry one day because she be so happy and do not deserve to be will be a good fellow say holli i wish i be half as good but i be so contradictory so unsatisfied and so unsatisfying i understand myself better than i want to and yet i do not understand myself at all that be because you be _ grow _ say marjorie with she wise air i have not settle down into a real marjorie yet i should not know my own picture unless i paint it myself we be two rather dangerous people be not we laugh holli we will steer clear of each other as will would say until we can come to a understanding unless we can help each other marjorie answer but i do not believe you need to be pull apart but only to be let alone to grow -- that be if the germ be perfect a perfect germ he repeat holli like to talk about himself to any one who would help he to self-analysis but the slowly move figure be approach the black figure with bent shoulder and a slouched hat the tall slight figure at he side in light gray with a shawl of white wool across she shoulder and draw up over she hair the fleecy whiteness soften the line of a face that be already soften o prudence how far ahead we be of those two exclaim the school-master and they be wiser than we perhaps because they do not know so much they do not know so much of each other surely she reply with a low laugh that very day mr holme have quote to she give it a personal application : what she suffer she shake off in the sunshine he have be argue within himself all day whether or not to destroy that letter in he pocket or to show it to she would it give she something else to shake off in the sunshine holli be wonder if this marjorie with she sweet bright face she graceful step and air of ladyhood with modest and quick reply not at all intrude herself but give herself unconsciously could be the same half-bashful little girl that he have walk with on a country road four year before the little girl who fall so far behind he ideal the little girl so different from city girl and now who among he small circle of girlhood at home could surpass she and she be dress so plainly and there be mark of toil upon she finger and even freckle hide beneath the fresh bloom of she cheek she would hunt egg tomorrow and milk the cow she might not only weed in the garden but when the potato be dig she might pick they up and even assist she father in assort they have he not say that marjorie be he boy as well as she mother 's girl have she not take the place of morri in all thing that a girl could and have she not take he place with the master and go on with virgil where morris leave off marjorie i do not see the _ need _ of you go to school he be say when they join the other holli you be right repeat the master emphatically that be only a whim but she will graduate the first year so it do not matter you see he be proud of he work say marjorie he will not give any school the credit of I i will give you into miss prudence 's keep for a term of year to round you off to make you more of a woman and less of a student -- like herself marjorie 's eye kindle i wish morri might hear that he have be scold I -- but that would satisfy he after several moment of light talk if the master ever could be say to encourage light talk he touch miss prudence detain she with he and marjorie and holli walk on together marjorie and holli be not silent nor altogether grave for now and then she laugh would ripple forth and he would join with a ringing boyish laugh that make she forget that he have grow up since that day he bring she the plate but the two behind they be altogether grave miss prudence be speak for mr holme have ask she what kind of a day she have have to-morrow be to be one of we anniversary you know she reply twenty-four year ago -- to-morrow -- be to have be to I what to-day be to linnet i wonder if i _ be _ as light heart as linnet you be as blithe a maiden as ever tread on air he return smile sadly do not i remember how you use to chase I around that old garden when we go back let we try another chase shall we we will let marjorie run and imagine it be i prudence if i regain my strength out there i be come home to tell you something may i i want you to regain you strength but i be tremble when i think of anything to be tell be it anything -- about -- jerome yes it be about he and about my self it be about we last interview when we speak of you do you still believe that he be live yes we be live why should he not be alive do yon know how old he would be he be just twenty year older than i then he must be sixty-four that be not young prudence and he have grow old when i say goodbye to he on the steamer -- no it be not a steamer he avoid the publicity he go in a merchant ship there be not even one passenger beside himself he have a fine constitution and he know how to take care of himself it be the -- worry that make he look old he be very warm-hearted and lovable yes escape miss prudence 's lip but he be weak and lead astray -- it seem strange that you silver wedding day might be almost at hand and that tall boy and girl in front of you my brother 's child to call I uncle john john she sob catch she breath poor child now i have bring the tear i be determine to get that dead look out of you eye that be begin to come to-night it shall go away to-night and you shall not awake with it in the morning do you know what you want do you want to tell I what you pray about on you

about he head not lie with the linen clothes but wrap together in a place by itself ' i can not see any comfort in that there be a broken sound in the master 's voice that miss prudence have never hear before a hopelessness that be something deeper than he old melancholy have any confession that she have make touch he anew be he trouble at that acknowledge hardness towards he brother or be it sorrow afresh at the mention of she disappointment or be it sympathy for the friend who have give she up and go away without she would miss prudence have be burden as she never have be burden before could she have know that he have lose a long-cherished hope for himself that he have live he lonely life year after year wait until he should no longer be bind by the promise make to he brother at they parting the promise be this that he should not ask prudence prue he brother have say to marry he until he himself should be dead in pity for the brother who have educate he and have in every way be so generous and who now plead brokenly for this last mercy he have give the promise rather it have be wring out of he and for a little time he have not repent and then when he forget he brother and remember himself he heart die within he and there be nothing but hard work leave to live for this only for a time he find god afterward and work hard for he he have write to he brother and beg release but no word of release have come and he be grow old and he health have fail under the stress of work and the agony of he self-control the constant anguish of patience but the letter in he pocket be of no avail now prudence have love he only as a brother all these long year of he suspense and hope and wait that friend whose sudden death have move she so have be in she thought and he be only she dear friend and -- jerome 's brother it be no wonder that the bent shoulder droop lower and that the slouch hat be draw over a face that fain would have hide itself prudence he sister prudence be speak to he and he have not hear a word how that young fellow in front be rattle on and laugh as though heart never ache or break with ache and now he be daring marjorie to a race and the fleet-footed girl be in full chase and the two who have run they race nearly a quarter of a century before walk on slowly and seriously with more to think about and bear than they could find word for i find comfort in that shall i tell you she ask yes he say if you can make I understand i think you will understand but i shall not make you i shall speak slowly for i want to tell you all i think the lord be dead he have be crucify and lay away within the sepulchre three day since and they who have so love he and so trust in he promise be broken-hearted because of he death we christ have never be dead to we john think what it must have be to they to know he _ dead _ ` let not you heart be trouble ' he say but they heart be trouble and he know it he know how john 's heart be rent and how he be sorrow with the mother he have take into he own home he know how peter have weep he bitter tear how martha and mary and lazarus be grieve for he how all be watch wait hope and yet hardly daring to hope -- oh how little we grief seem to we beside such grief as theirs and the third day since he have be take from they do they expect again to hear he footfall or he voice he could see all this time the hand outstretch in prayer he could hear they cry he could feel the beating of every heart and yet how slowly he be go forth to meet they how could he stay he foot be not peter and john run towards he be not mary on she way to he and yet he do not hasten something must first be do such little thing the linen clothes must be lay aside and the napkin that have be about he head must be wrap together in a place by itself such a little thing to think of such a little thing to do before he could go forth to meet they be it necessary that the napkin should be wrap together in a place by itself as necessary as that they terrible suspense should be end as necessary as that peter and john and martha and mary and he mother should be comfort one little instant sooner could you or i wait to fold a napkin and lay it away if we might fly to a friend who be weary for we suppose god say : ` fold that napkin and lay it away ' do we do it cheerfully and submissively choose to do it rather than to hasten to we friend if a leper have stand in the way beseech he if the dead son of a widow be be carry out we could understand the instant 's delay if only a little child be wait to speak to the lord but to keep so many wait just to lay the linen clothes aside and most of all to wrap together that napkin and lay it by itself only the know that the do this be do the will of god reconcile I to the wait that one instant longer that he mother need not have wait but for that so john perhaps you and i be wait to do some little thing some little thing that we do not know the meaning of before god 's will can be perfect concern we it may be as near to we as be the napkin about the head of the lord i be forget that after he die for we there be any of the father 's will left for he to do and i suppose he fold that napkin as willingly as he give himself up to the cross john that do help I -- i be so impatient at interruption to what i call my ` work ' and i be so impatient for the lord to work for I yes he answer slowly it be hard to realize that we _ must _ stop to do every little thing but i do not stop i pass the small thing by prudence i be burn up with impatience to-night be you i

the sky xvi maple street work for some good be it ever so slowly -- _ mr osgood _ the long room with its dark carpet and dark wall be in twilight in twilight and in firelight for without the rain be fall steadily and in the old house fire be need early in the season in the time of which little jeroma have hear there have be a fire on the hearth in the front parlor but to-night when that old time be among the legend the fire glow in a large grate in the back parlor the heat come up through the register miss prudence have a way of designate the long apartment as two room for there be a arch in the center and there be two mantel and two fireplace prue 's father would have say to-night that the old room be unchanged -- nothing have be take out and nothing new bring in since that last night that he have see the old man pacing up and down and the old man 's daughter whirling around on the piano stool as full of hope and trust and enthusiasm as ever a girl could be but to-night there be a solitary figure before the fire with no memory and no tradition to disturb she dream with no memory of other people 's past that be for there be a sad memory or a foreboding in the very droop of she shoulder and in she listless hand the small plump figure be array in school attire of dark brown with linen collar and cuff button boot rest on the fender and a black silk apron with pocket there be book and a slate upon the rug and a slate pencil and lead pencil in one of the apron pocket a sheet of note paper have slip from she lap down to the rug on the sheet of paper be a half-finished letter begin : dear morris there be nothing in the letter worth jot down she wonder why she have ever begin it she be nestle down now with she head on the soft arm of the chair she eye be close but she be not asleep for the moisture beneath the tremulous eyelid have form itself into two large drop and be slowly rolling unheed down she cheek the rain be beat noisily upon the window pane and the wind be rise higher and higher as it lull for a moment there be the sound of a footfall on the carpet somewhere and the door be push open from the light hall do not you want to be light up yet miss marjorie no deborah thank you i 'll light the lamp myself young thing like to sit in the dark i guess mutter old deborah close the door softly add to herself : miss prudence use to once on a time and this girl be come to it after that for a little time there be no sound save the sound of the rain and now and then the soft sigh that escape marjorie 's lip how strange it be she reason with herself for she to care at all what if holli do not want to answer that last letter of hers write more than two month ago just after linnet 's wedding day that have be a long letter perhaps too long but she have be so lonesome miss everybody linnet and morri and mr holme and miss prudence have go to she grandfather 's for the sea bathing and the girl have come to help she mother and she have walk over to he mother 's and talk about everything to she and then write that long letter to he that long letter that have be unanswered so long when he letter be due she have expect it as usual and have walk to the post-office the two mile and a half for the sake of the letter and have something to do she could not believe it when the postmaster hand she only she father 's weekly paper she stand a moment and then ask be that all and the next week come and the next and the next and no letter from he and then she have cease with a dull sense of loss and disappointment to expect any answer at all she mother inquire briskly every day if she letter have come and urge she to write a note ask if he have receive it for he might be wait for it all this time but shyness and pride forbid that and afterward he mother call and speak of something that he must have read in that letter she feel how she must have color and be glad that she father call she at that moment to help he shell corn for the chicken when she return to the house brighten up and laugh she mother tell she that mr rheid have say that holli have begin to write to she regularly and she be so proud of it she say it be because you be go away and he want she to hear directly from he i guess too it be because he be be exercise in he mind and think he ought to have write oftener before she say she hand be out of practice and the cap'n hate to write letter and only write business letter when it be a force put i guess she will miss you marjorie marjorie think to herself that she would but marjorie 's mother do not repeat all the conversation she do not say that she have follow she visitor to the gate and after glance around to be sure that marjorie be not near have lower she voice and say : but i do think it be a shame mis ' rheid for you holli to treat my marjorie so after write to she four year to give she the slip like this and the girl take on about it i can see it by she look although she be too proud to say a word i be sure i be sorry say mr rheid holli would not do a mean thing i do not know what you call this then marjorie 's mother have reply spiritedly as she turn towards the house mr rheid ponder night and day before she write to holli what marjorie 's mother have say but he never answer that part of the letter and he mother never know whether she have do harm or good poor little marjorie could have tell she with a indignation that she would have be frighten at but marjorie never know i be afraid she would not have feel like kiss she mother good-night if she have know it she father look grave and anxious that night when she mother tell he as in duty bind she be to tell he everything how she be arrange thing for marjorie 's comfort that be wrong sarah that be wrong he say how wrong i do not see how it be wrong she have answer sharply then i can not explain to you marjorie be not hurt any i do not believe she care half as much as you do you do not know you do not see she all the time she miss linnet and morri and perhaps she grieve about go away you remind I of some one in the bible -- a judge he have thirty son and thirty daughter and he get they all marry it be well for you peace of mind that you have but two it be no laughing matter she rejoin no it be not he sigh for he understand marjorie how the tear would have burn dry on marjorie 's indignant cheek have she surmise one tithe of she mother 's remonstrance and defense it be true she miss he letter and she miss write she long letter to he but she do not miss he as she would have miss morri have some misunderstanding come between they she be full of she home and she study and she feel herself too young to think grown-up thought and have grown-up experience she feel herself to be so much younger than linnet but she pride be touch simple-hearted as she be she want holli to care a little for she letter she have try to please he and to be thoughtful about he mother and grandmother and this be not a pleasant end she mother have watch she she be well aware and she be glad to come away with miss prudence to escape she mother 's keen eye she father have kiss she tenderly more than once as though he be seek to comfort she for something it be _ such _ a relief -- and she draw a long breath as she think of it -- to be away from both and to be with miss prudence who never see anything or think anything or ask any question a few tear drop slowly as she cuddle in the chair with she head on its arm she hardly know why because she be alone perhaps and linnet be so far off and it rain and miss prudence and she little girl might not come home to-night and it might be because miss prudence have another little girl to love miss prudence have go to new york a week ago to meet the child and to visit the rheid the nurse have relative in the city and prefer to remain with they but prue would be ready to come home with miss prudence and it be possible that they might come to-night the house have be so lonely with old deborah it be no wonder that she begin to cry and it be foolish to remember that holland plate in mr harrowgate 's parlor that she have see to-day when she have stop after school on a errand for miss prudence what a difference it have make to she that it be that plate on the bracket and not that yellow pitcher the yellow pitcher be in fragment now up in the garret she must show it to prue some rainy day and tell she about what a naughty little girl she have be that day that resolution help to shake off she depression she rouse herself go to the window and look out into darkness and then saunter as far as the piano and seat herself to play the march that holli like napoleon cross the alp but scarcely have she touch the key before she hear voice out in the rain and foot upon the piazza deborah 's old ear have catch a earlier sound and before marjorie could rush out the street door be open and the traveller be in the hall exclamation and warm embrace and then marjorie draw the little one into the parlor and before the fire the child stand with she grave eye search out the room and when the light from the bronze lamp on the center table flash out upon everything she walk up and down the length of the apartment stop now and then to look curiously at something marjorie smile and think to herself that she be a strange little creature it be just as papa say she remark come to the rug she survey be end the childishness and sweet gravity of she tone be striking marjorie remove the white hood that she have travel from californium in and brushing back the curl that shine in the light like thread of gold kiss she forehead and cheek and rosy lip i be you cousin marjorie and you be my little cousin i like you cousin marjorie the child say of course you do and i love you be

laugh up the broad staircase to bed miss prudence have finish she evening 's work and evening 's pleasure and be now sit opposite marjorie near the register in the back parlor a round table have be roll up between they upon which the shaded bronze lamp be burn gas not have yet be introduce into old-fashioned maple street the table be somewhat litter and in confusion prue 's stereoscope be there with the new view of the yosemite at which she have be look that evening and ask aunt prue numerous question among which be shall we go and see they some day shall we go everywhere some day aunt prue have satisfy she with perhaps so darling and then have fall silently to wonder why she and prue might not travel some day a year in europe have always be one of she postpone intention and by and by how she child would enjoy it marjorie 's book and write desk be on the table also for she have study mental philosophy and chemistry after she have copy she composition and write a long letter to she mother short letter be as truly a impossibility to marjorie as short address be to some public speech still marjorie always stop when she find she have nothing to say to she mother school and miss prudence and prue 's saying and doings be a endless theme of delight not only do she take marjoire 's letter to she old father and mother but she more than a few time carry they in she pocket when she visit mr rheid that she might read they aloud to she miss prudence 's work be also on the table pretty sew for prue and she writing material for it be the night for she weekly letter to john holmes mr holme do not parade he letter before the neighbor but none the less do he pore over they and ponder they for whom have he in all the world to love save little prue and aunt prue marjorie have close the chemistry with a sigh reserve astronomy for the fresher hour of the morning with the burden of the unlearned lesson on she mind she open she bible for she usual evening reading shrink from it with a distaste that she have feel several time of late and that she have fight against and pray about last evening she have compel herself to read a extra chapter to see if she might not read herself into a comfortable frame of mind and then she have close the book with a sigh of relief feeling that this last task of the day be do to-night she fix she eye upon the page awhile and then drop the book into she lap with a weary gesture that be not unnoticed by the eye that never lose anything where marjorie be concern it be something new to see a fretful or fret expression upon marjorie 's lip but it be certainly there to-night and miss prudence see it it might be also in she eye but if it be the uneasy eyelid be at this moment conceal it the child be very weary to-night miss prudence thought and wonder if she be allow she in she ambition to take too much upon herself music with the two hour a day practice that she resolutely never omit all the school lesson read and letter and the conscientious preparation of she lesson for bible class be most assuredly sufficient to tax she mental and physical strength and there be the daily walk of a mile to and from school and other thing numberless to push themselves in for she comfort and prue 's but she step be elastic she color as pretty as when she work in the kitchen at home and when she come in from school she be always ready for a romp with prue before she sit down to practice when summer come the garden and trip to the island would be good for both she child miss prudence advocate the higher education for girl but if marjorie 's color have fade or she spirit flag she would have take she out of school and set she to household task and to walk and drive have she not take linnet home after she three year course with the country color fresh in she cheek and she step as light upon the stair as when she leave home the weariness have creep into marjorie 's face since she close she book it be not when she open the bible be the child endure any spiritual conflict again linnet have never have spiritual conflict what should she do with this too introspective marjorie would prue grow up to ask question and need just such comforting too miss prudence 's own evening 's work have begin with she bible read she read and meditate all the hour and a quarter that marjorie be write she letter -lrb- they have supper so early that they evening begin at half-past six -rrb- she have read with eagerness and a sense of deep enjoyment and appreciation it be so good she have exclaim as she lay the bible aside and marjorie have raise she head at the exclamation and ask what be so good peter 's two letter to the church and to I without reply marjorie have dip she pen again and write : miss prudence be more and more of a saint every day marjorie it be a snow storm yes say marjorie not open she eye miss prudence look at the bronze clock on the mantel it be ten o'clock marjorie should have be asleep a hour ago

send you upstairs with prue after this linnet 's hour be nine o'clock when she be study and look at she and nannie rheid but i be not get through to be marry as linnet be how do you know ask miss

protest what be it that tire you so to-night school no answer marjorie sit upright school sit as lightly on my shoulder as that black lace scarf you give I yesterday it be because i grow more and more wicked every night i be worse than i be last night i try to read in the bible just now and i do not care for it one bit or understand it one bit i begin to think i never should find anything to do I good in malachus or in any of the old prophet suppose you read to I awhile -- not in the bible but in you sunday-school book you tell prue that it be fascinating ` history of the reformation ' be not it to-night o aunt prue i be too tired well then a chapter of walter scott that will rest you no it will not i would not understand a word ` the minister 's woo ' then you admire mr stowe so greatly i do not admire she to-night i be afraid aunt prue even a startling ring at the door bell will not wake I up suppose i play for you suggest miss prudence gravely i think you want I to go to bed say marjorie suppress she annoyance as well as she could just see child you be too worn out for all and any of these thing that you usually take pleasure in and yet you take up the bible and expect to feel devotional and be greatly edify even to find that malachus have a special message for you and you berate yourself for hardheartedness and coldheartedness when you be so weary do not you see that you brain refuse to think do you mean that i ought to read only one verse and think that enough oh if i might have you take more time than that would require for other thing to-day why yes say marjorie look surprised then why should you give god 's book just half a minute or not so long and wayland and legendre and every body else just as much time as the length of you lesson claim could you make anything of you astronomy now no i know i could not and that be why i be leave it till morning suppose you do not study it at all and tell mr mccosh that you be too tired to-night he would not accept such a excuse he would ask why i defer it so long he would think i be make fun of he to give he such a excuse i would not dare but you go to god and offer he you evening sacrifice with eye so blind that they can not see he word and brain so tired that it can find no meaning in they will he accept a excuse that you be ashamed to give you teacher no say marjorie look startle i will read and perhaps i can think now but miss prudence be bend towards she and take the bible from she lap let I find something for you in malachus and help I understand say marjorie after a moment miss prudence read aloud : ` and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice be it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick be it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be please with thee or accept thy person saith the lord of host ' close the book she return it to marjorie 's lap you mean that god will not accept my excuse for not feel like read to-night you say that mr mccosh would not accept such a excuse for you astronomy miss prudence marjorie be wide awake now you mean that i should read early in the evening as you do be _ that _ why you always read before you do anything else in the evening it certainly be i try to give my blind tired hour to god and find that he do not accept -- for i have no blessing in reading i excused myself on you plea i be too weary and then i learn to give he my best and freshest time there be no weariness or frettedness in marjorie 's face now the heart rest be give she physical rest i will begin to-morrow night -- i can not begin to-night -- and read the first thing as you do i be almost through the old testament how i shall enjoy begin the new miss prudence be it so about pray too what do you think i know it be and that be why my prayer do

tell linnet and I that we ought not to talk after we say we prayer so we use to talk first and put we prayer off until the last thing and sometimes we be so sleepy we hardly know what we be say this plan of early reading and pray do not interfere with prayer at bedtime you know as soon as my head touch the pillow i begin to pray i think i always fall asleep pray and my first thought in the morning be prayer my dear we best and freshest not we lame and blind belong to god yes assent marjorie in a full tone aunt prue o aunt prue what would i do without you to help I god would find you

give the fresh hour of she morning to god the tempting astronomy be open in she hand at the chapter _ via lactea _ she glance at it and read half a page then drop it suddenly and reach forward for the

little prayer that she might understand and enjoy she open to malachi and reverently and thoughtfully with no feeling of be hurry read the first and second chapter she think awhile about the blind for sacrifice and in the second chapter find word that mean something to she : my covenant be with he of life and peace life and peace peace have she ever known anything that be not peace before she have

ask aunt prue to let she go to school with she one day every week as a visitor until the new quarter commence miss prudence be not usually so strict she reason within herself why must she wait for another quarter be she afraid of the cold for prue she must be wait for something perhaps it be to hear from mr holme marjorie reason she consult he with regard to every new movement of prue 's she know that when she write to he she call she we little girl while miss prudence and morri linger at the breakfast table they catch sound of romp and laughter on the staircase and in the hall above those two be my sunshine say miss prudence i wish mother could have some of its shine answer morris my sister do not give poor mother much beside the hard side of they own life when miss prudence 's two sunbeam rush -lrb- if sunbeam do rush -rrb- into the back parlor they find she and morris talk earnestly in low rather suppress tone morris seem excite there be a air of resolution about miss prudence 's attitude that promise marjorie there would be some new plan to be talk about that night there be no stagnation even in the monotony of miss prudence 's little household hardly a day pass that marjorie do not find she with some new thing to do for somebody somewhere outside in the ever-increasing circle of she friend miss prudence 's income as well as herself be keep in constant circulation marjorie enjoy it it be the ideal with which she have paint the bright day of she own future but then -- miss prudence have money and she would never have money in a little old book of miss prudence 's there be a list of name -- miss prudence have show it to she -- against several name be write go home against other do and against as many as a dozen something to do the name of morri ' mother be include in the last marjorie hope the opportunity to do that something have come at last but what could it be she could not influence morri ' hardhearted sister to understand they mother and be tender towards she : even she could not do that what would miss prudence think of marjorie be sure that he mother would be comfort and morris satisfied she hope morri would not have to settle on the land he love the water with such abound enthusiasm he be so ready for he opportunity and so devoted to become a sailor missionary what a noble boy he be she have never love he as she love he at this moment as he stand there in all he young strength and beauty willing to give up he own planned life to serve the mother whom he sister have cast off he be like that hero she have read about -- rather be not all true hero like he it be queer she have not think of it once since -- why do she think of it now -- but that day miss prudence have come to see she so long ago the day she find she asleep in she chair she have be read in she Sunday school library about some one like morri just as unselfish just as ready to serve christ anywhere and -- perhaps it be foolish and childish -- she would be ashamed to tell any one beside god about it -- she have ask he to let some one love she like he and then she have fall asleep oh and -- morri have not give she that thing he have bring to she perhaps it be a book she want she be always want a book -- or it might be some curious thing from italy have he forget it she care to have it now more than she care last night what be the matter with she last night that she care so little she do look up to he more than she know herself she value he opinion she be more to herself because she be so much to he there be no one in the world that she open she heart to as she open it to he not miss prudence even sympathetic as she be she would not mind so very very much if he know about that foolish childish prayer but she could not ask he what he have bring she she have almost no quite refuse it last night how contradictory and uncomfortable she be she must say good-bye now too during she reverie she have retreat to the front parlor and stand lean over the closed piano she wrap all on for school and shawl strap of book in she hand o marjorie ready for school may i walk with you i 'll come back and see miss prudence afterward will you she

question and to study critically she dress and to touch she hair and pity she and kiss she and she would be sure to open the round gold locket she wear upon a tiny gold chain about she neck and tell they it be my papa who die in californium she be very proud of show my papa what excuse could she make to the child it be not storm and she do not have a cold and she heart do seem so set on it the last thing after she come upstairs last night she have open the inside blind to look out to see if it be snow and she have charge deborah to have the fire kindle early so that she would not be late at breakfast she must go herself she could concoct no reason for remain at home herself she throat have be a trifle sore last night but not even the memory of it could bring it back this morning deborah

be burn last night but that be with the excitement of the anticipation if somebody should come but who she have not stay at home for morri and linnet would not come early enough to keep they at home that be if she ought to remain at home for linnet what could happen she could not make anything happen she could not tell the child the naked truth the horrible truth and she could not tell she a lie and she could not break she heart by say that she do not want she to go oh if miss prudence be only at home to decide but would she tell _ she _ the reason if she do not take prue she must tell miss prudence the whole story she would rather go home and never go to school any more than to do that oh why must thing happen all together prue would soon be awake and ask if it be storm she have let she take it for grant last night she could not think of anything to say once she have say in aggrieved voice : i think you might be glad marjorie but be it not all selfishness after all she be arrange to give prue a disappointment merely to spare herself the child would not understand anything but then would aunt prue want she to go she must do what miss prudence would like that would decide it all oh

come as a shock to she miss prudence have save she that xx heir together oh for a mind more clear to see a hand to work more earnestly for every good intent -- _ phebe cary _ aunt prue begin marjorie i can not help think about beauty i do not see why you should child when there be so many beautiful thing for you to think about it be the morning after prue have hear the story of she father it be Saturday morning and she be in the kitchen help deborah bake mr kemlo be rest in a steamer chair near the register in the back parlor rest and listen the listening be in itself a rest it be a rest not to speak unless she please it be a rest to listen to the low tone of culture voice to catch bit of bright talk about thing that bring she out of herself it be a rest above all to dwell in a home where god be in the midst it be a rest to be free from the care of herself be miss prudence take care of she be not god take care of she through the love of miss prudence marjorie be busy about she weekly mending sit at one of the front window it be pleasant to sit there and see the sleigh pass and hear the bell jingle it be pleasant to look over towards the church and the parsonage and pleasantest of all to bring she eye into miss prudence 's face and work basket and the work in she lap for prue but i mean -- face acknowledged marjorie i mean face -- too i do not see why of all the beautiful thing god have make face should be ignore the human face with the love of god in it be more glorious than any painting more glorious than any view of mountain lake or river i do not believe i know what beauty be you know what you think it be yes prue be beautiful to I and you be and linnet and mother -- you see how confused i be the girl think so much of it one of they hurt she foot with three and a half shoe when she ought to wear larger and another lace so tight and another think so much of be slight and slender that she will not dress warmly enough in the street she always look cold and she have a cough too and another say she would rather have tubercle on she lung than sore on she face we have a talk about personal beauty yesterday and one girl say she would rather have it than anything else in the world but _ do _ you think so much depend upon beauty how much why ever so much friend and be love and marriage do you ever see a homely girl with plenty of friend and be wife always beautiful why no one of the greatest favorite i know be a middle-aged lady -- a maiden lady -- not only with a plain face but with a defect in the upper lip she be love she company be seek she be not rich she have only a ordinary position -- she be a saleswoman down town she be not educate some of you school girl friend be very fond of she she be attractive and you look at she and wonder why but you hear she speak and you wonder no longer she always have something bright to say i do not know of another attraction that she have beside she willingness to help everybody and she be neither young nor pretty no she be what you girl call a old maid marjorie be mend the elbow of she brown school dress she wear that dress in all weather every day and on rainy sunday some of the girl say that she do not care enough about dress she forget that she wear the same dress every day until one of the dressy little thing in the primary class remind she of the fact and then she laugh in the bible story sarah and rebekah and esther and abigail be speak of as be beautiful do they fortune depend upon they beautiful face do not esther 's she be choose by the king on account of she beauty but i think it be god who bring she into favor and tender love as he do daniel and rather more depend upon she pray and fast than upon she beautiful face then you mean that beauty go for a great deal with the world and not with god one of jesse 's son be so tall and handsome that samuel think surely the lord have choose he to be king over he people do you remember what the lord say about that not quite he say : ` look not on he countenance or the height of he stature because i have refuse he for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart ' then it do make a difference to man it seem as if it make a difference to samuel and the lord declare that man be influence by the outward appearance well now take it for grant from the lord 's own word what then then it be rather hard not to be beautiful be not it genius make a difference be it rather hard not to be a genius money make a difference be it rather hard not to be rich position make a difference be it rather hard not to be noble i never think about those thing they give you advantage in the world but beauty make people love you what kind of beauty lovable beauty confess marjorie smile feeling that she be be corner what make lovable beauty a lovable heart i suppose then i should not wonder if you might have it as well as another be clarissa park more love than any one in you class oh no she be not a favorite at all then child i do not see that you be prove you assertion i know i be not laugh marjorie clarissa park be engage but so be fanny hunting and fanny be the plainest little body but i do begin by really believe that beautiful face have the best of it in the world and i be feel rather aggrieved because somebody describe I yesterday as ` that girl in the first class who be always get up head she be short and rather stout and wear she hair in a knot at the back of she head ' now be not that humiliating not a word about my eye or complexion or manner miss prudence laugh at she comically aggrieved tone it be hard to be nothing distinctive but short and stout and to wear you hair in a knot as you grandmother do but the get up head be something it do not add to my beauty miss prudence i be afraid i 'll be a homely blue stock and if i do not teach how shall i use my knowledge i can not write a book or even article for the papers and i must do something with the thing i learn every educate lady do not teach or write you do not answer marjorie thoughtfully only you teach prue and i think it increase you influence miss prudence how much you have teach linnet and I i be think about two face i see the other night at mr harrowgate 's tea table both be stranger to I as the light fall over the face of one i think i never see anything so exquisite as to color : the hair be shine like thread of gold the eye be the azure you see in the sky lip and cheek be tint the complexion i never see excel for dazzling fairness -- we see it in a child 's face sometimes at she side sit a lady : older with a quiet grave face complexion dark and not noticeable hair the brown we see every day eye brown and expressive but not finer than we often see something about it attract I from she bewitching neighbor and i look and compare one face be quiet listen the other be sparkling as she talk the grave dark face grow upon I it be not a face it be a soul a human life with a history the lovely face be lovely still but i do not care to see it again the other i shall not soon forget but it be beauty you see persist marjorie not the kind you girl be talk about a stranger pass through the room would not have notice she beside the other the lovely face have a history i be tell after supper and she be a girl of character still -- i wish -- story book would not dwell so much on attitude and how the head set on the shoulder and the pretty hand and slender figure it make girl think of they hand and they figure it make this girl i know not wrap up carefully for fear of lose she ` slender ' figure and the eyelash and the complexion it make we dissatisfied with ourselves the lord know what kind of book would be write when he say that man looketh on the out ward appearance -- but do not christian writer ever do it christian writer fall into worldly way there be lovely girl and lovely woman in the world we meet they every day but if we think of beauty and write of it and exalt it unduly we be make a use of it that god do not approve a use that he do not make of it himself how beauty and money be scatter everywhere god 's saint be not the richest and most beautiful he do not lavish beauty and money upon those he love the best i call last week on a irish washerwoman and i be strike with the beauty of she girl -- four of they the eldest seventeen the youngest six the eldest have black eye and black curl the second soft brown eye and soft brown curl to match the third curl of gold as pretty as prue 's and black eye the youngest blue eye and yellow curl i never see such a variety of beauty in one family the mother be at the washtub the oldest daughter be iron the second get supper of potato and indian meal bread the third beauty be brushing the youngest beauty 's hair as i stand and look at they i think how many girl in this city would be vain if they own they eye and hair and how god have throw the beauty down among they who have no think about it he give beauty to those who hate he and use it to dishonor he just as he give money to those who spend it in sinning i almost think that he hold cheaply those two thing the world prize so highly money and beauty after a moment marjorie say : i do not mean to live for the world and you do not sigh for beauty smile miss prudence no not really but i do want to be something beside short and stout with my hair in a knot the fun in she eye do not conceal the vexation miss prudence it be hard to care only for the thing god care about she say earnestly yes very hard i think _ you _ care only for such thing you be not worldly one single bit i do not want to be -- one single bit i know you do give up thing but you have so much you have the best thing i do not want thing you have give up i think god care for the thing you care for i hope he do say miss prudence gently marjorie if he have give you a plain face give it back to he to glorify himself with if a beautiful face give that back to he to glorify himself with you be not you own you face be not yours it be buy with a price marjorie 's face be radiant just then the love the surprise the joy make it beautiful miss prudence could not forbear she draw the beautiful face down to kiss it people will always call you plain dear but keep you soul in you face and no matter can i help deborah now or be not there something for I to do upstairs i can study and practice this afternoon i do not believe you will look out in the path marjorie look then with a shout that be almost like linnet 's she drop

she be twenty-one this summer and not many event have stir she uneventful life since we leave she the night of miss prudence 's marriage she come home the next day bring mr kemlo with she and the same day she begin to take the old household step she have be away but a year and have not fall out of the old way as linnet have in she three year of study and she have not come home to be marry as linnet have she come home to do the next thing and the next thing have even be something for she father and mother or morri ' mother annie gray go immediately upon the homecoming of the daughter of the house to middlefield to learn dressmaking board with linnet and work she board linnet be lonely at night she begin to feel lonely as dusk come on and the arrangement of board for one and pleasant companionship for the other be satisfactory to both not that there be very much for annie to do beside stay at home Monday morning to help with the wash and iron Monday evening or early Tuesday linnet love she housekeeping too well to let any other finger intermeddle will decide that she must stay for company especially through the winter night if he have to pay she board therefore marjorie take the place that she leave vacant in the farmhouse and more than fill it but she do not love housekeeping for its own comfortable sake as linnet do she do it as by god 's law she father 's health fail signally this first summer he be weaken by several hemorrhage and become nervous and unfitted even to superintend the work of the hire man that general superintendence fall to mr west and she take no little pride in the flourishing state of the few acre now she could farm as she want to graham have not always listen to she the next summer he die that be the summer marjorie be twenty the chief business of the nursing fall to marjorie she mother be rather too energetic for the comfort of the sickroom and there be always so much to be attend to outside that quiet chamber marjorie know she father 's way mr west apologize to mr kemlo he never have to tell she what he want but i have to make he explain there be bear nurse and i be not one of they i 'll keep thing run outside and that be for he comfort he be as satisfied as though he be about himself if one of we must be down he know that he would better be the one during they last talk -- how many talk marjorie and she father have -- he make one remark that she have not forget and would never forget : -- my life have be of little account as the world go but i have seek to do god 's will and that be success to a man on he death-bed would not she life be a success then for what else do she desire but the will of god the minister tell marjorie that there be no man in the church whose life have have such a resistless influence as she father 's the same hire man be retain the farm work be do to mr west 's satisfaction the farm be she own as long as she live and then it be to belong equally to the daughter there be no debt the gentle patient life be miss with sore heart but there be no outward difference within door or without marjorie take he seat at table mr kemlo sit in he armchair at the fireside he wife read he _ agriculturist _ and he daughter read he special devotional book he wife admit to herself that graham lack force of character she herself be a _ pusher _ she do not understand he favorite quotation : he that believeth shall not make haste marjorie have she piano -- this piano be a graduate present from miss prudence more book than she could read from the library of mr and mr holme she busy work in the household a occasional visit to the farmhouse on the sea shore to read to the old people and sing to they and even to cut and string apple and laugh over she childish abhorrence of the work she never open the door of the chamber they still call miss prudence 's without feeling that it hold a history how different she life would have be but for miss prudence and linnet 's and morri 's and how many other life who know there be beside she class in Sunday school and she visit to linnet and exchange visit with the school-girl -- not with the girl at master mccosh 's she have make no intimate friendship among they and then there be letter from aunt prue and childish affectionate note from dear little prue marjorie 's life be not meager still she be not happy enough she write to aunt prue that she be not satisfy that be a girl 's old story mr holme say to she husband she must _ evolve _ john there be enough in she for something to come out of she what do girl want to _ do _ he ask look up from he write be satisfy laugh he wife do you go through that delusive period be i not a girl and here 's prue grow up to say some day that she be not satisfied no to say some day that she be _ when _ be you satisfied at what age you will not believe that i be thirty-five before i be satisfy with my life and then i be satisfied because i be willing for god to have he way with I if it be not for that willingness i should not be satisfied yet then you can tell marjorie not to wait until she be half of three score and ten before she give herself up she will be more yielding than mine she do not seek great thing for herself the letter from switzerland about be satisfied marjorie read again and again there be only one way for childhood girlhood or womanhood to be satisfied and that one way be to acknowledge god in every thing and let he direct every step then if one be not satisfied it be dissatisfaction with god 's will god 's will be not enough holli have make short visit at home twice since she have leave school the first time she have be at she grandfather 's and see he but half a hour the second time they meet not at all as she be attend to some business for mr holme and spend a day and night with mr harrowgate this twenty-first summer she be not happy she have not be happy for month it be a new experience not to be happy she have be bear happy i do not think any
