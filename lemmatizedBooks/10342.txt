illustration : ` be you sure you have not hear from papa ' a moment later the traveler be lie there alone all turn and look at he in wonder ` do you intend to punish you father 's assassin ' marco be essentially a man of he word the door be open by a stout monk ` he be not kill ' say marco breathlessly he leave juanita alone with marco chapter i in the city of the wind the ebro as all the world know -- or will pretend to know be a ignorant and vain world -- run through the city of saragossa it be a river moreover which should be accord the sympathy of this generation for it be at once rapid and shallow on one side it be border by the wall of the city the left bank be low and sandy liable to flood a haunt of lizard in the summer of frog in winter-time the lower bank be border by poplar tree and here and there plot of land have be recover from the riverbed for tillage and the growth of that harsh red wine which seem to harden and thicken the man of aragon one night when a half moon hang over the dome of the cathedral of the pillar a man make he way through the undergrowth by the riverside and stumble across the shingle towards the open shed which mark the landing-place of the only ferry across the ebro that saragossa possess the ferry-boat be moor to the landing-stage it be a high-prowed high-sterned vessel build on vike line from a picture the observant must conclude by a landsman carpenter it swing across the river on a wire rope with a running tackle by the force of the stream and the aid of a large rudder the man look cautiously into the vine-clad shed it be empty he creep towards the boat and find no one there then he examine the chain that moor it there be no padlock in spain to this day they bar the window heavily and leave the door open to the cunning mind be give in this custom the whole history of a great nation he stand upright and look across the river he be a tall man with a clean cut face and a hard mouth he give a sharp sigh as he look at saragossa outline against the sky he attitude and he sigh seem to denote along journey accomplish at last a object attain perhaps or within reach which be almost the same thing but not quite for most man be happier in strive than in possession and no one have yet decide whether it be better to be among the lean or the fat don francisco de mogente sit down on the bench provide for those that await the ferry and tilt back he hat look up at the sky the northwest wind be blow -- the solano -- as it only blow in aragon the bridge below the ferry have by the way a high wall on the upper side of it to break this wind without which no cart could cross the river at certain time of the year it come roar down the ebro bend the tall poplar on the lower bank drive before it a cloud of dust on the saragossa side it lash the water of the river to a gleaming white beneath the moon and all the while the cloud stand hard and sharp of outline in the sky they hardly seem to move towards the moon they scarcely change they shape from hour to hour this be not a wind of heaven but a current rush down from the pyrenee to replace the hot air rise from the plain of aragon nevertheless the cloud be move towards the moon and must soon hide it don francisco de mogente observe this and sit patiently beneath the trail vine note they slow approach he be a white-haired man and he face be burn a deep brown it be a odd face and the expression of the eye be not the usual expression of a old man 's eye they have the agricultural calm which be rarely see in drawing-room for those who deal with nature rarely feel calm in a drawing-room they want to get out of it and they eye assume a hunt look this seem to be a man who have know both drawing-room and nature who must have turn quietly and deliberately to nature as the better part the wrinkle on he face be not those of the social smile which so disfigure the face of woman when the smile be no longer want they be the wrinkle of sunshine i will wait he say placidly to himself in english with however a strong american accent i have wait fifteen year -- and she do not know i be come he sit look across the river with quiet eye the city lay before he with the spire of its unmatched cathedral the dome of its second cathedral and its many tower outline against the sky just as he have see they fifteen year before -- just as other have see they a hundred year earlier the great rounded cloud be nearer to the moon now now it touch it and quite suddenly the dome disappear don francisco de mogente rise and go towards the boat he do not trouble to walk gently or to loosen the chain noiselessly the wind be roar so loudly that a listener twenty yard away could have hear nothing he cast off and then hasten to the stern of the boat the way in which he handle the helm show that he know the trick of the old ferryman by wind and calm by high and low river he have probably learn they with the photographic accuracy only to be attain when the mind be young the boat swing out into the river with a odd jerk movement which the steersman soon correct and a man who have be watch on the bridge half a mile farther down the river hurry into the town a second watcher at a open window in the tall house next to the posada de los reye on the paseo del ebro close he field-glass with a thoughtful smile it seem that don francisco de mogente have purposely avoid cross the bridge where to this day the night watchman with lantern and spear peep cautiously to and fro -- a startlingly mediaeval figure it seem also that the traveler be expect though he have perform the last stage of he journey on foot after nightfall it be characteristic of this country that saragossa should be guard during the day by the toll-taker at every gate by sentry and by the new police while at night the street be give over to the care of a handful of night watchman who call monotonously to each other all through the hour and may be avoid by the simplest-minded of malefactor don francisco de mogente bring the ferry-boat gently alongside the landing-stage beneath the high wall of the quay and make he way through the underground passage and up the dirty step that lead into one of the narrow street of the old town the moon have break through the cloud again and shine down upon the bar window the traveler stand still and look about he nothing have change since he have last stand there nothing have change just here for five hundred year or so for he could not see the dome of the cathedral of the pillar comparatively modern only a century old don francisco de mogente have come from the west have know the newness of the new generation and he stand for a moment as if in a dream breathing in the tainted air of narrow undrained street listen to the cry of the watchman slowly die as the man walk away from he on sandale noiseless foot gaze up at the bar window heavily shadow there be a old world stillness in the air and suddenly the bell of fifty church toll the hour it be one o'clock in the morning the traveler have travel backwards it would seem into the middle age as he hear the church bell he give a angry upward jerk of the head as if the sound confirm a thought that be already in he mind the bell seem to be all around he the tower of the church seem to dominate the sleep city on every side there be a distinct smell of incense in the air of these narrow street where the wind of the outer world rarely find access the traveler know he way and hurry down a narrow turn to the leave with the cathedral of the pillar between he and the river he have make a dé tour in order to avoid the bridge and the paseo del ebro a broad road on the river bank in these narrow street he meet no one on the paseo there be several old inn notably the posada de los reye use by muleteer and other gentleman of the road who arise and start at any hour of the twenty-four and in summer travel as much by night as by day at the corner where the bridge abut on the paseo there be always a watchman at night while by day there be a guard it be the busiest and dustiest corner in the city francisco de mogente cross a wide street and again seek a dark alley he pass by the corner of the cathedral of the pillar and go towards the other and infinitely grander cathedral of the seo beyond this by the riverside be the palace of the archbishop farther on be another palace standing likewise on the paseo del ebro backing likewise on to a labyrinth of narrow street it be call the palacio sarrion and belong to the father and son of that name it seem that francisco de mogente be go to the palacio sarrion for he pass the great door of the archbishop 's dwelling and be already look towards the house of the sarrion when a slight sound make he turn on he heel with the rapidity of one whose life have be pass amid danger -- and more especially those that come from behind there be three man come from behind now run after he on sandaled foot and before he could do so much as raise he arm the moon break out from behind a cloud and show a gleam of steel don francisco de mogente be down on the ground in a instant and the three man fall upon he like dog on a rat one knife go right through he and grate with a harsh squeak on the cobble-stone beneath a moment later the traveler be lie there alone half in the shadow he dusty foot show whitely in the moonlight the three shadow have vanish as softly as they come almost instantly from strangely enough the direction in which they have go the burly form of a preach friar come out into the light he be walk hurriedly and would seem to be return from some mission of mercy or some pious bedside to one of the many house of religion located within a stone 's throw of the cathedral of the seo in one of the narrow street of this quarter of the city the holy man almost fall over the prostrate form of don francisco de mogente ah ah he exclaim in a even and quiet voice a calamity no answer the wounded man with a cynicism which even the near sight of death seem powerless to effect a crime you be badly hurt my son yes you have better not try to lift I though you be a strong man i will go for help say the monk lay help suggest the wounded man curtly but the friar be already out of earshot in a astonishingly short space of time the friar return accompany by two man who have the air of indoor servant and the quiet movement of street-bred roof-ridden humanity mindful of he cloth the friar stand aside unostentatiously and firmly refuse to take the lead even in a mission of mercy he stand with humbly-folded hand and a meek face while the two man lift don francisco de mogente on to a long narrow blanket the cloak of navarre and aragon which one of they have bring with he they bear he slowly away and the friar linger behind the moon shine down brightly into the narrow street and show a great patch of blood amid the cobblestone in saragossa as in many spanish city certain old man be employ by the municipal authority to sweep the dust of the street into little heap these heap remain at the side of the street until the dog and the child and the four wind disperse the dust again it be a survival of the middle age interesting enough in its bearing upon the evolution of the modern municipal authority and the transmission of intellectual gift the friar look round he and have not far to look there be a dust heap close by he plunge he large brown hand into it and with a few quick movement cover all trace of the calamity of which he have so nearly be a witness then with a quick meek look either way he follow the two man who have just disappear round a corner the street which by the way be call the calle san gregorio be of course desert the tall house on either side be closely shutter many of the balcony bear a branch of palm across the iron railing the outward sign of priesthood for the cathedral clergy live here and doubtless the holy man within have be asleep many hour across the end of the calle san gregorio and command that narrow street stand the palacio sarrion -- a empty house the greater part of the year -- a vast building of which the window increase in size as they mount skywards there be wrought-iron balcony of which the window embrasure be so deep that the shutter fold sideways into the wall instead of swing back as in house of which the wall be of normal thickness the friar be probably accustom to see the palacio sarrion rigidly shut up he never in he quick humble scrutiny of he surroundings glance up at it and therefore he never see a man sit quietly behind the curiously work railing smoke a cigarette -- a man who have witness the whole incident from begin to end who have indeed see more than the friar or the two quiet men-servant for he have see a stick -- probably a sword-stick such as nearly every spanish gentleman carry in he own country -- fly from the hand of don francisco de mogente at the moment when he be attack and fall into the gutter on the darker side of the street where it lay unheeded where indeed it still remain when the friar with he swing gait have turn the corner of the calle san gregorio chapter ii evasio mon there be some people whose presence in a room seem to establish a mental center of gravity round which other mind hover uneasily conscious of the dead weight of that attraction i have know evasio all my life the count de sarrion once say to he son i have stand at the edge of that pit and look in i do not know to this day whether there be gold at the bottom or mud i have never quarrel with he and therefore we have never make it up which perhaps be as good a description of evasio mon as any man have give he have never quarrel with any one he be in consequence a lonely man for the majority of human being be gregarious they meet together in order to quarrel the majority of woman prefer to sit and squabble round one table to seek another room they call it the domestic circle and spend they time in strain at the family tie in order to prove its strength it be evasio mon who stand at the open window of he apartment in the tall house next door to the posada de los reye on the paseo del ebro have observe with the help of a field-glass that a traveler be cross the river by the ferry-boat after midnight he note the unusual proceeding with a tolerant shrug it will be remember that he close he glass with a smile -- not a smile of amusement or of contempt -- not even a deep smile such as people wear in book it be merely a smile and could not be construe into anything else by any physiognomist the wrinkle that make it be deeply marked which suggest that evasio mon have learn to smile when he be quite young he have perhaps be teach and after all a man may as well show a smile to the world as a worried look or a mean look or one of the countless cast of countenance that be mould by conceit and vanity a smile be frequently misconstrue by the simple-hearted into the outward sign of inward kindness many think that it conciliate child and little dog but that which the many think be usually wrong if evasio mon 's face say anything at all it warn the world that it have to deal with a man of perfect self-control and the man who control himself be usually able to control just so much of he surrounding world as may suit he purpose there be something in the set of this man 's eye which suggest no easy victory over self for he eye be close together he hair be almost red he face be rather narrow and long it be not the face of a easy-going man as god have make it but year have make it the face of a man that nothing could rouse he be of medium height with rather narrow shoulder but upright and lithe he be clean shaven and of a pleasant ruddiness he eye be a bluish gray and look out upon the world with a reflective attention through gold-rimmed eye-glass with which he have a habit of amusing himself while talk examine they mechanism and the knot of the fine black cord with a bat-like air of blindness in body and mind he seem to be almost a young man but ramon de sarrion say that he have know he all he life and the count de sarrion have speak with christina when that woman be queen of spain mon be still astir although the bell of the cathedral of the virgin of the pillar immediately behind he house have strike the half hour it be more than thirty minute since the ferry-boat have sidle across the river and mon glance at the clock on he mantelpiece he expect it would seem a sequel to the arrival which have be so carefully note and at last the sequel come a soft knock as of fat finger make mon glance towards the door and bid the knocker enter the door open and in its darkened entry stand the large form of the friar who have render such useful aid to a stricken traveler the light of mon 's lamp show this holy man to be large and heavy of face with the narrow forehead of the fanatic with such a face and head this could not be a clever man but he be a wise worker who have tool of different temper in he bag too fine a steel may snap too delicately fashion a instrument may turn in the hand when suddenly press against the grain mon hold out he hand know that there would be no verbal message from the mysterious fold of the friar 's sleeve a letter instantly emerge they have blunder the man be still live you have better come it say and that be all and what do you know of this affair my brother ask mon hold the letter to the candle and when it be ignite throw it on to the cold ash in the open fireplace where it burnt little enough excellency one of the father pray at he window hear the sound of a struggle in the street and i be send out to see what it signify i find a man lie on the ground and accord to instruction do not touch he but go back for help mon nod he compact head thoughtfully and the man say nothing nothing excellency you be a wise man my brother go and i will follow you the friar 's meek face be oily with that smile of complete self-satisfaction which be only find when foolishness and fervor meet in one brain mon rise slowly from he chair and stretch himself it be evident that have he follow he own inclination he would have go to bed he perhaps have a sense of duty he have not far to go and know the shortest way through the narrow street he could hear a muleteer shout at he beast on the bridge as he cross the calle don jaime i the street be quiet enough otherwise and the watchman of this quarter could be hear far away at the corner of the plaza de la constitucion call to the god that the weather be serene evasio mon cloak to the eye against the autumn night hurry down the calle san gregorio and turn into a open doorway that lead into the patio of a great four-sided house he climb the stone stair and knock at a door which be instantly open come say the man who open it -- a white-haired priest of benevolent face he be conscious he ask for a notary he be die i think you -- no reply mon quickly he would recognize I though he have not see I for twenty year you must do it change you clothes he speak as with authority and the priest finger the silken cord around he waist i know nothing of the law he say hesitatingly that i have think of here be two form of will they be write so small as to be almost illegible this one we must get sign if we can but fail that the other will do you see the difference in this one the pin be from leave to right in that from right to left i will wait here while you change you clothes as emergency arise we will meet they he speak the last sentence coldly and follow with he narrow gaze the movement of the old priest who be lay aside he cassock let we have no panic evasio mon 's manner seem to say and he air be that of a quiet pilot know he way through the narrow water that lay ahead in a small room near at hand francisco de mogente be face death he lay half dress upon a narrow bed on a table near at hand stand a basin a bottle and a few evidence of surgical aid but the doctor have go two friar be in the room one be pray the other be the big strong man who have first succour the wounded traveler i ask for a notary say mogente curtly death have not soften he he be stare straight in front of he with glassy eye think deeply and quickly at time he expression be one of wonder as if a conviction force itself upon he mind from time to time against he will and despite the grow knowledge that he have no time to waste in wonder the notary have be send for he can not delay in come reply the friar rather give you thought to heaven my son than to notary mind you own business reply mogente quietly as he speak the door open and a old man come in he have papers and a quill pen in he hand you send for I -- a notary he say evasio mon stand in the doorway a yard behind the die man 's head the notary move the table so that in look at he client he could with the corner of he eye see also the face of evasio mon you wish to make a statement or a last testament say the notary a statement -- no it be useless since they have kill I i will make a statement elsewhere and he laugh be not pleasant to the ear a will -- yes he continue -- and hear the notary dip he pen -- my name he say be francisco de mogente of inquire the notary writing of this city you can not be a notary of saragossa or you would know that i be not a notary of saragossa -- go on of saragossa and santiago de cuba and i have a great fortune to leave one of the pray friar make a little involuntary movement the love of money perhaps hide itself beneath the brown hood of the mendicant the man who speak be die already he breath come short give I he say some cordial or i shall not last after a pause he go on there be a will in existence which i now cancel i make it when i be a younger man i leave my fortune to my son leon de mogente to my daughter juanita de mogente i leave a sufficiency i wish now to make a will in favor of my son leon -- he pause while the notary 's quill pen run over the paper -- on one condition on one condition -- write the notary who have lean forward but sit upright rather suddenly in obedience to a signal from evasio mon in the doorway he have forget he tonsure that he do not go into religion -- that he devote no part of it to the benefit or advantage of the church the notary sit very straight while he write this down my son be in saragossa say mogente suddenly with a change of manner i will see he send for he the notary glance up at evasio mon who shake he head i can not send for he at two in the morning then i will sign no will sign the will now suggest the lawyer with a look of doubt towards the dark doorway behind the sick man 's head sign now and see you son to-morrow there be no to-morrow my friend send for my son at once mon grudgingly nod he head it be well i will do as you wish say the notary only too glad it would seem to rise and go into the next room to receive further minute instruction from he chief the die man lay with closed eye and do not move until he son speak to he leon de mogente be a sparely-built man with a white and oddly-rounded forehead he eye be dark and he betray scarcely any emotion at the sight of he father in this lamentable plight ah say the elder man it be you you look like a monk be you one not yet answer the pale youth in a low voice with a sort of suppress exultation evasio mon watch he from the doorway smile faintly he seem to have no misgiving as to what leon might say but you wish to become one it be my dearest desire the die man laugh you be like you mother he say she be a fool you may go back to bed my friend but i would rather stay here and pray by you bedside plead the son he be a feeble man -- the only weak man it would appear in the room then stay and pray if you want to answer mogente without even troubling himself to show contempt the notary be at he table again and seem to seek he cue by a upward glance you will perhaps leave you fortune he suggest at length to -- to some good work but evasio mon be shake he head to -- to -- begin the notary once more and then lapse into a puzzle silence he be at fault again mogente seem to be fail he lay quite still look straight in front of he the count ramon de sarrion he ask suddenly be he in saragossa no answer the notary after a glance into the darkened door no -- but you will -- you will try and remember what you be do you wish to leave you money to you son no no then to -- you daughter and the question seem to be direct not towards the bed but behind it to you daughter he repeat more confidently that be right be it not to you daughter mogente nod he head write it out shortly he say in a low and distinct voice for i will sign nothing that i have not read word for word and i have but little time the notary take a new sheet of paper and write out in bold and it be to be presume unlegal term that francisco de mogente leave he earthly possession to juanita de mogente he only daughter be no notary this elderly priest write out a plain-spoken document about which there could be no doubt whatever in any court of law in the world which be probably more than a lawyer could have do francisco de mogente read the paper and then prop in the arm of the big friar he sign he name to it after this he lay quite still so still that at last the notary who stand watch he slowly kneel down and fall to pray for the soul that be go chapter iii within the high wall in these degenerate day saragossa have take to itself a suburb -- the first and deadliest sign of a city 's progress thirty year ago however torrero do not exist and those terrible erection of white stone and plaster which now disfigure the high land to the south of the city have not yet burst upon the calm of ancient architectural spain here on monte torrero stand a old convent now turn into a barrack here also amid the tree of the ancient garden rise the rounded dome of the church of san fernando close by and at a slightly higher level curve the canal imperial 400 year old and not yet finish assuredly conceive by a moorish love of clear water in high place but leave to spanish enterprise and in completeness when the moor have depart beyond the convent wall the canal wind round the slope of the brown hill mark a distinctive line between the outer desert and the green oasis of saragossa just within the border line of the oasis just below the canal on the sunny slope lie the long low house of the convent school of the sister of the true faith here amid the quiet of orchard -- white in spring with blossom the haunt of countless nightingale heavy with fruit in autumn at all time the home of a luxuriant vegetation -- history have surge to and fro like the tide draw hither and thither rise and fall accord to the dictate of a far-off planet and the moon of this tide be rome for the sister of the true faith be a jesuit corporation and they convent school be now a convent now a school as the tide may rise or fall the ebb first come in 1555 when spain throw out the jesuit the flow be at its height so late as 1814 when ferdinand vii -- a bourbon of course -- restore jesuitism and the inquisition at one stroke and before and after and through all these time the tide of prosperity have rise and fall have sap and sag and undermine with a noiseless energy which the outer world only half suspect in 1835 this same long low quiet house amid the fruit-tree be sack by the furious populace and more than one sister of the true faith it be whisper be beat to the ground as she flee shriek down the hill in 1836 all monastic order be rigidly suppress by mendizabal minister to queen christina in 1851 they be all allow to live again by the same queen 's daughter isabel ii so wag this world into which there come nineteen hundred year ago not peace but a sword a world all stir about by a reform rake of spain who in he own word come to send fire throughout the earth whose motto be ignem venus metterus in terram et quid volo nisi ut accendatur the road that run by the bank of the canal be desert when the count de sarrion turn he horse 's head that way from the dusty high road lead southwards out of saragossa sarrion have only be in saragossa twenty-four hour he great house on the paseo del ebro have not be throw open for this brief visit and he have be content to inhabit two room at the back of the house from the balcony of one he have see the incident relate in the last chapter and as he ride towards the convent school he carry in he hand -- not a whip -- but the delicately-wrought sword-stick which have fall from the hand of francisco de mogente into the gutter the night before in the grassy sedge that border the canal the frog be call to each other with that conversational note of interrogation in they throat which make they music one of nature 's most sociable and companionable sound in the fruit-tree on the lower land the nightingale be singing as they only sing in spain it be nearly dark a warm evening of late spring and there be no wind amid the thousand scent of blossom of open bud and a hundred flowering shrub there arise the subtle soft odour of sluggish water stir by frog tell of cool place beneath the tree where the weary and the dusty might lie in oblivion till the morning the count of sarrion ride with a long stirrup he spare form six foot in height a straight line from heel to shoulder he seat in the saddle and something in he manner at once gentle and cold something mystic that attract and yet hold inexorably at arm 's length lend at once a deeper meaning to he name which assuredly have a moorish ring in it the little town of sarrion lie far to the south on the border of valencium in the heart of the moorish country and to look at the face of ramon de sarrion and of he son the still brown-faced marco de sarrion be to conjure up some old romance of that sun-scorched height of the javalambre where history date back to century before christ -- where assuredly some moslem maiden in the later time must have forsake all for love of a wild yet courteous spanish knight of sarrion bequeath to she son through all the age the deep reflective eye the impenetrable dignity of she race sarrion 's hair be gray he wear a moustache and imperial in the french fashion and look at the world with the fierce eye and somewhat of the air of a eagle which resemblance be further accentuate by a finely-cut nose as a old man he be picturesque he must have be very handsome in he youth it seem that he be bind for the school of the sister of the true faith for as he approach its gate build solidly within the thickness of the high wall without so much as a crack or crevice through which the curious might peep he draw rein and sit motionless on he well-trained horse listen the clock at san fernando immediately vouchsafe the information that it be nine o'clock there be no one astir no one on the road before or behind he across the narrow canal be a bare field the convent wall bound the view on the left hand sarrion ride up to the gate and ring a bell which clang with a sort of surreptitiousness just within he only ring once and then wait post himself immediately opposite a little grating let into the solid wood of the door the window behind the grate seem to open and shut without sound for he hear nothing until a woman 's voice ask who be there it be the count ramon de sarrion who must without fail speak to the sister superior to-night he answer and compose himself again in the saddle with a southern patience he wait a long time before the heavy door be at length open the horse pass timorously within with jerk ear and a distended nostril look from side to side he glance curiously at the shadowy form of two woman who hold the door and lean they whole weight against it to close it again as soon as possible sarrion dismount and draw the bridle through a ring and hook attach to the wall just inside the gate no one speak the two nun noiselessly replace the heavy bolt there be a muffle clank of large key and they lead the way towards the house just over the threshold be the small room where visitor be ask to wait -- a square bare apartment with one window set high in the wall with one lamp burning dimly on the table now there be three or four chair and that be all the bare wall be whitewash the convent school of the sister of the true faith do not err at all event in the heathen indiscretion of a too free hospitality the visitor to this room be barely beneath the roof the door have in one of its panel the usual grate and shutter sarrion sit down without look round he in the manner of a man who know he surroundings and take no interest in they in a few minute the door open noiselessly -- there be a too obtrusive noiselessness within these wall -- and a nun come in she be tall and within the shadow of she cap she eye loom darkly she close the door and throw back she veil come forward she lean towards sarrion and kiss he and she face come within the radius of the lamp be the face of a sarrion there be in she action in the movement of she high-held head a sudden and startling self-abandonment of affection for spanish woman understand above all other the calling of love and motherhood and it seem that sor teresa -- know in the world as dolore sarrion -- have like many woman bestow a thwart love -- faute de mieux -- upon she brother you be well ask sarrion look at she closely she face frame by a spotless cap be gray and draw but not unhappy she nod she head with a smile while she eye flit over he face and person with that quick interrogation which serve better than word a woman never ask minutely after the health of one in whom she be really interested she know without ask she stand before he with she hand cross within the fold of she ample sleeve she face be lose again in the encircle shadow of she cap and veil she be erect and motionless in she stiff and heavy clothing the momentary betrayal of womanhood and affection be pass and this be the dreaded sister superior of the convent school again i suppose she say you be alone as usual be it safe after nightfall -- you who have so many enemy marco be at torre garda where i leave he three day ago the snow be melting and the fishing be good it be unusual to come at this hour i know but i come for a special purpose he glance towards the door the quiet of this house seem to arouse a sense of suspicion and antagonism in he mind i wish of course to see you also though i be aware that the affection be out of place in this -- holy atmosphere she wince almost imperceptibly and say nothing i want to see juanita de mogente say the count it be unusual i know but in this place you be all-powerful it be important or i should not ask it she be in bed they go to bed at eight o'clock i know be not that all the better she have a room to herself i recollect you can arouse she and bring she to I and no one need know that she have have a visitor -- except i suppose the peeping eye that haunt a nunnery corridor he give a shrug of the shoulder mother of god he exclaim the air of secrecy infect one i be not a secretive man all the world know my opinion and here be i plot like a friar can i see juanita and he laugh quietly as he look at he sister yes i suppose so he nod he thanks and dolore listen he say let I see she alone it may save complication in the future you understand sor teresa turn in the doorway and look at he he could not see the expression of she eye which be in deep shadow and she leave he wonder whether she have understand or not it would seem that sor teresa despite she slow dignity of manner be a quick person for in a few moment the door of the waiting-room be again open and a young girl hasten breathlessly in she be not more than sixteen or seventeen and as she come in she throw back she dark hair with one hand i be asleep uncle ramon she exclaim with a light laugh and the good sister have to drag I out of bed before i would wake up and then of course i think it be a fire we have always hope for a fire you know

bright the bird-like shallow vivacity of childhood still sparkle in they it seem that they be make for laugh not for tear or think she be the incarnation of youth and springtime to find such ignorance

to cuba i only come to ask you whether you have hear from you father and to hear that you be well and now i must go she stand look at he thoughtfully pull at the delicate embroidery of she sleeve for all that she wear be of the best that saragossa could provide and she wear it carelessly as if she have never know other and pay little heed to wealth -- as those do who have always have it i think

chance the same evening by the light of he solitary lamp in the small room -- which have be a lady 's boudoir in olden day -- the count de sarrion sit down to write a letter to he son he despatch it at once by a rider to torre garda far beyond pampeluna on the southern slope of the pyrenee i be grow too old for this work he say to himself as he seal the letter it want a younger man marco will do it though he hate the pavement there be something of the chase in it and marco be a hunter at he call a man come into the room all dusty and sunburnt a typical man of aragon dry and wrinkled burnt like a son of sahara he clothing like he face be dust-coloured he wear knee-breeches of homespun brown stocking a handkerchief that have once be color bind round he head with the knot over he left ear he be startlingly rough and wild in appearance but he feature on examination be refine and he eye intelligent i want you to go straight to torre garda with this letter and give it into the hand of my son with you own hand it be important you may be watch and follow you understand the man nod they be a taciturn people in aragon and navarre -- so taciturn that in politely greet the passer on the road they cut down the curt good-day buena they say and that be all go with god say the count and the messenger leave the room noiselessly for they wear no shoe-leather in this dry land there be a train in those day to pampeluna and a daily post but then as now a letter of any importance be better send by hand while the railway be still look upon with suspicion by the authority as a means of circulate malcontent and spread crime every train be still inspect at each stop place by two of the civil guard the count be early astir the next morning he know that a man such as marco possess the instinct of the chase and that deep insight into the thought and action of other even into the thought and action of animal which make a great hunter or a great captain would never have let slip the feeble clue that he have of the incident in the calle san gregorio the count have be a politician in he youth and he position entail a passive continuance of the policy he have actively advocate in earlier day but as a old sailor weary with the battle of many storm learn at last to treat the thunder and the tempest with a certain tolerant contempt so he have pass through evil monarchy and corrupt regency through the storm of anarchy and the humiliation of a brief and ridiculous republic now stand aside and watch the wave go past he with a semi-contemptuous indifference he be too well know in the street of saragossa to wander hither and thither in they make inquiry as to whether any have see he lifelong friend francisco de mogente back in the city of he birth from which he have be exile in the uncertain day of isabellum francisco de mogente have be place in one of those vague position of spanish political life where exile have never be commute though friend and enemy would alike have welcome the return of a scapegoat on they own term but mogente have never be the man to make term -- any more than this grim spanish nobleman who now sit wonder what he next move must be after he early coffee sarrion go out into the calle san gregorio the sound of deep voice chant the matins come to he through the open door of the cathedral of the seo a priest hurry past late and yet in time to save he record of service attend the beggar be leisurely make they way to the cathedral door too lazy to make a earlier start philosophically reflect that the charitable be as likely to give after matins as before the count go over the ground of the scene that he have witness in the fitful moonlight here the man who might have be francisco de mogente have turn on he heel here at the never open door of a desert palace he have stand for a moment fight with he back to the wall here he have fall from that corner have come aid in the person -- sarrion be sure -- of a friar it be a odd coincidence for the church have never be the friend of the exile man and it be in the day of a priest-ridden queen that he foe have triumph they have carry the stricken man back to the corner of the calle san gregorio and the plazuelum san bruno and from the movement of the bearer sarrion have receive the conviction that they have enter the house immediately beyond the angle of the high building opposite to the episcopal palace sarrion follow he memory step by step he determine to go into the house -- a huge building -- divide into many small apartment the door have never particularly attract he attention like many of the doorway of these great house it be wide and high give access to a dark stairway of stone the door stand open night and day for this stairway be a common one as its dirtiness would testify there be some one come down the stair now sarrion remember that he face be well know and that he have no particular business in any of the apartment into which the house be divide pause for a moment and wait on the threshold he look up the dark stair and slowly distinguish the form and face of the newcomer it be he old friend evasio mon -- smart well-brushed smile a good-morning to all the world this sunny day they have not meet for many year they friendship have be one of those begin by parent and carry on in after year by the child more from habit than from any particular tie of sympathy for we all find at length that the nursery carpet be not the world they way have part soon after the nursery and though they have meet frequently they have never trodden the same path again for evasio mon have be educate as a priest i have often wonder why i have never clash -- with evasio mon sarrion once say to he son in the reflective quiet of they life at torre garda it take two to clash reply marco at length in he contemplative way have give the matter he consideration and perhaps that be the only explanation of it sarrion look up now and meet the smile with a grave bow they take off they hat to each other with rather more ceremony than when they have last meet a long slow friendship be the best a long slow enmity the deadliest one do not expect to see you in saragossa say mon gently a man bear he school mark all through life this layman have learn something in the seminary which he have never forget no reply the other what be this house i be just go into it mon turn and look up at the building with a little wave of the hand indicate lightly the stone and mortar it be just a house my friend as you see -- a house like another and who live in it poor people and foolish people as in any other people one must pity and can not help despise he laugh and as he speak he lead the way as it be unconsciously away from this house which be like another because they be poor inquire sarrion who do not move a step in response to evasio mon 's lead partly admit mon hold up one finger because my friend none but the foolish be poor in this world then why have the good god send so many fool into the world because he want a few saint i suppose mon be still try to lead he away from that threshold and sarrion still stand he ground they half-bantering talk suddenly collapse and they stand look at each other in silence for a moment both be what may be call ready man quick to catch a thought and answer i will tell you say sarrion quietly why i be go into this house i have long cease to take a interest in the politics of this poor country as you know mon 's gesture seem to indicate that sarrion have only do what be wise and sensible in a matter of which it be no longer any use to talk but to my friend i still give a thought go on the count two night ago a man be attack in this street -- by the usual street cutthroat it be to be suppose i see it all from my balcony there see from this corner you can perceive the balcony he draw mon to the corner of the street and point out the sarrion palace gloomy and desert at the further end of the street but it be dark and i could not see much he add seem unconsciously to answer a question pass in he companion 's mind for mon 's pleasant eye be measure the distance i think they bring he in here for before i could descend help come and the cutthroat run away it be like you good kind heart my friend to interest yourself in the fate of some rake who be probably tipsy or else he would not have be abroad at that hour i have not mention the hour one presume say mon with a short laugh that such incident do not happen in the early evening however let we by all means make inquiry after you dissipate protege he move with alacrity to the house lead the way now by a odd chance say sarrion follow he more slowly i have conceive the idea that this man be a old friend of mine then my good ramon he must be a old friend of mine too francisco de mogente mon stop with a movement of genuine surprise follow instantly by a quick sidelong glance beneath he lash we poor wrong-headed francisco he say what make you think of he after all these year have you hear from he he turn on the stair as he ask this question in a indifferent voice and wait for the answer but sarrion be look at the step with a deep attention see he say there be drop of blood on the stair there be blood in the street but it have be cover with dust this also have be cover with dust -- but the dust may be sweep aside -- see and with the glove which a spanish gentleman still carry in he hand whenever he be out of door he brush the dust aside yes say mon examine the step yes you may be right come let we make inquiry i know most of the people in this house they be poor people in my small way i help some of they when a evil time come in the winter he be all eagerness now and full of desire to help it be he who tell the count 's story and tell it a little wrong as a story be usually relate by one who repeat it while sarrion stand at the door and look around he it be mon who persist that every stone should be turn and every denizen of the great house interrogate but nothing result from these inquiry i do not of course mention francisco 's name he say confidentially as they emerge into the street again nothing be to be gain by that and i confess i think you be the victim of you own imagination in this francisco be in santiago de cuba and will probably never return if he be here in saragossa surely he own son would know it i see leon de mogente the day before yesterday by the way and he say nothing of he father and it be not long since i speak with juanita we could make inquiry of leon -- but not to-day by the way it be a great retreat organise by some pilgrim to the shrine of we lady of the pillar and leon be sure to be of it the man be half a monk you know they be walk down the calle san gregorio and as if in illustration of the fact that chance will betray those who wait most assiduously upon she the curtain of the great door of the cathedral be draw aside and leon de mogente come out blinking into the sunlight the meeting be inevitable there be leon -- by a lucky chance say mon almost immediately leon de mogente have see they and be hurry to meet they see thus in the street under the sun he be a pale and bloodless man -- food for the cloister he bow with a odd humility to mon but speak directly to the count de sarrion he know and show that he know that mon be not glad to see he i do not know that you be in saragossa he say a terrible thing have happen my father be dead he die without the benefit of the church he return secretly to saragossa two day ago and be attack and rob in the street and die in that house add sarrion indicate with he stick the building they have just quit ye -- e answer leon hesitatingly with a quick and frightened glance at mon it may have be i do not know he die without the consolation of the church it be that that i think of yes say sarrion rather coldly you naturally would chapter v a pilgrimage evasio mon be a great traveler in eastern country a man who make the pilgrimage to mecca add thereafter to he name a title which carry with it not only the distinction confer upon the dullest by the sight of other man and country but the bearer stand high among the elect if many pilgrimage could confer a title this gentle-mannered spaniard would assuredly have be thus decorate he have make almost every pilgrimage that the church may dictate -- that wise old church which fill so well its vocation in the mind of the restless and the unsatisfied he have be many time to rome he could tell you the specific property of every shrine in the roman catholic world he make a sort of speciality in latter-day miracle do this woman want a son to put a graceful finish to she family of daughter he could tell she of some little-known pilgrimage in the mountain which rarely fail go he would say go there and say you prayer it be the right thing to do the air of the mountain be delightful the journey divert the mind in all of which he be quite right and it be not for he any more than it be for the profane reader to inquire why latter-day miracle be nearly always perform at or near popular health resort be another in grief evasio mon would send he on a long journey to a gay city where the devout be not without worldly diversion in the evening neither be it upon hearsay only that he prescribe he have be to all these place and test they perhaps which would account for he serene demeanor and that even health which he seem to enjoy he have travel without perturbment it would seem for he journey have leave no wrinkle on he bland forehead neither be the light of restlessness in he quiet eye he must have see many city but city be nearly all alike and they grow more alike every day many man also must he have meet but they seem to have rub against he and leave he unmarked -- as sandstone may rub against a diamond it be upon the sandstone that the scratch remain he be not part of all that he have see which may have mean that he look not at man or city but right through they to something beyond upon which he gaze be always fix living as he do in a city possess so great a shrine as that of the virgen del pilar the scene of a vision accord to st jame when travel through spain mon naturally interested himself in the pilgrim who come from all part of the world to worship in the cathedral who may be see at any hour kneel in the dim light of flicker candle before the altar rail mon 's apartment indeed in the tall house next door to the posada de los reye on the paseo del ebro be a known resort of the more culture of the pilgrim of these who come from afar from rome and from the farthest limit of the roman church -- from warsaw to minnesota evasio mon have friend also among the humble and such as sheltered in the posada de los reye which itself be a typical spanish hostelry and one of those house of the road in which the traveler be lucky if he find the bedroom all occupy for then he may without give offense sleep more comfortably in the hayloft here night and day the clink of bell and the gruff admonition of refractory mule tell of travel and the constant come and go of strange wild-looking man from the remoter corner of aragon far up by the foothill of the pyrenee the huge two-wheeled cart draw by six eight or ten mule come lumber through the dust at all hour of the twenty-four bring the produce of the greener land to this oasis of the aragonese desert some come from other oasis in the salt and stony plain where once a inland sea cover all while the other hail from the north where the sierras de guara rise merge into the giant pyrenee many of these driver make they way up the stair of the house where evasio mon live he quiet life and give a letter or merely a verbal message remember faithfully through the long and dusty journey to the man who though no priest himself seem know to every priest in spain these letter and message be nearly always from the curate of some distant village and tell as often as not of a cheerful hopefulness in the work sometimes the good man themselves would come sit humbly beneath the hood of the great cart or ride a mule far enough in front to avoid the dust and yet near enough for company this be more especially in the month of February at the anniversary of the miraculous appearance at which time the graven image set up in the cathedral be understand to be more amenable to supplication than at any other and have accomplish they pilgrimage the simple churchman turn quite naturally to the house that stand adjoining the cathedral there they be always sure of a welcome and of a invitation to lunch or dinner when they be treat to the very best the city could afford and while keep strictly within the letter of the canonical law could feast they hearty country appetite even in lend mon so arrange he journey that he should be away from saragossa in the great heat of the summer and autumn which wise precaution be render the easier by the date of the other great festival which he usually attend for it will be find that the miracle and other event attractive to the devout nearly always happen at that season of the year which be most suitable to the environment thus the tradition of the middle age fix the month of February for saragossa when it be pleasant to be in a city and September for montserrat -- to quote only one instance -- at which time the cool air of the mountain be most to be appreciate evasio mon however be among those who deem it wise to avoid the great festival at montserrat by make he pilgrimage earlier in the summer when the number of the devout be more restricted and they quality more select score of thousand of the very poorest in the land flock to the monastery in September turn the mountain into a picnic ground and the festival into a fair mon never know when the spirit would move he to make this pleasant journey but he preparation for it must have be make in advance and he departure by a early train the day after meet he old friend the count de sarrion be probably sudden to every one except himself he leave the train at lerida go on foot from the station to the town but he do not seek a hotel he have a friend it appear whose house be open to he in the spanish way who live near the church in the long narrow street which form nearly the whole town of lerida in navarre and aragon the train service be not quite up to modern requirement there be usually one passenger train in either direction during the day though between the larger city this service have of late year be double it be afternoon and the hour of the siesta when evasio mon walk through the narrow street of this ancient city although the sun be hot and all nature lay gasp beneath it the street be unusually busy and in the shades of the arcade at the corner of the market-place at the corner of the bridge and by the bank of the river where the low wall be rub smooth by the trousers of the indolent man stand in group and talk in a low voice it be not too much to state that the only serene face in the street be that of evasio mon who go on he way with the absorb smile which be usually take in england to indicate the christian virtue and be associate as often as not with dissent the man of lérida -- a simpler more agricultural race than the navarrese -- be disturbed and indeed these be stir time in spain these man know what might come at any moment for they have be bear in stir time and they father before they stir time have reign in this country for a hundred year ferdinand vii -- the beloved the dupe of napoleon the great the god of all spain from irun to san roque and one of the thorough-paced scoundrel whom god have permit to sit on a throne -- have bequeath to he country a legacy of strife which be now bear fruit for not only aragon but all spain be at this time in the most unfortunate position in which a nation or a man -- and above all a woman -- can find herself -- she do not know what she want on one side be catalonium republican fiery democratic and independent on the other navarre more priest-ridden than rome herself with every man a carlist and every woman that which she confessor tell she to be in the south andalusia only ask to be leave alone to go she own sunny indifferent way to the limbo of the great nation which way should aragon turn in truth the man of aragon know not themselves stir time indeed for the news have just penetrate to far remote lérida that the two greatest nation of europe be at each other 's throat it be a long cry from em to lérida and the talker on the shady side of the market-place know little of what be pass on the bank of the rhine stir time too be nearer at hand across the mediterranean for thing be approach a deadlock on the tiber and that river too must it seem flow with blood before the year run out for the greatest catastrophe that the church have have to face be prepare in the new and temporary capital of italy and all man know that the word must soon go forth from florence tell the monarch of the vatican that he must relinquish rome or fight for it spain in she awkward search for a king hither and thither over europe have throw france and germany into war and evasio mon probably know of the historic scene at em as soon as any man in the peninsula for history will undoubtedly show when a generation or so have pass away that the latter stage of napoleon 's declaration of war be hurry on by priestly intrigue it will be remember that bismarck be the deadliest and cleverest foe that jesuitism have have mon know what the talker in the market-place be say to each other he probably know what they be afraid to say to each other for spain be still seek a king -- might yet set other nation by the ear the republic have be try and have miserably fail there be yet a don carlo a direct descendant of the brother whom ferdinand the beloved cheat out of he throne there be a don carlo why not don carlo since we seek a king the man in the phrygian cap be say to each other and that be what mon want they to say after dark he come out into the street again cloak to the lip against the evening air he go to the large cafe by the river and there seem to meet many acquaintance the next morning he continue he journey by road now and on horseback he sit a horse well but not with that comfort which be beget of a love of the animal for he the horse be essentially a means of transport and all other animal be look at in a like utilitarian spirit in every village he find a friend as often as not he be the first to bring the news of war to a people who have scarcely know peace these hundred year the teller of news can not help tell with he tiding he own view of they and evasio mon make it know that in he opinion all who have a grievance could want no better opportunity of air it thus he travel slowly through the country towards montserrat and wherever he slight black-clad form and serene face have pass the spirit of unrest be leave behind in remote aragonese village as in busy catalan town where the artisan -lrb- that disturber of ancient peace -rrb- be already begin to add he voice to thing of spain evasio mon always find a hearing needless to say he find in every village venta in every posada of the town that which be easy to find in this babble world -- a talker and evasio mon be a notable listener chapter vi pilgrim it be not often that nature take the trouble to stir the heart of man into any emotion stronger than a quiet admiration or a peaceful wonder here and there on the face of the earth however the astonishing work of god give pause to the most casual observer the most thoughtless traveler why do he do this one wonder and no geologist -- not even a french geologist with he quick imagination and lively sense of the picturesque -- can answer the question on first perceive the sudden uncouth height of montserrat the traveler must assuredly ask in he own mind why the mountain be of granite where no other granite be it belong to no neighbouring formation it stand alone throw up its rugged peak into a cloudless sky it be a piece from nothing near it -- from nothing nearer one must conclude than the moon no wonder it stir the imagination of mediæval man dimly grope for they god ignatius de loyola solve the question with that unbounded assurance which almost always accompany the greatest of human blunder it be the self-confident man who compass the finest wreck loyolum wound in the defense of that strongest little city in europe pampeluna -- wound alas and not kill -- jump to the conclusion that god have rear up montserrat as a sign for it be here that the spanish soldier who be to mould the history of half the world dedicate himself to heaven within sight of the mediterranean and of the pyrenee tower above the brown plain of catalonium this shrine be the greatest in christendom that base its greatness on nothing but tradition thousand of pilgrim flock here every year should they ask for history they be give a legend do they demand a fact they be tell a miracle on payment of a sufficient fee they be show a small ill-carved figure in wood the monastery be not without its story for the french occupy it and burn it to the ground for the rest its story be that of spain tear hither and thither in the hopeless struggle of a church no longer able to meet the demand of a enlighten religious comprehension and endeavor to hold back the inevitable advance of the human understanding to-day a few monk be permit to live in the great house teach music and provide for the want of the devout pilgrim without the monastery gate there be a good and exceedingly prosperous restaurant where the traveler may feed in the vast house be accommodation for rich and poor a cell and clean linen a bed and a monastic basin the monk keep a small store where candle may be buy and match and even soap which be in small demand evasio mon arrive at montserrat in the evening have drive in open carriage from the small town of monistrol in the valley below it be the hour of the table d'hôte and the still evening air be ambient with culinary odour mon go at once to the office of the monastery and there receive he sheet and pillow-case he towel he candle and the key of he cell in the long corridor of the house of santa maria de jesu he know he way about these holy house and exchange a nod of recognition with the lay brother on duty in the office then this traveler hurry across the courtyard and out of the great gate to join the pilgrim of the richer sort at table in the dining-room of the restaurant there be four who look up from they plate and bow in the grave spanish way when he enter the room then all fall to they fish again in silence for spain be a silent country and only babble in that home of fervid eloquence and fatal verbosity the corte it be always dangerous to enter into conversation with a stranger in spain for there be practically no subject upon which the various nationality be unable to quarrel a frenchman be a frenchman all the world over and politics may be avoid by a graceful reference to the patrie for which republican and legitimist be alike prepare to die but the spaniard may be a aragonese or a valencian a andalusian or a guipuzcoan and patriotism be a flower of purely local growth and color thus man meet in public place have learn to do so in silence and a table d'hôte be a wordless function unless the inevitable andalusian -- he who take the place of the gascon in france -- be present with he babble and he laugh he fine opinion of himself and he faculty for make a sacrifice of he own dignity at that over-rated altar -- the shrine of sociability there be no andalusian at this small table to serve at once as a link of sympathy between the quiet man who would fain silence he and a means of make unsociable person acquaint with each other the five man be thus permit to dine in a silence befitting they surroundings and they station in life for they be obviously gentleman and obviously of a thoughtful and perhaps devout habit of mind a keen observer who have have the cosmopolitan education say of a attaché be usually able to assign a nationality to each member of a mixed assembly but there be a subtle resemblance to each other in these diner which would have make the task a hard one these be citizen of the world and they likeness lay deeper than a mere accident of dress in fact the most remarkable thing about they be that they be all alike studiously unremarkable after the formal bow evasio mon give he attention to the fare set before he once he raise he narrow gaze and with a smile of recognition acknowledge the grave and very curt nod of a man seat opposite a second time he meet the glance of another diner a stout puffy man who breathe heavily while he eat both man alike avert they eye at once and both look towards a little wizened man double up in he chair who eat sparingly and bear on he wrinkled face and bent form the evidence of such a weight of care as few but king and minister ever know so absorb be he that after one glance at evasio mon he lapse again into he own thought the very manner in which he crumble he bread and handle he knife and fork show that he mind be as busy as a mill he be oblivious to he surroundings have forget he companion he mind have more to occupy it than one brief lifetime could hope to compass yet he be so clearly a man in authority that a casual observer could scarcely have fail to perceive that these devout pilgrim from italy from france from far-off poland and saragossa close at hand in catalonium have come to meet he and be subordinate to he it be probably no small task to command such man as evasio mon -- and the other four seem no less pliable behind they gentle smile when the dessert have be place on the table and one or two have reflectively eat a baked almond more from habit than desire the little wizened man look round the table with the manner of a rather absent-minded host it be eight o'clock he say in french the monastery gate close at half-past we have no time to discuss we business at this table shall we go within the monastery gate there be a seat by the wall near the fountain in the courtyard -- he rise as he speak and it become at once apparent that this be a great man for all stand aside as he pass out and one open the door as to a prince of which amenity he take no heed the monastery be build against the sheer side of the mountain perch on a cornice like a huge eagle 's nest the building have no pretense to architectural beauty and consist of barrack-like house build around a quadrangle the chapel be at the farther end and be of course the center of interest here be keep the sacred image which have survive so many chance and change which hide for a hundred and fifty year in a cavern on the mountainside make itself know at last by a miraculous illumination at night and for the further guidance of the faithful give forth a sweet scent it moreover select this spot for its shrine by jib under the immediate eye of a bishop and refuse to be carry further up the mountain the house of santa maria de jesu have the advantage of be at the outer end of the quadrangle and thus have no house opposite to it face a sheer fall of three thousand foot a fountain splash in the courtyard below and a low wall form a long seat where the devout pass the evening hour in that curt and epigrammatic conversation which be more peaceful than the quick talk of frenchman and deeper than the babble of italy it be to this wall that the little wizened man lead the way and here seat himself with a gesture invite he companion to do the same have any idle observer be interested in they movement he would have conclude that these be four traveler probably pilgrim of the better class who have make acquaintance at the table d'hôte i have come a long way say the little man at once speak in the rather round french of the italian bear and have leave rome at a time when the church require the help of even the humblest of she servant -- i hope we good mon have something important and really effective this time to communicate mon smile at the imply reproach and i too have come from far -- from warsaw say the stout man breathing hard as if to illustrate the length of he journey let we hope that there be something tangible this time he speak with the gaiety and lightness of a frenchman for this be that frenchman of the north a pole mon light a cigarette with a gay jerk of the match towards the last speaker indicative of he recognition of a jest something continue the pole more than great promise -- something more stable than a castle -- in spain ha ha you have not take pampeluna yet my friend one do not hear that bilboa have fall into the hand of the carlist every time we meet you ask for money you must arrange to give we something -- for we money my friend i will arrange answer mon in he quiet neat enunciation to give you a kingdom and he incline he head forward to look at the pole through the upper half of he gold-rimmed glass and not a vague republic in the region of the north pole say the stout man with a laugh well who live shall see you want more money -- be that it inquire the little wizened man who seem to be the leader though he speak the least -- a not unusual characteristic yes reply the spaniard you country have cost we much this year say the little man blinking he colourless eye and stare at the ground as if make a mental calculation you have force germany and france into war you have make france withdraw she troops from rome and you give victor emmanuel the chance he await you have give all europe -- the nerve and now be the moment to play on those nerve say mon with you clumsy don carlo it be not the man -- it be the cause remember that we be a ignorant nation it be the ignorant and the half educate who sacrifice all for a cause it be a pity you can not buy a new don carlo with we money put in the pole this one will serve be the reply one must look to the future many have be ruin by success because it take they by surprise in case we succeed this one will serve the church do not want its king to be capable -- remember that but what do spain want inquire the leader spain do not know and this prince of ours whom you have ask to be you king be not that a speak in you wheel ask the man of few word a loose speak which will drop out no one -- not even prim -- think that he will last ten year he may not last ten month but you have to reckon with the man this son of victor emmanuel be clever and capable one can never tell what may arise in a brain that work beneath a crown we have reckon with he he be honest that tell he tale no honest king can hope to reign over this country in they new constitution it need a bourbon or a woman the quick colourless eye rest on mon 's face for a moment and -- who know -- perhaps they pick up mon 's secret in pass something dishonest in a word put in the pole but nobody heed he for the word be with the leader when last we meet he say at length and you receive a large sum of money you make a distinct promise unless my memory deceive I he pause and no one suggest that he memory have ever make slip or lapse in all he long career you say you would not ask for money again unless you could show something tangible -- a fortress take and hold a great general buy a province win be that so yes answer mon or else continue the speaker in order to meet the very just complaint from other country such as poland for instance that spain have have more than she share of the common fund -- you would lay before we some proposal of self-help some proof that spain in ask for help be prepare to help herself by a sacrifice of some sort i say that i would not ask for any sum that i could not double say mon the little man sit blinking for some minute silent in that absolute stillness which be peculiar to great height -- and be so marked at montserrat that many can not sleep there i will give you any sum that you can double he say at length then i will ask you for three million peseta all turn and look at he in wonder the fat man give a gasp with three million peseta he could have make a polish republic mon only smile for every million peseta that you show I say the little man i will hand you another million -- cash for cash when shall we begin you must give I time answer mon reflectively say six month hence the little man rise in response to the chapel bell which be slowly toll for the last service of the day come he say let we say a prayer before we go to bed chapter vii the alternative the letter write by the count de sarrion to he son be deliver to marco literally from hand to hand by the messenger to whose care it be entrust so fully do the mountaineer carry out he instruction that after standing on the river bank for some minute he deliberately walk knee-deep into the water and touch marco on the elbow for the river be a loud one and marco intent on he sport never turn he head to look about he this the last of the sarrion be a patient look man with the quiet eye of one who deal with nature and the slow movement of the far-sighted for nature be always consistent and never hurry those who watch she closely to obey the law she write so large in the instinct of man and beast the messenger give he master the letter and then stand with the water rustling past he woollen stocking there be a odd suggestion of brotherhood between these man of very different birth for as man be equal in the sight of god so be those dimly like each other who live in the open air and cast they life upon the broad bosom of nature marco hand he rod to the messenger whose face wrinkle like a walnut by the sun of aragon light up suddenly with pleasure there he say point to a swirl pool beneath some alder there be a big one there i have rise he once he wade slowly back to the bank where a second crop of hay be already show its new green and sit down it seem that marco de sarrion be behind the time -- these new and wordy time into which spain have flounder so disastrously since charle iii be king -- for he give a deeper attention to the matter in hand than most have time for he turn from the hard task of catch a trout in clear water beneath a sunny sky and give he attention to he father 's letter after all it read i want you and await you in saragossa and that be all marco will come the count have reflect without persuasion and explanation be dangerous in which he be right for this river know as the wolf in which marco be peacefully fishing be one of those northern tributary of the ebro which have run with blood any time this hundred year the country moreover that it drain be mark in the government map as a blank country or one that pay no tax and know not the uniform of the government troops torre garda the long two-storied house crowning a hill-top farther up the valley of the wolf be one of the few country house that have not stand empty since the forty and all the valley of the wolf from the grim pyrenee stand sentinel at its head to the sunny plain almost in sight of pampeluna where the wolf merge into other stream be hold quiescent in the grip of the sarrion we will fight say the man of this valley for the king when we have a king worth fight for and we will always fight for ourselves and it be say that they only repeat what the sarrion have tell they at all event no carlist come that way torre garda be not worth hold they say and you can not hold pampeluna unless you take torre garda first think those who know the art of guerilla warfare so the valley of the wolf await a king worth fight for and in the meantime they pay no tax enjoy no postal service and be perhaps none the worse without it there be carlist over the mountain on either side of the valley eternal snow close the northern end of it and feed the wolf in the summer heat down at the mouth of the valley where the road be wide enough for two cart to pass each other and a carriage could be drive at the trot there often pass a patrol from the royalist stronghold of pampeluna but the government troops never venture up the valley which be like a mouse-hole with a carlist cat wait round the corner to cut they off neither do the carlist hazard themselves through the narrow defile where the wolf rush down its straighten gate for there be forty thousand man in pampeluna only ten mile away which reason be sound enough to dictate caution in any write word that might pass from the count in saragossa to he son at torre garda a white dog with one yellow and black ear -- a dog that might have be a nightmare a bad distorted dream of a pointer -- stand in front of marcos de sarrion as he read the letter and seem to await the hearing of its contents there be many person of doubtful social standing who seek to make up -- to bridge that narrow and unfathomable gulf -- by affability this dog it seem know that he be not quite a pointer seek to conciliate humanity by a eagerness by a pathetic and blundering haste to try and understand what be expect of he and to perform the same without delay which be quite foreign to the nature of the real breed in spain one address a man by the plain term : man and after all it be something -- deja quelque choose -- to be worthy of that name this dog be call perro which be translate be dog he have be a waif in he early day some stray from the mountain near the frontier where dog be train to smuggle full of zeal he have probably smuggle too eagerly marco have find he half starve far up the valley of the wolf he have not be deem worthy of a baptismal name and have be call the dog -- and admit as such to the outbuilding of torre garda from thence he have work he humble way upward by patience and comfort he mind slowly expand until man almost forget that this be a disgraceful mongrel perro have rise from a slumberous contemplation of the tumble water and now stand await order he near hind leg shake with eagerness to please by run anywhere at any pace marco never speak to he dog he have see spain humble to the dust by babble and the sight have perhaps dry up the spring of he speech for he rarely speak idly if he have anything to say he say it but if he have nothing he be silent which be of course fatal to social advancement and set he at one stroke outside the pale of political life spain at this time and indeed during the last thirty year have be the happy hunting ground of the beau sabreur of those -lrb- of all man most miserable -rrb- who owe they success in life to a woman 's favor this silent spaniard might perhaps have make for himself a name in the world 's arena in other day for he have a spark of that genius which create a leader but fate have rule that he should have no wider sphere than a obscure pyrenean gorge no greater a follow than the man of the valley of the wolf these he hold in a iron grip within he deep and narrow head lay the secret which neither madrid nor bayonne could ever understand why the valley of the wolf be neither royalist nor carlist the quiet slow eye have alone see into the heart of the wild navarrese mountaineer and know the way to rule they it may be think that they small number make the task a easy one but it must also be remember that these mountain slope have give to the world the finest guerilla soldier that history have know and be people by one of the untame race of mankind moreover marcos de sarrion be a restful man and those few who see below the surface know that the restful man be he whose life 's task be well within the compass of he ability perro it seem with a intelligence develop at the best and hardest of all school where hunger be the usher await not word but action from he master and have not long to wait for marco rise and slowly climb the hill towards torre garda half hidden amid the pine tree on the mountain crest above he there be a midnight train he know from pampeluna to saragossa the railway station be only twenty mile away which be to this day consider quite a convenient distance in navarre there would be a moon soon after nightfall there be plenty of time that far-off ancestress of the middle-age have it would appear hand down to she son forever with the clear cut profile the philosophy which allow itself time to get through life unruffle the count de sarrion be take he early coffee the next morning at the open window in saragossa when marco with the dust of travel across the alkali desert still upon he come into the room i expect you say the father you will like a bath all be ready in you room i have see to it myself when you be ready come back here and take you coffee he attitude be almost that of a host for marco rarely come to saragossa although there be a striking resemblance of feature between the sarrion the father be taller slighter and quicker in he glance while marco ' face seem to bespeak a greater strength in any common purpose it would assuredly fall to marco ' lot to execute that which he father have conceive the older man 's presence suggest the court while marco be clearly intend for the camp the count de sarrion have pass through both and have emerge half cynical half indifferent from the slough of a evil woman 's downfall you would have make a good soldier he say to marco when he son at last come home to torre garda with a education complete in england and france but there be no opening for a honest man in the spanish army honesty be in the gutter in spain to-day and marco always follow he father 's advice later he find that spain indeed offer no career to honest man at this time gradually he supplant he father in a unrecognised indefinable monarchy in the valley of the wolf and there in the valley they wait as good spaniard have wait these hundred year until such time as god 's wrath shall be overpast i have a long story to tell you say the count when he son return and sit down at once with a keen appetite to he first breakfast of coffee and bread and i will tell it without comment without prejudice if i can marco nod the count have light a cigarette and now lean against the window which open on to the heavily bar balcony overlook the calle san gregorio four night ago he say at about midnight francisco de mogente return secretly to saragossa i think he be come to this house but we shall never know that no one know he be come -- not even juanita the count glance at he son only long enough to note the passage of a sort of shadow across he dark eye at the mention of the schoolgirl 's name francisco be attack in the street down there at the corner of the calle san gregorio and be kill he conclude marco rise and cross the room towards the window he be it appear a eminently practical man and desire to see the exact spot where mogente have fall before the story go any farther perro go so far as to push he plebeian head through the bar and look down into the street it be he misfortune to fall into the fault of excess as it be the misfortune of most parvenu do juanita know ask marco yes my sister dolore have tell she poor child it be more in the nature of a disappointment than a sorrow she heart be young and disappointment be the sorrow of the young marco sit down again in silence we must remember say the count that she never know he it will pass i see the incident from this window there be no door at this side of the house i should as you know have have to go round by the paseo del ebro to render help be out of the question i go down afterwards however when help have come and the die man have be carry away -- by a friar marco i have see something fall from the hand of the murder man i go down into the street and pick it up it be the sword-stick which juanita send to she father for the new year why do he not let we know that he be come to europe asked marco ah that he will tell we hereafter the mere fact of he be attack in the street of saragossa and kill for the money that be in he pocket be of course quite simple and common enough but why should he be care for by a friar and take to one of those numerous religious house which have spring into unseen existence all over spain since the jesuit be expel have he leave a will ask marco sarrion turn and look at he with a short laugh he throw he cigarette away and come into the room sit down in front of the small table where marco be still satisfy he honest and simple appetite i have tell my story badly he say with a curt laugh and spoil it you have soon see through it mogente make a will on he death-bed -- which be by the way witness by leon de mogente as a supernumerary not a legal witness -- just to show that all be square and above board then he leave he money -- to juanita one can only conclude that he be wander in mind when he do it for he be fond of she i think he have no reason to wish she harm i have pick up what unconsidered trifle of information i can but they do not amount to much i cabled to cuba for news as to mogente 's fortune for we know that he have make one there be the reply he hand marco a telegram which bear the word : three million peseta in the english fund that be the millstone that he have tie round juanita 's neck say sarrion folding the paper and return it to he pocket to saddle with three million peseta a girl who be at a convent school in the hand of the sister of the true faith when the carlist cause be die for want of fund and the jesuit know that it be don carlo or a republic and all the world know that all republic have be fatal to the society -- bah the count throw out he hand in a gesture of despair it be to throw she into a convent bind hand and foot we can not leave that poor girl without help marco no say marco gently there be only one way -- i have think of it night and day there be only one way my friend marco look at he father thoughtfully and wait to hear what that way might be you must marry she say the count chapter viii the trail the count rise again and go to the window without look at marco they have live together like brother and like brother they have fall into the habit of close the door of silence upon certain subject juanita it would appear be one of these for neither be at ease while speaking of she spaniard and german and englishman be not notable for a pretty and fanciful treatment of the subject of love but they approach it with a certain shy delicacy of which the lighter latin heart have no conception the count glance over he shoulder and marco without look up must have see the action for he take the opportunity of shake he head you shake you head say sarrion with a sort of effort to be gay and careless what do you want she be the prettiest girl in aragon it be not that say marco curtly with a flush on he brown face then what be it marco make no answer the count light another cigarette to gain time perhaps listen to I he say at length we have always understand each other except about juanita we have nearly always be of the same mind -- you and i marcos be lean he arm on the table and look across the room towards he father with a slow smile let we try and understand each other about juanita before we go any farther you think that there may be thought in you mind which be beyond my comprehension it may not be as bad as that i allow you that as the heart grow older it lose a certain sensitiveness and delicacy of feeling still the comprehension of such feeling in younger person may survive you think that juanita should be allow to make she own choice -- be it not so -- learn in england eh yes be the answer and i reply to that a convent education -- the only education open to spanish girl -- do not fit she to make she own choice it be not a question of education no it be a question of opportunity say sarrion sharply and a convent schoolgirl have no opportunity my friend a father or a mother if they be wise will choose better than a girl throw suddenly into the world from the convent gate but that be not the question juanita will never get outside the convent gate unless we drag she from they -- half against she own will we can give she the choice we have certain rights no rights reply sarrion that the church will recognize and the church hold she now within its grip she be only a child she do not know what life mean exactly so sarrion exclaim and that make they plan all the easier of execution they can bring pressure to bear upon she assiduously and quite kindly so that she will be bring to see that she only chance of happiness be the veil few man and no woman at all can be happy in a life of they own choosing if they be assure by person in daily intercourse with they -- person whom they respect and love -- that in live that life they will assuredly be lay up for themselves a eternity of damnation we must try and look at it from juanita 's point of view marco turn and glance at he father with a smile that be not so easy he say that be what i have be try to do but you must not overdo it reply sarrion significantly remember that she point of view may be a ignorant one and must be biass by the strongest and most dangerous influence look at the question also from the point of view of a man of the world -- and tell I tell I after think it over carefully -- whether you think that you would feel happy in the future know that you have allow juanita to choose a convent life with she eye blind i be not thinking of my happiness say marco quite simply and curtly of juanita 's happiness suggest the count yes then think again and tell I whether you as a man of the world can for a moment imagine that juanita 's chance of happiness would be greater in the convent -- whether the church could make she happier than you could if you give she the opportunity of lead the life that god create she for marco make no answer and oddly enough sarrion seem to expect none that be he explain in the same careless voice if we may go on the presumption that you be content to place juanita 's happiness before you own i be content to do that always ask sarrion gravely always there be a short silence then the count come into the room and as he pass marco he lay he hand for a moment on he son 's broad back then my friend he say cross the room and take up he glove let we get to action that will please you better than word i know let we go and see leon -- the weakest link in they fine chain juanita have no one in the world but we -- but i think we shall be enough leon de mogente live in a apartment in the plaza del pilar he father for whom he have but little affection have make he a liberal allowance which have be spend so to speak on he soul it elevate the spirit of this excellent young man to decorate he room in imitation of a sanctuary he live in a atmosphere of aesthetic emotion which he quite mistake for holiness he be a dandy in the care of he soul and trick himself out to catch the eye of high heaven the marquis de mogente be out he have cross the plaza the servant thought to say a prayer in the cathedral on the suggestion of the servant the sarrion decide to wait until leon 's return the man who have the air of a murderer -lrb- or a spanish cathedral chorister -rrb- volunteer to go and seek he master i can say a prayer myself he say humbly and here be something to put in the poor-box answer sarrion with he twisted smile by my soul he exclaim when they be leave alone this place reek of hypocrisy he look round the wall with a raise eyebrow i have be try to discover he go on what be in the mind of francisco as he lay die in that house in the calle san gregorio -- what he be try to carry out -- why he make that will he send for leon you see and must have see at a glance that he have for a son -- a mule of the worst sort he probably see that to leave money to leon be to give it to the church which mean that it would be spend for the further undoing of spain and the propagation of ignorance and superstition for ramon de sarrion be one of those good spaniard and good catholic who lay the entire blame for the downfall of they country from its great estate to a church which can only hope to live in its present form as long as superstition and crass ignorance prevail i can not help think he go on that francisco dimly perceive that he be the victim of a careful plot -- one see something like that in all these ramification three million peseta be worth scheming for they would make a difference in any cause they might make all the difference at this moment in spain kingdom have be win and lose for less than three million peseta i believe he be watch in cuba and he return be know or perhaps he be bring back by some clever forgery who know at all event it be know that he have leave he money nearly all to leon we will ask leon suggest marco what reason he father give for make a new will and he will lie to you say sarrion but he will lie badly murmured marco with he leisurely reflective smile i think say sarrion after a pause nay i feel sure that francisco leave he fortune to juanita at the last moment as a forlorn hope -- leave it to you and I to get she out of the hobble in which he place she you know it be always he hope that you and juanita should marry but marco ' face harden and he have nothing to say to this reiteration of the dead man 's hope the silence be not again break before leon de mogente come in he look from one to the other with a apprehensive glance he pale eye have that dulness which betoken if not a absorption in the thing to come that which often pass for the same a incompetence to face the present moment i be about to write to you he say address himself to sarrion i be have a mass celebrate tomorrow in the cathedral my father i know i shall be there say sarrion rather shortly and marco i also reply marco one must do what one can say leon with a resigned sigh marco the man of action and not of word look at he and say nothing he be perhaps notice that the dishonest boy have grow into a dishonest man monastic religion be like a varnish it only serve to bring out the true color and be powerless to alter it by more than a shade those who have live in religious community know that human nature be the same there as in the world -- that a man who be not straightforward may grow in monastic zeal day by day but he will never grow straightforward on the other hand if a man be a good man religion will make he better but it must not be a religion that run to word leon sit with fold hand and lower eye he be a sort of amateur monk and like all amateur he be apt to exaggerate outward sign it be marco who speak at length do you intend he ask in he matter-of-fact way to make any effort to discover and punish you father 's assassin i have be advise not to by whom leon look distressed he be pained it would seem that the friend of he childhood should step so bluntly on to delicate ground it be a secret of the confession marco exchange a grave glance with he father who sit back in he chair as one may see a leader sit back while he junior counsel conduct a able cross-examination have you advise juanita of the term of she father 's will i understand answer leon that it will make but little difference to juanita she have she allowance as i have mine my father i understand have but little to bequeath to she marco glance at he father again and then at the clock he have it appear finish he cross-examination and be now characteristically anxious to get to action sarrion now take the lead in conversation and proffer the usual condolence and desire to help in the formal spanish way he could hardly conceal he contempt for leon who for he part be not free from embarrassment they have nothing in common but the subject which have bring the sarrion hither and upon this point they could not progress satisfactorily see that sarrion himself have evidently sustain a greater loss than the dead man 's own son they rise and take leave promising to attend the mass next day leon become interested again at once in this side of the question which be not without a thrill of novelty for he he have organise and take part in many interesting and gorgeous ceremony but a requiem mass for one 's own father must necessarily be unique in the most varied career of religious emotion he be a little flurry as a girl be flurry at she first ball and feel that the eye of the black-letter saint be upon he he shake hand absent-mindedly with he friend and be already make mental note of they addition to the number secure for to-morrow 's ceremony he be very earnest about it and marco leave he with a sudden softening of the heart towards he such as the strong must always feel for the weak you see say sarrion when they be in the street what evasio mon have make he i do not know whether you be dispose to hand over juanita and she three million peseta to evasio mon as well marco make no reply but walk on wrapt in thought i must see juanita he say at length after a long silence and sarrion 's wise eye be soften by a smile which flit across they like a flash of sunlight across a darkened field remember he say that juanita be a child she can not be expect to know she own mind for at least three year marco nod he head as if he know what be come and remember that the danger be imminent -- that evasio mon be not the man to let the grass grow beneath he foot -- that we can not let juanita wait three week i know answer marco chapter ix the quarry sarrion call at the convent school of the sister of the true faith the next morning and be inform through the grate that the school be in retreat even i whose duty it be to speak to you shall have to perform penance for do so say the doorkeeper in she soft voice through the bar then do a extra penance my sister return sarrion and answer another question tell I if the sor teresa be within the sor teresa be at pampeluna and the mother superior be here in the school herself the sor teresa be only sister superior you must know and be therefore subordinate to the mother superior sarrion be a pleasant-spoken man and a man of the world he know that if a woman have something to tell of another she be not to be frighten into silence by the whole court of cardinal and eke the pope of rome himself so he draw he horse nearer to the forbid wooden gate and do not ride away from it until he have gain some scrap of information and saddle the lay sister with a burden of penance to last all through the retreat he learn that he sister have be send to pampeluna where the sister of the true faith conduct another school much patronise by the poor nobility of that priest-ridden city he be make to understand moreover that juanita de mogente have be give special opportunity for prayer and meditation owing to a unchristian spirit of resentment and revenge which she have display on learn the will of heaven in regard to she abandon and it be to be fear heretic father which mean my sister that neither you nor any other in the world may see or speak to she -- but i must close the grille and the little shutter be sharply shut in sarrion 's face this be the beginning of a quest which for a fortnight continue entirely fruitless evasio mon it appear be on a pilgrimage sor teresa have go to pampeluna the inexorable gate of the convent school remain shut to all comer sarrion go to pampeluna to see he sister but come back without have attain he object marco take up the trail with a patient thoroughness learn at the best school -- the school of nature he be without haste and express neither hope nor discouragement but he realize more and more clearly that juanita be in genuine danger by one or two move in this subtle warfare sarrion have force he adversary to unmask he defens some of the obstruction behind which juanita be now conceal could scarcely have originate in chance marco have in the course of he long antagonism against wolf or bear or boar in the central pyrenee more than once experience that sharp shock of astonishment and fear to which the big-game hunter can scarcely remain indifferent when he find himself oppose by a unmistakable sign of a intelligence equal to he own or a instinct superior to it subtly meet he subtle attack this he experience now and know that he himself be be watch and he every action forestall the effect be to make he the more dog the more cunning in he quest because he know that juanita 's cause be in competent hand or for some other reason sarrion withdraw from take such a active part as heretofore he keen and careful eye note a change in marco juanita 's helplessness seem to have arouse a steady determination to help she at any cost weakness be a appeal that strength rarely resist it be marco who finally discover a opportunity and with characteristic patience he sift it and organise a plan of action before make anything know to he father there be a service in the cathedral of la seo tomorrow evening he announce suddenly at midnight one night on he return from a long and tiring day all the girl of the convent school will be there ah say sarrion look he son up and down with a speculative eye well my aunt sor teresa be likely to be there she have return to saragossa to-day the mother superior -- by the grace of god -- have indigestion i have get a letter safely through to sor teresa the service be at seven o'clock the archbishop will go in procession round the cathedral to bless the people the cathedral be very dark there will be considerable confusion when the door be open and the people crowd out i have a few man -- of the road from the posada de los reye -- who will add to the confusion under my instruction i think if you help I we can get juanita separate from the rest i will take she home and see to it that she arrive at the school at the same time as the other we can arrange it i think yes answer sarrion i have no doubt that we can arrange it and they sit far into the night after the manner of conspirator discuss marco ' plan which be like himself quite simple and direct the cathedral of the seo in saragossa be one of the most ancient in spain and bear in its architecture some resemblance to the moorish mosque that once stand on the same spot it be a huge square building dimly light by window set high up in the stupendous roof the choir be a square set down in the middle -- a church within a cathedral there be two principal entrance one on the plaza de la seo where the fountain be and where in the sunshine the philosopher of saragossa sit and do nothing from morn till eve the other entrance be that which be know as the grand portal and with a wrong-headedness characteristic of the peninsular it be situate in a little street where no man pass marco know that the grand portal be use by the religious community and devout person who come to church for the good motive while those who praise god that man might see they enter and quit the cathedral by the more public doorway on the plaza he know also that the convent school take they station just within the great porch which during the day be the parade ground for those authorise beggar who wear they number and licence suspend round they neck as a guarantee of good faith the cathedral be cram to suffocation when marco and he father enter by this door at the foot of the shallow step descend from the porch to the floor of the cathedral sor teresa 's white cap rise above the head of the people here and there a nun 's cap or the blue veil of a nursing sister show itself amidst the black mantilla here and there the white head of some old man make its mark among the sunburnt face for there be as many man as woman present the majority of they look about they as at a show but all be silent and respectful all make room readily enough for any who wish to kneel there be no push no impatience all be polite and forbear the archbishop 's procession have already leave the door of the choir and be move slowly round the building it be precede by a chorister and a boy who sing in unison with a strange uncomfortable echo in the roof immediately on they heel follow a man in he usual outdoor clothes who accompany they on a haut-boy with queer snort note and nod to he friend as he perceive they face dimly loom in the light of the flicker candle carry by acolyte behind he they stop at interval and sing a verse then the organ far above they head roll in its solemn note and the whole choir break into song as they move on the archbishop precede by the host bear aloft beneath a silken canopy wear a long red silk robe of which the train be carry by two careless acolyte a red silk biretta and red glove as the host pass the people kneel and rise and kneel again as the archbishop come -- a sort of human tide rise and kneel and rise again to dust they knee and stare about they which be not without a symbolical meaning for those who know the history of the church in latin country the face of the archbishop strike a sudden and startling note of sincerity as he pass on with uphold hand and eye turn from side to side with a luminous look of love and tenderness as he silently invoke god 's blessing on these he people he pass on leave in some doubt heart perhaps the knowledge that amid much that be mistaken and tawdry and superstitious and evil here at all event be one good man immediately behind he come the beadle in vestment and a long flaxen wig ill-combed put on all awry make room with he staff and hit the people if they would not leave off pray and get out of the way then follow the choir -- a living study in evil countenance -- perfunctory careless snuff-blown and ill-shaven with cold hard face like inquisitor all the while the great bell be booming overhead and the whole atmosphere seem to vibrate with sound and emotion it be move and impressive especially for those who think that the almighty be better pleased with abject abasement than a plain common-sense endeavor to do better and will accept a long tale of public penance before the record of simple daily duty honestly perform near the great porch on either side of the bishop 's path be range the seminarist in cassock of black with a dark blue or red hood -- depressing look youth with flaccid face and a unhealthy eye behind they stand a group of friar in rough woolen garment of brown

shall i know that it be you i will kiss you hand when it come through answer marco yes she say rather slowly what a joke but now they be at the gate of the convent school have come a short way and they stand beneath the thick tree until the school come with its usual accompaniment of eager talk like the running of water beneath a low bridge and its babble round the stone juanita slip in among she schoolmate and sor teresa look straight in front of she saw nothing chapter x thisbe it be the custom in the convent school on the torrero-hill to receive visitor on thursday this festivity farther extend to the evening when the girl be allow to walk for a hour in the garden and talk talk it must be remember as a indulgence of the flesh be consider in religious community to be a treat only permit at certain period it be indeed only by tie the tongue that tyranny can hope to live these promenade be not without use the mother superior once say to evasio mon one of the lay director of this school one discover what friendship have be form but the mother superior like many cunning person be wrong for a schoolgirl 's friendship be like the seed of grass blow hither and thither while only one or two of a sowing take root in some hidden corner and grow juanita 's bosom friend of the red hair have recover she lose position she hair be in fact golden again they be walk in the garden at sunset and wait for the clock of san fernando to strike seven juanita have tell she friend of the chocolate -- all soft inside -- which be to come through the hole in the wall and the golden haired girl have confide in juanita that she have never love she as she do at that moment which be perhaps not unnatural the garden of the convent school be large and spread far down the slope of the hill there be many fruit-tree and a few cypress where the stream run there be bunch of wave bamboo and at the lower end where the wall be break there be a little grove of nut tree where the nightingale sing it must be seven come let we go slowly towards the tree say juanita they both look round eagerly there be two nun in the garden gravely walk side by side casting demure and not unkindly glance from time to time towards they gay charge juanita and she friend have as elder girl certain privilege and be allow to walk apart from the rest they be heiress moreover which make a difference even in a convent school that shut the world out with forbid gate juanita bid she friend keep watch and run quickly among the tree the wall be old and overgrown with wild rose and honeysuckle she find the hole and hastily turn back she sleeve thrust she arm through she hand come out through the flower with a inconsequent childish flourish of the finger close by the grave face of marco he be essentially a man of he word and she jerk she hand away from he lip with a gay laugh marco she say the packet must be small or they will not come through i have have they make small on purpose he say but she seem to have forget the chocolate already for she hand do not come back i be try to see through she explain after a moment i can see nothing only something black i see it be you horse you be on horseback

feel that he would certainly come some day and take I away and all this would be over all -- what inquire marco the matter-of-fact at the other side of the wall oh i do not know there be a sort of strain and mystery which i can not define i be not a coward you know but sometimes i be afraid and feel alone in the world there be leon of course but leon be no good be he no he be no good reply marco and marco do you think it be possible to be in the world and yet be save to be quite safe i mean for the next world like sor teresa yes i do do uncle ramon think so yes reply marco what a bother one 's soul be she say with a sigh i be sure mine be i be never allow to think of anything else why ask marco who be a patient searcher after remedy and never discuss matter which could not be ameliorate by immediate action oh because it seem that i be more than usually wicked no one seem to think it possible that i can save my soul unless i go into religion and you do not want to do that no i never want to do it not even when i have be a long time in retreat and we have be happy and quiet here inside the wall and the life they lead here seem so little trouble and one can lay aside that nightmare of the world to come i do not even want it then but when i go into the world like last Sunday marco and see the shop and uncle ramon and you then i hate the thought of it and when i touch the dear old moor 's soft nose just now i feel i could not do it at any cost but that i must go into the world and have dog and horse and see the mountain and enjoy myself and leave the rest to chance and the kindness of the virgin marco he do not answer at once and she thrust she hand through the woodbine again where be you she ask why do you not answer he take she hand and hold it for a

one with she oh it be senor mon he be terrible he see everything go marco and marco do not wait he have the note in he hand -- a small screw of paper all wet with the dew on the woodbine he gallop up the hill close under the wall and put he willing horse straight at the canal the horse leap in and struggle half swimming across to have go any other way would have be to make himself visible from one part or another of the convent grounds and evasio mon be in that garden both sor teresa and evasio mon see juanita emerge from the nut tree and join she friend but neither appear to have notice anything unusual by the way say mon pleasantly i be on foot and can save myself a considerable distance by use the door at the foot of the garden that way be unfrequented answer sor teresa it be scarcely consider desirable at night oh no one will touch I -- a poor man say mon with he pleasant smile have you the key with you sor teresa look on the bunch hang at she girdle no she admit rather reluctantly i will send for it and she call by gesture one of the nun who seem to be look the other way and yet perceive the movement of sor teresa 's hand while the key be be bring mon stand look with he gentle smile over the lower wall of the garden where the pathway cut across the bare field down towards the river would it not be wiser to carry that key with you always in case it should be want as in the present instance he say smoothly i shall do so in future reply sor teresa humbly for the first duty of a nun be obedience and there be no nunnery that be not under the immediate and unquestioned control of some man be he a priest or in some privileged case the pontiff himself at last a second bunch of key be place in sor teresa 's hand and she examine they carefully i be not quite sure she say which be the right one it be so seldom use and she finger they one by one mon glance at she sharply though he lip still smile allow I he say those key among which you be look be the key of cupboard and not of door there be only two door key among they all he take the key and lead the way towards the door hide behind the grove of nut-tree the nightingale be singing as he pass beneath the bough follow by sor teresa juanita hurry up towards the house by another path turn and glance anxiously over she shoulder this i think will be the key say mon affably as he stoop to examine the lock and he be right he open the door pass out and turn to salute sor teresa before he close it gently in she face go with god my sister he say bow with a raise hat and ceremonious smile he wait until he hear sor teresa lock the door from within then he turn to examine the ground in the little lane that skirt the convent wall but on the sun-baked ground the neat light foot of the moor have make no mark he look at the wall but fail to perceive the hole in it for the woodbine and the wild rise tree cover it like a curtain marco have make a round by the summit of the hill and turn to the right rejoin the high road from the casa blanca cross the canal again by that bridge and return to saragossa by the broad avenue know as the monte torrero he rein in he horse beneath the lamp that hang from the tree opposite to the gate of the town call the puerta de santa engracia and unfold the note that juanita have write to he it be scribble in pencil on a half sheet tear from a exercise book dear marco it say thank you most preposterously for the chocolate the next time please put in some almond milagro so love almond and i be very fond of milagro -- you grateful juanita there be a mistake in the spelling chapter xi the royal adventure there be halting-place in the life of most man when for a period the individual desire must give place to some great national need we each live we little story through but at time we find ourselves drag from the narrow way into the great high road where the history of the world blunder to a end which can not even yet be dimly discern when marco ride into saragossa after nightfall he find the street fill by group of anxious man the nerve of civilisation be at a great tension at this time sedan be past pari be already besiege all the french-speaking people think that the end of the world must need be at hand the pope have be deprive of he temporal power the great foundation of the world seem to tremble beneath the onward tread of inexorable history in spain itself no man know what might happen next there seem no depth to which the land of ancient glory might not be doom to descend cuba be in wild revolt thousand of life have be uselessly throw away already the pride of the proudest nation since rome have be humble by the just interference of the united state a kingdom without a king spain have hawk she crown round europe for a throne as for humbler post it be easy enough to find second-rate man who have no special groove nor any capacity to delve one but the first-rate man be one discover nearly always occupy elsewhere they be never wait for something to turn up spain with she three crown in she hand have call at every court in europe she have throw two nation into the greatest war of civilised age she be still look for a king still call hopelessly to the second-rate royalty leopold of hohenzollern would have accept have not france arise to object only to receive a sound thrashing for she pain thus for the second time in the world 's history spain be the means of bring a french empire to the dust ferdinand of portugal a cousin to the queen of england himself a coburg finally decline the honor and spain could not wait there be a certain picturesqueness in prim the usual ornamental general through whose hand spain have pass and repass during the last century he be a hard man and the man of spain unlike the french understand a martinet but spain could not wait she must have a king for the regency be wearisome it be weary of itself like a old man ready to die there be no money in the public coffer the corte be a house of word here eloquence reign supreme and eloquence never yet make a empire half a dozen different party make speech at each other but spain owe to a bless immunity from the cheap newspaper be spare these speech she be tell that castelar be the eloquent orator of the age she look at castelar who be a fat little man with a big moustache and a small forehead and she say : let we have a king prim be better he be a man at all event and not a word-spinner he be from cataluña where they make hard man with clear head and he know he own mind and he also say : let we have a king one cry for don carlo and another for espartero cataluña say there be no living with andalusium aragon want she own king and wish valencium would go hang navarre be all for don carlo and when marco de sarrion ride into saragossa they be call in the street that only a republic be possible now he go home to that grim palace between the cathedral and the ebro and find he father go a brief note tell he that sarrion have go to madrid where a meeting of notable have be hastily summon -- and that he marco must hurry back to torre garda -- that the carlist be up for they king marco return the same night to pampeluna and the next day ride to torre garda by the high road that wind up the valley of the wolf in he own small kingdom be soon make he iron hand feel and these people who would pay no tax to king or regent remain quiet amid the anarchy that reign all over spain thus a week pass and rumor of strange doings at madrid reach the quiet valley all over the country band of malcontent call themselves carlist have rise in obedience to the voice of don carlo ' grandson the son of that don juan who have renounce a hopeless cause to meet a soldier with he cap worn right side foremost be for the time unusual in the city of the north for the army no longer know a master and the spanish soldier have a naïve and simple way of notify this condition by wear the peak of he cap behind marco hear nothing of he father at madrid but surmise that there the talker still hold sway the postal service of spain be still almost mediæval in the principal city the post-office be to-day only open for business during two hour of the twenty-four in the year of the franco-prussian war there be no postal service at all to the disaffected part of the northern province at the end of a week marco rise at three o'clock and ride sixty mile before sunset to keep he word with juanita he do not trust the railway which indeed be in constant danger of be cut by carlist or royalist but perform the distance by road where he meet many friend from navarre and one or two from the valley of the wolf a thousand report a hundred rumor and lie innumerable be on the road also travel hither and thither over spain and marshall prim seem to be the favored god of the moment marco be at he post outside the convent school wall at seven o'clock he hear the clock of san fernando strike eight in these southern latitudes the evening be not much longer in summer than in winter it be quite dark by eight o'clock when marco ride away he be not give to a display of emotion he be a eminently practical man juanita would have come if she could he reflect why could she not keep she appointment he ride to the main gate and ask if he could see sor teresa -- know in the world as dolore sarrion -- for the monastic life be forbid by law at this time in spain and this be no nunnery though as in all such place certain mediaeval folly be carefully foster sor teresa be not here be the reply through the grate then where be she but there be no reply to this plain question have she go to pampeluna the little shutter behind the grate be softly close and marco turn he horse 's head with a quiet smile he face beneath the shadow of he wide hat be still and hard he have ride sixty mile since morning but he sit upright in he saddle this be a man as juanita have observe not to say thing but to do they it be not difficult for he to find out during the next few week that juanita have be send to pampeluna whither also sor teresa have be command to go saragossa have a playful way of sack religious house which the older-world city of navarre would never permit in pampeluna the religious habit be still respect and a friar may carry he shaven head high in the windy street pampeluna it be know might at any moment be in danger of attack but not of bombardment by the carlist who have many friend within the wall juanita be as safe perhaps in pampeluna as anywhere in northern spain so marco go back to torre garda and hold he valley in a quiet grip the harvest be gather in and starvation during the come winter be at all event avoid the first snow come and still marco have no news of juanita he know however that both she and sor teresa be still at pampeluna in the great yellow house in the calle de la dormitaleria nearly opposite the cathedral gate from whence there be constant noiseless traffic of sister and novice hurry across with lowered eye to the sanctuary or back to they duty with the hush of prayer still upon they in November marco receive a letter from he father send by hand all the way from the capital prim have re-establish order he write there be hope of a settlement of political difference a king have be find and if he accept the crown all might yet go well with spain a week later come the news that amedeo of savoy the younger son of that brave old victor emmanuel who face the curse of a pope have be declare king of spain amedeo of savoy duke of aosta be not a second-rate man he be brave honest and a gentleman -- quality to which the throne of spain have be stranger while the bourbon sit there sarrion summon marco to madrid to meet the new king the wise man of all party know that this be the best solution of the hopeless difficulty into which spain have be thrust by the bourbon and the tonguester a few honest politician here and there set aside they own interest in the interest of the country which action be worth recording -- for its rarity but the country in general be gloomy and indifferent spain be slow to learn while france be too quick and she knowledge be always superficial give we at all event a spaniard mutter those who have cry down with liberty when that arch-scoundrel fernando the desire return to he own give we money and we will give you don carlo return the cassocked canvasser of that monarch in a whisper it be evening when marco arrive at madrid and the station like all the train be crowd all who could be travel to madrid to meet the king -- for one reason or another marco be surprise to see he father on the platform among those wait for the train from the capital of the north come say sarrion let we go out by the side door i have the carriage there the street be impassable no one know where to turn there be no head in spain now they assassinate he last night whom ask marco prim they shoot he in he carriage like a dog in a kennel -- five of they -- with gun one have no pride in be a spaniard now marco follow he father through the crowd without reply there seem nothing indeed to be say nothing to be add to the simple observation that it be a humiliation for a man to have to admit in these day that he be a spaniard he be a catalonian to the last say sarrion when they be seat in they carnage he walk die up he own stair so that he wife might be spare the sight of see he carry in stubborn and brave one of the best man we have see and the king the king land at carthagena to-day -- land with he life in he hand he carry it in he hand wherever he go day and night in spain he and he wife without prim he can not hope to stand but he will try we must do what we can the carriage be make its careful way across the puerta del sol which have be clear by grape-shot more than once in sarrion 's recollection it look now as if only artillery could set order there viva el rey viva don carlo a loafer shout and wave he hat in sarrion 's grim and smile face i do not understand he say to marco as they pass on why the good god give the bourbon so many chance i can not understand why the bourbon never take they answer marco for he be not a push man but one of those patient waiter on opportunity who appear at length quietly at the top and look down with thoughtful eye at those who struggle below the sweat and strife of some career must tarnish the brightest lustre father and son drive together to the apartment in a street high above the town near the church of san josé where the sarrion live when in madrid and there sarrion give marco further detail of that strange adventure which amedeo of spain be about to begin in return marco vouchsafe a brief account of affair in the valley of the wolf he never have much to say and even in these stir time tell of a fine harvest of that brilliant weather which mark the year of the napoleonic downfall and juanita inquire sarrion at length be at pampeluna they can not get she away from there without my know it she be well and happy you have not write to she no answer marco we must remember say sarrion with a nod of approval that we be deal with the cleverest man in the world and the greediest -- and the hardest press add marco but you have not write to she no nor hear from she i have a note from she at saragossa before they move she to pampeluna answer marco with a smile it be rather badly spell and ask sarrion marco do not reply to this comprehensive interrogation you have come to some decision sarrion suggest i have come to the usual decision that you be quite right in you suspicion they want that money and they intend to get it by force she into religion and induce she to sign the usual testament make by nun confer all they earthly goods upon the order into which they be admit then sarrion go back to he original question and as soon as we see sign of they be likely to succeed i propose to see juanita again you can do it despite they yes i can do it and i shall explain the position to she -- that she bad fortune have give she choice of two evil that be one way of put it it be the only honest way sarrion shrug he shoulder my friend he say i do not think that love and honesty be much in sympathy chapter xii in a strong city amedeo as the world know land at carthagena to be meet by the news that prim be dead the man who have summon he hither to assume the crown he who alone in all spain have the power and the will to maintain order in the riven kingdom have himself be summon to appear before a higher throne there will be no republic in spain while i live prim have often say and prim be dead every dog have he day a deputy sneeringly observe to the marshall himself a few hour before he be shoot in response to prim 's plain-spoken intention of striking with a heavy hand all those who should manifest opposition to the duke of aosta so amedeo of spain ride into he capital one snowy day in January 1871 carry high he head and look down with courageous intelligent eye upon the face of the people who refuse to cheer he as upon a sea of hidden rock through which he must need steer he hazardous way without a pilot before receive the living he visit the dead man who may be assume to have be honest in he intention as he undoubtedly prove himself to be brave in action the best man that spain produce in she time of trouble among the first to bow before the king be the two sarrion and as they return into a anteroom they come face to face with evasio mon wait he turn there ah say sarrion who do not seem to see the hand that mon have half extended i do not know that you be a courtier i be not reply mon but i be here to see whether i be too old to learn he turn towards marco with he pleasant smile but do not attempt the extended hand here i shall take a lesson from marco he say marco make no reply but pass on and mon turn on he heel look after he with a sudden misgiving like one who hear the sound of a distant drum judge from the person in he immediate vicinity we friend have money in he pocket say sarrion as they descend those palace stair which have stream with blood a few year earlier or promise in he mouth be that general pacheco who turn away as we come yes answer sarrion why do you ask i have hear that he be to receive a command in the army of the north sarrion make a grimace uncomplimentary to that very smart soldier general pacheco and at the foot of the stair he stop to speak to a friend he speak in french and name the man by he baptismal name for this be a frenchman name deulin a person of mystery suppose to be in the diplomatic service in some indefinite position with he be a englishman who greet marco as a friend what do you make of all this ask sarrion address himself to the englishman who however rather cleverly pass the question on to the older man with a slow british gesture i make of it -- that they only want a little money to make don carlo king say deulin what be evasio mon do in madrid asked sarrion raise the money or spending it reply the frenchman with a shrug of the shoulder as if it be no business of he they pass up-stair together but have not go far when marco say the englishman 's name without raise he voice cartoner he turn and marco run up three step to meet he who be the prelate with the face of a fox-terrier he ask he represent the vatican be he with mon marco nod a affirmative and turn descend the stair i have better get back to pampeluna he say to he father the train for the northern frontier leave madrid in the evening and at this time no man know who might be the next to take a ticket for france the sarrion make they preparation to depart the same evening and arrive early secure a compartment to themselves marco however do not take he seat but stand on the platform look towards the gate through which the passenger must come be you look for some one ask sarrion general pacheco be the reply and then after a pause here he come he be attend by three aide-de-camp and a squadron of orderly he carry he head very high but he foot be on the ground comment sarrion who be roll himself a cigarette shall we invite he to come with we yes general pacheco be one of those soldier of the fifty who owe they success to a handsome face he wear a huge moustache curl to he eye and have the air of a invincible conqueror -- of heart he have dine he be go to take up he new command in the north he walk as the french say on air and he certainly swagger in he gait on that thin base he be hardly surprise to see the count sarrion one of the exclusive who have never accept queen isabellum 's new military aristocracy with he hat in one hand and the other extended towards he on the platform await he arrival you will travel with we say sarrion and the general accept look round to see that he attendant be duly impressed i find he say seat himself and accept a cigarette from sarrion that each new success in life bring I new friend make it necessary to abandon the old one suggest sarrion no no laugh the general with a cackle and a patronising hand uphold against the mere thought one only add to the number as one go on just as one add to a little purse against the change of fortune eh and he look from one to the other still brown face with a cunning twinkle sarrion be a man of the world he know that this expansiveness would not last it would probably give way to melancholy or somnolence in the course of half a hour these thing be a matter of the digestion and many vow of friendship be make by perfectly sober person who have dine with a sincerity which pass off next morning the milk of human kindness should be allow to stand overnight in order to prove its quality ah say sarrion you speak from a happy experience no no protest the other gravely it be a small thing -- a mere bagatelle in the french rente -- but one see one 's opportunity one see one 's opportunity he make a gesture with the two finger that hold he cigarette which seem to be a warn to the sarrion not to make any mistake as to the shrewdness of he who speak to they speak for yourself say sarrion with a laugh i do insist the other lean forward i speak essentially for myself one do not mind admit it to a man like yourself all the world know that you be a carlist at heart do it yes -- and you must take comfort i think you be on the right road now i hope we be i be sure of it money that be the only way to go to the right people with money in both hand he sit back and look at the sarrion with he little cunning eye twinkle beneath he gold lace cap the expansiveness would not last much longer sarrion 's dark glance be diagnose the man with a deadly skill the thing he say slowly be to strike while the iron be hot he speak in the symbolic way of a people much give to proverbial wisdom and the dark use of allegory he might have mean much or nothing as it happen the count de sarrion mean nothing for he know nothing that be what i say give I a couple of month i want no more no say sarrion look at he with much admiration be that so two month -- and the sum of money i name ah in two month reflect sarrion rome you know be not build in a day the general give he cackle laugh aha he cry i see that you know all about it you give I my cue -- the word rome eh to see how much i know and the great soldier-statesman lean back in he seat again well pleased with himself i understand he say that it amount to this the sanction of the vatican be require to the remittance of the usual novitiate in the case of a young person who be in a great hurry to take the veil once that be obtain the money be set at liberty and all go merrily there be enough to -- well let we say -- to convince my whole army corps and my humble self and the vatican will of course consent i fancy that be how it stand he tap he pocket as if the golden piecès de conviction be already there and close he eye like any common

and be subject to great fall of snow in its brief winter season sarrion walk to the calle de la dormitaleria a little street run parallel with the city wall eastward from the cathedral gate there he learn that sor teresa be out the lay-sister fear that he could not see juanita de mogente she be in class : it be against the rule sarrion insist the lay-sister go to make inquiry it be not in she province but she know the rule she do not return and in she place come father muro the spiritual adviser of the school juanita 's own confessor he be a stout man whose face would have be pleasant have it follow the line that nature have lay down but there be something amiss with father muro -- the usual lack of naturalness in those who lead a life that be against nature father muro be afraid that sarrion could not see juanita it be not within he province but he know that it be against the rule then he remember that he have see a letter address to the count de sarrion it be lie on the table at the refectory door where letter intend for the post be usually place it be doubtless from juanita he would fetch it sarrion take the letter and read it with a pleasant smile on he face while father

they in he pocket sarrion smoking a cigarette by the stove glance at he son and know that juanita 's fate be fix for good or ill for happiness or misery she be destine to marry marco de sarrion if the whole church of rome should rise up and curse he soul and hers for the deed sarrion appear to have no suggestion to make he continue to smoke reflectively while he warm himself at the stove he be wise enough to perceive that he must now be the secondary part to possess power and to resist the temptation to use it be the task of king to quietly relinquish the tiller of a younger life be a lesson that gray hair have to learn i think say marco at length that we must see leon he be she guardian we will give he a last chance will you warn he inquire sarrion yes reply marco rise he may be here in pampeluna i think it likely that he be they be hard press if they get the dispensation from rome they will hurry event they will try to rush juanita into religion at once and leon 's presence be indispensable they be probably ready and only await the permission of the vatican they be all here in pampeluna which be better than saragossa for such work -- better than any city in spain they probably have leon wait here to give he formal consent when require then let we go and find out say sarrion the plaza de la constitucion be the center of the town and beneath its colonnade be the office of the countless diligence that connect the smaller town of navarre with the capital which continue to run even in time of war to such place as irun jaca and even estellum where the carlist cause be openly espouse marco make the round of the diligence office he have it seem a hundred friend among the thick-set muleteer in breeches stocking and spotless shirt who look at he with keen dust-laden eye from beneath the shade of they great beret the driver of the diligence which be now arrive from the mountain village pause in they work of unload they vehicle to give he the latest news they be soft speak person with a repress manner which characterise both man and woman of they ancient race and they speak to he in basque some free they hand from the fold of the long blanket which each wear accord to he fancy to shake hand with he other nod curtly man from the valley of ebro muttered buenas -- the curt salutation of aragon the taciturn marco seem to know they by they baptismal name he even know they horse by name also and ask after each while perro affable alike with rich and poor exchange the time of day with travel dog all lean and dusty from the road who limp on sore foot and probably tell he of the snow while they lay in the sun and lick they paw like he master he be not proud but take a wide view of life so that all variety of it come within he field of vision then master and dog take a walk down the calle del pozo blanco where the saddle and harness-maker congregate where muleteer must come to buy those gay saddle-bag which so soon lose they bright color in the glaring sun where the guardia civile step in to buy they paste and pipe-clay where the great man 's groom may chat with the teamster from the mountain while both be wait on the saddler 's needle finally marco pass through the wide calle de san ignacio to the drawbridge across the double fosse where the rope-maker be always at work walk backwards with a ever decrease bundle of hemp at they waist and one eye cock upward towards the roadway so that they know all who come and go better even than the sentry at the gate for the sentry be change three or four time a day while the rope-maker go on forever just beyond the second line of fortification be a halting-place by a low wall where the country woman -lrb- whom one may meet ride in the plain -- dignified cloaked and hooded figure startlingly suggestive of a sacred picture -rrb- on mule or donkey stop to descend from they perch between the saddle-bag or pannier it be a sort of al fresco cloakroom where these lady repair the ravages of wind or storm where they assemble in the evening to pack they purchase on they beast of burden and finally climb to the top of all themselves for it be not etiquette to ride in or out of the gate upon one 's wares and a breach of this unwritten law would immediately arouse the suspicion of the courteous toll-officer who finger delicately with a tobacco-stained hand the bundle and basket submit to he inspection here also marco have friend and be able to tell the latest news from cuba where some have husband son or lover a so-called volunteer to put down the hopeless rebellion attract to a miserable death by the forty-pound bounty pay by government there be old woman who chaff he and young one with fine-cut classic feature and crinkled hair who lay in wait for a glance from he grave eye it be a pity there be not more like you señor conde say one old peasant for it be you that keep the man from fight among themselves and make they tend the sheep or take in the crop carlist or royalist the land come before either say i for it be the land that feed the child add another who carry a pair of small espradrilla in she apron pocket marco go back to he father with such

from the summit of the steep river bank almost to the deep embrasure of the wall marco turn in he saddle and look up at these as they ride down the slope sarrion see the action and glance at marco and then at the towering wall but he make no comment and ask no question there be two old monastery on the villaba road huge building within a high wall each own a chapel which stand apart from the dwelling-house it be a known fact that the carlist have never threaten these building which stand far outside the town it be also a fact that the range of they have be carefully measure by the artillery officer and the great gun on the city wall be at this time train on the isolate building to batter they to the ground at the first sign of treachery marco pull the bell-rope swinging in the wind outside the great door of the monastery while sarrion tie the horse to a post the door be open by a stout monk whose face fall when he perceive two layman in ride costume humbler person as a rule ring this bell the marquis de mogente be here say marco and the monk spread out he hand in a gesture of denial whoever be here he say be in retreat one do not disturb the devout he make a movement to

shaven head towards a long passage see through the open door marco go in he spur heel clank loudly in the half-empty house he knock at the door of the third cell on the right for in he way he be a devout person and wish to disturb no man at he prayer the door be open by leon himself who start back when he see who have knock marco go into the room which be small and bare and whitewashed and close the door behind he a few religious emblem be on the wall above the narrow bed a couple of book lay on the table one be open it be a very old edition of à kempis leon de mogente 's religion be of the sort that feel itself able to learn more from a old edition than a new one there be many in these day of cheap imitation of the mediaeval who feel the same leon sit down on the plain wooden bench and lay he hand on the open book he look with weak eye at marco and wait for he to speak marco oblige he at once i have come to see you about juanita he say have you give you consent to she take the veil leon reflect he have the air of a man who have be carefully teach a part lose he place at the first cue what business be it of yours he ask rather hesitatingly at length none leon make a hopeless gesture of the hand and look at he book with a face of distress and embarrassment marco be sorry for he he be strong and it be the strong who be quickest to detect pathos will you answer I he ask and leon shake he head i have come here to warn you say marco not unkindly i know that juanita have inherit a fortune from she father i know that the carlist cause be fall for want of money i know that the jesuit will get the money if they can because don carlo be they last chance in they last stronghold in europe they will get juanita 's money if they can -- and they can only do it by force juanita into religion and i have come to warn you that i shall prevent they leon look at marco and gulp something down in he throat he be not afraid of marco but he be in terror of some one or of something else marco study the white face the shrink hunt eye with the quiet persistence learn from watch nature be you a jesuit he ask bluntly but leon only draw in a gasp breath and make no answer then marco go out and close the door behind he chapter xiv in the cloister marco and sarrion go back to pampeluna in the dusk of the winter evening each meditate over that which they have see and hear leon have become a jesuit and juanita be worse -- infinitely worse than alone in the world marco need no tell of all that lay behind leon 's scared silence for he father have bring he up in a atmosphere of plain language and wide view of mankind sarnon himself have see navarre ruin its man sacrifice its woman make miserable by a war which have last intermittently for thirty year he have see the simple basque who have no means of verify that which they priest tell they fight desperately and continuously for a lie the carlist war have always be the war of ignorance and deceit against enlightenment and the advance of think it be needless to say upon which side the cassock have range itself the basque be promise they liberty they should be allow to live as they have always live practically a republic if they only succeed in force a absolute monarchy on the rest of spain the jesuit make this promise the society find itself in the position that no promise must be allow to stick in the throat sarrion like all who know they strange story be ready enough to recognize the fact that the jesuit body must be divide into two part of head and heart the heart have do the best work that missionary have yet accomplish the head have ruin half europe it be the political jesuit who have earn sarrion 's deadly hatred the political jesuit have moreover a record in history which have only in part be make manifest william the silent be assassinate by a emissary of the jesuit maurice of orange he son almost meet the same fate and the would-be murderer confess three jesuit be hang for attempt the life of elizabeth queen of england and later another parry be draw and quarter two year later another be execute for participate in a attempt on the queen 's life and at later period four

doctrine the brother of the congregation of the holy virgin the father of the faith the order of st vincent de paul -- be jesuit how far they belong to the heart and not to the head be a detail only know to themselves those who have follow the contemporary history of france may draw they own conclusion from the trial of the case of the assumptionist father lo mismo perro con nuevo cuello -- say sarrion to any who seek to convince he that spain owe she downfall to other cause and that the jesuit be no longer what they have be the same dog with new collar and he hold that they be not a progressive but a retrogressive society that they statute still hold good it be allowable to take a oath without intend to keep it when one have good grounds for so act in the case of one unjustifiably make a attack on you honor when you can not otherwise defend yourself than by impeach the integrity of the person insulting you it be quite allowable to do so in order to cut short calumny most quickly one may cause the death of the calumniator but as secretly as possible to avoid observation it be absolutely allowable to kill a man whenever the general welfare or proper security demand it if any man have commit a crime st liguorus and other jesuit writer hold that he may swear to a civil authority that he be innocent of it provide that he have already confess it to he spiritual father and receive absolution it be they say no longer on he conscience pray say the founder of the society as if everything depend on prayer and act as if everything depend on action of what be you think sarrion ask suddenly when they have ride almost to the city gate in silence i be wonder what juanita will say some day when she know and understand everything i be not wonder what juanita will say confess sarrion with a laugh but what evasio mon will do for sarrion persist in take a optimistic view of juanita and that which must supervene when she have grow into understanding and knowledge marco go back to the hotel he have many arrangement to make sarrion ride to the large house in the calle de la dormitaleria where the school of the sister of the true faith be located to

very materially one-third of a human span of life namely bed in any town of france germany or holland the curious need not seek long for the mattress-maker he be usually to be find in some open space

people good housewife moreover stand near he with they knit to see that he do it well and put back within the cover all the wool that he take out in these backward country the domestic mattress be remake once a year if not oftener in we great land there be a considerable vagueness as to the period allow to a mattress to form itself into lump and to accumulate dust or germ moreover there be thousand of exemplary housekeeper who throw up the eye of horror to they whitewashed ceiling at the thought of a foreign person 's personal habit who do not know what be inside they mattress and never think of look to see from year 's end to year 's end in spain a country rarely visit by those person who pride themselves upon be particular the mattress-maker be a much more necessary factor in domestic life than be the sweep or the plumber in northern land no palace be too royal for he no cottage be too humble to employ he he be moreover the only man allow inside a nunnery which be the reason why he find himself bring into prominence now he be usually a thin lithe man somewhat of the figure of those northerner who supply the bull-ring with banderilléros he arrive in the early morning with a sheathe knife at he waist a packet of cigarette in he jacket pocket and two light stick under he arm all he ask be a courtyard and the sunshine that heaven give he in a moment he deftly cut the stitch of the mattress and lay bare the wool which he never touch with he finger the longer stick in he right hand describe great circle in the air and descend with the whistle of a sword upon the wool of which it pick up a small handful then the shorter stick come into play pick the wool from the longer throw it into the air beat it this way and that toss it and catch it until every fiber be clear when the fluffy mass be deftly cast aside all the while through the beating of the wool the two stick beat against each other play a distinct air and each mattress-maker have he own hand down from he forefather end with a whole chromatic scale as the shorter stick swoop up the length of the longer to sweep away the linger wool thus the whole mattress be transfer from a sodden heap to a high and fluffy mountain of card wool all baked by the heat of the sun the man have a hundred attitude full of grace he work with a skill which be a conscious pleasure a pleasure unknown to those who have never have opportunity of acquire a manual craft or appreciate the wondrous power that god have put into human limb he have complete control over he two thin stick can pick up with they a single strand of wool or half a mattress he can throw aside a pin that lurk in a ball of wool or kill a fly that settle on he work without stain the snowy mass and all the while from the moment that the mattress be open till the heap be complete the two stick never cease play they thin and woody air so that any within hearing may know that the colchonero be at work when the mattress case be empty he pause to wipe he brow -lrb- for he must need work in the sun -rrb- and smoke a cigarette in the shade it be then that he gossip in a southern land such a worker as this must always have a audience and the child hail with delight the come of the mattress-maker at the convent school of the sister of the true faith he service be require once a fortnight for there be many bed but he come be none the less exciting for its frequency he be the only man allow inside the door father muro be it seem not count as a man and in truth a priest be often find to possess many quality which be essentially small and feminine the mattress-maker of pampeluna be a thin man with a ropy neck and keen black eye that flash hither and thither through the mist of wool and dust in which he work he be consider so essentially a domestic and harmless person that he be permit to go where he list in the house and high-walled garden for nun have a profound distrust of man as a mass and a confide faith in the few individual with whom they have to deal the girl be allow to watch the colchonero at he work more especially the elder girl such as juanita de mogente and she friend milagro of the red-gold hair juanita watch he so closely one spring afternoon that the keen black eye keep return to she face at each round of the long whistle stick the other girl grow tired of the sight and move away to another part of the garden where the sun be warmer and the violet already in bloom but juanita linger she do not know that this be one of marco ' friend -- that in the summer this colchonero take the road with he packet of cigarette and two stick and wander from village to village in the mountain beat the mattress of the people and see the wondrous work of god as these be only see by such as live all day and sleep all night beneath the open sky quite suddenly the polish stick cease play loudly and drop they tone to pianissimo so that if juanita be to speak she could be hear hombre she say do you know marco de sarrion i know the chapel of we lady of the shadow he answer glance at she through a mist of wool will you give he a letter fold it small and throw it in the wool he say and immediately the stick beat loudly again juanita 's hand be already in she pocket seek she purse no no he say i be too much caballero to take money from a lady she walk away drop as she pass the uncarded heap a fold paper which be lose amid the fluff the stick fly this way and that and the twisted note shoot up into the air with a bunch of wool which fall across the two stick and be presently cast aside upon the card heap and peeping eye from the bar window of the convent school see nothing marco and he father have return to saragossa they be people of influence in that city and saragossa strange to say have a desire to maintain law and order within its wall it be unlike barcelona which be at all time republican and frankly turbulent its other neighbor pampeluna remain to this day clerical and mysterious it be the city of the lose cause carlism and the church the sarrion be not look upon with a kindly eye within the wall of the northern fortress and it be much too small a town for any to pass unobserved in its street there be work to do in saragossa in pampeluna there be only suspicion to arouse juanita be in sor teresa 's care and could scarcely come to harm hold in she hand as she do a strong card to be play on emergency all spain seem to be pause breathlessly the murder of prim have shake the land like a earthquake the king have already make enemy he have no enthusiasm he new subject would have prefer a few mistake to this cautious pause they be a people vaguely craving for liberty before they have cast off the habit of servitude no latin race will ever evolve a great republic for it must be rule but spain be already talk of democracy and the new king have scarcely seat himself on the throne we can do nothing say sarrion but try to keep order in we own small corner of this bear-garden so he remain at saragossa and throw open he great house there while marco pass to and fro into navarre up the valley of the wolf to torre garda where evasio mon might be no man know paris have fall the commune be rife france be wallow in the deepest degradation and in bayonne the carlist plotter scheme without let or hindrance so long as he be away we need not be uneasy about juanita say marco he can not return to saragossa without my hearing of it and one evening a casual teamster from the north whose great two-wheeled cart as high as a house and as long as a locomotive stand in the dusty road outside the posada de los reye drop in cigarette in mouth to the palacio sarrion in spain a messenger deliver neither message nor letter to a servant a survival of mediaeval habit permit the humblest to seek the presence of the great at any time of day the sarrion have just finish dinner and still sit in the vast dining-room the wall of which glitter with arm and loom darkly with great portrait of the spanish school of paint the teamster be not abashed it be a time of war and war be a great leveler of social scale he have bring he load through a disturbed country he be a guipuzcoan -- as good as any man it be about the señor mon he say you wish to hear of he he return to pampeluna two day ago the teamster thank they excellency but he could not accept

worker have that which be consider a better manner he know he place and that knowledge have affect he manhood the letter he give to marco bear no address it be seal however in red wax which have the impress of nature 's seal a man 's thumb -- unique and not to be counterfeit from the envelope marco take a twisted paper not innocent of card wool we be go back to saragossa juanita write i have refuse to go into religion but they say it be too late that i can not draw back now be this true marco pass the note across to he father i wish this be barcelona he say with a sudden gleam in he grave eye why because then we could pull the school down about they ear and take juanita away sarrion smile or get shoot mysteriously from a window while attempt it he say no we fight with finer weapon than that mon have get he dispensation from rome a few hour too late he hand back the note and they sit in silence for a long time in the huge dimly-lighted room success in life rest upon one small gift -- the secret of the entry into another man 's mind to discover what be pass there the greatest general the world have know owe he success by he own admission to he power of guess correctly what the enemy would do next many can guess but few guess right she have not date she letter say sarrion at length no but it be write on Thursday that be the day that the colchonero go to the calle de la dormitaleria he draw a strand of wool from the envelope and show it to sarrion and the day that mon return to pampeluna he will be prompt to act he always have be that be what make he different from other man prompt and restless sarrion glance across the table as he speak at the face of he son who be also a prompt man but withal restful as if possess a reserve upon which to draw in emergency for the restless and the uneasy be those who have all they force in the field do not sit up for I say marco rise he stand and thoughtfully empty he glass i shall change my clothes he say and go out there

roar down the bed of the ebro for the spring be at hand with its wild march solano and hard blue sky there be no moon but marco have good eye and those whom he seek be man who after a long siesta travel or work during half the night the dust be astir on the paseo del ebro where it lie four inch deep on the broad space in front of the posada de los reye where the cart stand there be cart here now with dim old-fashioned lantern and long team of mule wait patiently to be relieve of they massive collar the first man he meet tell he that evasio mon must have arrive in saragossa at sunset for he have pass he on the road go at a good pace on horseback from another he hear the rumor that the carlist have tear up the line between pampeluna and castéjon go to the station this informant add

carlist have drive the outpost back from the mouth of the valley of the wolf which be now cut off he think i be at torre garda reflect marco as he return to the city fight the wind on the bridge chance favor he for a man with tired horse stop he carriage to inquire if that be the count marco de sarrion he have bring juanita to saragossa in he carriage not with sor teresa but with the mother superior of the school and two other pupil he have be dismiss at the plaza de la constitucion and the lady have take another carriage he have not hear the address give to the driver by daylight marco return to the palacio sarrion without have discover the driver of the second carriage or the whereabouts of juanita in saragossa but he have learn that a carriage have be order by telegraph from a station on the pampeluna line to be at alagon at four o'clock in the morning he learn also that telegraphic communication between pampeluna and saragossa be interrupt the carlist again chapter xvii at the inn of the two tree at dawn the next morning marco and sarrion ride out of the city towards alagón by the great high road many inch deep in dust which have always be the main artery of the capital of aragon the pace be leisurely for the carriage they be go to meet have be time to leave alagón fifteen mile away at four o'clock there be but one road they could scarcely miss it it be seven o'clock when they halt at a roadside inn sarrion quit the saddle and go indoors to order coffee while marco sit on he tall black horse scanning the road in front of he the valley of the ebro be flat here with bare brown hill rise on either side like a gigantic mud-fence string of cart be make they way towards saragossa far away marco could perceive a recurrent break in the dusty line a cart or carriage travel at a greater than the ordinary market pace be make its laborious way past the heavier traffic it come at length within clearer sight a carriage all white with dust and a pair of skinny aragonese horse such as may be hire on the road the driver seem to recognize marco for he smile and raise he hand to he hat as he draw up at the inn a recognize halting-place before the last stage of the journey marco catch sight of a white cap inside the carriage he lean down on he horse 's neck and perceive sor teresa who have not see he look out of the carriage window towards the inn he ride round to the other door and drop out of the saddle then he turn the handle and open the door but sor teresa have no intention of descend she lean forward to say as much and recognize she nephew you she exclaim and she pale face flush suddenly she have be a nun for many year and be no doubt a conscientious one but she have never yet learn to remove all she love from earth to fix it on heaven yes how do you know that i should be here i guess it answer marco who be always practical you will like some coffee it be order come in and warm yourself while the horse rest he lead the way towards the inn what do you say he ask turn on the threshold for he have hear she mutter something i say ` thank god ' what for for you brain my dear she answer and you strong heart sarrion be make up the fire when they enter the room -- lithe and young in he ride costume -- and he turn smile to meet she she kiss he gravely there be always something unexplained between these two something to be say which make they both silent there be the coffee say marco on the table we have no time to spare marco mean explain sarrion significantly that we have no time to waste i think he be right say sor teresa then if that be the case let we at least speak plainly say sarrion with a due regard he allow with a shrug of the shoulder to you vow and you position and all that we must not embroil you with you confessor nor juanita with hers you need not think of that so far as juanita be concern say sor teresa it be i who have choose she confessor where be she ask marco she be here in saragossa why ask the man of few word i do not know where be she in saragossa i do not know i have not see she for a fortnight i only learn by accident yesterday afternoon that she have be bring to saragossa with some other girl who have be postulant for six month and be about to become novice but juanita be not a postulant say sarrion with a laugh she may have be tell to consider herself one but no one have a right to do that say sarrion pleasantly no and even if she be a novice she could draw back there be some order reply sor teresa slowly stir she coffee which make it a matter of pride never to lose a novice excuse my pertinacity say sarrion i know that you prefer generality to anything of a personal nature but do juanita wish to go into religion as much she pause or as little suggest marco who be look out of the window as many who have enter that life sor teresa complete the sentence without notice marco ' interruption and these period of probation say sarrion revert to those generality which form the language of the cloister may they be dispense with anything can be dispense with -- by a dispensation be the reply sarrion laugh and with a easy tact change the subject which could scarcely be a pleasant one between a profess nun and two man know all over spain as leader in that party which be erroneously call anti-clerical because it hold that the church should not have the dominant voice in politics have you see we friend evasio mon lately he ask yes -- he be on the road behind I behind you i understand that he leave pampeluna yesterday for saragossa say sarrion yes -- but i hear at alagón that he be delay on the road at the castejon side of alagón -- a accident to he carriage -- a broken wheel ah say sarrion sympathetically he glance at marco who be look out of the window with a thoughtful smile you yourself have have a hurry journey from pampeluna say sarrion to he sister i hear the railway line be break by the carlist the damage be be repair reply sor teresa my journey be not a pleasant one but that be of no importance since i have arrive why do you come ask marco bluntly he be a plain-dealer in thought and word if sor teresa should embroil herself with she confessor as sarrion have gracefully put it by answer he question that be she affair i come to prevent if i could a great mistake you mean that juanita be quite unfitted for the life into which for the sake of he money she be be force or trick force have fail reply sor teresa juanita have spirit she laugh in the face of force and refuse absolutely and mutter sarrion one may presume that subtler means be use answer the nun you mean trickery suggest marco you mean that she own word be twist into another meaning that she be commit or convict out of she own lip that she be bring to saragossa by trickery and that by trickery she will be drag unwittingly into religion -- you need not shake you head i be say nothing against the church i be a good catholic it be a question of politics and in politics you must fight with the weapon that the adversary select we be only politician my dear aunt be that all say sor teresa look at he with she deep eye which have see the world before they see heaven thing see leave they trace behind the eye marco make no answer but turn away and look out of the window again it be a question of mutual accommodation put in sarrion in he lighter voice sometimes the church make use of politics and at another time it be politics make use of the church and each sully the other on each occasion we shall not let juanita go into religion the church may want she and may think that it be for she happiness but we also have we opinion on that point we also he break off with a laugh and throw out he hand in a gesture of deprecation for sor teresa have place she two hand over that part of she cap which conceal she ear i can hear nothing she say i can hear nothing she remove she hand and sit sip she coffee in silence marco be stand near the window he could see the white road stretch out across the plain for mile what do you intend to do on you arrival in saragossa if you have not meet we he ask i should have go to the casa sarrion to warn you father or yourself that juanita have be take from my control and that i do not know where she be and then inquire marco and then i should have go to torrero she answer with a smile at he persistence where i intend to go now then i shall learn at what hour and in which chapel the ceremony be to take place to-day the ceremony in which juanita have be order to take part as a spectator only sor toresa nod she head it can not well take place without you no she answer neither can it take place without evasio mon one of the novice be he niece and where possible the near relation be necessarily present yes -- i know say marco he have apparently study the subject somewhat carefully and evasio mon be delay on the road which give we a little more time to mature we plan sor teresa say nothing but glance towards marco who be watch the road you need not be anxious dolore say sarrion cheerfully between politician these matter settle themselves quietly enough in spain i cease to be anxious reply sor teresa from the moment that i see marco in the inn yard it be marco who speak next after a short silence you horse be ready if you be rest he say we shall return to saragossa by a shorter route and i again assure you add sor teresa 's brother that there be no need for anxiety we shall arrange this matter quite quietly with evasio mon we shall take juanita away from you school to-day we cousin peligro be already at the casa sarrion wait she arrival marco have arrange these matter he make a gesture of the hand presumably symbolic of marco ' plan for it be short and sharp there will be nothing for you to do say marco from the window waste no time i see a carriage some mile away so sor teresa go on she journey she dealings with man have be confine to member of that sex who go about they purpose in a indirect and roundabout way speaking in generality attentive to insignificant detail possess that smaller sense of proportion which be a feminine fail and which must always make a tangled jumble of those public affair in which woman and priest may play a part she have come into actual touch in this little room of a obscure inn with a force which seem to walk calmly on its way over the petty tyranny that rule she daily life which seem to fear no man neither god as represent by man but shape for itself a deity large-minded and manly who consider the broad inner purpose rather than petty detail of outward observance the sarrion return to they gloomy house on the paseo del ebro and there await the information which sor teresa alone could give they they have not wait long before the driver of she carriage who have seem to recognize marco on the road from alagón bring a note : it be at number five calle de la merced but they will await e m and the other carriage that be on the road marco ask the man the carriage which bring the caballero -- have it arrive in saragossa not yet answer the driver i have hear from one who pass they on the road that they have a second mishap just after leave the inn of the two tree where they excellency take coffee -- a little mishap this one which will only delay they a hour or less he have no luck that caballero the man look quite gravely at marco who return the glance as solemnly for they be as brother these two son of that same mother nature with whom they love to deal fight she strong wind she heat she cold she dust and river read she thousand and one secret of the cloud of night and dawn which townsman never know and never even suspect they have a silent contempt for the small subtlety of a man 's mind and be half ashamed of the business on which they be now engage as the man withdraw in obedience to marco ' salutation go with god the clock strike twelve come say marco to he father we must go to number five calle de la merced do you know the house yes it be one of the many in saragossa that stand empty or be suppose to stand empty it be a old religious house which be sack in the disturbance of christina 's reign he walk to the window as he speak and look out the house have be throw open for the first time for many year and they now occupy one of the larger room look across the garden to the ebro ah you have order the carriage he say see the brougham standing at the door and the rusty gate throw open give egress to the paseo del ebro yes answer marco in a odd and restrained voice to bring juanita back chapter xviii the maker of history number five calle de la merced be to this day a empty house like many in saragossa present to the passer-by a dusty stone face and huge bar window over which the spider have draw they filmy curtain for one reason or another there be many empty house in the larger city of spain and many historical name have pass away with they have fade into oblivion some religious order and not a few kindred brotherhood number five calle de la merced have its history like the rest of the monastery and the rounded cobblestone of the large courtyard bear to-day a black stain where the curious inquirer will be tell the caretaker of the empty house have be in the habit of cook they bread on a brazier of charcoal fan into glow with a palm leaf scatter the ash but the true story of the black stain be in reality quite otherwise for it be here that the infuriate people burn the chapel furniture when the monastery of saragossa be sack the sarrion leave they carriage at the corner of the calle de la merced in the shadow of a tall house for the sun be already strong at midday though the snow lay on the hill round torre garda they find the house closely bar the dust and the cobweb be undisturbed on the huge window the house be as empty as it have be these forty year marco try the door which resist he strength like a wall it be a true monastic door with no crack through which even a fly could pass that house stand empty say a old woman who pass by it have stand empty since i be a girl it be accurse they kill the good father there sarrion thank she and walk on marco be examine the dust on the road out of the corner of he eye two carriage have stop here he say at this small door which look as if it belong to the next house ah answer sarrion that be a old trick i have see door like that before there be several in the calle san gregorio sit on my balcony in the casa sarrion i have see a man go into one house and look out of the window of the next a minute later mon have not arrive say marco with he eye on the road he have the carriage of one-eyed pedro whose near horse have a circular shoe but we must not wait for he the risk would be too great they may dispense with he presence no answer marco thoughtfully look at the smaller door which seem to belong to the next house we must not wait as he speak a carriage appear at the farther end of the calle de la merced which be a straight and narrow street here they come he add and draw he father into a doorway across the street it be indeed the carriage of the man know as one-eyed pedro a victim to the dust of aragon and the near horse leave a circular mark with its hind foot on the road evasio mon descend from the carriage and pay the man give it would seem a liberal propina for the one-eyed pedro expectorate on the coin before put it into he pocket mon tap on the door with the stick he always carry it be instantly open to give he admittance and close as quickly behind he ah whisper sarrion with a smile on he keen face i have hear they knock like that on the door in the calle san gregorio it be simple and yet distinctive he turn and illustrate the knock on the balustrade of the stair up which they have hasten we will try it he add grimly on that door when evasio have have time to go away from it they wait a few minute and then go out again into the calle de la merced it be the luncheon hour and they have the street to themselves they stand for a moment in the doorway through which mon have pass listen say marco in a whisper it be the sound of a organ come almost muffle from the back of the empty house and it seem to travel through long corridor before reach they they have say sarrion so far as i recollect a large and beautiful chapel in the patio opposite to that great door which have probably be build up on the inside then he give the peculiar knock on the door at a gesture from marco he stand back so that he who open the door would need to open it wide and almost come out into the street to see who have summon he they hear the door opening and the head that come round the door be that of the tall and powerful friar who have come to the assistance of francisco de mogente in the calle san gregorio he draw back at once and try to close the door but both father and son throw they weight against it and slowly press he back enable marco at length to get he shoulder in both man be somewhat smaller than the friar but both be quicker to see a advantage and take it in a moment the friar abandon the attempt and run down the long corridor into which the light filtered dimly through cobweb marco give chase while sarrion stay behind to close the door at the corner of the corridor the friar slip and find himself out-matched raise he voice to shout but the cry be smother by marco who leap at he like a cat and they roll on the floor together the friar be heavier and stronger he have lead a simple and healthy life he muscle be toughen by he wanderings and the hardship of he call at first marco be underneath but as sarrion hurry up he see he son come out on the top and hear at the same moment a dull thud it be the friar 's head against the floor a guipuzcoan trick of wrestling which usually mean death to its victim but the friar 's thick cloak happen to fall between he head and the hard floor this alone save he for marco be a spaniard and do not care at that moment whether he kill the holy man or not indeed sarrion hastily lean down to hold he back and marco rise to he foot with blaze eye and the blood trickle from a cut lip the friar would have kill he if he could for the blood that run in southern man be soon heated and the primeval instinct of fight never die out of the human heart he be not kill say marco breathlessly for which we may thank heaven add sarrion with a short laugh come let we find the chapel they hurry on through the dimly light corridor guide by the sound of the distant organ there seem to be many close door between they and it for only the deeper and more resonant note reach they ear they gain the large patio where the grass grow thickly and the iron-work of the well in the center be hide by the trail rope of last year 's clemati the chapel be there but the door be build up say sarrion point to a doorway which have be fill in and they pause for a moment as all man must pause when they find sudden evidence that that sword which be bring into the world nineteen hundred year ago be not yet sheathe marco have already find a second door lead from the cloister that surround the patio back in the direction from which they have come they enter the corridor which turn sharply back again -- the handiwork of some architect skilful not in the carrying of sound but in kill it it be the way to the organ loft whisper marco it be probably the only entrance to the chapel they open a door and be face by a second one cover and pad with fade feel marco push it ajar and the note of the organ almost deafen they they be in the chapel behind the organ at the west end they pass in and stand in the dark the note of the great organ bray in they ear they could hear the panting of the man work at the bellows marco lead the way and they pass on into the chapel which be dimly light by candle the subtle odour of stale incense hang heavily in the atmosphere which seem to vibrate as if the deeper note of the organ shake the building in they vain search for a exit the chapel be long and narrow marco and he father be alone at the west end conceal by the font of which the wooden cover rise like a miniature spire almost to the ceiling a group of people be kneel on the bare floor by the screen which have never be repair but show clearly where the carve have be knock and tear to make the bonfire in the patio two priest be on the altar step while the chorister be dimly visible through the broken railing of the screen there seem to be some nun within the screen while other kneel without four knelt apart as if await admission to the inner sanctum that be juanita whisper marco point with a steady finger the girl kneel next to she be weep but juanita kneel upright she face half turn so that they could see she clear-cut profile against the candle-light beyond to those who study human nature every attitude or gesture be of value there be energy and courage in the turn of juanita 's head she be listen near to she the motionless black form of sor teresa tower among the worshipper she be look straight in front of she not far away a bow figure all curved and cringe with weak emotion -- a sight to make man pause and think -- be leon de mogente behind he upright with a sleek bow head be evasio mon from he position and in the attitude in which he kneel he could without move see juanita and be probably watch she the chapel be carpet with a old and fade matting of grass such as be make on all the coast of the mediterranean marco and sarrion go forward noiselessly instinctively they cross themselves as they near the chancel evasio mon be nearest to they kneel apart a few pace behind leon he could see every one from this position but he do not hear the sarrion a few yard behind he at this moment juanita turn round and perceive they give a little start which mon see he turn he head to the left sarrion be stand in the semi-darkness at he shoulder then he turn to the right and there be marco motionless with a handkerchief hold to he lip evasio mon reflect for a moment then he turn to sarrion with he ready smile do you come here to see I he whisper i want you to get juanita de mogente away from this as quickly as possible return sarrion in a whisper we need not disturb the service but my friend protest mon still smile by what right that you must ask of marco mon turn to marco in silent inquiry and he receive a wordless answer for marco hold under he eye in the half light the certificate of marriage sign by that political bishop who be no carlist and be ever a thorn in the side of the churchman strive for a absolute monarchy mon shake he head still smile more in sorrow than in anger at the misfortune which he duty compel he to point out it be not legal my dear marco it be not legal he glance round into marco ' still face and perceive perhaps that he might as well try the effect of word upon the stone pillar behind he he reflect again for a moment while the service proceed and the voice of the choir rise and fall like the wave of the sea in a deep cave it be a simple enough ceremonial denuded of many of the mediaeval mummery which have be revive by a newer emotional church for the edification of the weak-minded juanita glance back again and see mon kneel between the two motionless upright man who be grave while he smile and smile then at length he rise to he foot and stand for a moment if he ever hesitate in he life it be at that instant and marco ' hand come forward beneath he eye point inexorably at juanita there be a pause in the service a momentary silence only break by the smother sob of the novice who kneel next to juanita the organ roll out its deep voice again and under cover of the sound mon step forward and touch juanita on the shoulder she turn instantly and he beckon to she to follow he if the priest at the altar perceive anything they make no sign sor teresa absorb in prayer never turn she head the service go on uninterruptedly sarrion lead the way and mon follow juanita glance at marco indicate with a nod evasio mon 's back and make a gay little grimace suggestive of that schemer 's discomfiture then she follow mon and marco come noiselessly behind she they pass out through the dark passage behind the organ into the old cloister there mon turn to look at juanita and from she to marco he be distressed for they it be illegal he repeat gently without a dispensation and by way of reply marco hand he a second paper bearing at its foot the oval seal of the vatican it be the usual dispensation easy enough to procure for the marriage of a orphan under age i be glad say mon and he try to look it sarrion go on into the narrow corridor the friar be sit on a worm-eaten bench there lean back against the wall he hand over he eye he be hurt explain marco simply he try to stop we mon make no comment but accompany they to the door which he close behind they and then return to the chapel reflect perhaps upon how small a incident the history of nation may turn for if the friar have be able to withstand the sarrion -- if there have be a grate to the small door in the calle de la merced -- don carlos de borbone might have wear the three crown of spain chapter xix cousin peligro the novitiate dress have be dispense with and juanita wear she usual school-dress of black with a black mantilla they therefore walk the length of the calle de la merced without attract undue attention juanita 's cheek be flush and she eye bright with excitement she slip she hand within sarrion 's arm and give it a little squeeze of affection how kind of you to come she say i know i could trust you i be never afraid sarrion smile a little dryly and glance towards marco who have meet and overcome all the difficulty and who now walk quietly by he side conceal the bloodstain on the handkerchief cover he lip then juanita let go sarrion 's left arm and run round behind he to take the other while with she right hand she take marco ' left arm there she cry with a laugh now i be safe from all the world -- from all the world be it not so yes answer marco turn to look at she as she

have to be haul up from she knee like a sack that have be say its prayer that stupid milagro cry when they say it be milagros go to be a nun ask sarrion absent-mindedly he be think of something else and look at juanita with a speculative glance she be so gay and inconsequent heaven forbid be the reply she say she be go to marry a soldier i can not think why she say she like the drum but i tell she she could buy a drum and hire a man to hit it she be very rich you know it be not worth marry for that be it no answer marco to whom the question have be address she may get tired of drum you know just as we get tired say we prayer at school i be sure she ought to reflect before she marry a soldier i would not if i be she oh but i forget she pause and turn to marco she grip he arm with a confidential emphasis do you know marco i keep on forget that we be marry you do not mind do you i be not a bit sorry you know i be so glad because it get I away from school and i hate school and there be always the dread that they would make I a nun despite we all you do not know what it be to feel helpless and to have a dread to wake up with it at night and wish you be dead and all the bother be over it be all over now without be dead marco assure she with he slow smile quite sure quite sure answer marco and i shall never go back to school again and they have no power over I neither sor teresa nor sor dorothea nor the dear mother we always call she the ` dear mother ' you know because we have to but we hate she but that be all over now be it not yes answer marco then i be glad i marry you say juanita with conviction and i need not be afraid of señor mon with he gentle smile ask juanita turn on marco with a sudden shrewd gravity no she give a great sigh of relief and shake

street now and the carriage be approach they it be one of the heavy carriage use only on state occasion which have stand idle for many year in the stable of the palacio sarrion the horse be from torre garda and the man in they quiet livery greet she with country frankness it be one of the grand carriage say juanita yes why she ask to take you home reply sarrion juanita get into the carriage and sit

the reply be it open after all these year yes answer sarrion but why for you answer sarrion juanita turn and look out of the window with bright and thoughtful eye she ask no more question and they drive to the palacio sarrion in silence there they find cousin peligro await they cousin peligro be a sarrion and seem in some indefinite way to consider that in so be and so exist she place the world under a obligation that she consider the world bind in return for the honor she confer upon it to support she in comfort and deference be a patent fact hardly worth put into word the old family she be in the habit of say with a sigh be die out at the same time she make a little gesture with outspread palm and fold she white hand complacently on she lap as if to indicate that society be not leave comfortless -- that she be still there from she inferior she look for the utmost deference she white hand have never do a hour 's work she be ignorant and idle but she be a lady and a sarrion cousin peligro live in a little apartment in madrid which she fondly imagine to be the hub of the social universe they all come she say to consult the senorita de sarrion upon point of etiquette and she pat the air condescendingly with she left hand there be some people who seem to be create by a far-seeing providence as a solemn warning cousin peligro say juanita one day after listen respectfully to a lecture on the care of the hand live in a little field of she own like a scarecrow add marco the taciturn and this be the lady who await they at the palacio sarrion she have be summon from madrid by sarrion who pay the expense of the journey no small item by the way for cousin peligro like many people who live at the expense of other seek to mitigate the bitterness of the bread of charity by spread it very thickly with other people 's butter she do not come down to the door to meet they when the carriage clatter over the cobble-stone of the echo patio such a proceeding might have lower she dignity in the eye of the servant who to do they justice see right through cousin peligro into the vacuum that lay behind she she sit in state in the great drawing-room with she hand fold on she lap and placidly arrange she propose mode of greet the newcomer she have be inform that sarrion have find it necessary to take juanita de mogente away from the convent school and to assume the care of that guardianship which have always be a understood obligation mutually bind between himself and francisco de mogente cousin peligro be therefore keenly alive to the fact that juanita require at this critical moment of she life a good and abide example hers also be the bless knowledge that no one in all spain be better fit to offer such a example than the señorita peligros de sarrion she therefore sit in she best black silk dress in a attitude subtly combine with a kind tolerance for all who be so unfortunate as not to be sarrion a complacent determination to do she duty it be to be regret that she be for a time leave sit thus for perro be in the hall and he greet of juanita have to be acknowledge with several violent hug which result in juanita 's mantilla get mix up with perro 's collar

item of she late education with a jerk which gradually derange cousin peligro ' prim mantilla then she dance she round a impalpable mulberry bush until the poor lady be breathless no more prime at six o'clock in the morning conclude juanita suddenly allow cousin peligro to sit again do you ever go to prime at six o'clock in the morning cousin peligro no be the grave answer such thing be not expect of lady how thoughtful of heaven exclaim juanita with a light laugh then i do not mind be grownup -- and put up my hair -- if you will lend I two hairpin she fall on cousin peligro ' mantilla and extract two hairpin from it despite the resistance of the soft white hand then she twist up the heavy plait that hang to she waist throw back she mantilla and stand laughing before the old lady there

cousin peligro marry echo the disciple of etiquette faintly marry -- to whom marco and i but cousin peligro only gasp and cover she face with she hand marco come into the room at this moment and scarcely look at cousin peligro those white hand play so large a part in she small daily life that they be always in evidence and it do not seem out of place that they should cover she foolish face i

juanita 's voluble explanation you see say sarrion after a pause she be happy enough now answer marco but she may find out some day that she be not juanita come back before long and find sarrion alone where be marco she ask he be take a siesta answer sarrion like a poor man yes like a poor man he be not in bed all last night you have a narrower escape of be make a nun than you suspect juanita 's face fall she go to the window and stand there look out when be we go to torre garda she ask after a long silence i hate town and people i want to smell the pine and the bracken chapter xx at torre garda the river know as the wolf find its source in the eternal snow of the pyrenee amid the solitary grandeur of the least known mountain in europe it roll and tumble -- toss hither and thither in its rocky bed feed by this and that streamlet from stony gorge -- down to the green valley of torre garda here there be a village crouch on either side of the river-bed and above it on a plateau surround by chestnut tree and pine stand the house of the sarrion in winter the wholesome smell of wood smoke rise from the chimney pervade the air in summer the warm breath of the pine creep down the mountain to mingle with the cooler air that stir the bracken below all summer and winter at evening and at dawn night and day growl the wolf -- so name from the continuous low-pitched murmur of its water through the defile a mile below the village the man of the valley of the wolf have a hundred tale of they river in its different mood and firmly believe that the voice which be ever in they ear speak to such as have understanding of every change in the weather the old woman have no doubt that it speak also of those thing that must affect the prince and the peasant alike of good and ill fortune of life and of death of hope and its slow slow die in the heart certain it be that the river have its humor not to be account for by outward thing -- seem to be gay without reason like any human heart in dull weather and murmur dismally when the sun shone and the bird be singing in the tree in clearest summer weather the water would sometimes run thick and yellow for day the result of some landslip where the snow and ice be melting sometimes the wolf would hurl down a mass of debris -- a forest tear from the mountainside by avalanche the dead body of a few stray sheep or a fox or a wolf or the dun corpse of a mountain bear many in the valley have see table and chair and the roof perhaps of a house catch in the timber of the old bridge below the village and the river of course have exact its toll from more than one family it be jocularly say at the venta that the wolf be royalist for in the first carlist war it have fight for queen christina do to death a whole company of insurgent at that which be know as the false ford where it would seem that a child could pass while in reality no horseman might hope to get through the house of torre garda be not itself ancient though it undoubtedly stand on the site of some mediaeval watch-tower it have be build in the day of ferdinand vii at the period when french architecture be run rife over the world and have the appearance of a gascon chateau it be a long low house of two story every room on the ground floor open with long french window to a terrace build to the edge of the plateau where a fountain splash its clear spring water into a stone basin where gray stone urn stand on lichen-covered pillar amid flower-bed every room on the first floor have window open on a wide balcony which run the length of the house and be protect from the rain and midday sun by the far-stretching eaves of the roof the house be of gray stone roof with slab of the same such as peel off the slope of the pyrenee and slide one over the other to the valley below the pointed turret at each corner be roof with the small green tile that the moor love the wind and the snow and the rain have tone all torre garda down to a cool gray-green against which the four cypress tree on the terrace stand rigid like sentinel keep eternal guard over the valley above the house rise a pine-slope where the snow linger late into the summer above this again be rock and broken declivity of slide stone and crowning all the everlasting snow from the terrace of torre garda a strong voice could make itself hear in the valley where tobacco grow and ripen or on the height where no vegetation live at all the house seem to hang between sky and earth and the air that move the cypress tree be cool and thin -- a very breath of heaven to make thinker wonder why any who can help it should choose to live in town the green shutter have be close across the window for nearly three month when on one spring morning the villager look up to see the house astir and the window open wide there have be much to detain the sarrion at saragossa and juanita have to wait for the gratification of she desire to smell the pine and the bracken again it seem that it be no one 's business to question the validity of the strange marriage in the chapel of we lady of the shadow evasio mon who be suppose to know more about it than any other only smile and say nothing leon de mogente be absorb in he own peculiar selfishness which be not of this world but the next he fall into the mistake common to ecstatic mind that thought of heaven justify a deliberate neglect of obvious duty on earth leon say juanita gaily to cousin peligro will assuredly be a saint some day : he have so little sense of humor for leon it seem could not be bring to understand juanita 's sunny view of life you may look solemn and talk of great mistake as much as you like she say to she brother but i know i be never mean for a nun it will all come right in the end uncle ramon say so i do not know what he mean but he say it will all come right in the end and she shake she head with that wisdom of the world which be give to woman only which may live in the same heart as ignorance and innocence and yet be superior to all the knowledge that all the sage have ever put in book there be lawyer to be consult and moreover pay and juanita gaily splash down she name in a bold schoolgirl hand on countless document there be a spanish proverb warn the unwary never to drink water in the dark or sign a paper unread and marco make juanita read everything she sign she be quick enough and only laugh when he protest that she have not take in the full meaning of the document i understand it quite enough she answer it be not worth trouble about it be only money you man think of nothing else i do not want to understand it any better not now but some day you will juanita look at he pen in hand momentarily grave you be always think of what i shall do some day she say and marco do not deny it you seem to hedge I around with precaution against that time she continue thoughtfully and look at he with bright and search eye at length all the formality be over and they be free to go to torre garda event be move rapidly in spain at this time and the small wonder of juanita 's marriage be already a thing half forget have it not be for she great wealth the whole matter would have pass unnoticed for wealth be still a burden upon its owner and there be many who must perforce go away sorrowful on account of they great possession half the world guess however at the truth and every man judge the sarrion from he own political standpoint praise or blame accord to preconceived conviction but there be some in high place who know that a great danger have be avert cousin peligro have consent to sarrion 's proposal that she should for a time make she home with he either at torre garda or at saragossa she have live in troublous time but be convince that the carlist like heaven make special provision for lady no one say she will molest I and she fold she hand in complacent serenity on she lap she have a profound distrust of railway in which common mode of conveyance she suspect a democratic spirit though to this day the spanish ticket collector present himself hat in hand at the door of a first-class carriage and the time-table find itself subservient to the convenience of any excellency who may not have finish he coffee in the refreshment-room cousin peligro be therefore glad enough to quit the train at pampeluna where the carriage from torre garda await they there be saddle horse for sarrion and marco and a handful of troops be wait in the shadow of the tree outside of the station yard a officer ride forward and pay he respects to juanita you do not recognize I senorita he say you remember the chapel of we lady of the shadow yes i remember she answer shake hand we catch you say you prayer when we arrive he blush as he laugh for he be a simple man lead a hard and lonely life yes senorita why not i have no doubt say juanita look at he shrewdly that the saint hear you marco he explain write to ask I for a few man to take you carriage through the danger zone so i take the liberty of ride with they myself i be the watch-dog señorita at the gate of you valley you be safe enough once you be within the valley of the wolf they talk together until sarrion ride forward to announce that all be ready to depart while cousin peligro sit with pinch lip and disapprove face she take a early opportunity of mention that lady should not talk to gentleman with such familiarity and freedom that above all a smile be sufficient acknowledgment for any jest except those make by the very aged when to laugh be a sign of respect for cousin peligro have be bring up in a school of manners now fortunately extinct he be marco ' friend explain juanita besides he be a nice person i know a nice person when i see one she conclude with a friendly nod towards the watch-dog of the valley of the wolf who be talk in the shade of the tree with marco the man ride together in advance of the carriage and the luggage cart the journey be uneventful and the sun be set in a cloudless west when the mouth of the valley be reach it be cousin peligro ' happy lot to consider herself the center of any party and the pivot upon which social event must turn she bow graciously to captain zeneta when he come forward to take he leave it be most considerate of marco she say to juanita in he hearing to provide this escort he no doubt divine that accustomed as i be to live in madrid i might have be nervous in these remote place juanita be tire they be near they journey 's end she do not take the trouble to explain the situation to cousin peligro there be some fool whom the world allow to continue in they folly because it be less trouble marco and sarrion be ride together now in silence from time to time a peasant wait at the roadside come forward to exchange a few word with one or the other the road ascend sharply now and the pace be slow the regular tramp of the horse the quiet evening hour the fatigue of the journey be conducive to contemplation and silence when marco help cousin peligro and juanita to descend from the high-swung travel carriage juanita be too tired to notice one or two innovation when as a schoolgirl she have spend she holiday at torre garde no change have be make in the simple household but now marco have send from saragossa such modern furniture as woman need to-day there be new chair on the terrace she own bedroom at the western corner of the house next door to the huge room occupy by sarrion have be entirely refurnish and newly decorate oh how pretty she exclaim and marco linger in the long passage perhaps hear the remark later when they be all in the drawing-room await dinner juanita clasp sarrion 's arm with she wonted little gesture of affection you be a old dear she say to he to have my room do up so beautifully so clean and white and simple -- just as you know i should like it oh you need not smile so grimly you know it be just what i should like -- do he not marco yes answer marco and it be the only room in the house that have be do i look into the other to see -- into you great barrack and into marco ' room at the end of the balcony i have guess why marco have that room why he ask so that you can see down the valley -- so that perro who sleep on the balcony outside the open window have merely to lift he head to look right down to where the other watch-dog be ten mile away after dinner juanita discover that there be a new piano in the drawing-room in addition to a number of those easier chair which we grandmother never know cousin peligro protest that they be unnecessary and even conducive to sloth and indolence still protest she take the most comfortable and sit with fold hand listen to juanita finding out the latest waltz with variation of she own on the new piano sarrion and marco be on the terrace smoking the small new moon be near the west the night would be dark after its set they be silent listen to the voice of they ancestral river as it growl heavy with snow through the defile presently a servant bring coffee and tell marco that a messenger be wait to deliver a note after the manner of spain the messenger be invite to come and deliver he letter in person he be a travel knife-grinder he explain and have receive the letter from a man on the road whose horse have go lame one must be mutually helpful on the road the letter be from zeneta at the end of the valley write hastily in pencil the carlist be in force between he and pampeluna would marco ride down to the camp and hear detail marco rise at once and throw he cigarette away he look towards the light window of the drawing-room no good say anything about it he say i shall be back by breakfast time they will probably not notice my absence he be go -- the sound of he horse 's foot be drown in the voice of the river -- before juanita come out to the terrace a slim shadowy form in she white evening dress she stand for a minute or two in silence until she eye become accustomed to the darkness she perceive sarrion and a empty chair perro usually walk gravely to she and stand in front of she await a jest whenever she come she look round perro be not there where be marco she ask take the empty chair he have be send for to the valley he have go go echo juanita stand up again she go to the stone balustrade of the terrace and look over into the darkness i hear he cross the bridge a few minute ago sarrion say quietly he might have say good-bye sarrion turn slowly in he chair and look at she he probably do not wish he coming and going to be talk of by cousin peligro he suggest still he might have say good-bye to I she turn again and lean she arm on the gray stone she stand in silence look down into the valley chapter xxi juanita grow up marco ' horse the moor have perform the journey to pampeluna once in the last twelve hour he be a strong horse accustom to long journey but marco choose another a older and staider animal of less value better fit for night work he wish to do the journey quickly and return by breakfast-time he be not in a mood to spare he beast man who live in stir time and meet death face to face quite familiarly from day to day as englishman meet the rain soon acquire the philosophy which consist in take the good thing the god send they unhesitatingly and thankfully juanita be at torre garda at last -- after month of patient wait and watch after danger foresee and face -- that be enough for marco de sarrion he therefore press he horse although he be alert and watchful because it be he habit to be so he be less careful perhaps than usual he ride at a greater pace than be prudent on such a road by so dark a night the spring come early on the southern slope of the pyrenee it be a warm night and there have be no rain for some day the dust lay thickly on the road muffle the beat of the horse 's foot the wolf roar in its narrow bed the road only recently make practicable for carriage at sarrion 's expense be not a safe one it hang like a cornice on the left-hand bank of the river and at certain corner the stone fall from the mountain height almost continuously in other place the heavy stone buttress have be undermine by the action of the river it be a road that need continuous watch and repair but marco have ride over it a few hour earlier and there have be no change of weather since he know the weak place and pass they carefully three mile below the village the river pass through a gorge and the road mount to the lip of the overhang cliff there be no danger here for there be no fall stone from above it be to this passage that the wolf owe its name and in a narrow place invisible from the road the water seem to growl after the manner of a wild beast at meat marco ' horse know the road well enough which moreover be easy here for it be cut from the rock on the left-hand side while its outer boundary be mark at interval by white stone the horse be perhaps too cautious by night a rider must leave to he mount the decision as to what hill may be descend at a trot marco know that the old horse beneath he invariably decide to walk down the easiest declivity at the summit of the road the horse be trot at a long regular stride on the turn of the hill he propose to stop although he must have know that the descent be easy marco touch he with the spur and he start forward the next instant he fall so suddenly and badly that he forehead scrape the road marco be throw so hard and so far that he fall on he head and shoulder three foot in front of the horse it be the narrowest place in the whole road and the knowledge of this flash through marco ' mind as he fall he strike one of the white stone that mark the boundary of the road and hear he collar-bone snap like a dry stick then he roll over the edge of the precipice into the blackness fill by the roar of the river he still have one hand whole and ready though the skin be scrape from it and the finger of this hand be firmly twist into the bridle he hang for a moment jerk hither and thither by the effort of the horse to pick himself up on the road above a stronger jerk lift he to the edge of the road and marco hang there for a instant find a insecure foothold for one foot in the root of a overhang bush but the horse be nearer to the edge now he be half over and might fall at any moment it flash through marco ' mind that he must live at all cost there be no one to care for juanita in the troubled time that be come juanita be he only thought and he fight for he life with skill and that quickness of perception which be the real secret of success in human affair he jerk on the bridle with all the strength of he iron muscle jerk himself up on the road and the horse over into the gorge as the horse fall it lash out wildly its hind foot touch the back of marco ' head and seem almost to break he spine he roll over on he side choke he do not lose consciousness at once but know that oblivion be come perro the dog have be excitedly skirmish round keep clear of the horse 's heel and do little else he now look over after the horse and marco see he lean body outline against the sky he have let the rein go

take the scissors from the dressing-table and cut the cord which be a piece of old fishing-line fray and worn by friction against the rock of the river juanita hastily thrust the cord into she pocket and draw the ring less quickly on to that finger for which it have be destine when sarrion return to the room a minute later she be carefully and slowly cut the sleeve of the injured arm do you know uncle ramon she say cheerfully i be sure -- i be positively certain he will recover poor old marco sarrion glance at she sharply as if he have detect a new note in she voice and he eye fall on she

minute at which he recover consciousness for she knowledge be fresh enough in she mind to be half mechanical in its result will that drug make I sleep ask marco alertly yes how soon that depend upon how stale the little apothecary 's stock-in-trade may be answer juanita probably a quarter of a hour he be a queer little man and unwashed but he set you collar-bone like a angel you have to do nothing but keep quiet i fancy you will have to be content with a quiet seat in the background for some week amigo mio she busy herself as she speak with some duty of a sick-nurse which have be postpone during he unconsciousness it be nearly six o'clock she say without appear to look in he direction so you need not try to peep round the corner at the clock please do not manage thing marco it

bedside again and cousin peligro have not be disturb she have not leave she room she will tell we to-morrow morning that she scarcely sleep at all a real lady never sleep well you know she must have hear we but she do not come out of she room for which we may thank the saint there be some people one would rather not have in a emergency in fact when you come to think of it -- how many be there in the world whose presence would be of the slightest use in a crisis -- one or two at the most she hold up she finger to emphasise the smallness of this number and withdraw it again hastily but she be not quick enough for marco have see the ring and he eye suddenly brighten she turn away towards the window hold she lip between she tooth as if she have commit a indiscretion she have be talk against time slowly and continuously to prevent he talk or think to give the apothecary 's soothing drug time to take effect for the little man of medicine have speak very clearly of concussion and its after-effect he have post off to pampeluna to fetch a doctor from there leave instruction that should marco recover he reason he should not be permit to make use of it and here in a moment be marco fully in possession of he sens and make a use of they which juanita resent without know why i must see my father he say stir the bedclothes before i go to sleep again juanita turn on she heel but do

go and fetch he she go to the window and pass out on to the balcony sarrion have in obedience to she wish go to he room he be now sit on a long chair on the balcony apparently watch the dawn of what be you think as you sit there watch the new light in the mountain she ask gaily he look at she with a softness in the eye which usually express a tolerant cynicism of you he answer i hear the murmur of you voice you need not tell I that he have recover consciousness he want to see you she say i think he be surprise not to see you -- to see only I -- when he regain he sens there be the faintest suspicion of resentment in she voice but i think that the apothecary say that he be to be keep absolutely quiet say sarrion rise so he do but he be only a man you know just like you and marco -- and he do not understand oh say sarrion meekly as he follow she she lead the way into marco ' room she be as fresh and rosy as the morning itself with the delicate pink and white of the convent still in she cheek it be on sarrion 's face that the night 's work have leave its mark here he be she say he be not asleep be it a secret i suppose it be -- you have so many you two she laugh and look from one to the other but neither answer she shall i go away marco she ask abruptly turn towards the bed as if she know at all event that from he she would get a plain answer and it come uncompromisingly yes he say she go to the door with a curt laugh and close it behind she with decision sarrion look after she with a sudden frown he look for a instant as if he be about to suggest that marco might have make a different reply and then decide to hold he peace he be perhaps wise in he generation politeness never yet win a woman 's love marco have note juanita 's lightness of heart on recover he sens the first use he have make of they be to observe she every glance and silence there be no sign of present anxiety or of great emotion the incident of the ring have no other meaning therefore than a girlish love of novelty or a taste not hitherto make manifest for personal ornament it might have deceive any one less observant than marco less in the habit of watch nature and dumb animal he be patient however and industrious in the collection of evidence against himself and she have startle he by say that she be grown-up though he perceive soon after that it be only a manner of speak for she be still careless and happy without a thought of the future as child be these thing however he keep to himself he have not send for he father to talk to he of juanita man never discuss a woman in whom they be really interested though fool do that horse do not fall say marco to he father he be throw there be a wire across the road there be none when i get there reply sarrion then it have be remove i see it as we fall my foot catch in it or i could have throw myself clear in the usual way sarrion reflect a moment let I look at the note that zeneta write you he say you will find it in my pocket hang behind the door i be a fool i be in too great a hurry now that i think of it zeneta would not have write a note like that then he never write it at all say sarrion who have find the paper and be read it near the window the clear morning light bring out the wrinkle and the crow 's - foot with inexorable distinctness on he keen narrow face what do it mean he ask at length folding the letter and replace it in the pocket from which he have take it marco rouse himself with a effort he be sleepy i think it mean that evasio mon be about he answer no man in the valley would have do it suggest sarrion if any man in the valley have do it he would have put he knife into I when i lay on the road which would have be murder he give a short laugh and be silent and the hand inside the velvet glove do not risk murder reflect sarrion they have not give up the game yet we must be careful of ourselves and of juanita i count she as one of ourselves reply sarrion quickly for he hear she voice in the passage with a brief tap on the door she come in she be struggle with perro you have have long enough for you secret she say and now marco must go to sleep i have bring perro to see he he be so uneasy in he canine mind perro low-born and eager need restraint to keep he from the bed where he master lay and juanita continue to hold he while she speak you must remember she say that it be owe to perro that you be here at all if he have not come back and awaken we all you would have be on the road still sarrion glance sharply at she he attention catch by she version of that which have really happen she do not want marco to know that it be she who have hear perro she who have insist that something have happen to marco and some jesuit come along the road might have find you there she say and push you over it would have be so easy marco and sarrion glance at each other and possibly juanita see the glance as she hold perro back from he master you do not know marco how they hate you they could not hate you more if you be a heretic i have always know it because father muro be always try to find thing out about you in confession he ask question about you -- who you confessor be if you do a pilgrimage i say -- be quiet perro -- i say you never do a pilgrimage and you be always change you confessor because no holy father could stand the strain for long she forcibly eject perro from the room and come back breathless and laughing she have not a care in the world think marco who know well enough the danger that he have pass through but father muro be such a innocent old love she go on that he do it badly he have be tell to do it by the jesuit and he make a bungle of it he think that he could make a schoolgirl answer a question if she do not want to and no one be afraid of he he be a dear good old saint and will assuredly go to heaven he be not a jesuit you know but he be afraid of they as everybody else be i think -- she pause and close the shutter to soften the grow day except marco she throw back over she shoulder towards the bed with some far-off suggestion of anger still in she voice and now he must be allow to sleep until the doctor come from pampeluna she conclude she leave the room as she speak to warn the servant who be already astir to do they work as noiselessly as possible when she return marco be asleep the doctor can not be here for another hour at least whisper sarrion who be stand by the window watch marco it be too far for a man of he age to ride and he have no carriage there may be some delay in find one to do so great a distance at this time in the morning you must take the opportunity to get some sleep but juanita only shake she head and laugh sarrion do not persuade she but turn to quit the room he hand be on the door when some one tap on the other side of it it be marco ' servant the doctor excellency he announce briefly in the passage stand a man of middle height hard and wiry with those line in he face that time neither obliterate nor deepen the parallel of hunger he have be through the first carlist war nearly thirty year earlier he have starve in pampeluna the hungry the impregnable sarrion shake hand with he and pass into the room ah he say in the quiet voice of one who be accustom to speak in the presence of sleep when he see juanita ah -- you yes say juanita so you be nurse you husband he murmur abstractedly as he bent over the bed and juanita make no answer how long have he be asleep he ask after a few moment and in reply receive the write paper which he read quickly with a practice eye and lay it aside we must wait he say turn to sarrion until he awake but it be all right i can see that while he sleep he be a strong man none stronger in all navarre as he speak he be examine the bottle leave by the village apothecary tasting one smell another he nod approval in medicine as in war one expert may know unerringly what another will do then he look round the room which be orderly as a hospital ward one see he say that he have a nun to care for he he smile faintly so that he feature fall into the line that hunger draw but juanita look at he with grave eye and do not answer to he pleasantry then he turn to sarrion it be only by the kindness of a mere acquaintance he say that i be enable to get here so soon my own horse be tire out with a hard day yesterday and i be go out to seek other in pampeluna -- no easy task on market-day -- when i meet a travel carriage on the plaza de la constitution its owner must have divine my haste for he offer assistance and on hear my story and whither i be bind he give up he intended journey decide to remain a few day longer in pampeluna and place he carriage at my disposal i hardly know the man at all -- though he tell I that he be a old friend of yours he live in saragossa ah say sarrion who be listen with rather marked attention juanita have move away but she be stand now listen also look back over she shoulder with wait eye it be the senior evasio mon say the doctor and in the silence that follow marco stir in he sleep as if he too have hear the name chapter xxiii kind inquiry for the next fortnight juanita remain in supreme command at torre garda exercise that rule which she say she have acquire at the convent school it have in reality come to she straight from heaven as it come to all woman be it not part of the gentler soul to care for the helpless and the sick just as it be in a man 's heart to fight the world for a woman 's sake marco make a quick recovery he broken bone knit together like the snapped branch of a young tree he cut and bruise heal themselves unaid he have no nerve say juanita you should see a nun when she be ill st luke and all the saint have they hand full i can tell you with return health come energy indeed the patient have never lose he grip of the world many from the valley come to make inquiry some leave a message of condolence some depart with a grunt indicative of satisfaction a few of the more cultivate give they name to the servant as they drink a glass of red wine in the kitchen say it be pedro from the mill tell he that three finger thoma pass by muttered another grudgingly it be i so-called short knife who come to ask explain a third tap the sheath of he baptismal weapon how far have you come ask juanita who find these gentleman entertaining seventeen mile from the mountain be the reply all you friend be call to inquire after you health say juanita to marco they be famous brigand and make one think fondly of the guardium civile there be not many razor in the valley and i be sure there be no soap they be honest enough though they appearance may be disquieting oh i be not afraid of they answer juanita with a shrewd and mystic smile it be cousin peligro who fear they she scold I for speak to one of they on the verandah it undermine the pedestal upon which a lady should always stand be i on a pedestal marco she look back at he over she shoulder through the fold of she mantilla it be a opportunity perhaps which a skillful lover would have seize marco be silent for a moment then he speak in a repress voice if they come again he say i should like to see they but juanita have already put into the apothecary 's lip a command that no visitor should be admit she keep this up for some day but be at length force to give way marco be so obviously on the high road to recovery there be no suggestion of a after-effect of the slight concussion of the brain which have render he insensible it be short knife who first gain admittance to the sick-room he be quite a simple person smell of sheep and endowed with a tact which be as common among the peasantry as amid the great there be no sign of embarrassment in he manner and he omit to remove he beret from he close-cropped head until he see juanita whom he salute curtly replace he cap with a calm unconsciousness before he nod to marco it be you i hear singing the basque song as i climb the hill he say address juanita first with the instinct of a gentleman you speak basque i understand it at all event though i can not speak it as well as marco oh he say the man glance towards the bed he be one of we -- one of we do you know the song that the woman of the valley sing to they baby i can not sing to you for i have no voice except for the goat they be not particular the goat -- they like music they stand round I and listen but if you be pass in the mountain my wife will sing it to you -- she know it well we have many round the table -- god be thank it make they sleep when they be contrary it tell how easy it be to kill a frenchman then have observe the conventionality he turn eagerly to marco juanita listen to they for a short time while they speak together in the basque tongue then she go to the balcony and stand there lean she arm on the iron rail look out over the valley with thoughtful eye she have see clearly a hundred device to relieve she of she watch at the bedside marco make excuse for she to absent herself he find occupation for she elsewhere with he return strength come anxiety that she should lead she own life -- apart from he you need not try to get rid of I she say to he one day and i do not want to go for a walk with cousin peligro she think only of she shoe and she clothes while she walk i would go for a walk with perro if i go with any one he have a better understanding of what god make the world for than cousin peligro but i be not go to walk with any one thank you nevertheless she absent herself and marco ' attempt to find diversion for she cease with a suspicious suddenness she fall into the habit of use the drawing-room which be immediately beneath the sick-room and spend much of she time at the piano there it keep marco quiet she explain airily to sarrion and vouchsafe nothing further on the subject chiefly because the music of handel and beethoven alone have be encourage by she professor juanita have learn with some enthusiasm the folk song of the basque consider worthy only of the attention of the people she have a pretty voice round and young with strange low note in it that seem to belong not to she but to some woman who have yet to live and suffer or perhaps be happy as some few be in this uneven world she have catch moreover the trick of slur from one note to the other which must assuredly have be leave in spain by the moor it come from the far east it be probably characteristic of those song that they could not sing by the water of babylon when they hang they harp upon a tree in the strange land for it give to song sad or gay the minor low clear note of exile it ring out unexpectedly in strange place the boatman of the malabar coast face the surf singing no other than the refrain that the basque woman murmur over the cradle it keep marco quiet say juanita i suppose she suggest to marco one day when she return to he room and find he quiet that when you be well enough to ride you will begin you journey up and down the valley yes and you endless watch over the carlist they be make good use of they time i hear reply marco with the grave appreciation of a good fighter for a worthy foe juanita remember this now as she stand on the balcony for he of the short knife and marco be talk politics -- those rough and ready politics of the valley of the wolf which deal but little in word and very considerably in deed of a bloody nature she could hear marco talk of the near future when he should be in the saddle again and she eye grow gloomy and dark with those velvet depths that lie in hazel eye when they be grave she kingdom be slip away from she she be stand thus when the sound of a horse 's foot catch she attention a horseman be come up the slope from the village to the castle of torre garda she look at he with eye that have be train by marco in the holiday time to see great distance in the mountain then she turn and reenter the sick man 's room there be another visitor come to make inquiry into you welfare -- it be senor mon and she look for the gleam that immediately light marco ' dark eye sarrion be out he have ride to a distant hamlet earlier in the day the tiding of this journey might well have reach evasio mon 's ear cousin peligro be take the siesta by which she seek to forestall a possible fatigue later in the day there be some people who seem to have the misfortune to be absent on the rare occasion when they be want he be not come into this room say juanita coolly i will go down and see he evasio mon greet she with a gay smile i be so glad he say to hear that all go well with marco we hear of he accident at pampeluna i have a day of leisure so i ride out to pay my respects he glance at she but do not specify whether he have come to pay he respects to she as a bride or to marco as a invalid it be a long way to come for a mere politeness reply juanita who could meet smile with smile if need be but the eye before which evasio mon turn aside be grave enough it be not a mere politeness he answer i have know marco since he be a child and have watch he progress in the world -- not always with a light heart that be kind of you reply juanita but why watch he if it give you pain mon laugh he be quick to see a joke and juanita he know be a gay soul one can not help take a interest in one 's friend and be naturally sorry to see they drift into what ask juanita turn to the table where a servant have place coffee for the visitor politics be politics a crime they lead to many -- but do not let we talk of they -- he break off with a light gesture dismiss as it be a unpleasant topic since you be happy he conclude look at she with benevolent eye he be a man of quick gesture and slow precise speech he always seem to mean much more than be convey by the mere word he enunciate juanita look quickly at he what do he know of she happiness be she happy -- when she come to think of it she remember she gloomy thought of a few minute earlier on the balcony when we be young we confound thought with fact when the heart be young it make for itself a new heaven and a new earth from a word a glance a silence it be a different earth from this one but who can tell that it be not the same heaven as that for which man look marco be talk politics in the room overhead forget she perhaps by now evasio mon 's suggestion have come at a opportune moment leon be much exercise on you account say mon quietly as if he have divine she thought it be unlike leon perhaps to be exercise about anything but he own soul for he be a very devout man but juanita be not likely to pause and reflect on that point why she ask he naturally dislike the idea of you be drag into politics answer mon gently i why should i be drag into politics mon make a deprecatory gesture it seem that he find himself draw again to speak of a subject that be distasteful to he then he shrug he shoulder well he say half to himself we live in a practical age let we be practical but he would have prefer that you should marry for love come let we change the subject my child how be sarrion in good health i hope it be very kind of leon to exercise he mind on my account say juanita steadily but i can manage my own affair those be my own word answer mon soothingly i say to he : ` juanita be no longer a child marco be honest he will not have deceive she he must have tell she that such a marriage be a mere question of politics that there be no thought of love ' he glance sharply at she it be almost prophetic for marco have use the very word it be not difficult to be prophetic if one can sink self sufficiently to cloak one 's thought with the mind of another and thus divine the workings of he brain juanita remember that marco have tell she that this be a matter of politics mon be only guess but he guess right the greatest man the world have produce only guess after all but they do not guess wrong such a fortune as yours he say with a easy laugh would make or mar any cause you see you fortune be perhaps you misfortune -- who know juanita laugh also as at a pleasant conceit the wit that have baffle father muro be ready for evasio mon a woman will take she stand before she own heart and defy the world juanita 's eye flash across the man 's gentle face but she say if the fortune be my own if i prefer that marco should have it -- to the church evasio mon smile gently of course he murmur that be what i say to leon and to sor teresa also who naturally be trouble about you though there be other alternative neither marco nor the church need have it you could have it yourself as you father my old and dear friend intend it how could i have it myself ask juanita whose curiosity be arouse mon shrug he shoulder the pope could annul such a marriage as yours by a stroke of the pen if he wish he pause look at she beneath he light lash and i be tell he do wish it what the pope wish -- well one must try to be a good catholic if one can juanita smile she do not perhaps consider herself call upon to admit the infallibility of he holiness in matter of the heart she know better than the pope mon see that he have strike a false note i be a sentimentalist myself he say with a frank laugh i should like every girl to marry for love i should like love to be treat as something sacred -- not as a joke but i be get to be a old man juanita i be behind the time do i hear sarrion in the passage he rise as he speak and go towards the door sarrion come in at that moment the spanish sense of hospitality be strongly arabic mon have ride many mile sarrion greet he almost eagerly chapter xxiv the stormy petrel as juanita quit the room she hear sarrion ask evasio mon if he have lunch and mon admit that he have as yet omit that meal juanita shrug she shoulder it be only in later life that we come to realize the importance of meal if mon be hungry he should have say so she give no further thought to he she hate he she be glad to think that he should have suffer even if he pain be only hunger what be hunger she ask herself compare with a broken heart one be a pass pang that could be alleviate could be confess to the first comer while a broken heart must be hide at any cost from all the world she meet cousin peligro come towards the drawing-room in she best black silk dress and in what might have be call a fluster of excitement at the thought of a visitor if such a word have be applicable to she placid life of self-deception juanita make some small jest and laugh rather eagerly at it as she pass the pattern lady on the stair she be very calm and collect be a determine person as many seemingly gay and light-hearted people be she be go to leave torre garda and marco who have marry she for she money it be characteristic of determine people that they be restricted in they foresight they look in front with eye so steady and concentrate that they perceive no side issue but only the one path that they intend to tread juanita be go back to pampeluna to sor teresa at the convent school in the calle de la dormitaleria she reck nothing of the carlist of the disturbed country through which she have to pass she have never lack money and have sufficient now for she need the village of torre garda could assuredly provide a carriage for the journey or at the worst a cart anything would be better than remain in this house -- even the hate school in the calle de la dormitaleria she have always know that sor teresa be she friend though the sister superior 's manner of indicate friendship have not be invariably comprehensible juanita take a cloak and what money she could find she be not a very tidy person and the money have to be collect from odd trinket-box and discard purse marco be still talk politics with he friend from the mountain when she pass beneath he window sarrion and evasio mon have go to the dining-room where it be to be presume cousin peligro have follow they she profess a great admiration for evasio mon who be on familiar term with people of the highest distinction a hour 's start would be sufficient in that time she could be half-way to pampeluna secrecy be of course out of the question the drawing-room window be open juanita pause on the threshold for a moment then she go into the room and scribble a hurry note -- not innocent of blot -- which she address to marco she leave it on the writing-table and carry she cloak over she arm she hurry down a zigzag path conceal in a thicket of scrub-oak to the village of torre garda before reach the village she overtake a traveling-carriage go at a walk pace down the hill the carriage which be old-fashioned in build and set high upon its narrow wheel be empty where be you go ask juanita of the man who take off he hat to she almost as if he have expect she i be return to pampeluna empty excellency he answer i have bring the baggage of señor mon who be travel over the mountain on horseback i be hope to get a fare from torre garda back to pampeluna if i have the good fortune the coincidence be rather startling juanita have always be consider a lucky girl however one for whom the smaller chance of daily existence be invariably kind she accept this as another instance of the indulgence of fate in small thing she be not particularly glad or surprise a dull indifference have come over she the small thing of daily life have never engross she mind she be quite indifferent to they now it be she intention to get to pampeluna through all difficulty and the incident of the road occupy no place in she thought she be vaguely confident that no one could absolutely stand in she way have not evasio mon say that the pope would willingly annul she marriage she be think these thought as she drive through the little mountain village what be that -- it sound like thunder or gun inquire evasio mon pause in he late and simple luncheon in the dining-room a clerical ear like yours should not know the sound of gun reply sarrion with a curt laugh it be not that however it be a cart or a carriage cross the bridge below the village mon nod he head and continue to give he attention to he plate juanita look well -- and happy he say after a pause sarrion look at he and make no reply he be borrow from the absent marco a trick of silence which he know to be effective in a subtle war of word do you not think so i be sure of it evasio sarrion be wonder why he have come to torre garda -- this stormy petrel of clerical politics -- whose come never bode good mon be much too wise to be audacious for audacity 's sake he be not a theatrical man but one who have work consistently and steadily for a cause all through he life he be too much in earnest to consider effect or heed danger i be not on the win side but i be sure that i be on the right one he have once say in public and the speech go the round of spain after he have finish luncheon he speak of take he leave and ask if he might be allow to congratulate marco on he escape it should be a warn to he he go on not to ride at night to do so be to court mishap in these narrow mountain road yes say sarrion slowly will he nurse allow I to see he ask the visitor he nurse be juanita i will go and ask she reply sarrion look round he quite openly to make sure that there be no letter lie about on the table of the terrace that mon might be tempt to read in he absence he hurry to marco ' room marco be out of bed he be dress with the help of he servant and the visitor from the mountain with a quick gesture marco indicate the open window through which the sound of any exclamation might easily reach the ear of evasio mon juanita have go he say in french read that note it be he do of course i know now write juanita why you be afraid of my grow up but i be grow up -- and i have find out why you marry I i know it would come sooner or later say marco who wince as he draw he sleeve over he injured arm he be very quiet and collect as people usually be in face of a long anticipated danger which when it come at last bring with it a dull sense of relief sarrion make no reply perhaps he too have anticipate this moment a girl be a closed book neither know what might be write in the hidden page of juanita 's heart a crisis usually serve to accentuate the weakness or strength of a man 's character marco be intensely practical at this moment -- more practical than ever he have only one thought -- the thought that fill he life -- which be juanita 's welfare if he could not make she happy he could at all event shield she from harm he could stand between she and the world she can only have go down the valley he say continue to speak in french which be a second mother tongue to he she must have go to sor teresa he have induce she to go by some trick he would not dare to send she anywhere else i hear a carriage cross the bridge reply sarrion he hear it also and ask what it be the next moment he speak of juanita the sound must have put the thought of juanita into he mind which mean that he provide the carriage he must have have it wait in the village whatever he may undertake be always perfectly organise we know that how long ago be that a hour ago and more marco nod and glance at the clock he will no doubt have make arrangement for she to get safely through to pampeluna then where be you go ask sarrion perceive that marco be slip into he pocket the arm without which he never travel in the mountain after she be the reply to bring she back no marco pause for a moment look from the window across the valley to the pine-clad height with thoughtful eye he hold odd view -- now deem chivalrous and old-fashioned -- on the question of a woman 's liberty to seek she own happiness in she own way such view be unnecessary to-day when woman be so to speak up and fight they belong to the day of we grandmother who have less knowledge and much more wisdom for they know that it be always more profitable to receive a gift than demand a right the measure will be fuller no not unless it be she own wish he say sarrion make no answer in human difficulty there be usually nothing to be say there be nearly always one clear course to steer and the deviation be only find by too much talk and too much licence give to crooked mind if happiness be not to be find in the straight way nothing be gain by turn into by-path to seek it a few find it and a great number be not unhappy who have see it down a side-path and have yet hold they course in the straight way will you keep he in the library -- make the excuse that the sun be too hot on the verandah -- until i be go say marco i will follow and at all event see that she arrive safely at pampeluna sarrion give a curt laugh we may be able he say to turn to good account evasio 's conviction that you be ill in bed when in reality you be in the saddle he will soon find out of course -- but in the meantime yes say marco with a slow smile in the meantime he leave the room as he speak but turn on the threshold to look back over he shoulder he eye be alight with anger and the smile have lapse into a grin sarrion go down to the verandah to entertain the unsought guest they have give we coffee he say in the library it be too hot in the sun although we be still in march will you come and what have juanita decree ask mon when they be seat and sarrion have light he cigarette the verdict have go against you reply sarrion juanita have decree most emphatically that you be not to be allow to see marco mon laugh and spread out he hand with a characteristic gesture of bland acceptance of the inevitable the man it seem be a philosopher a person that be to say who will play to the end a game which he know he can not win aha he laugh so we arrive at the point where a woman hold the casting vote it be the point to which all man travel they have always hold the casting vote -- ce dame -- and we can only bow to the inevitable and juanita be grow up one see it she be begin to record she vote yes answer sarrion with a narrow smile she be begin to record she vote with a spanish formality of manner sarrion place he horse at the disposition of evasio mon should the traveller feel disposed to pass the night at torre garda but mon decline i be a bird of passage he explain i be due in pampeluna again to-night i shall enjoy the ride down the valley now that you hospitality have so well equip I for the journey -- he break off and look towards the open window listen sarrion have also be listen he have hear the thud of marco ' horse as it pass across the wooden bridge below the village gun again he suggest with a short laugh i certainly hear something mon answer and rise briskly from he chair he go to the window sarrion follow he and they stand side by side look out over the valley at that moment that which be more of a vibration than a sound come to they ear across the mountain -- deep and foreboding i think i be right say mon in little more than a whisper the carlist be abroad my friend and i who be a man of peace must get within the city wall with a easy laugh he say good-bye in a few minute he be in the saddle ride leisurely down the valley of the wolf after juanita -- with marco de sarrion in between they on the road chapter xxv war 's alarm juanita 's carriage emerge from the valley of the wolf into the plain at sunset she could see that the driver pay but little heed to he horse he attention wander constantly to the mountain for instead of look to the road in front he head be ever to the right and he eye search the plain and the bare brown hill at last he pull up and turn on he box hold up one finger listen señorita he say and he dark eye be alight with excitement juanita stand up and listen look westward as he do the sound be like the sound of thunder but shorter and sharper what be it the carlist -- the son of dog he answer with a laugh and he shake he whip towards the mountain see he say gather up the rein again that dust on the road to the west -- that be the troops march out from pampeluna we be in it again -- in it again at the gate of the city there be a crowd of people the carriage have to stand aside against the tree to let pass the gun which clatter down the slope the man be laugh and shout to each other the officer erect on they horse seem to think only of the safety of the gun as a woman enter a ballroom review she jewelery with a quick comprehensive glance at the guard-house beneath the second gateway there occur another delay the driver be a pampeluna man and well-known to the sentry but they do not recognize he passenger and send for the officer on duty the señorita juanita de mogente he mutter as he come into the road -- a stout and grizzled warrior smoking a cigarette ah yes he say with a grave bow at the carriage door i remember you as a schoolgirl i remember now forgive the delay and pass in -- señora de sarrion juanita be usher into the little bare waiting-room in the convent school of the sister of the true faith in the calle de la dormitaleria it be a small square apartment at the end of a long and dark passage the day filter dimly into it through a bar window no larger than a pocket-handkerchief juanita stand on tiptoe and look into a narrow alley on the sill of this window marco have stand to wrench apart the bar of the window immediately overhead through which he have lift she one cold night -- year and year ago it seem nothing have change in this gloomy house the dear sister superior be at prayer in the chapel the doorkeeper have whisper the usual formulum for a nun must always be give the benefit of the doubt if she be alone in she cell or in the chapel it be always piously assume that she be at prayer juanita smile at the familiar word then i will wait she say but not very long she give the nun a familiar little nod of warn as if to intimate that no trick of the trade need be try upon she she stand alone in the little gray dim room now and wait with brooding eye within all be quiet with that air of awesome mystery peculiar to the cloister which so soon give place with increase familiarity to a sense of deadly monotony it be only from outside that the mystery of the cloister continue to interest juanita know every stone in this silent house its daily round of artificial duty appear small to she eye they have nothing to do all day in a nunnery she once say to marco in jest so they rise up very early in the morning to do it she have laugh on first see the mark of marco ' heel on the window-sill she turn and look at it again now -- without laugh and she think of torre garda with its keen air cool to the cheek like spring water with the scent of the bracken that she love with the tall still pine upright against the sky motionless whisper with the wind she have always think that the cloister represent safety and peace in a world of strife and now that she be back within the wall she feel that it be better to be in the world to take part in the strife if necessary for heaven have give she a proud and a fierce heart she would rather be miserable here all she life than go back to marco who have dare to marry she without love she the door of the waiting-room open and sor teresa stand on the threshold i have come back say juanita i think i shall go into religion i have leave torre garda she give a short laugh and look curiously at sor teresa -- impassive in she straight-hanging robe so you have get I back she say back to the convent not to this convent reply sor teresa quietly but i have come back i shall come back -- the mother superior the mother superior be in saragossa i be mistress here reply sor teresa standing still and dark like one of the pine at torre garda the sarrion blood be rise to she pale cheek she eye glow darkly beneath she overshadow head-dress command -- that indefinable spirit which be vouchsafe to gentle people while rough and strong man miss it -- be write in every line of she face every fold of she dress in the quiet of she small white hand rest motionless against she skirt juanita stand look at she with flash eye with she head throw back with clench hand then i will go somewhere else but i do not understand you you always want I to go into religion sor teresa hold up one hand and cut short she speech for the habit of obedience be so strong that clear-headed man will deliberately go to they death rather than relinquish it the gesture be know to juanita it be dread in the school think -- say sor teresa think before you say that well argue juanita if you do not urge I in word you use every means in you power to induce I to take the veil -- to make it impossible for I to do anything else think urge sor teresa think again do not include I in such generality without think juanita pause she run back in she mind over a hundred incident of school life remember as such be with photographic accuracy well she admit at length you do you best to make I hate it -- at all event ah say sor teresa with a slow smile then you do not want I to go into religion -- juanita come a step nearer and peer into sor teresa 's face she might as well have seek a answer in a face of stone answer I she say impatiently all be not suit for the religious life answer the sister superior after the manner of she teaching i have know many such and i have see much sorrow arise from a mistaken sense of duty i have hear of life wreck by it -- i have know of two juanita who have move away impatiently now turn and look at sor teresa the gloom of evening be gather in the little bare room the stillness of the convent be oppressive be you suit to the religious life ask the girl suddenly but sor teresa make no answer juanita sit suddenly down she movement be quick and impulsive still as they have be when she be a schoolgirl when she have arrive at the convent she have feel hungry and tire the feeling come back to she with renew intensity now she be sick at heart the gray twilight within these wall be like the gloom of a hopeless life i wonder who the other be she say half to herself for the world be open out before she like a great book hitherto close the life of man and woman have gain depth and meaning in a flash of thought she rise and impulsively kiss sor teresa i use to be afraid of you she say with a laugh which seem to surprise she as if the voice that have speak be not she own then she sit down again it be almost dark in the room now and the window glimmer a forlorn gray i be so hungry and tired say juanita in rather a faint voice but i be glad i come i could not stay in torre garda another hour marco marry I for my money the money be want for political purpose they could not get it without I -- so i be throw in she drop she two hand heavily on the table and look up as if expect some exclamation of surprise or horror but she hearer make no sign do you know this she ask in a altered voice after a pause be you in the plot too as well as marco and uncle ramon have you be scheming all this time as well that i should marry marco since you ask I say sor teresa slowly and coldly i think you would be happier marry to marco than in religion it be only my opinion of course and you must decide for yourself it be probably the opinion of other however as well there be plenty of girl who oh be there cry juanita passionately who -- i should like to know i be only speak in generality my child juanita look at she suspiciously she April eye glitter with a new light i think you mean milagro he once say that he think she pretty and like she hair it be red everybody know that besides we be marry she drop she tired head upon she fold arm -- a schoolgirl attitude which return naturally to she amid the old surroundings i do not care what become of I she say wearily i do not know what to do it be very hard that papa should be dead and leon leon such a preposterous stupid you know he be sor teresa do not deny this sisterly truth but stand motionless wait for juanita 's decision i be so hungry and tired she say at length i suppose i can have something to eat if i pay for it yes you can have something to eat and i may be allow to stay here to-night at all event no you can not do that answer the sister superior juanita look up in surprise then what be i to do where be i to go back to you husband be the reply in the same gentle inexorable voice i will take you back to marco -- that be all i will do for you i will take you myself juanita laugh scornfully and shake she head she have plenty of that spirit which will fight to the end and overcome fatigue and hunger you may be mistress here she say but i do not think you can deny I a lodge you can not turn I out into the street under exceptional circumstance i can do both ah mutter juanita incredulously and those circumstance have arise there you can satisfy yourself she lay before juanita on the bare table a paper which it be not possible to read in the semi-darkness she turn to the mantelpiece where two tall candle add to the sacerdotal simplicity of the room while the sulphur match burnt blue juanita look indifferently at the print paper it be a siege notice say sor teresa see that she hearer refuse to read it be sign by general pacheco who arrive here with a large army to-day it be expect that pampeluna may be besiege by to-morrow evening the investment may be a long one which will mean starvation every householder must make a return of those dwelling under he roof he must refuse domicile to any stranger and i refuse to take you into this house juanita read the paper now by the light of the candle which sor teresa set on the table it be a curt military document without explanation or unnecessary mitigation of the truth for pampeluna have see the like before and understand this business thoroughly you can think about it say sor teresa folding the paper and place it in she pocket i will send you something to eat and drink in this room she close the door leave juanita to realize the grim fact that -- shape we life how we will with all foresight -- every care -- the history of the world or of a nation will suddenly break into the story of the single life and march over it with a giant stride presently a lay-sister bring refreshment and set the tray on the table without speak juanita know she well -- and she doubtless know juanita 's story for she pious face be draw into line indicative of the deepest disapproval juanita eat heartily enough not notice the cold simplicity of the fare she have finish before sor teresa return and without thinking of what she be do have rearrange the tray after the manner of the refectory she be stand by the window which she have open the sound of war come into the room with startling distinctness the boom of the distant gun dispute the advance of the carlist while nearer the bugle call the man to arm and the heavy tramp of foot come and go in the calle de la dormitaleria well ask sor teresa what have you decide to do juanita listen to the alarm of war for a moment before turn from the window it be not a false alarm she inquire the carlist be really out for she have fall into the habit of the northern province of speaking of the insurrection as if it be a recurrent flood they have be prepare all the winter answer sor teresa and pampeluna be to be invest yes and torre garda torre garda answer the nun be to be take this time the carlist have decide to besiege it it be at the mouth of the valley that the fighting be take place then i will go back to torre garda say juanita chapter xxvi at the ford they will allow two nun to pass anywhere say sor teresa with she chilling smile as she lead the way to she own cell in the corridor overhead she provide juanita with that dress which be a passport through any quarter of a town across any frontier to any battlefield so juanita take the veil at last -- in order to return to marco sor teresa 's word prove true enough at the city gate where the sentinel recognize she and allow she carriage to pass across the drawbridge by a careless nod of acquiescence to the driver it be a clear dark night without a moon the prevail wind which hurry down from the pyrenee to the warmer plain of spain stir the bud leaf of the tree that border the road below the town wall i suppose say sor teresa suddenly that evasio mon be at torre garda to-day yes and you leave he there when you come away yes we shall meet he on the road say sor teresa with a note of anxiety in she voice presently she stand up in the carriage which be a open one on high wheel and speak to the driver in a low voice into he ear he be a stout and respectable man with a good ecclesiastical clientèle in the pious capital of navarre he have a confidential manner the distant firing have cease now and a great stillness reign over the bare land there be no tree here to harbor bird or to rustle in the wind the man nursing he horse for the long journey drive at a easy pace juanita usually voluble enough seem to have nothing to say to sor teresa the driver could possibly overhear the conversation of he passenger for this or for another reason sor teresa be silent as they approach the hill they find themselves in a more broken country they climb and descend with a rather irritating regularity the spur of the pyrenee keep they form right down to the plain and the road to torre garda pass over they juanita lean sideways out of the carnage and stare upward into the pine tree do you see anything ask sor teresa no -- i can see nothing there be a chapel up there on the slope we lady of the shadow answer juanita and lapse into silence again she know now why the name have strike she with such foreboding when she have learn it from the lip of the laughing young captain of infantry it tell of calamity -- the greatest that can happen to a woman -- to be marry without love the driver turn in he seat and try to overhear he seem uneasy and look about he with quick turn of the head at last when he horse be mount a hill he turn round do these sainted lady hear anything he ask no answer sor teresa why do you ask there have be a man on horseback on the road behind we he answer with assume carelessness all the way from pampeluna he have now take a short cut and be in front on the road above we i can hear he that be all and he give a little cry to he horse the signal for they to trot they be approach the mouth of the valley of the wolf and could hear the sound of its wild water in the darkness below they the valley open out like a fan with either slope rise at a easy angle to the pine wood the road be a cornice cut on the western bank upon which side it run for ten mile until the bridge below the village of torre garda lead it across the river to the sunny slope where the village crouch below the ancient castle from which the name be take the horse be go at a walk pace now and the driver to show perhaps he nonchalance and fearlessness be hum a song beneath he breath when suddenly the hillside burst into flame and a deafening roar of musketry stun both horse and driver juanita happen to be look up at the hillside and she see the fire run along like a snake of flame in the grass in a moment the carriage have swing round and the horse be go at a gallop down the hill again the driver stand up he have a rein in either hand and he haul the horse round each successive corner with consummate skill all the while he use language which would have huddle cousin peligro shriek in the bottom of the carriage juanita and sor teresa stand up and look back by the light of the firing they see a man lie low on he horse 's neck gallop headlong through the zone of death after they do you hear the bullet say juanita breathlessly they be like the wind through the telegraph-wire oh i should like to be a man i should like to be a soldier and she give a low laugh of thrilling excitement the driver be now pull up he horse he too laugh aloud it be the troops he cry they think we be the carlist but who be this señoras it be that man again he lean back and hastily twist one of the carriage-lamps round in its socket so as to show a light behind he towards the newcomer as the rider pull up he come within the ray of the lamp which be a powerful one and at the sight of he juanita give a sharp cry which neither she nor any that hear it forget to the end of they life it be marco she cry clutch sor teresa 's arm and he come through that -- he come through that no one hurt ask marco ' deep voice no one hurt señor answer the driver who have recognize he and the horse the horse be safe a malediction upon they they nearly have we over the cliff those be the troops they take we for carlist no say marco they be the carlist the troops have be drive farther up the valley where they be entrench they have send to pampeluna for help this be a carlist trap to catch the reinforcement as they approach they think you carriage be a gun the driver scratch he head and make know he view as to the ancestory of the carlist there be no get into the valley to-night say marco to sor teresa and juanita you must return to pampeluna and what will you do ask juanita in a hard voice i will go on to torre garda on foot answer marco speak in french so that the driver should not hear and understand there be a way over the mountain which be know to two or three only uncle ramon be at torre garda ask juanita in the same curt quick way yes then i will go with you she say with she hand already on the door it be sixteen mile say marco over the high mountain the last part can only be do by daylight i shall be in the mountain all night juanita have open the door she stand on the step look up at he as he sit on the tall black horse if you will take I she say in french i will come with you sor teresa be silent still she have not speak since marco have pull up he sweating horse in the lamplight what a simple world this would be if more of its woman know when to hold they tongue marco fresh from a bed of sickness be not fit to undertake this journey he must already be tire out for she know that it be marco who have follow they carriage from pampeluna she guess that find no troops where he expect to find they he have ride ahead to discover the cause of it and have pass unheard through the carlist ambush and back again through the zone of fire that juanita could accomplish the journey on foot to torre garda seem doubtful the country be unsafe the snow have hardly melt it be madness for a wounded man and a girl to attempt to reach torre garda through a pass hold by the enemy but sor teresa say nothing marco sit motionless in the saddle he face be above the radius of the reversed carriage-lamp while juanita standing on the dusty road in she nun 's dress look up at he be close to the glaring light it be to be presume that he be watch she descend from the carriage and then turn to shut the door on sor teresa by he silence marco seem to consent to this arrangement he come forward into the light now in he hand he hold a paper which he be unfold juanita recognize the letter she have write to he in the drawing-room at torre garda he tear the blank sheet off and folding the letter closely replace it in he pocket then he lay the blank sheet on the dusty splash-board of the carriage and write a few word in pencil you must get back to pampeluna he say to the driver in that tone of command which be the only survival of feudal day now leave in europe -- and even the modern spaniard be lose it -- at any cost -- you understand if you meet the reinforcement on the road give this note to the commanding officer take no denial give it into he own hand if you meet no troops go straight to the house of the commandant at pampeluna and give the letter to he you will see that it be do he say in a lower voice turn to sor teresa the man protest that nothing short of death would prevent he carry out the instruction it will be worth you while say marco it will be remembered afterwards he pause deep in think there be a hundred thing to be consider at that moment quickly and carefully for he be go into the valley of the wolf cut off from all the world by two army watch each other with a deadly hatred the quiet voice of sor teresa break the silence softly take its place in he thought it seem that the sarrion brain have the power -- the secret of so much success in this world -- of thrust forth a sure and steady hand to grasp the heart of a question and tear it from the tangle of side-issue among which the majority of man and woman be condemn to flounder where be evasio mon she ask marco answer with a low contented laugh he be trap in the valley he say in french i have see to that the firing have cease as suddenly as it have commence and a silence only break by the voice of the river now hang over the valley be you ready sor teresa ask she driver yes excellency then go she may have nod a farewell to marco and juanita but that they could not see in the blackness of the night she certainly give they no speak salutation the carriage move away at a sharp trot leave marco and juanita alone we can ride some distance and must ford the river higher up say marco at once he do not seem to want any explanation the excitement of the moment seem to have wipe out the event of the last few month like write off a slate juanita be young again ready to throw herself headlong into a adventure in the mountain with marco such as they have have together many time during the holiday but this be better than the danger of mere snow and ice for juanita have taste that highest of emotion the excitement of battle she have hear that which some man have once hear can not live without the siren song of a bullet be we go nearer to the carlist she ask hurriedly there be fight blood in she vein and the tone of she voice tell clearly enough that it be astir at this moment yes answer marco we must pass underneath they for the ford be there we must be quite noiseless we must not even whisper he edge he horse towards one of the rough stone lay on the outer edge of the road to mark its limit at night i can only give you one hand he say can you get up from this stone behind you ask juanita as we use to ride when i be -- little for marco have like most spaniard grow from boyhood to manhood in the saddle and juanita have no fear of horse she clamber to the broad back of the moor and settle herself there sit pillion fashion and hold herself in position with both hand round marco if he trot i fall off she say with a eager laugh they soon quit the road and begin to descend the steep slope towards the river by a narrow path only make visible by the open space in the high brushwood it be the way down to a ford lead to a cottage by courtesy call a farm though the cultivate land be scarcely a acre in extent reclaim from the river-bed the ground be soft and mossy and the roar of the river cover the tread of the careful horse in a few minute they reach the water 's edge and after a moment 's hesitation the moor step boldly in on the other bank marco whisper to juanita to drop to the ground the cottage be here he say i shall leave the horse in they shed he descend from the saddle and they stand for a moment side by side let we wait a few moment the moon be rise say marco perhaps the carlist have be here as he speak the sky grow lighter in a minute or two a wane moon look out over the sharp outline of hill and flood the valley with a reddish light it be all right he say nothing be disturb here they be asleep in the cottage the noise of the river must have drown the firing they be friend of mine they will give we some food for to-morrow morning and another dress for you you can not go in that oh laugh juanita i have take the veil it be do now and can not be undo she raise she hand to the wing of she spreading cap as if to defend it against all comer and marco turn suddenly throw he uninjured arm round she imprison she struggle arm he hold she thus a prisoner while with he injured hand he find the string of the cap in a moment the starched linen flutter out fall into the river and be carry swirl away juanita be still laugh but marco do not answer to she gaiety she recollect at that instant have once threaten to dress as a nun in order to alarm marco and sarrion 's grave remark that it would of a certainty frighten he they be silent for a moment then juanita speak with a sort of forced lightness you may have only one arm she say but it be a astonishingly strong one and she look at he surreptitiously beneath she lash as she stand with she hand on she hair chapter xxvii in the cloud marco tie he horse to a tree and lead the way towards the cottage it seem to be innocent of bar and bolt the ford know to so few and the evil name of the wolf serve instead the door open at a push and marco go in a wood-fire smoulder on a open hearth while the acrid smoke half-filled the room blacken by the fume of peat and charcoal marco stand on the threshold and call the owner by name there be a shuffling sound in a inner room and the scrape of a match a minute later a door be open and a old woman stand in the aperture fully dress and carry a lamp above she head ah she say it be you i think it be the voice of a friend and you have you pretty wife there what be you do abroad at this hour the carlist yes answer marco rather quickly the carlist we can not pass by the road so have send the carriage back and be go across the mountain the woman hold up she hand and shake they from side to side in a gesture of horror ah but there she cry i know what you be there be no turn you back on you road if you say you will go -- you will go though it rain rock but

laugh all the valley know that they be not bad admit the mother but it be a flower compare to a cabbage still we can hide the flower in the cabbage leave if you like and she laugh heartily at she own conceit then see to it while i put my horse away say marco he quit the hut and overhear the woman point out to juanita that she have lose she mantilla come through the tree in the dark while he attend to he horse he could hear they laughter and gay conversation over the change of clothes for juanita understand these people as well as he do and have grow through childhood to the age of think in they midst the peasant be still press a simple hospitality upon juanita when marco return to the cottage and find she ready for the journey i be tell the señora explain the woman volubly that she must not

accommodate herself with a rest of two hour in the hay the woman press upon they some of she small store of coffee and some new bread he can well prepare you breakfast for you she say confidentially to juanita he be like one of we all the valley will tell you that a great gentleman who can yet cook he own breakfast -- as the good god mean they to be they set forth at once in the yellow light of the wane moon marco lead the way up a pathway hardly discernible amid the rock and undergrowth once or twice he turn to help juanita over a hard or a dangerous place but they do not talk as conversation be not only difficult but inexpedient they have climb for two hour slowly and steadily when the bark of a dog on the mountainside above they notify they that they be near they destination who be it ask a voice presently marcos de sarrion reply marco strike no light we have no candle up here answer the man with a laugh he only speak basque and it be in this language that marco give a brief explanation juanita sit on a rock she be tire out there be three man -- short thick-set and silent a father and two son they stand in front of marco and speak in monosyllable after the manner of old friend under he direction they bring a heap of dry bracken and hay in a shed little more than a roof and four upright they make a rough couch for juanita which they hedge round with heap of bracken to protect she from the wind you will see the star say the old man shake out the blanket which marco have carry up from the cottage at the ford it be good to see the star when you awake in the night one remember that the saint be watch in a few minute juanita be sleep like a child curl up beneath she blanket and hear through she dream the low voice of marco and the peasant talk hurriedly in the half-ruined cottage for marco and these three be the only man who know the way over the mountain to torre garda the dawn be just break when marco awake juanita oh she say plaintively i have only be asleep ten minute you have sleep three hour reply marco in that hushed voice in which it seem natural to speak before the dawn i be make coffee -- come when you be ready juanita find a pail of

tender and wise smile i know what it be that make man gipsy she say when she join marco who be attend to a fire of stick on the ground at the cottage door i shall always have a kindly feel for they now they get something straight from heaven which be never know to people who sleep in stuffy house and get up to wash in warm water she give a little shiver at the recollection of she ablutions and

go down to fetch he mother up here to bake bread all day there will be a little army here to-night juanita stand watch marco who seem entirely absorb in blow up the fire with a pair of dilapidated bellows i suppose she say lightly that it be of these thing that you be think when you be so silent as we climb up here last night i suppose so answer marco juanita look at he with a little frown as if she do not quite believe he the day have now come and a pink light suffused the topmost peak a faint warmth spread itself like a caress across the valley and turn the cold air into a pearly mist of what be you think ask marco suddenly for juanita have stand motionless watch he i be think what a comfort it be that you be not a indoor man she reply with a careless laugh the peasant have bring they cow to the high pasture so there be plenty of milk in the cottage which be little more than a dairy for it have no furniture beyond a few straw mattress throw on the floor in one corner marco serve breakfast pedro particularly tell I to see that you have the cup which have a handle he say pour the coffee from a battered coffee-pot during they simple breakfast they be silent there be a subtle constraint juanita who have a quick and direct mind decide that the moment have come for that explanation for which marco do not ask a explanation do not improve by keep they be alone here -- alone in the world it seem -- for the cow have stray away the dog have go to the valley with they master she and marco have always know each other she know he every thought she be not afraid of he she never have be why should she be now marco she say yes i want you to give I the letter i write to you at torre garda he feel in he pocket and hand she the first paper he find without particularly look at it juanita unfold it it be the note all crumpled which she have thrust through the wall of the convent school at saragossa she have forget it but marco have keep it all this time that be the wrong one she say gravely and hand it back to marco who take it with a little jerk of the head as of annoyance at he own stupidity he be usually very accurate in detail he give she in exchange the right paper which have be tear in two the other half be in the military despatch office in madrid to-day juanita have arrange in she own mind what to say she be quite mistress of the situation and be ready to move serenely and surely in she own sphere take the lead in such subtle matter with the capability and mastery which characterise marco ' lead in affair of action but marco ' mistake seem to have put out she prearranged scheme she slowly tear the letter into piece and throw it on the fire do you know why i come back she ask which question can hardly have form part of the plan of action no because you never pretend that you care if you have pretend that you care for I i should never have forgive you marco do not answer he look up slowly expect perhaps to find she look elsewhere but she eye meet he and she shrink back with a involuntary movement that seem to be of fear she face flush all over and then the color fade from it leave she white and motionless as she sit stare into the flicker wood-fire presently she rise and walk to the edge of the plateau upon which the hut be build she stand there look across to the mountain marco busy himself with the simple possession of he host set they in order where he have find they and tread out the smoulder ember of the fire juanita turn and watch he over she shoulder with a mystic persistency beneath she lash lurk a smile -- triumphant and tender chapter xxviii le gant de velours they accomplish the rest of the journey without accident the old spirit of adventure which have lead they to these mountain while they be yet child seem to awaken again and they be as comrade but juanita be absent-minded she be not climb skilfully at one place far above tree or other vegetation she make a false step and send a great rock roll down the slope you must be careful say marco almost sharply you be not think what you be do and juanita suffer the reproof with a unwonted meekness she be more careful while they pass over a dangerous slope where the snow have soften in the morning sun and come to the topmost valley -- a oval basin of rock and snow with no visible outlet immediately below they at the foot of a slope which look quite feasible lay huddle the body of a man it be a carlist explain marco we hear some time ago that they have be try to find another way over to torre garda that valley be a trap that be not the way to torre garda at all and that slope be solid ice see he knife lie beside he he try to cut step before he die this be we way and he lead juanita rather hastily away at nine o'clock they pass the last shoulder and stand above torre garda and the valley of the wolf lie in the sunlight below they the road down the valley lay like a yellow ribbon stretch across the broad breast of nature half a hour later they reach the pine wood and hear perro bark on the terrace the dog soon come panting to meet they and not far behind he sarrion whose face betray no surprise at perceive juanita you would have be safer at pampeluna he say with a keen glance into she face i be quite safe enough here thank you she answer meet he eye with a steady smile he ask marco whether he have feel he wounded shoulder or suffer from so much exertion and juanita answer more fully than marco give detail which she have certainly not learn from himself a man have once be nurse in sickness by a woman part with some portion of he personal liberty which she never relinquish it be the result of good nursing say sarrion slip he hand inside juanita 's arm and walking by she side it be the result of he great strength she answer with a glance towards marco which he do not perceive for he be look straight in front of he uncle ramon say juanita a hour later when they be sit on the terrace together she turn towards he suddenly with she shrewd little smile uncle ramon -- do you ever play pelota every basque play pelota he reply juanita nod and lapse into reflective silence she seem to be arrange something in she mind towards sarrion as towards marco she assume at time a attitude of protection and almost of patronage as if she know much that be hide from they and have access to some chamber of life of which the door be close to all man do it ever strike you she say at length that in a game of pelota -- suppose the ball to be endow with a well a certain lower form of intelligence the intelligence of a mere woman for instance -- it would be rather natural for it to wonder what on earth the game be about it might even think that it have a certain right to know what be happen to it yes admit sarrion who have a quick and eager mind understand that juanita be prepare to speak plainly and at such time woman always speak more plainly than man he light a cigarette throw away the match with a little gesture which seem to indicate that he be ready for she -- would meet she on she own ground why do evasio mon want I to go into religion she ask bluntly my child -- you have three million peseta and if i have go into religion -- and i nearly do -- the church would have have they pardon I say sarrion the jesuit -- not the church it be not the same thing -- though the world do not yet understand that the jesuit would have have the money and they would have spend it in throw spain into another civil war which would have be a worse war than we have see the church -- we church -- have enemy it have bismarck and the english but it have no worse enemy than the jesuit for they play they own game at pelota and you and marco we be on the other side say sarrion with a shrug of the shoulder and i have be the ball sarrion glance at she sideways this be the moment that marco have always anticipate sarrion wonder why he should have to meet it and not marco juanita sit motionless with steady eye fix on the distant mountain he look at she lip and see there a faint smile not devoid of pity -- as if she know something of which he be ignorant he pull himself together for he be a bold man who face he fence with a smile well he say since we have win have you win sarrion glance at she again why do she not speak plainly he be wonder in the subtler matter of life woman have a clearer comprehension and a plainer speech than man when they be tongue-tied -- the reason be a strong one at all event señor mon do not know when he be beat say juanita and the silence that follow be break by the distant sound of firing they be fight at the mouth of the valley that be true admit sarrion they say he be trap in the valley -- as we be so i believe will he come to torre garda as likely as not answer sarrion he have never lack audacity if he come i should like to speak to he say juanita sarrion wonder whether she intend to make evasio mon understand that he be beat it be mon himself who have say that the woman always hold the casting vote at all event say juanita who seem to have return in she thought to the question of win or lose at all event you play a bold game that be why we win say sarrion stoutly and you do not heed the risk what risk juanita turn and look at he with a little laugh of scorn oh you do not understand neither do marcos i suppose man do not you might have ruin several life so might evasio mon return sarrion sharply and juanita rather draw back as a fencer may flinch who have be touch sarrion lean back in he chair and throw away the cigarette which he have not smoke juanita have choose she own ground and he have meet she on it he have answer the question which she be too proud to ask and as he have anticipate evasio mon come to torre garda it be almost dusk when he arrive whether he know that marco be not in he room remain a open question he do not ask after he he be bring by the servant to the terrace where he find cousin peligro and juanita sarrion be in he study and come out when mon pass the open window so we be all besiege say the visitor with he tolerant smile as he take a chair offer to he in the grand manner by cousin peligro who belong to the school of etiquette that hold it wrong for any lady to be natural in the presence of man other than of she own family cousin peligro smile in rather a pinched way and with a gesture of she outspread hand morally wipe the besieger out no female sarrion she seem to imply need ever fear inconvenience from a person in uniform you and i señorita say mon with he bland and easy sympathy of manner have no business here we be person of peace cousin peligro make a condescending and yet decisive gesture pat the empty air i have my charge i shall fulfil it she say -- determine and not without a suggestion of coyness withal juanita be lie in wait for a glance from sarrion and when she receive it she make a little movement of the eyelid tell he to take cousin peligro away you will stay the night say sarrion to evasio mon no my friend thank you very much i cherish a hope of get through the line to-night to pampeluna i come indeed to offer my poor service as escort to these lady who will surely be safer at pampeluna then you think that they will besiege torre garda ask sarrion innocently one never know my friend -- one never know it seem to I that the firing be nearer this afternoon sarrion laugh you be always hear gun mon turn and look at he and there be a suggestion of melancholy in he smile ah ramon he say you and i have hear they all we life and there be perhaps a second meaning in he word know only to sarrion whose face soften for a instant let we have some coffee he say turn to cousin peligro will you see to it peligro -- in the library so peligro walk across the broad terrace with the mincing step teach in the thirty leave mon hatless with a bow head accord to the etiquette of those leisurely day he be all thing to all man by the way say sarrion and follow she without complete he sentence so juanita and evasio mon be leave alone on the terrace juanita be sit rather upright in a garden chair the only seat near to she be the easy chair just vacate by cousin peligro mon look at it he glance at juanita and then draw it forward she turn and with a smile and gesture invite he to be seat a watchful look come into evasio mon 's quick eye behind the glass that reflect the last ray of the setting sun for the young and the guilty silence have a special terror mon have deal with the young and the guilty all he life he sit down without speak he be wait for juanita juanita move she toe within she neat black slipper look at it critically she be wait for evasio mon he pause as a duellist may pause with he best weapon lay out on the table before he wonder which one to select perhaps he suspect that juanita hold the keenest that deadly plain-speaking he subtle training have teach he to sink self so completely that it be easy to he to insinuate he mind into the thought of another to understand they almost to sympathise with they but juanita puzzle he there be no face so baffling as that which a woman show the world when she be hide she heart i speak as a friend say mon when i recommend you to allow I to escort you to pampeluna i know that you always speak as a friend answer juanita quietly of mine not of marco perhaps ah but you friend be marco ' say mon with a suggestion of raillery in he voice and he enemy be mine she retort look straight in front of she of course -- be it not write in the marriage service mon laughingly turn in he chair and cast a glance up at the window as he speak they be beyond earshot of the house but why should i be a enemy of marcos de sarrion then juanita unmask she gun because he outwit you and marry I she answer for you money -- yes for my money he be quite honest about it i assure you he tell I that it be a matter of business -- of politics that be the word he use he tell you that ask mon in real surprise juanita nod she head she be look at she own slipper again and the move foot within it there be a mystic little smile at the corner of she lip which tilted upward there as humorous and tender lip nearly always do it suggest that she know something which even evasio mon the all-wise do not know and you believe he inquire mon dimly grope at the meaning of the smile he tell I that it be the only way of escape you and the rest of they and religion answer juanita -- without answer the question and you believe he repeat mon which be a mistake for she turn on he at once and answer yes mon shrug he shoulder with the tolerant air of one who have meet defeat time after time who expect naught else perhaps then there be nothing more to be say he observe carelessly you elect to remain at torre garda i bow to you decision my child i have warn you against marco mon shrug he shoulder a second time and in reply to you warning say juanita slowly i will tell you that marco have never do or say anything unworthy of a spanish gentleman -- and there be no better gentleman in the world which statement all man will assuredly be ready to admit mon turn and look at she with a odd smile ah he say you have fall in love with marco juanita change color and she eye suddenly light with anger i be not afraid of anything you may say or do she say i have marco marco have always outwit you when you have come in contact with he marco be cleverer than you he be stronger she pause mon be slowly draw he glove through he hand which be white and smooth that be the difference between you she continue you wear glove marco take hold of life with he bare hand you may be more cunning but marco outwit you the mind seek but the heart find you mind may be subtle -- but marco have a better heart mon have rise he stand with he face half turn away from she so that she could only see he profile and for a moment she be sorry for he that one moment which always mar a earthly victory he turn away from she and walk slowly towards the library window which stand open and give passage to the sound of move cup and saucer we all carry with we through life the remembrance of certain word probably forget by the speaker a few bear the keener sharper memory of word unspoken juanita never forget the silence of evasio mon as he walk away from she a moment later she hear he laugh and talk in the library he have come on horseback and sarrion accompany he to the stable on he departure they be both young for they year the spaniard of the north be thin and lithe and long-lived sarrion offer he hand for mon 's knee who with this aid spring into the saddle he turn and look towards the terrace juanita he say and pause she be no longer a child one hope that she may have a happy life see that so many do not sarrion make no answer we be not weakling continue mon lightly you and marco and i we may sweat and toil as we will -- but believe I there be more power in juanita 's little finger it be the casting vote -- amigo -- the casting vote he wave a salutation as he ride away chapter xxix la main de fer juanita be very early astir the next morning the house be peculiarly quiet but she know that marco if he have be abroad have now return for perro be lie on the terrace in the sunlight watch the library window juanita go to that room and there find marco write letter a map of the valley of the wolf lay open on the table beside he you be always write letter she say you begin write they on the splash-board of the carriage at the mouth of the valley and you have be do it ever since they be make use of my knowledge of the valley he reply he continue he task after a very quick glance up at she juanita have find out that he rarely look at she i be not at all tire after we adventure she say i make up last night for the want of sleep do i look tired not at all answer marco glance no higher than she waist but i have a dream she say it be so vivid that i be not sure now that it be a dream i be not sure that i do not in reality get out of bed quite early in the morning before daylight when the moon be just touch the mountain and look out of my window and the terrace marco be cover with soldier row and row of they like shadow and at the end beneath my window stand a group of man some be officer one look like general pacheco fat with a chuckle laugh another seem to be captain zeneta -- the friend who stand by we in the chapel of we lady of the shadow -- who be say he prayer you remember most young man be too conceit to say they prayer nowadays and there be two civilian in riding-boot all dusty who look singularly like you and uncle ramon it be a odd dream marco -- be it not yes answer he with a laugh do not tell it to the wrong people as joseph do no you reverence she say she stand look at he with grave eye be there go to be a battle she ask curtly yes where he point down into the valley with he pen just above the bridge if it all come off as they have plan she go out on to the terrace and look down into the valley which be peaceful enough in the morning light the thin smoke of the pine wood-fire rise from the chimney in column of brilliant blue the sheep on the slope across the valley be call to they lamb then juanita return to the library window and stand on the threshold with brooding eye and a bright patch of color in she cheek will you do I a favor she ask of course he lift he pen from the paper but do not look up if there be a battle -- if there be any fighting will you take great care of yourself it would be so terrible if anything happen to you for uncle ramon i mean yes answer marco gravely i understand i promise to take care juanita still linger at the window and you always keep you promise do not you to the letter why should not i no of course not it be characteristic of you that be all you promise be a sort of rock that nothing can move woman you know make a promise and then ask to be let off you would not do that no answer marco quite simply in navarre the hour of meal be much the same as those that rule in england to-day at one o'clock luncheon both marco and sarrion be at home the valley seem quiet enough the soldier of juanita 's dream seem to have vanish like the shadow to which she compare they i be sure say cousin peligro while they be still at the table that the sound of firing approach i have a very delicate hearing all my sens be very highly develop the sound of the firing be nearer marco zeneta be retreat slowly before the enemy with he small force explain marco but why be he do that he must surely know that there be lady at torre garda lady be not article of war say juanita with a frivolous disregard of cousin peligro ' reprove face and this be war as she speak marco rise and quit the room after glance at he watch juanita follow he marco she say in the hall have close the dining-room door behind she will you tell I what time it will begin zeneta be time to retreat across the bridge at three o'clock the enemy will it be hope follow he and where will you be i shall be with pacheco and he staff on the hill behind pedro 's mill you will see a little flag wherever pacheco be cousin peligro ' delicate hearing have not be deceive the firing be now close at hand the valley take a turn to the leave below the ridge and upon the hillside above this corner the white irregular line of smoke now become visible in a few minute the dark mass of zeneta 's man appear on the road at the corner he be before he time the man be run they raise the dust like a troop of sheep and move in a halo of it every hundred yard they stop and fire a volley they be act with perfect regularity and from a distance look like toy soldier they be retreat in good order and the sound of they volley come at regular interval on the bridge they halt they be go to make a stand here as would seem natural have they have artillery they could have effectually hold this strong and narrow place it now become apparent that they be a woefully small detachment they could not spare man to take up position on the rocky hillside behind they there be a pause the carlist be wait for they skirmisher to come in from height above the road sarrion and juanita stand at the edge of the terrace sarrion be watch with a quick and comprehensive glance be general pacheco a good general ask juanita excellent sarrion do not comment further on this successful soldier they play I false the general have tell he indignantly a few hour earlier they promise I a good sum -- yes a sufficient sum but when the time come the money be not forthcoming a awkward position but i find a way out of it by be loyal suggest sarrion with a short laugh and there the conversation cease juanita look across the valley towards pedro 's mill there be no flag there all the valley be peaceful enough give in the brilliant sunshine no glint of sword or bayonet on the bridge the little knot of man await the advent of the carlist form up round the corner in a moment these come swarm over the road and the hillside the roadway be pack with they the rock and the bush above the river seem alive with they they fire independently and the hillside be white in a moment the royalist troops on the bridge fire one volley and then turn they run straight along the road some throw down they knapsack one or two stop seem to hesitate and then lay they down on the road like a tired child other limp to the side and sit there all the while the carlist come on the rear rank be still come round the corner the skirmisher be already across the bridge there be only one place for zeneta 's man to run to now -- the castle of torre garda they be already at the foot of the slope juanita and sarrion could distinguish the slim form of they commander walk along the road behind he man sword in hand sometimes he run a few step but for the most part he walk with long steady stride shepherd he man they begin to climb the slope and zeneta take up he position on a rock jut out of the hillside he stand on tiptoe and watch the bridge the last of the carlist be on it now juanita could see he eager face with intrepid eye alert and lip apart draw back over he tooth she glance at sarrion whose lip be the same he eye glitter he be bite he lower lip as the last man run across the bridge on the heel of he comrade zeneta look across the valley towards the water mill he wave he handkerchief high above he head a little flag flutter above the tree grow round the mill-wheel cousin peligro be only human now come to the terrace to see what be happen she have take the precaution of put on she mitten and open she parasol what be the meaning of this noise she ask but neither sarrion nor juanita seem to hear she they be watch the little flag which seem to be descend the hill so close beneath the house be zeneta 's man now that those on the terrace could hear he voice the bridge say sarrion under he breath look at the bridge it be half hide in the smoke that still hover in the air but something be take place there man be run hither and thither the sunlight glitter on uniform and bayonet gun say sarrion curtly and as he speak the whole valley shake beneath they foot a roar seem to arise from the river and spread all up the hill and simultaneously a cloak of white smoke be lay over the green slope juanita see zeneta stand for a moment with sword uphold while he man gather round he then with a wild shout of exultation he lead they down the hill again before he have run ten pace he fall -- he foot seem to slip from under he and he lay at full length for a moment -- then he be up again and at the head of he man a bullet come singing up over the low brushwood and a distant tinkle of fall glass tell that it have find its billet in a window the bush in the garden seem suddenly alive with rustling life and sarrion drag juanita back from the balustrade no -- no she say angrily yes -- i promise marco answer sarrion with he arm round she waist in a moment they be in the library where they find cousin peligro in a easy chair with fold hand and the face of a very early christian martyr i have never be treat like this before she say severely sarrion stand at the window keep juanita in it will be all over in a few minute he say holy virgin what a lesson for they the din be terrible the lady of delicate hearing place she hand over she ear not forget to curl she little finger in the manner deem irresistible by she generation quite suddenly the firing cease as if by the turning of a tap there say sarrion it be over marco say they be to be teach a lesson they have learn it he quit the room take he hat which he have throw aside juanita go to the terrace she could see nothing the whole valley be hide in smoke which roll upward in yellow cloud the air choke she she come back to the library cough and go towards the door juanita say cousin peligro i forbid you to leave the room i absolutely refuse to be leave alone then call you maid say juanita patiently where be you go i be go to follow uncle ramon down to the valley there must be hundred of wound i can do something -- then i forbid you to go it be permissible for marco to identify himself with such proceedings -- in protection of those whom providence have place under he care indeed i should expect it of he it be he duty to defend torre garda juanita look at the supine form in the easy chair yes she answer and i be mistress of torre garda which perhaps have a double meaning for when she close the door -- not without emphasis -- cousin peligro sit upright with a start juanita hurry out of the house and run down the road wind on the slope to the village the smoke choke she the air be impregnate with sulphur it seem impossible that anybody could have live through these hellish minute that be pass in front of she she see sarrion hurry in the same direction a moment later she give a little cry of joy marco be ride up the slope at a gallop he pull up when he see he father and by the time he have quit the saddle juanita be with he marco ' face be gray beneath the sunburn he eye be bloodshot and he lip be press upward in a line of deadly resolution it be the face of a man who have see something that he would never forget he look at he father evasio mon he say kill marco nod he head you do not do it say sarrion sharply no they find he among the carlist there be five or six priest it be zeneta -- wound himself -- who recognize he and tell I he be not dead when zeneta find he -- and he speak ` always the lose game ' he say then he smile -- and die sarrion turn and lead the way slowly back again towards the house juanita seem to have forget she intention of go to the valley to offer help to the nursing-sister who live in the village marco ' horse the moor be shake and drag on the bridle which he have slip over he arm he jerk angrily at the rein look back with a little exclamation of impatience juanita take the bridle from he arm and lead

that she duty lay in another direction and mon 's life well he shrug he shoulder i know say juanita quietly all about it chapter xxx the casting vote there be in one corner of the little churchyard of

valley where the carlist have leave in a position -lrb- impregnable from the front -rrb- a strong detachment to withstand the advance of any reinforcement that might be send from pampeluna to the relief of captain zeneta and he handful of man these be take in the rear by the force under general pacheco himself and annihilate this be however a matter of history as be also the reputation of pacheco a great general -- a brute they say of he in spain to this day by sunset all be quiet again at torre garda the troops quit the village as unobtrusively as they have come they have lose but few

no answer to this sarrion be read the paper very attentively but it be he who speak first i must go to saragossa he say without look up from he paper perhaps juanita will take compassion on my solitude there i always feel that it be a pity to go away from torre garda just as the spring be come say she conversationally do not you think so she glance at marco as she speak but the remark must have be address to sarrion whose reply be inaudible for some reason the two man seem ill at ease and tongue-tied there be a dull glow in marco ' eye juanita be quite cool and collect and mistress of the situation you know say marco at length in he direct way that it be only of you happiness that i be think -- you must do what you like best and you know that i subscribe to marco ' polite desire

farewell they have part at the same spot a hundred time before there be but the one train from pampeluna to saragossa and both have make the journey many time there be no question of a long absence from each other but this parting be not quite like the other neither say anything except those conventional word of farewell which from constant use have lose any meaning they ever have sarrion gather the rein in he gloved hand glance back over the collar which juanita have vigorously pull up about he ear and with a nod drive away into the night when marco who walk slowly up the slope return to the house he find it in darkness the servant have go to bed it be past ten o'clock the window of he own study have be leave open and the lamp burnt there he go in extinguish the lamp and take a candle go

hollow sound of wheel which evasio mon have mistake for gun a breeze be spring up and the candle which marco have set on a table near the open window gutter he blow it out and go out in the darkness he know where to find the chair that stand on the balcony just outside he window and sit down to listen for the rumble of the carriage across the bridge he turn he head at the sound of a window be open and perro who lay at he foot lift he nose and sniff gently a shaft of light lay across the balcony at the far end of the house juanita have open she shutter she know that sarrion must pass the bridge in a few minute and be go to listen for he marco lean forward and touch perro who understand and be still for a moment juanita appear on the balcony step to the railing and back again the shaft of light then remain half obscure by she shadow as she stand in the window she be not go to bed until she have hear sarrion cross the bridge thus they wait and in a few minute the low growling voice of the river be dominate by the hollow echo of the bridge sarrion have go juanita go within she room and extinguish the lamp it be a warm night and the pine tree give out a strong and subtle scent such as they only emit in spring the bracken add its discreet breath hardly amount to a tangible odour there be violet also not far away perro at marco ' foot stir uneasily and look up into he master 's face instinctively marco turn to look over he shoulder juanita be stand close behind he marco she say quietly you remember -- long long ago -- in the cloister at pampeluna when i be only a child -- you make a promise you promise that you would never interfere in my life yes i have come she pause and pass in front of he stand there with she back to the balustrade and she hand behind she in a attitude which be habitual to she i have come she begin again deliberately to let you off that promise -- not that you have keep it very well you know -- she break off and give a short laugh such as a man may hear perhaps once in he whole life and hear it must know that he have not live in vain but i do not mind she say she move uneasily for she eye grow accustomed to the darkness could discern he face she return to the spot where marco have first discover she behind he chair and marco -- you make another promise you say that we be only go to play at be marry -- a sort of game yes he answer steadily he do not turn he never see she hand stretch out towards he then suddenly he give a start and sit still as stone she hand be on he hair soft as the touch of a bird she finger creep down he forehead and close over he eye firmly and tenderly -- a precaution which be unnecessary in the darkness -- for she be lean over he chair and she hair dusky as the night itself fall over he face like a curtain then i think it be a stupid game -- and i do not want to play it any longer marco end of project gutenberg 's the velvet glove by henry seton merriman
