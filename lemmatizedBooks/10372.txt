honywood vachell i dedicate this book foreword the author of _ bunch grass _ venture to hope that this book will not be altogether regard as mere flotsam and jetsam of english and american magazine the story it will be find have a certain continuity and may challenge interest as apart from incident because a attempt have be make to reproduce atmosphere the atmosphere of a country that have change almost beyond recognition in three decade the author go to a wild californium cow-country just thirty year ago and remain there seventeen year during which period the land from such pastoral use as cattle and sheep-raising become subdivide into innumerable small holding he behold a new country in the making and the passing of the pioneer who settle vital difference with a pistol during those year some note outlaw range at large in the county here speak of as san lorenzo the dalton gang of train robber live and die -lrb- some with they boot on -rrb- not far from the village entitle paradise stage coach be rob frequently every large rancher suffer much at the hand of cattle and horse thief the writer have talk to frank jame the most famous of western desperado he have enjoy the acquaintance of judge lynch who hang two man from a bridge within half-a-mile of the ranch-house he remember the chinese riot he have witness many a fight between the hungry squatter and the old settler with no title to the league over which he herd roam and so in a modest way he may claim to be a historian not forget that the original signification of the word be a narrator of fable found upon fact apology be tender for the dialect to be find in these page there be no californian dialect at the time of the discovery of gold the state be flood with man from all part of the world and

what be most hostile in the cultivate dweller in city -- be a all-pervading essence in primitive community color and discolor every phase of life and think one instance among a thousand will suffice stage coach in the writer 's county use to be hold up single-handed by a highwayman know as black bart all the foothill folk plead in extenuation of the robber that he write a copy of verse embalm he adventure which he use to pin to the nearest tree black bart would have be shoot on sight have he present he doggerel to any self-respecting western editor nevertheless the sentiment that inspire a bandit to set forth he misdeed in execrable rhyme transform he from a criminal into a popular hero the virtue that count in the foothill during the eighty be generosity courage and that amazing power of recuperation which enable a man to begin life again and again undaunted by the bludgeoning of misfortune some of the story in this volume be obviously the work of a apprentice but they have be include because however faulty in technique they do serve to illustrate a past that can never come back and man and woman who be outwardly crude and illiterate but at core kind and chivalrous and nearly always humorously unconventional the bunch grass so beloved by the patriarchal pioneer have be plough up and destroy the unwritten law of judge lynch will soon become a oral tradition but the

ajax who have a trick of say what other think blurt out -- what do you mean by conquer -- belle we sit down my name be alethea-belle a double name father want to call I alethea but mother fancy belle

exercise with prayer and a hymn after that the parent will please retire that evening alethea-belle go early to bed with a rage headache next morning she appear whiter than ever but she eyelid be red however she seem self-possessed and even cheerful ride together across the range ajax say to I : alethea-belle be scare out of she life you mean belle alethea be as brave as she father be before she you be right poor little belle perhaps we would better find some job or other round the _ adobe _ this afternoon there 'll be ructions but the ructions do not take place that day it seem that alethea - belle tell she scholar she be suffer severely from headache she beg they politely to be as quiet as possible perhaps amazement constrain obedience these foothill imp will kill she say ajax within a week we know that the big boy be become unmanageable but no such information leak from alethea-belle 's lip each evening at supper we ask how she have fare during the day always she reply primly : i thank you i be get along nicely better than i expect mr spafford a peeper through door and keyhole explain the schoolmarm 's method i jest happen to be passin ' by she tell I and i peek in through -- through the winder that great big hoodlum of a george spragg be a-sassin ' miss buchanan a ' makin ' face at she the crowd be a - whoopin ' he up in the middle o ' the uproar she kneel down ' o lord ' say she ' i pray thee to soften the heart of pore george spragg and give I a weak woman the strength to prevail against he everlastin ' ignorance and foolishness ' george get the color of a beet but he quit he foolin ' yes sir she pray for 'em and she coax 'em a ' she never know when she be beat but they 'll be too much for she she be losin ' she appetite a ' she do not sleep good we will not be boardin ' she much longer but that night as usual when i ask alethea-belle how she do she reply in she prim formal accent : i be do real well i thank you much much better than i expect two day later i detect a bruise upon she forehead with great difficulty i extract the truth tom eubank have throw a apple at the schoolmarm and what do you do she gray eye be unruffled she delicately cut lip never smile as she reply austerely : i tell thoma that i be sure he mean well but that if a boy wish to give a apple to a lady he have ought to hand it politely and not throw it then i eat the apple it be a newtown pippin and real good after recess thoma apologise what do the brute say he be not a brute he say he be sorry he would throw the pippin so hard next day i happen to meet tom eubank he have a basket of newtown pippin for the schoolmarm he be very red when he tell I that miss buchanan like -- apple apple at that time do not grow in the brush - hill tom have buy they at the village store \* \* \* \* \* but alethea-belle grow thinner and whiter just before the end of the term the climax come i happen to find the little schoolmarm cry bitterly in a clump of sage-brush near the water-trough it be like this she confess presently : i can not rid myself of that weak hateful belle she be go to lie down soon and let the boy trample on she then she 'll have to quit and alethea see the promised land oh oh i do despise the worst half of myself the sooner you leave these young devil the better what do you say she confront I with flash eye i swear that she look beautiful the angularity the lack of color the thin chest the stoop back be efface i could not see they because -- well because i be look through they far beyond they at something else i love my boy my foothill boy and if they be rough brutal at time they be strong she emphasis on the word be pathetic they be strong and they be young and they be poise for flight -- now to I I have be give the opportunity to direct that flight -- upward and if i fail they if i quit -- she tremble violently you will not quit say i with conviction to-morrow say she they have fix thing for a real battle she refuse obstinately to tell I more and obtain a solemn promise from I that i would not interfere \* \* \* \* \* afterwards i get most of the fact out of george spragg three of the biggest boy have plan rank mutiny doubtless they resent a compulsory attendance at school and with short-sighted policy make certain that if they get rid of alethea-belle the schoolhouse would be close for ever and what chance could she have -- one frail girl against three burly young giant a full attendance warn she that she scholar expect something interesting to happen boy and girl file into the schoolroom quietly enough and the proceedings open with prayer but not the usual prayer alethea-belle pray fervently that right might prevail against might now and for ever amen within a minute the three mutineer have march into the middle of the room in loud ear-piercing note they begin to sing pull for the shore the girl giggle nervously the boy grin several open they mouth to sing but close they again as alethea-belle descend from the rostrum and approach the rebel the smallest child know that a fight to a finish have begin the schoolmarm raise she thin hand and she thin voice no attention be pay to either then she walk swiftly to the door and lock it the old _ adobe _ have be build at a time when indian raid be common in southern californium the door be of oak very massive the window narrow opening in the thick wall be heavily bar the child wonder what be about to happen the three rebel sing with a louder more defiant note as alethea-belle walk past they and on to the rostrum upon she desk stand a cover basket take this in she hand she come back to the middle of the room the boy eye she movement curiously she carry besides the basket a cane then she bent down and place the basket between herself and the boy they still sing pull for the shore but faintly feebly they stare hard at the basket and the cane alethea-belle stand back with a curious expression upon she white face very swiftly she flick open the lid of the basket silence fall on the scholar out of the basket quite slowly and stealthily come the head of a snake a snake well know to the smallest child -- known and dread the flat head the lidless baleful eye the grey-green diamond - bar skin of the neck be unmistakable it be a rattler shriek one of the rebel they spring back the other child rise panic-stricken the schoolmarm speak very quietly -- do not move the snake will not hurt any of you as she speak she flick again the lid of the basket it fall on the head of the serpent alethea-belle touch the horror which withdraw then she pick up the basket secure the lid and speak to the huddled-up terrify crowd -- you try to scare I do not you and i have scare you she laugh pleasantly but with a faint inflection of derision as if she know as she do that the uncivilised child of the foothill like they father fear nothing on earth so much as rattler and -- ridicule after a moment she continue : i bring this here to-day as a object-lesson you loathe and fear the serpent in this basket as i loathe and fear the serpent which be in you she catch the eye of the mutineer and hold they and she eye shine i believe that i have be send to kill the evil in you as i be go to kill this venomous beast stand back they shrink back against the wall open-eyed open-mouthed tremble alethea-belle unfastened for the second time the lid of the basket once more the flat head protrude hiss alethea-belle strike sharply it be harmless now she say quietly its back be break but the snake still writhe alethea-belle shudder then she set she heel firmly upon the head and now -- she voice be weak and quaver but a note of triumph of mastery inform it -- and now i be go to cane you three boy i be go to try to break you stubborn will but you be big and strong and you must let I do it if you do not let I do it you will break my heart for if i be too weak to command here i must resign oh i wish that i be strong the mutineer stare at each other at the small white face confront they at the boy and girl about they it be a great moment in they life a imperishable experience the biggest speak first sheepishly roughly almost defiantly -- come on up boy we 'll hev to take a lickin ' this time alethea-belle go back to the rostrum tremble she have never cane a boy before and she loathe violence and yet she give those three lad a sound thrashing when the last stroke be give she totter and fall back upon she chair -- senseless \* \* \* \* \* later i ask she how she have catch the snake after you leave I she say i sit down to think i know that the boy want to scare I and it strike I what a splendid thing ` twould be to scare they just then i see the snake asleep on the rock and i remember what one o ' the cowboy have say about they be stupid and sluggish at this time o ' year but my when it come to catch it alive -- i -- nearly have a fit i would chill and fever before i be able to brace up well sir i get I a long stick and i fix a noose at the end of it and somehow -- with the lord 's help -- i get the creature into my work-basket and i carry it home and put it under my bed with a big stone atop o ' the lid but i never sleep a wink i be teetotal but i know now what it be to have the -- the -- jim-jam say i i believe that be what they call it in californium yes i see snake rattler everywhere you be the pluckiest little woman in the world say i oh no i be a miserable coward and always will be now it be over i kind of wish i have not scare the little child quite so bad about a month later when alethea-belle be leave we and about to take up new quarter in paradise near the just finish village schoolhouse mr spafford come to I the schoolmarm it seem have step off we scale she have gain nearly ten pound since the day of the great victory you good cooking mr spafford -- mr spafford smile scornfully do my good cooking help she any afore she whack they boy not much no sir she scholar hev put the flesh on to she pore bone and i give they the credit they air tryin ' to pay for what they schoolmarm 's put into they head and heart miss buchanan have teach we a thing or two i suggest yes mrs spafford reply solemnly she hev ii the dumble look back i be quite sure that john jacob dumble 's chief claim to the confidence of we community -- a confidence invariably abuse -- be the fact that the rascal 's family be such nice folk so well - raise so clean so respectable such constant and punctual church - member after the presbyterian church be build in paradise no more edifying spectacle could be see than the arrival on Sunday morning of the dumble family in they roomy spring wagon the old man -- he be not more than fifty-five -- have two pretty daughter and a handsome son mr dumble a comely woman always wear gray clothes and gray thread glove she have a pale too impassive face and she dark hair tightly draw back from she brow have curious white streak in it ajax say a thousand time that he should not sleep soundly until he have determine whether or not mr dumble be a party to she husband 's misdemeanor my brother 's imagination as i have say before run riot at time he be of opinion that the wear of gray indicate a character originally white but discolor by she husband 's dirty little trick certainly mr dumble be a woman of silence secretive with lip tightly compress as if -- as ajax remark -- she fear that some of john jacob 's peccadillo might escape from they the father be inordinately proud of he son quincey who in many respects take after the mother he too be quiet self-possessed and somewhat pale he work for we and other cattleman not for he father and after the lad leave school ajax fall to speculate about he as he speculate about the mother be quincey on to the old man 's game he would ask it must be record that john jacob be very careful to keep within the limit of the law but he plough close to the line where the soil as we all know be richest and comparatively speak virgin but no man in the county be louder than he in denounce such crime as horse-stealing or cattle-lifting crime in those day disgracefully common he might ear-mark a wander piglet for instance or clap he iron upon a unbranded yearling but who could swear that these estray be not the lawful property of he upon whose land they be find at that time ajax and i be breed cleveland bay and amongst we colt we have two very promising animal likely to make a match team and already prize-winner at the annual county fair one day in October uncle jake we head vaquero report the colt to be miss out of we back pasture careful examination reveal the cutting of the fence obviously the colt have be steal ajax suggest that we should employ old man dumble to help we to recover the steal property he be shrewd and persevere and he know every man woman and child within a radius of fifty mile why boy say he when we ask he to undertake the job i would do more than this to help friend and neighbor it be a dooty to hunt down these scallywag a dooty ya -- and a pleasure we take the trail that night the thief so far as we could conjecture have about twenty hour start but then he would be oblige to travel by night and by devious mountain-paths accord to old dumble he objective would be bakersfield and to reach bakersfield some dry plain must be traverse at the watering-place upon these plain we might expect to hear from sheep-herder and vaquero some information respect animal so handsome and so peculiarly mark as we colt and so it prove at a dismal saloon where water be nearly as expensive and quite as bad as the whisky we learn that a bright bay colt with a white star and stock and another with a white nose have be see early that morning old man dumble glean more we be deal with a tenderfoot and a stranger to the saloon-keeper he say as we strike into the sage-brush wilderness the fool do not know enough to spend a few dollar at the bar he call for one lemonade well say ajax you be teetotal yourself you ought to respect a man who call for lemonade i be not a thief say we neighbor if i be he add i reckon i would cover my track around saloon with a leetle whisky boy there be another thing this feller we be after be ridin ' too fast they colt will not stand it young thing must feed a ' rest the saloon-keeper allow they be footsore a ` ready and kinder peter out we must keep we eye skin you be a wonder say ajax how you divine that the thief would travel this trail beat I wal say old man dumble it be this way there be a big dealer come three time a year to bakersfield he pay good money for good stuff -- a ' he ask no question i happen to hear he be a-comin ' down only las ' Sunday something in he voice some sly gleam in he eye arouse my suspicion as soon as we happen to be alone i whisper to my brother : i say what if the old man be play hare and hound with we pooh say ajax he be keen as mustard to collar this thief -- the keener possibly since he discover that the fellow be a tenderfoot i have size he up about right he want to establish a record it be like this teetotal business of he the people here refuse to believe evil of a man who drink water go to church and catch horse - thief i 'll add one word more to give the old fraud he due he really hold in abhorrence any crime that might land he in the state penitentiary hullo there be a faint reek out yonder i 'll take a squint through my glass we call a halt we be now on the alkaline plain beyond the san emigdio mountain ride all through the night we have change horse at a ranch where we be know ajax stare through he binoculars what we be after say he quietly be in sight he hand he glass to I i could barely make out a horseman herd along two animal the plain be blaze with heat in the distance a soft blue haze obscure the horizon faintly outline against this be three spiral of what seem to be white smoke : three move pillar of alkaline dust he can not git away from we say old man dumble look at he my suspicion take flight he be as ajax say keener than we to arrest the thief he small eye sparkle with excitement he right index-finger be crooked as if itch for the trigger he lip move in fancy he be rehearse the stand and deliver of a officer of the law we kin ride he down he mutter yes say ajax we look to we girth and we pistol it be unlikely that the thief would show fight but -- he might then we mount and gallop ahead forrard -- for-r-rard shout ajax within a few minute a quarter of a hour at most the man we be hunting would see we then the chase would really begin he would abandon the footsore colt and make for the hill and so it come to pass presently we see the horseman turn off at right angle the jaded colt hesitate trot a few yard and stand still a faint neigh float down wind doggone it exclaim old man dumble he horse be fresh he be get friend in the hill we have leave the trail and be pound over the sage-brush desert i could smell the sage strongly pungent and the alkaline dust begin to irritate my throat the sun if one stand still be strong enough to blister the skin of the hand for three-quarter of a hour it seem to I that the distance between we and we quarry remain constant but dumble say we be fall behind the thief be lighter than any of we and he horse be evidently a stayer the hill rise out of the haze bleak and bare seam with gulch a safe sanctuary for all wild thing if the cuss be within range i would try a shot say the old man i would like to make out who he be say ajax suddenly the horse of the thief fall we discover later that the beast have plunge into a piece of ground honeycomb with squirrel - hole the man stagger to he foot the horse struggle where he fall but do not rise he shoulder be break we have he yell dumble yes we have he repeat my brother suppose we take a look at he the thief have abandon all idea of escape he stand beside he horse wait for we but at the distance we could not determine whether he intend to surrender quietly or to fight ajax adjust he glass and glance through they then with a exclamation he hand they to I kin ye make he out boy ask we neighbor yes say i give back the glass to ajax he hand they in silence to old man dumble then instinctively both we right hand go to we belt we be not quite sure what a father might do he do what should have be expect -- and avoid he drop the binoculars then he turn to we tremble livid -- a scarecrow of the man we know it be my boy he say hoarsely and i think he be the best boy in the county oh god a minute may have pass not more one guess that in that brief time the unhappy father see clearly the inevitable consequence of he own roguery and sharp practice he have sow broadcast innumerable nameless little fraud he reap a big crime i look across those dreary alkaline plain and out of the lovely blue haze beyond i seem to see the dumble ' spring wagon roll to church mr dumble 's pale impassive face be turn to the bleak plain at last i read she aright that quiet woman of silence she know the father of she child from the outer rind to the inmost core i thought of the pretty daughter who do not know and out yonder stand the son ajax beckon I aside we whisper together for a moment or two then my brother speak -- we be go to lead home we colt he say curtly and you can lead home yours we shall take better care of ours after this experience they will not be allow to run wild in the back pasture boy -- quincey a ' I -- shush-h-h say ajax that fellow out there be a long way off i could not swear in a court of law that he be the person we take he to be whom he look like we know who he be we do not know and we do not wish to know so long we ride back to we colt iii pap spooner pap spooner be about sixty-five year old and the greatest miser in san lorenzo county he live on less than a dollar a day and allow the rest of he income to accumulate at the rate of one per cent a month compound interest when ajax and i first make he acquaintance he be digging post-hole the day a day in September be uncommonly hot i say indiscreetly : mr spooner why do you dig post-hole with a queer glint in he small dull gray eye he reply curtly : why be you boy a-shootin ' quail -- hey 'cause ye like to i reckon fer the same reason i like ter dig post-hole it be jest recreation -- to I when we be out of earshot ajax laugh recreation say my brother nothing will ever recreate he of all the pincher -- shush-h-h say i it be too hot we neighbor tell many story of pap spooner even that bland old fraud john jacob dumble admit sorrowfully that he be no match for pap in a horse cattle or pig deal and george leadham the blacksmith swear that pap would steal milk from a blind kitten the humorist of the village be of opinion that heaven have help pap because he have help himself so freely out of other folk ' pile in appearance andrew spooner be small thin and wiry with the beak of a turkey-buzzard the complexion of a indian and a set of large white very ill-fitting false tooth which click like castanets whenever the old man be excite now in californium pap be a _ nom de caresse _ for father but so far as we know

shine to better advantage upon the right hand he retort reasonably enough that the mutilate member kind of need settin ' off he seize the opportunity to ask ajax why we wear no jewellery and upon my brother reply that we consider diamond out of place upon a cattle ranch he roundly assert that in he opinion a gen ` leman could not be too dressy during the first month he buy in san lorenzo a

and short-sighted be suffuse with tender light and he pendulous lower lip be a-quiver with emotion even the hair of he head -- tow-coloured and worn _ à la pompadour _ -- seem to bristle with excitement wal he whisper it be -- it be miss birdie dutton in the silence that follow i could see ajax pull he moustache miss birdie dutton why in the name of the sphinx should jasperson have select out of a dozen young lady far more eligible miss birdie dutton she be we postmistress a tall dark not uncomely virgin of some thirty summer but alas one of she eye be fashion out of glass she nose be

emphatically to be excuse from interference i hold that a man and a maid must settle they love affair without help from a third party ajax unhappily think otherwise miss dutton he begin tentatively be aware jasperson of you -- er -- passion for she she be not no sech a thing say the lover yet she eye continue ajax be keen -- keen and penetrate it be a peach cry the enthusiastic poet there be not another like it in the land but it can not see in the dark a ' boy i have not show my hand -- yet you have make no advance directly or indirectly not a one by golly i -- i dass not i jest do not know how i be not up to the trick you air of course but i be not my brother somewhat confusedly hasten to assure jasperson that he knowledge of the sex be quite elementary and glean for the most part from a profound study of light literature the poet grin derisively you be not no tenderfoot he say i reckon that what you do not know about the girl be not worth picklin ' well if you mean business say ajax didactically if nothing we can say or do will divert you mind from courtship and matrimony -- if my dear jasperson you be prepare to exchange the pleasant place the sunny slope and breezy freedom of bachelor life for the thorny path that lead to the altar and thence to -- er -- the cradle if in short you be determine to own a best girl why then the first and obvious thing to do be to let she know discreetly that you be in love with she as how say jasperson breathlessly i tell ye that when she be around i feel like a worm you speak of wiggle reply my brother and i suppose that heretofore

miss dutton take the chair she offer but as soon as a suitable opportunity present itself ask to see the album thus you will cleverly betray a warm interest in she by show a lively interest in she people and to look over a album two person must -- you bet they must interrupt the poet they must nestle up that be right what kind of a chump be i not to have think of that before yes boy she be get a album a beaut ' too : crimson plush a ' nickel and of course the picture of she folk be inside by gum i 'll give the homeliest of 'em sech a send-off as -- you will not say ajax remember jasperson that a burning black eye indicate jealousy which you must beware of arouse do not praise too wantonly the beauty of miss dutton 's sister and cousin but if the father be well-looking pay you mistress the compliment of say that the child of true lover always take after the father in turn the leaf of the album you might touch she hand quite accidentally no less a authority than mr pickwick commend a respectful pressure i 'll do it exclaim jasperson i 'll do it sure have she a pretty hand i ask have she a pretty hand echo the lover in disdainful tone she have the hand of a queen the empress of

then array it in the ivy-bosomed shirt and the $ 75 suit of broadcloth he toilet occupy just two hour and seventeen minute ajax decorate the lapel of he coat with a handsome rosebud and then the impatient swain tie round he neck a new white silk handkerchief mount he horse and betook himself at a gallop to the village church ajax remark with regret that the pace be too hot at the start and fear that we colt would finish badly as we walk back to the verandah i tell my brother that he have assume a big responsibility for i be convince that miss dutton albeit possess of many admirable quality be not the woman to make little jasperson either happy or comfortable she doubtless be a wise bird would greedily snap up this nice worm who have wax fat in the richest soil but how would the worm fare when swallow up and absorb at five that afternoon the amorous poet ride slowly up to the corral as he sit limply upon he sorrel horse smile dismally at ajax we could see that the curl be out of he moustache and out of the brim of he sombrero upon he delicate face be inscribed failure boy say he throw one leg over the horn of the saddle i do not get there i -- i mire down later he give we some interesting detail it transpire that he have meet he sweetheart after sabbath-school and have sit beside she during the regular service after church he have accept a warm invitation from mr swiggart to join the family circle at dinner at table he have be privileged to supply miss birdie with many dainty : pickle cucumber cup-custard and root beer he tell we frankly that he have mark nothing amiss with the young lady 's appetite but that for he part he have make a sorry meal my swaller he say plaintively be in kink before the boolyon be serve you say murmured ajax that miss dutton 's appetite be good it be just grand reply the unhappy bard i never see a lady eat cup-custard with sech relish we may infer then observe my brother that miss birdie be still in happy ignorance of you condition otherwise pity for you would surely have temper that craving for cup-custard i dun ` no ' boy about that I a ' miss birdie sing out o ' the same hynm book and -- and i sort o ' show down i reckon she know what ail jasper jasperson ajax unwisely congratulate the lovelorn one upon this piece of news he say that the rubicon be now pass and retreat impossible we note the absence of the rosebud and jasperson blushingly confess that he have present the flower to he best girl after dinner a act of homage -- so we presume -- in recognition of the lady 's contempt of danger in mix pickle cucumber with cup-custard after that say jasperson i thought of the album a ' 'twa then my foot begin to get cold but i up and as ' t to see it as bold as a coyote in a hen-roost then she sez kind of soft a ' smilin ' : ` why mister jasper what d'you want to see my album for you do not know my folk ' a glorious opportunity say ajax what do you reply my buck dog-gone it i would ought to have sail

escort he sweetheart to the annual picnic and return late at night find ajax and I enjoy a modest nightcap before turn in we ask he to join we but he refuse with some asperity and upon cross-examination confess that he have promise miss button to take the pledge at the next meeting of the lodge now we know that jasperson be the pink of sobriety but one who appreciate a occasional glass of beer or even a mild cocktail and we have hear he more than once denounce the doctrine of the prohibitionist so we be quite convinced that meek submission to the dictate of the grand secretary of corona lodge be both unnecessary and inexpedient and we say so birdie know i do not drink stammer we hire man but she think i would ought to take the pledge as a example a example echo ajax to whom to _ we _ she say a example gen ` leman jest -- a example but she mean we say ajax sternly we name be mention do not you deny it jasperson they be he admit reluctantly she as ' t I careless-like if

profoundly move and ajax appear less solidly complacent than usual i reflect not without satisfaction that i have do what i could to keep jasperson and the grand secretary apart this be very serious say ajax after a significant pause i -- i feel jasperson that this engagement be bring about by -- I it be a fact assent we hire man and that be what make I feel so mean right now boy i love that woman so that i dass not go agin she ajax rise in he might and confront the tremble figure upon the divan my brother 's nickname be give to he at school in virtue of he great size and strength standing now above jasperson he proportion seem even larger than usual the little dandy in he smug black garment with he diamond stud gleam in the ivy-bosomed shirt -lrb- he ring have be give to miss

jasperson you be play the worm d'you hear the _ worm _ i once advise you to wiggle up to the bird now i tell you solemnly to wiggle away before it be too late i have be a fool and so have you for the past three week i have have my eye on you and i suspect that you would fall a victim to a ambitious and unscrupulous woman you have lose weight man and you have no flesh to spare marry miss dutton and you 'll be a scarecrow within a year and require the service of the mortician within two i get you into this infernal scrape and by heaven i i 'll get you out of it but what will the neighbor say stammer jasperson sit upright at my brother 's word he pendulous nether lip have stiffen and now he pale blue eye be quicken with hope and vitality he arrange he white satin tie that have slip to one side and smooth nervously the nap of the broadcloth pants while ajax clothe in rough gray flannel take a turn up and down we sitting-room my brother and i have live together for many year year of fat kine and year of lean but i could not recall a single instance when he have consider the opinion of mr grundy in come to californium to a rough life on a cattle ranch we have virtually snap we finger beneath the dame 's nose i mention this because it shed light upon what follow the neighbor jasperson reply ajax will say some deuced unpleasant thing but i think i can promise you the sympathy of the man and you ranch be fifteen mile from a petticoat i dass not break it off gen ` leman not by word of mouth but -- but we might write and lay yourself open to a breach of promise case and heavy damages no -- i have a better plan than that we 'll make miss dutton release you she shall do the write this time boy say jasperson solemnly she 'll never do it -- never she mind be sot on merridge i see it all now she hypnotise I by golly i swear she do that eye of hers be a corker what night be you to be initiate ask ajax with seeming irrelevance next toosday reply the neophyte nervously you have never i believe be on a spree never gen ` leman -- never they tell I say ajax softly that we village whisky the sheep - herder ' delight will turn a pet lamb into a roar lion it be pizon say jasperson -- jest pizon you jasperson need a violent stimulant on Tuesday afternoon my boy you and i will go on a mild spree i do not like spree any more than you do but i see no other way of cut this knot now mark I not a word to miss dutton it be late so -- good-night between may-day and the follow Tuesday but little transpired worth recording miss dutton send the convert a bulky package of tract with certain scathing passage mark -- obviously for we benefit -- in red ink and we learn from alethea-belle that the initiation of jasper jasperson be to be make a occasion of much rejoicing and that a immense attendance be expect at corona lodge the storekeeper ask ajax outright if there be truth in the rumor that we be to be decorate with the blue ribbon and my brother hint mysteriously that even stranger thing than that might happen jasperson complain of insomnia but he say several time that he would never forget what ajax be do on he behalf and i do not think he ever will for my part i maintain a strict neutrality ethically consider i be sensible that my brother 's action be open to severe criticism at the same time i be certain that mild measure would not have prevail the grand secretary while i be in the post-office invite I quite informally to participate in the opening exercise and to assist at the banquet the benediction so to speak of the secret rite she say that other prominent gentleman would receive invitation and that she be certain the work would please and edify she express much chagrin when i tender my regret and amaze I by affirm that ajax have cordially consent to be present this i consider a outrageous breach of good manners upon he part : if he keep he promise a number of most worthy and respectable person would consider themselves insult so i advise miss birdie not to count upon he i like you big brother she say in she hard metallic tone he be such a man : he have make quite a conquest of I for mercy 's sake do not tell he so i pledge myself to profound secrecy but walk home the remembrance of a uncanny gleam in she bold black eye put to flight my misgiving i decide that ajax be justify in use pizon upon Tuesday afternoon i deem it expedient to remain at the ranch - house about five jasperson array in he best accompany ajax to the village the lodge be to open its door at 730 and at ten my brother return alone breathless and red in the face the bearer of extraordinary tiding i shall let he tell the story in he own word the whole village say he have be paint by jasperson a lovely pigeon-blood red then he sit down and laugh in the most uncontrollable and exasperating manner by jupiter he gasp i know that whisky be wonderful stuff but i never believe it could turn a worm into a malay run amok then he laugh again till the tear roll down he cheek between the gust and gurgle of laughter a few more detail leak out i present they connectedly the kind reader will understand that allowance must be make for my brother he be a seasoned vessel but no man can drink we village nectar with impunity of course he begin i know that this be he last day the boy would ask jasperson to celebrate so mindful of you precious reputation -- i do not care a hang about my own -- i keep in the background upon inquiry you 'll find that it be generally concede that i do my best to prevent what have happen and jasperson be foxey too he hang back say he be go to join the lodge and would not indulge in anything stronger than napa soda he have three round of that then he be persuade by jake william to try a glass of beer and after that a bumper of strong fruity port -- the pure juice of the californian grape that warm he up at a quarter to six he take he first drink of whisky and then the evil spirit of all the devil who manufacture it seem to possess he in less than half-an-hour he be the center of a howling crowd and none howl louder than he he set up the drink again and again i try to drag he away and fail miserably i 'll be hang if he do not get hold of a six-shooter and threaten to fill I with lead if i interfere he tell the boy he be go to join the lodge that be the dominant note he be go to join the lodge he have come to town on purpose how they cheer he then that scoundrel jake william be inspire by satan to ask he if he be provide with a initiation robe and he actually persuade jasperson to remove he beautiful black clothes and to array himself in a sonora blanket then they strip he poor white face with black and red paint till he look like a apache honestly i do my level best to quash the proceedings : i might as well have try to bale out the pacific with a pitchfork at a quarter-past seven the swiggart drive into paradise and i wish you could have see the grand secretary 's face she have no idea naturally that she jasper be the artist so busily engage in decorate the village but she know there be a awful row on and i fancy she rather glory in she own saintliness presently the lodge fill up and i could see miss birdie standing on the porch look anxiously around for the candidate finally i feel so sorry for the girl that i make up my mind to give she a hint so that she could slip quietly away she greet I warmly and say that she suppose mr jasperson be around ` somewhere ' and i say that he be then she speak about the riot and ask if i have see a number of brutal cowboy abuse a poor indian she tell I that she brother and sister inside the lodge be very distressed about it and as she talk the yell grow louder and i be convince that the candidate be about to present himself so i try to explain the fact but confound it she be so obtuse -- for i could not blurt the truth right out -- that before she catch on the procession arrive the catechuman be seat upon a empty beer-barrel place upon a sort of float drag by the boy they have with they a big drum that terrible bassoon of uncle jake 's and a cornet the noise be something terrific well miss birdie 's a good pluck one she stand on the step and rebuke they that voice of hers silence the band before she be through talk you might have hear a pin drop she rate they for a quarter of a hour and all the good people in the lodge come out to listen and applaud i be jam up against she and could not stir at the end she invite they to come into the lodge to see a good man -- i quote she verbatim -- a upright citizen a credit to he country and a ornament to society take the pledge when she stop jasperson begin in that soft silky voice of he he thank she and say he be glad to know that he be hold in such high esteem that he cordially hope the boy would come in as he be pay for the banquet and that after supper they might expect a real sociable time that be all but it be enough for the grand secretary she give a ghastly scream and keel over right into my arm and where say i be jasperson jasperson reply ajax soberly be be remove in a spring-wagon to he own ranch to-morrow he will be a very sick man but i think i have get he out of he scrape vii fifteen fat steer uncle jake say murmured ajax that laban swiggart have be ` milk ' we ever since we buy this ranch laban be we neighbor a barbed-wire fence divide he sterile hill from we fertile valley and emphasise sharply the difference between a government claim and a spanish grant the county assessor value the swiggart ranch at the rate of _ one _ and we domain at _ six _ dollar per acre we own two league of land we neighbor but half a section yet in consequence of dry season and low price we be hardly able to pay we bill whereas the swiggart confound all law of cause and effect by live in comparative splendor and luxury uncle jake believe that he steal we steer continue ajax puff slowly at he pipe some two year before we have lose fifteen fat steer we have employ laban to look for they and he have charge we thirty dollar for labor that be in vain ajax say i we have eat the swiggart ' salt not to mention they fat chick they pickle peach they jam and jelly it be a outrage to insinuate as you do that these kind neighbor be common thief my brother look quite distressed of course mr swiggart can know nothing about it she be a real good sort the best wife and mother in the county and i be only quote uncle jake he say that fifteen steer at $ 30 a head make $ 450 laban build a barn that spring and put up a tank and windmill with this parthian shot my brother leave I to some sorry reflection i cordially like and respect laban swiggart and he family he have marry a skenk no name in we county smell sweeter than skenk : a synonym indeed for piety deportment shell-work and the preserving of fruit the widow skenk live in san lorenzo hard by the congregational church and it be generally concede that the hand of one of she daughter in marriage be a certificate of character to the groom no skenk have be know to wed a drunkard a blasphemer or a evil liver moreover laban have be the first to welcome we -- two raw englishman -- to a country where inexperience be a sin he have help we over many a stile he have save we many dollar and he have a honest face broad benignant brow surmount a pair of keen and kindly eye he nose proclaim a sense of humor he mouth and chin be conceal by a beard almost apostolic in its silky beauty could such a man be a thief the very next day laban ride down he steep slope and ask we to help he and he to eat a christmas turkey he say something too about a fine ham and a proposition a money-making scheme to be submit to we after the banquet hard time be make you rich say ajax my god he exclaim passionately have i not be poor long enough have i not see my wife and child suffer for want of proper food and clothing if prosperity be come my way boy i have pay the price for it and do not you forget it he eye be suffuse with tear and ajax take note of it my brother tell I later that so tender a husband and father be assuredly no cattle-thief upon christmas day we sit at meat for nearly two hour mr doctor tapper the wife of the stout dentist of san miguelito be present of the three miss skenk she have make the best match -- from a worldly point of view she wear diamond she keep two hire girl she entertain on a handsome scale and never fail to invite she less fortunate sister to she large and select party -- she be in a word a most superior person and a devout church-member to this lady ajax make himself mightily agreeable now really say she i do wish the doctor be here he do so dearly love badinage that and bridgework be he forte and why be not he here demand my brother he be hunting we bay mare it break out of the barn this morning i tell he that i would not disappoint alviry for a ark full of bay mare i know she would count on I to help she entertain you gentleman i hope you husband will find he mare say ajax we lose fifteen fat steer once but we never find they that be so observe mr swiggart and i wear myself out a-hunting 'em they be steal -- sure the wickedness of some folk pass my understanding remark mr tapper well we be tell that the triumphing of the wicked be short but -- good land -- job never live in this state he have be more to home in new england say laban slily the skenk be from massachusett the swiggart from illinoi there be a pit dig for such continued mr tapper ignore the interruption a pit full o ' brimstone and fire yes sister i will take one more slice of the ham i never eat sweeter meat eastern i presume my dear no sister laban cure that ham pork-packing be he trade back east laban add : boy i hope ye like that ham i have a reason for ask we assure we host that the ham be superlatively good mince and pumpkin pie follow coffee then grace as we rise from the table laban say pleasantly boy here be some import cigar we 'll smoke outside have so to speak soap the way mr swiggart launch he proposition he wish to pack bacon hog he point out be sell at two cent a pound bacon and ham at twelve and fifteen cent we have some two hundred and fifty hog ready for market these laban want to buy on credit he propose to turn they into lard ham and bacon to sell the same to local merchant -lrb- thereby save cost of transportation -rrb- and to divide the profit with we after the original price of the hog be pay this seem a one-sided bargain he be to do all the work we should in any case get the market price for the hog while the profit be to be divide however we host explain that we take all the risk if the bacon spoil he would not agree to pay we a cent with the taste of that famous ham in we mouth this contingency seem sufficiently remote and we say as much well i could rob ye right and left ye have get to trust I and there be a say : ` to trust be to bust ' he be so candid in explain the many way by which a unscrupulous man might take advantage of two ignorant briton that ajax not relish the personal flavor of the talk rise and stroll across to the branding-corral when he return he be unusually silent and ride home he say thoughtfully : i see laban 's brand this afternoon it be 81 and the 8 be the same size as we s he ear-mark be a crop which obliterate we swallow-fork queer -- eh not at all i reply indignantly it be a social crime to eat as you do to-day three large helping of turkey and then -- bosh he interrupt if laban be a honest man no harm have be do if he steal we steer -- and mind you i do not say he do -- three slice off the breast of a turkey will hardly offset my interest in five ton of beef as for this packing scheme it sound promising but we lack figure to-morrow we will drive into san lorenzo and talk to the child of israel if ikey rosenbaum say that bacon be likely to rise or stay where it be we will accept laban 's proposition the follow morning we start early the short cut to san lorenzo lay through the swiggart claim and the road pass within a few yard of the house we see mr swiggart on the verandah and offer to execute any commission that she care to entrust to two bachelor in reply she say that she hate to ask favor but -- if we be go to town in a two-seater would we be so very kind as to bring back she mother mr skenk who be ail and in need of a change gran ` ma 's hard on the spring observe euphemia mr swiggart 's youngest girl but she 'll tell you more story than you can shake a stick at not ` bout fairy mr ajax but reel folk we assure mr swiggart that we should esteem it a pleasure to give she mother a lift ajax have meet the old lady at a church social some six month before and find she a bonanza of gossip have extract some rich and curious ore in san lorenzo we duly find isaac rosenbaum who prove a optimist on the subject of bacon indeed he chatter so glibly of rise price and better time that the packing scheme be immediately refer to he mature judgment and he not only recommend it heartily but offer to handle we stuff on commission or to buy it outright if it prove marketable accord to ikey the conjunction if could not be ignore pack bacon beneath the sunny sky of southern californium be a speculation he say swiggart he add ought to know what good ham be for he buy the very best eastern brand what we cry simultaneously do mr swiggart _ buy _ ham yes it seem that only a few day previously laban have carefully select the choicest ham in the store ajax clutch my arm and we flee we have convict the wretch he say presently the _ wretch _ i amend the use of the plural smite he in the face this be awful he groan why when you be away last summer and i break my leg she nurse I like a mother woman throw such sop to a bark conscience i be positive now that laban have steal the steer and that he wife be privy to the theft the lie about the ham have be doubtless concoct for purpose of plunder the kindness and hospitality of we neighbor have be after all but a snare for tenderfoot \* \* \* \* \* we find mr skenk -- whom we have see on arrival -- sit on she front porch satchel in hand patiently await we ajax help she to mount -- no light task for she be a very heavy and enfeebled woman i drive as we trot down the long straggling street we passenger speak with feeling of the change that have take place in the old mission town i have live here thirty year twenty mighty hard one as a married woman and ten tol ` able easy one as a widder mr skenk be a saintly man but tryin ' to live with on account o ' deefness and the azmy i never see a chicken take with the gape but i think o ' abram skenk yes mr ajax my daughter be all bear here ` ceptin ' alviry she be bear in massachusett it do make

ajax stick he hand into he pocket and i do the same she misinterpret the action you be not go to prosecute she falter ajax nod to I upon formal occasion he expect I be the elder to speak if i say more or less than he approve i be severely take to task mr swiggart i begin lamely enough i be sure that you husband can cure ham -- ajax look at I indignantly with the best of motive i have give a sore heart a grievous twist we buy that ham she say sadly a-purpose no matter we have decide to go into this packing business with you husband when -- er -- experience go into partnership with ignorance ignorance expect to pay a premium we have pay we premium she rise and we hold out we hand no gentleman i will not take you hand till that debt be cancel the piano and the team will go some way towards it good-bye and -- thank you viii a experiment my brother and i have just ride off the range when uncle jake tell we that a tramp be hang about the corral and wish to speak with we he look like hell conclude uncle jake we find he a minute later curl up on a heap of straw on the shady side of we big barn he get up as we approach and stare at we with a curious derisive intentness of glance slightly disconcert you be englishman he say quietly the man 's voice be charming with that unmistakable quality which challenge attention even in mayfair and enthral it in the wilderness we nod and he continue easily : it be late and some twenty-six mile so i hear to the nearest town may i spend the night in you barn i do not smoke -- in barn while he be speak we have time to examine he he appearance be inexpressibly shocking dirty with a ragged six week ' growth of dark hair upon he face out at heel and elbow shirtless and shiftless he seem to have reach the nadir of misery and poverty obviously one of the broken brigade he have seemingly lose everything except he manners he amazing absence of self-consciousness make a clown of I i blurt out a gruff all right and turn on my heel unable to face the derisive smile upon the thin pale lip as i walk towards the house i hear ajax follow I but he do not speak till we have reach we comfortable sitting-room then as gruffly as i he say humpty dumpty -- after the fall we light we pipe in silence sensible of a extraordinary depression in the moral atmosphere five minute before we have be much elate the spring round-up of cattle be over we have sell we bunch of steer at the top price the money lay in we small safe we have be talk of a modest celebration as we ride home over the foothill now to use the metaphor of a cow county we have be bring up with a sharp turn we prosperity measure by the ill-fortune of a fellow - countryman dwindle ajax sum up the situation : he make I feel cheap why i ask conscious of a similar feeling ajax smoke and reflect it be like this he answer presently that chap have be to the bottom of the pit but he bob up with a smile do you notice he smile i ring the bell for quong we chinese servant when he come in i tell he to prepare a hot bath ajax whistle but as quong go away look rather cross my brother add we clothes will fit he the bath-house be outside quong carry in a couple of pail full of boiling water we lay out shave tackle a old suit of gray flannel a pair of brown shoe and the necessary under-linen a blue bird 's - eye tie i remember be the last touch then ajax shrug he shoulder and say significantly you know what this mean rehabilitation exactly it may be fun for we to rig out this poor devil but we must do more than feed and clothe he have you think of that i have not and say so this be a experiment first and last we be go to try to raise a man from the dead if we get he on to he pin we 'll have to supply some crutch be you prepare to do that if you be right of course he may refuse we help it would not surprise I a little bit if he do refuse when we preparation be complete we return to the barn in a few word ajax tell the stranger of what have be do after supper he conclude we 'll talk thing over time be rather good just now and something can be arrange you be very kind reply the tramp but i think you have better leave I in the barn we can not say my brother it be too beastly to think of you like this nevertheless we have to argue the matter and i ought to add that although we prevail in the end both ajax and i be aware that the man 's acceptance of what we offer impose a obligation upon we rather than upon he as he be about to enter the bath-house he turn with the derisive smile on he lip -- if it amuse you he murmur i shall have earn my bath and supper when he reappear nobody would have recognize he so far the experiment have succeed beyond expectation a new man walk into we sitting-room and glance with intelligent interest at we household god over the mantel-piece hang a etching of the grand canal at venice he survey it critically put up a pair of thin hand as so to shut off a excess of light jimmie whistler teach that fellow a trick or two he remark you know whistler oh yes we leave he with _ punch _ and a copy of a art journal ajax say to I as we go back to the barn -- i 'll bet he be a artist of sort it happen that we have in we cellar some fine claret a few magnum of léoville '74 a present from a millionaire friend we never drink it except upon great occasion ajax suggest a bottle of this elixir not entirely out of charity such tipple would warm a graven image into speech and my brother be inordinately curious we guest have nothing to give to we except he confidence and that he have withhold we decant the claret very carefully as soon as we guest taste it he sigh and say quietly -- i never expect to taste that again it be léoville be not it and in exquisite condition he sip the wine in silence while i thought of the bundle of foul rag upon we rubbish heap ajax be talk shop describe with some humor we latest deal and the present high price of fat steer we guest listen politely and when ajax pause he say ironically -- yours be a gospel of hard work i dare say you have ride two horse to a standstill to-day just so i can not ride or plough or dig ajax open he lip to reply and close they we guest smile you be wonder what bring I to californium as a matter of fact a private car no thanks no more claret later we hope he might melt into confidence over tobacco and toddy he smoke one cigar slowly and with evident appreciation and as he smoke he stroke the head of conan we irish setter a ultra - particular person who abominate tramp and stranger conan like you say ajax abruptly be that he name ` conan ' eh good conan good dog presently he throw away the stub of he cigar and cross to a small mirror with a self-possession rather surprising he begin to examine himself i be renew acquaintance he explain gravely with a man i have not see for some month by what name shall we call that man say ajax boldly there be a slight pause and then we guest say quietly -- would ` sponge ' do ` soapy sponge ' no say my brother my father 's christian name be john call I ` johnson ' accordingly we call he johnson for the rest of the evening while the toddy be be consume johnson observe the safe a purchase of my brother 's in which we keep we papers and account and any money we might have we have buy it second-hand and the vendor assure we it be quite burglar-proof ajax mention this to we guest he laugh presently no safe be burglar-proof he say and most certainly not that one he continue in a slightly different tone : i suppose you be not imprudent enough to keep money in it i mean gold on a big lonely ranch like this all you money affair should be transact with cheque we be in the wild say ajax and it may surprise you to learn that not so very long ago the spanish-californian who own most of the land keep thousand of pound in gold slug in the attic over this old ` adobe ' don juan soberane from whom we buy this ranch keep he cash in gold dust and slug in a clothes-basket he nephew use to take a tile off the roof drop a big lump of tallow attach to a cord into the basket and scoop up what he could the man who buy we steer yesterday have no dealings with bank he pay we in uncle sam 's note do he shortly afterwards we go to bed as we guest turn into the spare room he say whimsically -- have i entertain you you have entertain I ajax hold out he hand johnson hesitate a moment -- i recall he hesitation afterwards -- and then extend he hand a singularly slender well-formed member you have the hand of a artist say the ever-curious ajax the most beautiful hand i ever see reply johnson imperturbably belong to a -- thief good-night ajax frown turn down the corner of he lip in exasperation i be eat up with curiosity he growl \* \* \* \* \* next morning we route out a old kit-bag into which we pack a few necessaries when we insist upon johnson accept this he shrug he shoulder and turn the palm of he hand upwards as if to show they emptiness why do you do this he ask with a certain indescribable peremptoriness ajax answer simply -- a man must have clean linen in the town you be go to a boil shirt be a credential i should like to give you a letter to the cashier of the bank he be a britisher and a good fellow you be not strong enough for such work as we might offer you but he will find you a billet you positively overwhelm I say johnson you must be lineally descend from the good samaritan ajax write the letter a neighbor be drive in to town as we know and i have arrange early that morning for we guest 's transportation and what be i to do in return for these favor johnson demand let we hear from you say my brother you shall he reply within half a hour johnson have vanish in a buckboard and a cloud of fine white dust upon the follow afternoon i make a alarming discovery we burglar-proof safe have be open and the roll of note be miss i seek ajax and tell he he allow one word only to escape he lip -- johnson what tenderfoot we be i groan lineal descendant of the good samaritan well he have have a long start but we must catch he if it should not be -- johnson conan would have nail anybody else this be unanswerable for conan guard we safe whenever there be anything in it worth guard ajax never be so happy as when he can prove himself a prophet i say he be a artist he remark the truth be we try a experiment upon the wrong man a few minute later we take the road we have not go very far however before we meet the neighbor who have drive johnson to town he pull up and greet we boy say he i have a note for ye from that britisher we take the note but we do not open it till we californian friend have disappear we have be butcher but as yet the abominable fact that a compatriot have skin we be something we wish to keep to ourselves great minneapoli say ajax look at this i see a bank receipt for the exact sum which represent we bunch of steer be that all i ask ajax ought to have shout for joy but he answer with a groan yes there be not a line of explanation he say we should hear from he and we have i reply we return to the ranch very soberly when ajax place the bank receipt in the safe he kick that solid piece of furniture we 'll drive in comfortably to-morrow and find out what we can he observe i do not think we shall find johnson i murmured nor do we the cashier testify to receive the roll of note but not the letter of introduction we hunt high and low for johnson but he be not how do he get away without money he ask he have money i stick a twenty-dollar bill into he coat pocket before leave town we visit we gunmaker with the intention of order some cartridge by the merest chance he speak of johnson a britisher be in here yesterday : somethin' o ' the cut o ' you boy in a gray suit with a brown sombrero sure enough do he buy cartridge he buy a six-shooter and a few cartridge oh say ajax we find ourselves walk towards a secluded lot at the back of the old mission church ajax ask I for a opinion which i be too daze to express we have do a silly thing and perhaps a wicked thing say my brother if that poor devil be lie dead in the brush-hill i shall never forgive myself we have give a starving man too heavy a meal bosh say i believe every word he utter -- the echo indeed of my own thought i feel in my bone we be go to see johnson again twenty-four hour later we hear of he the santa barbara stage have be hold up by one man it happen however that a remarkably bold and fearless driver be on the box the stage have be stop upon the top of a hill but not exactly on the crest of it the driver testify that the would-be robber have leap out of a clump of manzanita just as the heavy lumbering coach be begin to roll down the steep hill in front of it to pull up at such a moment be difficult the driver see he chance and take it he lash the leader and charge straight at the highwayman who jump aside to avoid be run over and then be a-foot abandon he enterprise he be wear a mask fashion out of a gunny-sack new overalls and _ brown _ shoe that same night at lo olivo a man wear brown shoe be arrest by a deputy sheriff because he refuse to give a proper account of himself but on be search a letter to the cashier of the san lorenzo bank sign -lrb- so run the paragraph -rrb- by a well-known and responsible englishman be find in the pocket of he coat whereupon he be allow to go he way with many apology from the over-zealous official johnson say ajax do he hold up the stage i ask of course he do reply my brother contemptuously after this incident johnson who for a brief time have loom so large in we imagination fade into a sort of wraith year pass bring with they great change for I i leave californium and settle in england i write a book which excite a certain amount of interest and inspire some of my old school-fellow to renew acquaintance with I by this time i have forget johnson he be part of a distant country where the fine white dust settle thickly upon all thing and person in england where the expect so to speak come to five o'clock tea such surprising individual as johnson appear -- if they ever do appear -- as creature of a disorder fancy or digestive apparatus once i tell the story at the scribbler ' club to a couple of journalist they wink at each other and say politely that i spin a good yarn for a amateur i never tell a story say the elder of my critic till i have work out a climax you leave we at the top of a confound hill in californium bang up in the cloud and then the climax flit into sight masquerade as a barrel of claret the claret come from bordeaux it be léoville poyferré 1899 not a line of explanation come with it but all charge be prepay i write to the shipper a monsieur have buy the wine and order it to be consign to I reader of this story will say that i ought to have think of johnson i do not i thank effusively half a dozen person in turn who have not send the claret then hopelessly befogged i have the wine bottled however johnson send the wine for he tell I so i have be pass a few day at bloi and be stare at the fragonard which hang in the gallery of the château when a languid voice say this be the best thing here hullo johnson i exclaimed hullo say he he have recognize I first and address the remark about the picture to I nobody else be near we we shake hand solemnly eye each other note the change johnson appear to be prosperous but slightly gallicise how be -- ajax he murmur ajax have grow fat can not you dine with I it be my turn we must order a bottle of léoville at once you send that wine i exclaimed there be no note of interrogation in my voice i know yes he say indifferently it will be worth drinking in about ten year ' time we have a admirable dinner upon a terrace overhang the loire but the measure of my enjoyment be stint by johnson 's exasperating reticence concern himself he talk delightfully of the châteaux in touraine he display a intimate knowledge of french history and archaeology but i be tingle with impatience to transport myself and he to californium and he know this -- the rogue finally as the soft silvery twilight encompass we he tell what i want to know my father be a manufacturer who marry a frenchwoman my brother have trodden carefully and securely in my father 's footstep they be all fairly prosperous -- smug respectable fellow i resemble my mother after eton and christ church i be pitchfork into the family business for a time it absorb my attention i will tell you why later then have master the really interesting part of it i grow bored i want to study art after several scene with my father i be allow to go my own way -- a pleasant way too but it lead downhill you understand i spend three winter in venice then my father die and i come into a small fortune which i squander my mother help I then she die my brother cut I condemn I as a bohemian and a vagabond i confess that i do take a malicious pleasure in rub they sleek fur the wrong way then i cross the atlantic as the guest of a american millionaire he take I on in he own car to californium i start a studio in san francisco -- and a life class that undo I i find myself bankrupt then i fall desperately ill each day i feel the quicksand engulf I but you friend i interrupted my friend yes i have friend but perhaps you will understand I have see to what depths i fall that i could not bring myself to apply to my friend well i be at my last gasp when i crawl up to you barn i mean morally for my strength be return you and you brother ride up by god i could have kill you kill we you look so fit so prosperous and i could read you both could see in flaming capital you pity you contempt -- aye and you disgust that a fellow-englishman should be fester before you eye i ask for leave to spend the night in you barn and you say ` all right ' all right when everything be so cruelly so pitilessly the other way then you come back take for grant that i must accept whatever you offer i want to refuse but the word stick in my throat i follow you to the bath-house be i grateful not a bit i decide that for you own amusement and perhaps to staunch you english pride which i have offend you mean to lift a poor devil out of hell so as to drop he again into deeper depths when the comedy be over -- good heaven you think that my dear fellow you write now do not you i be give you a bit of psychology -- show you the point of view of the worm writhe beneath the boot of lordly man but always i mean to turn if i get the chance i wash myself i shave i slip into you nice clean clothes i 'll admit that the warm water remove some encrust mud from my mind but it sharpen rather then obscure my resolution to make the most of what look like a last chance but when you uncork that léoville shame spoil it for I you drink only two glass i remember it bring everything back -- everything if i have have one more glass i should have lay myself at you foot whine and whimper the cigar that i smoked afterwards be poppy and mandragora through a cloud of smoke i see all the pleasant year that be go again i weaken i have arouse you interest i could have sponge upon you indefinitely at that moment i see the safe you brother imprudently mention that a large sum of money lay inside it i make up my mind instantly to take the money and do so that night the dog be lick my hand as i rob you but next morning -- he pause then he laugh lightly next morning -- you appear with the kit-bag that disconcert I terribly it prove what i have not perceive -- that you two young englishman tenderfeet both of you have realize what you be do have seriously face the responsibility of resurrect the dead the letter to the cashier the twenty-dollar bill i find in my coat - pocket -- these be as scorpion but i have not the nerve to own up so i carry the money to the bank and deposit it to you account then you buy a six-shooter yes i mean to try another world i have have enough of this one i could not go back to my wallow what restrain you the difficulty of find a hiding-place if my body be discover i know that it would be awful for you thanks it be easy to find a hole but it be not easy to pull a hole in after one -- eh still i think i should find some wild gulch on the santa barbara trail amongst those god-forsaken foothill the buzzard would pull the hole in within forty-eight hour ah the buzzard i shiver see once more those grim sexton of the pacific seaboard i find the right place and just then i see the stage crawl up the grade immediately the excitement of a new sensation grip I i have a taste of it when i open you safe it seize I again relentlessly if i be successful i might begin again if i fail i could shoot myself without impose a atrocious remorse upon you well the pluck of that driver upset my plan -- the plan of a amateur i ought to have hold they up on the upgrade and after you fail -- ah after i fail i have a lucid interval do not laugh i be hungry and thirsty the most pressing need of my nature at that moment be a square meal i walk to a hotel and be nail you brother 's letter to the cashier save I i realize dimly that i have become respectable that i look -- for the deputy sheriff tell I so -- a english gentleman -- mr johnson you friend that be about all all i echo in dismay the rest be so commonplace i get a small job as clerk in a fruit - packing house it lead to better thing i suppose i be my father 's son i fail to make a living spoil canvas but as a business man i have be a mild success and what be you do now i buy and sell claret any other

express it when he happen to meet a out-of-elbows individual who claim positively that he could discover water gold or oil with no tool or instrument other than a hazel twig uncle jap who forget to ask why this silver-tongued vagabond have fail to discover gold for himself return in triumph to he ranch bring with he the wizard pledge to consecrate he gift to the locate of the lake of oil in

dollar be exhaust and he patience the wizard swear stoutly that the lake be there million and million of barrel of oil but he deem it expedient to leave the country in a hurry because uncle jap intimate to he in the most convincing manner that there be not room in it for so colossal a fraud the wizard might have argue the question but the sight of uncle jap 's old navy six-shooter seem to paralyse he tongue after this incident uncle jap ranch with feverish energy and mr fullalove say that the old man have get over a real bad dose of swell head \* \* \* \* \* five year later come the oil boom everybody know now that it flow in prodigious quantity into the vat of one man whom we shall speak of with the respect which the billionaire inspire as the autocrat of petroleum let we hasten

be strike in pint quart gallon bucket and finally in thousand and ten of thousand of barrel it flow copiously in we cow-county it grease so to speak the wheel -- and how ramshackle some of they be -- of a score of enterprise it saturate all thing and person now conceive if you can the triumphant i-told-you-so-boys expression of uncle jap he swell again visibly : head first then body and soul the

time and sink another well he discover oil sand not a lake then he mortgage he land every stick and stone on it and sink three more well it be a case of bernard palissy be bernard a married man i forget if so do he consult he wife before he burn the one and only bed do she protest it be a fact that uncle jap 's lily do not protest she look on the picture of misery and she mouth be a thin line of silence across she wrinkled impassive countenance when every available cent have be raise and sink the oil spout out who look at the fountain in the patch of lawn by the old fig tree possibly mr panel not uncle jap he the most temperate of man become furiously drunk on petroleum he exude it from every pore of course he be acclaimed by the county and the state -lrb- the Sunday edition publish he portrait -rrb- as the star-spangled epitome of yankee grit and get-there at this point we must present with apology the agent of the autocrat _ the _ agent the high-muck-a-muck of the pacific slope with a salary of a hundred thousand a year and _ perk _ in he youth nat levus smell of fried fish unless the smell be overpower by onion and he change he lodgings more often than he change he linen now you meet he as nathaniel leveson esquire who travel in he private car who assume the god when the god be elsewhere who own a palace on nob hill and some of the worst and therefore the most paying rookery in chinatown who never refuse to give a cheque for charitable purpose when it be demand in a becomingly public manner who like the autocrat have endowed christian church and have successfully eliminate out of he life everything which smack of the ghetto except he nose nathaniel leveson visit we county open a office and begin to lay he pulpy white hand upon everything which directly or indirectly might produce petroleum in due season he invite uncle jap to dine with he at the paloma hotel in san lorenzo the old man with the hayseed in he hair and the stain of bitumen upon he gnarled hand eat and drink of the best see a glorified vision of he lily crown with diamond at last the vision fade somewhat when nathaniel begin to talk dollar and cent even to uncle jap unversed in such high matter as finance it seem plain that leveson & company be to have the dollar and that to he the star-spangled epitome of yankee grit and get-there be to be apportion the cent lemme see he say with the slow puzzle intonation of the man who do not understand i own this yere oil -- subject to the mortgage mr panel i believe that do not amount to shuck say uncle jap quite so forgive I for interrupt you i own this yere oil-field lake i call it and bar the mortgage it be bin pay for with the sweat of my -- soul he bring out the word with such startling emphasis that nathaniel nearly upset the glass of fine old cognac which he be raise to he lip ya my soul continue uncle jap meditatively i risk everything i would get man he lean across the gaily decorate table with its crystal its pink shades its pretty flower and compel he host to meet he flaming eye -- man i risk my wife 's love and respect and he draw a deep breath by god i be justified i get there if i have not the fire die

courteous manner dive plunge the quill to the bottom of the ink pot withdraw it quickly and jerk its contents upon the blotting-paper a huge purple blot spread and spread till the other small blot be incorporate d -- n he splutter uncle jap dive shrug he shoulder and smile my advice be : take what leveson offer fifty thousand for million possibly can you touch they if omnipotence forbid dive stare moodily at the big purple blot then pick up the sheet of blotting-paper he tear it to piece with he nervous finely-formed finger and drop it into the waste-paper basket when he look up he see that uncle jap 's mild blue eye be curiously congest you might see so-and-so dive name a banker i 'll write a note of introduction then he add with a faint inflection of derision : i fear it will be of no service to you because few business man care to buy trouble even at a bargain all this ajax and i hear from uncle jap after he return from san lorenzo without sell sunny bush to so-and-so none the less he bring back a pair of small diamond ear-ring lily 's ear be not pierce he explain but she 'll hev a reel splendid time lookin ' at 'em jest as i uster hev with my nightie you -- _ nightie _

that such money as jaspar panel ask for be to be pay jaspar panel ask for a good deal and get it he sink more well and cap they he build reservoir he lay down pipe line the day of triumph dawn when a english company offer to take all the oil uncle jap could supply provide it be deliver free on board they vessel then come the crush blow that the railroad would not transport mr panel 's petroleum if they do -- this be not the reason give by the shipping agent -- the autocrat might be _ displeased _ meantime the bank politely request jaspar panel to meet he obligation hitherto uncle jap have be a man of simple and primitive belief he have hold for instance that a beneficent providence will uphold right against might he have pin he faith to the flag under which he fight and bleed when a boy he have tell he lily -lrb- who believe he -rrb- that american citizenship be a greater thing than a roman 's in rome 's palmiest day : a phrase take whole from the mouth of a fourth of July orator last of all he have believe devoutly in he own strong hand and will the partnership of mind and muscle which confront seemingly insuperable obstacle confident that it can destroy they and now hour by hour day by day conviction settle upon he soul that in this world one only reign supreme : the autocrat of oil whose high priest be nathaniel leveson after heart-rending month of humiliation upon the eve of foreclosure by the bank uncle jap write a forlorn letter to nathaniel accept he offer of fifty thousand dollar for the lake of oil mr leveson so a subordinate reply _ be not buy oil property _ for the moment he be interested in other matter uncle jap happen to read next day that leveson tread in the footstep of he master be about to present a splendid church to the people of san lorenzo uncle jap stare at the paper till it turn white till he see in the middle of it a huge purple blot ever-increasing in size that evening he clean he old six-shooter which have make the climate of the county

hev you she ask the ostler he be around somewhere the man reply with this information we start out to look for he away from the familiar brush hill confront by strange face confuse possibly by the traffic my companion seem so nervous and helpless that i dare not leave she almost unconsciously we direct we step towards the amalgamated oil company 's office here we learn that leveson be in town and that uncle jap have call to see he do he see he mr panel 's voice quaver no the clerk answer curtly then he add : nobody see the boss without a appointment we tell mr panel to call to-morrow if the clerk have speak with tongue of angel lily could not have assume a more seraphic expression a ' where be he now she ask you husband ma'am i can not tell you i mean mr leveson he be in there the private room be indicate and up to he eye in work he will not quit till he go to dinner at the paloma d'ye hear the typewriter click he make thing hum when he be here and do not you forget it i shall never forget that say mr panel in a accent which make I remember that she grandfather have be a graduate of harvard university good-afternoon we walk on down the street suddenly mr panel staggered and might have fall have i not firmly grasp she arm i dunno ' what ail I she mutter do you eat any breakfast this morning i dunno ' as i do she admit with reluctance do you eat any dinner mebbee i do not she innate truthfulness compel she to add with a pathetic defiance : i could not hev swaller a mossel to save my life i take she to a restaurant and prescribe a plate of soup and a glass of wine then i say with emphasis : now look here mrs panel i want you to rest while i hunt up mr panel when i find he i 'll bring he to you a ' s ` pose he will not come he will come no he will not not till he be do what he be set he mind to do be you aimin ' to hunt fer jaspar up a ' down this town certainly it be not as big as you think ` pear to I it would be a better plan to keep a eye on the other feller with a woman 's instinct she have hit the mark perhaps it would i admit i notice one or two thing she continue earnestly near the office be a empty lot with tree and bush i would as lief rest there as here ef it be the same to you then you kin look around for jaspar if ye have a mind to and if i find he watch he as i shall watch the other feller and then -- the rest be in the dear lord 's hand she adjust the thick veil which southern californian woman wear to keep the thick dust from they face and together we return to leveson 's office pass the door i could hear the typewriter still click mr panel sit down under a tree in the empty lot and for the first time since we have meet that day speak in she natural tone i come away without feed the chicken she say i look at my watch it be nearly six one hour of daylight remain leveson i happen to know be in the habit of dine about half-past six he often return to the office after dinner between the hotel paloma which lay just outside the town and the office run a regular service of street car leveson be the last man in the world to walk when he could drive it seem reasonably certain that jaspar fail to see leveson at the office would try to speak to he at the hotel from my knowledge of the man 's temperament and character i be certain that he would not shoot down he enemy without warn so i walk up to the hotel feeling easier in my mind the clerk whom i know well assign I a room i see several man in the hall but not uncle jap do mr leveson dine about half-past six i ask the clerk raise he brow that be queer he say you be the second man to ask that question within a hour old man panel ask the same thing and what do you tell he mr leveson do not dine till seven he go to the church first if the man have say that leveson go to heaven i could not have be more surprised then i remember what i have read in the local papers i have not see the church yet i have not wish to see it know that every stone in it be pay for with the sweat -- as uncle jap have put it -- of other man 's soul where be this church you do not know third turn to the leave after pass the olive branch saloon leveson own that too do not he the clerk yawn i dare say he own most of the earth around here and most of the people on it i walk quickly back towards the town wonder what take leveson to the church no doubt he want to see if he be get he money 's worth to note the day 's work perhaps to give the lie to the publish statement that he build church and never enter they nearly half-an-hour have pass since i leave mr panel when i reach the third turn to the left i see the church certainly the handsomest in san lorenzo it stand in a large lot litter with builder ' material the workman have leave it at six the building have a indescribably lifeless aspect a hour before man have be busy within and without it now not a soul be to be see i have time to walk round it to note that the door be lock to note also quite idly that the window of the vestry be open i could see no sign of uncle jap come round to the front i saw in the distance a portly figure approach follow by a thin dust-coloured wraith of a woman i slip behind a tree and wait leveson stroll up bland and impose he stand still for a moment stare intently at the outside of he church now complete then take a key from he pocket he open the vestry door and enter the building close the door behind he i go to meet mr panel see jaspar i have not what be that feller she always speak of leveson as a ` feller ' doin ' in a church it be he church he build it good

locality ajax smile we have not much he say but we feel that we have a right to expect high health we use to say he add that sickness be unknown in we hill till a wise doctor settle here from the east the professor frown i rise at six he say austerely i make a microscopical examination of the water in you new spring which rise i venture to remind you through soil which be undoubtedly diatomaceous that sound awful diatom in a fossilised condition be silicious and they be to be find in virginium in bermuda and here professor i be a ignoramus then it be my duty to inform you that the man or woman who drink water from that spring be swallow million of tiny flint knife hard as diamond dust -- indeed diatomaceous earth be use commercially as a polish powder you mean that if we drink that water we shall be polish off the professor glare like many distinguished scientist he take himself seriously and he know that this be a serious matter those tiny flint knife cut to riband the mucous membrane fortunately say ajax we do not drink that water the spring be only develop a few day ago in a graver voice he continue : we be exceedingly oblige to you of course we shall warn we man have nobody

and i stand by the editor o ' _ the tribune _ if i kin co-operate in yer important work why count I in the professor raise he grizzled brow in astonishment but he say politely -- i be very much oblige to you my question be this : ` do the cattle drink at the spring which bubble out of that hill yonder ' some of 'em do regularly not to say reglerly perfessor it be this way with cattle on a ranch as well water as ours they drink when they feel like it and they drink where the water be handy to the feed come to think of it there never have be much feed around that spring and it never flow good and hard till we open it a few day ago since you open it to you personal knowledge have cattle drunk of it uncle jake scratch he head the professor 's manner be impressive have you see cattle actually drink that water i dunno ' as i have i have see 'em stand in it animal have remarkable subjective intelligence -- what you would term instinct it would be extremely interesting to determine whether such instinct have prevent they from drink water unfit for animal consumption unfit for animal consumption by gosh that be what kill we cow i reckon we find she lyin ' by the spring cold a ' stiff two day ago have you bury the carcass not much turkey-buzzard attend to we cow funeral of course you look excited my friend i be we have lose other cattle and colt in this yere pasture ah murmur the professor he expression become benignant we s ` pose continued uncle jake that they die o ' old age you mention colt i do so colt die anyhow and anyway it be a solid fact that we have lose more animal in this pasture than anywhere else i 'll take my oath to that good say the professor heartily you have give to I information of value the professor return to the corral under the tree close to the creek in whose cooling water stand bottle of beer and wine a tender calf be be barbecue upon long willow spit sizzle and frizzle toothsome morsel make more toothsome by the addition of a sauce cunningly compound of chilli tomato and the pungent onion the professor make a noble meal he be delighted to observe how few of the guest slake they thirst with water and he quote the famous quatrain : let prince revel at the pump let peer with pond make free but whisky beer or even wine be good enough for I after the _ rodeo _ the professor light a large cigar and compose himself under a live-oak he mind ever active be wander through the home-pasture seek the fatal spring he be try to estimate the effect of silicious matter upon the mucous membrane of a cow when he see dan sombrero in hand bow low before he hello say the professor he eye rest professionally upon dan 's splendid proportion what a subject to cut up what a skeleton to articulate perfessor say dan i want you to hev a look at I the professor look at he my young friend he say genially you be worth look at do you drink water when i can not git nothing else reply dan water it be and lot of it except when i strike town if you must drink water say the professor with authority have it distil jeeroosalem exclaim dan that be a gilt-edged idea perfessor ye be a pathologist be not yer the professor nod genius however exalted acknowledge unsolicited testimonial from any source he see plainly that in dan 's eye he loom gigantic i be he reply graciously a path-finder a seeker-out of noo track to knowledge you might express it worse say the professor what can i do for you i be a mighty sick man say dan solemnly the professor be so astonished that he nearly bit through he excellent cigar but at once a flame sparkle in he gray eye if dan with he appearance of robust health be really a mighty sick man why then he case challenge attention he stand up and so to speak spread he wing hover over he lawful prey what be wrong

house in order hav 'n' t get no house say dan not quite comprehend but sadly frighten I and mame expect to build next year but that be off next year echo the professor testily the question be : where will you be next week dan stagger the professor have long retire from active practice remember with a qualm that he might have break this appalling news more considerately he say quietly -- i beg you pardon i ought to have temper this but you be a american and strong enough at this moment to know the truth i may pull you through without boast there be not another man in america or europe either who would say as much christopher columbus i do not call myself that say the professor modestly but i may claim to have discover pathogenic continent now my boy -- he take hold firmly of dan 's arm -- i be go to put you to bed no you be not say dan i have chore to do i can not be spare the professor nod you be a stout fellow after all half-an-hour will not make any material difference in half-an-hour you 'll find I in the bunk-house i be obligate to ye he add hastily so long he stride off the professor nod approvingly he have grit himself and esteem it highly in other i must pull he through he mutter \* \* \* \* \* when the professor reach the bunk-house he find three tall strong man await he they face tan by many sun exhibit a curious uniformity of tint -- the color of dirty gruel dan say in a voice that tremble -- these be my friend jimmie barker and pete holloway they help open up that dern spring they drink a plenty of the water jimmie here could not git enough of it they have the same symptom as i hev jimmie and pete writhe pin and needle all over say pete go to sleep on a ant ' nest onst say jimmie faintly this be a heap worse heaven help you ejaculate the professor ` pear to I say dan solemnly from what you say just now we be in the mulligatawny the professor mutter something encouraging but he remember the cow to bed with you he command within half-an-hour everyone on the ranch have hear the news the professor alone remain monumentally impassive all that be humanly possible shall be do he affirm and you treatment say i i have no drug here but already i have despatch a man to san lorenzo for strychnium which in the first stage be invaluable meantime i must do what i can with whisky have you plenty of whisky yes but -- i want a gallon of it of course you be aware -- you know i mean -- the professor wave a powerful arm beneath he shaggy brow he gray eye sparkle angrily i know what i be do he say sharply and i can not waste valuable time impart to a layman knowledge gather during a lifetime the whisky please -- _ at once _ i obeyed meekly five minute later the professor be walk towards the bunk-house with a gallon demijohn tuck under he arm a quarter of a hour afterwards he might have be see return he eye be positively snap with vigor and excitement for he love a fight for a fight 's sake ajax meet he professor he say i do not want you to impart the knowledge of a lifetime to I but do please tell we something we be on edge with anxiety the man of science melt with a shrug of he massive shoulder he say mildly for he -- my dear sir i will try to gratify a not unreasonable curiosity i do not wish to alarm you prematurely this morning but the worst have happen the silicious fragment in that confound earth have lacerate terribly the mucous membrane of these three unfortunate young man that in itself be a matter of small importance the mucous membrane be most delicate but it have quite amazing capacity of repair itself the point be this the water in that spring and -- i 'll be perfectly frank -- the water in most of the surface spring in this particular locality be simply swarm with pathogenic germ and amongst they i identify this morning the as yet unnamed _ coccus _ which i have the honor to discover and which be as deadly as the _ coma bacillus _ of asiatic cholera or -- shall i say -- the highly specialised venom of the rattlesnake great scot this _ coccus _ my dear friend increase and multiply under certain condition it exact a highly lacerated condition of the mucous membrane into which it burrow fortunately it be rare fortunately also it be seldom find in water which have filter through diatomaceous earth for these fossilised deposit be only find here and there and as a rule not near water they be three good fellow i hope to pull they through say the professor stoutly for the moment there be nothing more to be do they be in bed and not to put a fine point on it half-drunk alcohol stupefy the _ coccus _ but it do not destroy they i shall pour whisky down they throat till the drug i have order arrive from san lorenzo i have tell you foreman that my patient be not to be disturb after supper i shall administer another dose of whisky a hour later the professor accompany by I return to the bunk - house i hope to find they asleep he say i give they enough alcohol to induce stupor how much at least a quart i say with deference -- i do not presume to question you treatment but cowboy can carry a amazing quantity of whisky alcohol be a stimulant-narcotic be not it perfectly it stimulate first speak from a variegated experience of cowboy i should say that a quart of well-matured bourbon would barely suffice to stimulate three powerful young man ` um say the professor thoughtfully i have not consider that they assure I they be water-drinker however a mistake of that sort be easily rectify so speak he tiptoe to the door of the bunk-house and finger upon lip enter immediately a sharp exclamation indicate that something surprising have occur i follow quickly to find the professor stare pop-eyed at three vacant bunk go say the professor in stupefaction they can not have go far sir but within five minute judgment upon this important point have to be suspend uncle jake have obey instruction only too well he have not be near the bunk-house indeed he and the other ranch hand have be eat supper more than a hundred yard away he be the first to suggest that no cowboy travel far afoot -- a suggestion that send the professor at a smart trot towards the big barn here also be three vacant stall the professor 's patient illustrate pathetically the ruling passion have mount and gallop away uncle jake say with a curious air of conviction -- it be my idee that they want to hev one good time in town before they cash in they check incredible ejaculate the famous pathologist he look askance at I i reply hesitatingly -- i think it be possible perhaps probable if they be makin ' san lorenzy say uncle jake we 'll find they store clothes go too we hasten to the bunk-house yes upon the floor lay flannel shirt and jumper and overalls in a corner where the professor have leave it stand the demijohn of whisky uncle jake lift it gosh say he the whisky 's go too thank heaven mutter the professor wipe he forehead why do not you understand by the luck of thing they have take they medicine a quart apiece i gasp we shall find they dead drunk on the road uncle jake deliver himself -- it be my idee that they have jest fill up three bottle there be a rubbish heap outside we must follow they say the professor grimly he be no horseman and san lorenzo be six-and-twenty mile away yes say uncle jake as they approach the barn the professor whisper to I -- there be nothing to regret if i can get these boy into the county hospital before to-morrow morning i shall have do a splendid night 's work pick I out a decently mannered horse \* \* \* \* \* after the professor have administer the first dose of alcohol he patient lay quiet for at least three minute then jimmie say dolefully -- badly as she be treat I i would like to kiss my edna good-bye

from the chamber usually occupy by miss mary willing jimmie cry dan air you dead yet not quite come a attenuate whisper from the other side of the passage we 'll live to be marry old sock continue dan in a robuster voice but i have get the worst dose o ' prickly heat you ever see the following day we three friend be ride the range six month afterwards professor adam chawner resume he work at the smithsonian institute xii the babe one of the britisher who come to paradise be a irishman the son of a archdeacon with a large family and a small income he be a strapping fellow strong and sturdy as a camel -- and quite as obstinate he always speak affectionately of he people but i fancy they be not deeply grieve when he leave england i dare say he be troublesome at home you know what that mean however he be warmly welcome in paradise for he bring with he two hundred pound in cash and a disposition to spend it as quickly as possible ajax christen he the babe because he have a milk-and-roses complexion and a babe 's capacity for and love of liquid refreshment perhaps the archdeacon think that the west be a sort of kindergarten where child like the babe be give at small expense object-lesson and exercise peculiarly adapt to young and plastic mind in central america certain tribe live by the seaboard throw they child into the surf wherein they sink or learn to swim as the fate decree some sink when the babe 's two hundred pound be spend he come to we and ask for a job he say i remember that he be the son of a archdeacon and that he could trust we to bear that in mind we be so impressed by he guileless face and cock-a-hoop assurance that we have not the heart to turn he away at the end of a fortnight ajax take pencil and paper and compute what the babe have cost we he have stake a valuable horse he have smash a patent reaper he have set fire to the ranch and burn up five hundred acre of bunch grass and he have turn some of we quiet domestic cow into wild beast because -- as he put it -- he wish to become a vaquero he say that the billet of foreman would just suit he father 's son the equivalent of what the babe have destroy say my brother ajax if put out at compound interest five per cent would in a hundred year amount to more than fifty thousand pound i be awfully sorry murmur the babe i fear observe ajax to I later that we can not afford to nurse this infant i be of the same opinion so the babe depart and for a season we see he chubby face no more then one day like a bolt from the blue come a unstamped letter from san francisco the babe write to ask for money such letter as a rule may be leave unanswered but not always ajax and i read the babe 's ill-written line and fill in the gap in the text connote and collate it become a manuscript of extraordinary interest and significance we infer that if the sum demand be not send the writer might be constrain to cast himself as rubbish to the void now the babe have he little failing but cowardice be not one of they indeed he physical courage redeem in a sense he moral and intellectual weakness there be only one thing to do say ajax we must rescue the babe we 'll spin a dollar to determine who go to the city to-morrow morning i nod for i be smell the letter the taint of opium be on it awful -- be not it murmur ajax do you remember those loathsome den in chinatown and the creature on the mat and in the bunk and that missionary chap who say how hard it be to reclaim they poor babe then we fill we pipe and smoke they slowly we have plenty to think about for rescue a opium-fiend be no easy job and reclaim he afterwards be as hard again but the babe 's blue eye and he pink skin -- what do they look like now -- be plead on he behalf and we remember that he have play in he school eleven and could run a quarter-mile in fifty-eight seconds and be always cheery and good-tempered the wood of the colony and the west be full of such babe and they all like to play with edge tool next day we both go north ajax say that two head be better than one and that it be not wise to trust oneself alone in the stew of san francisco the police will not tell you how many white man be annually lose in those fester alley that lie north of kearney street but if you be interested in such matter i can refer you to a certain grim-faced guide who have spend nearly twenty year in chinatown and you can implicitly believe one quarter of what he say : that quarter will strain you credulity not a little we walk to the address give in the letter -- a low dive -- not a stone 's - throw from one of the biggest hotel west of the rocky mountain the man behind the bar say that he know the babe well that he be a perfect gentleman and a personal friend of he the fellow 's glassy eye and he grey-green skin tell they own story a more villainous or crafty-looking scoundrel it have be my good fortune not to see where be you friend say ajax the man behind the bar protest ignorance then my brother lay a five-dollar gold piece upon the country and repeat the question the man 's yellow finger begin to tremble gold to he be opium and opium hold all he world and the glory thereof i can not take you to he -- now he mutter sullenly you can reply ajax and you must the man glare at we doubtless he guess the nature of we errand and wish to protect he friend from the interference of philistine then he smile evilly and laugh all right come on i be not goin ' to take yer to the palace hotel he open the till and slip some money into he pocket then he put on a ragged overcoat and a hat which he draw down over he eye with a furtive jerk of he yellow finger then he go behind the bar and swallow something it be not whisky but it bring a faint tinge of color into he cheek and seem to stiffen he knee shall we walk boy or shall i send for my carriage you carriage repeat ajax be you speak of the patrol - waggon it be just round the corner this allusion to the police be not waste upon the babe 's friend who scowl and retort glibly -- there be better man than you mister who ride in that after this exchange of pleasantry we take the road and follow we guide across a great thorough-fare and into kearney street thence into the labyrinth of chinatown think ye could find yer way out of this ask we guide presently we have pass through a abominable rookery and be walk down a narrow alley seemingly desert yet i be sensible that eye be furtively watch we from behind bar window and i fancy that i hear whisper -- mere guttural sound that convey nothing to the ear save perhaps a warning that we be on unholy ground the path we tread be foul with refuse the stench be sicken the most forlorn cur would surely have slink from such a kennel and here _ here _ to this lazar-house of all that be unclean and infamous come of he own free-will -- the babe my god exclaim ajax in reply how can any man find he way _ into _ it and hark ye my friend for reason that we will not trouble you with we have not ask the police to accompany we but if we be not back at we hotel in two hour ' time the clerk have instruction to send a constable to you saloon here we air say we guide duck yer head we stoop beneath a low arch and enter a dark passage at the end be a rickety staircase and already we could smell the pungent fume of the opium and taste its bitterness as i groped my way down the stair i be conscious of a uncanny silence a silence eloquent of a sleep that be as death a sleep that always end in death it be easy to conceive death as a hideous personality lurk at the bottom of those rotten stair wait patiently for he victim not constrain to go abroad for they know that they be creep to he creep and crawl unassoiled by priest hinder by no physician unredeemed by love deaf and blind and dumb \* \* \* \* \* at the foot of the stair be another passage darker and filthier than the one above the wall be streaming with moisture and the atmosphere almost unendurable at that time the traffic in opium be receive the serious attention of the authority certain scandalous case of bribery at the custom house have stir the public mind and the police be instruct to raid all opium den and arrest whomsoever might be find in they the devotee of the pipe be accordingly compel to lie snug in place without the pale of police supervision : and this awful den be one of they it be now so dark that i could barely distinguish the outline of we guide who walk ahead of I suddenly he stop and ask I if i have any match i hand he my box which he drop and the match be scatter about in the mud at we foot he give I back my box and ask ajax for he match i dare say older and wiser man would have apprehend mischief but we be still in we salad day ajax give up he box without a protest the man strike a match after some fumble light a piece of candle and return to my brother he box it be empty -- for he have cleverly transfer the match to he own pocket -- but we do not know that then by the light of the candle i be able to take stock of my surroundings we be face a stout door : a door that without doubt have be construct for purpose of defense and upon the center of this we guide tap softly -- three time it open at once reveal the big body of a celestial evidently the cerberus of the establishment upon he fat impassive face lay the seal of a unctuous secrecy nothing more out of he obliquely-set eye he regard we indifferently but he nod to we guide who return the salutation with a sly laugh for some inexplicable reason that laugh fire my suspicion it be -- so to speak -- a open sesame to a chamber of horror the more horrible because intangible and indescribable ajax say afterwards that he be similarly affect the contagion of fear be a very remarkable thing and one little understand by the physiologist i remember i put my hand into my pocket because it begin to tremble and i be ashamed of it and then as i still stare at the fat chinaman he smooth mask seem to drop from he face and treachery cunning greed hatred of the white devil be reveal to I i be now convince we have come on a fool 's errand that be like to end evilly for we but be a fool i hold my peace and say nothing to ajax who confess later that if i have speak he would have second a motion to retreat we advance sensible that we be be trap : a psychological fact not without interest opposite the door through which we have just pass be another door as stout as the first the chinaman unlock this with a small key and allow we to enter the guide with the candle lead the way and then in a jiffy before we have time to glance round we the candle be extinguish the door be close we hear the click of a patent lock and we know that we be alone and in darkness the first thing that ajax say and he voice be not pleasant to hear be : this serve we right of all the confound fool who meddle with what do not concern they we be the greatest then i hear he fumble for he matchbox and then when he discover that it be empty he make some more remark not flattering to himself or I i be more frightened than angry with he rage and disgust be paramount we stand there in that squalid darkness for about a hundred year -lrb- it be really ten minute -rrb- and then the voice of we guide seem to float to we as if from a immeasurable distance boy he say how air ye makin ' it ajax answer he quite coolly -- what do you want we money of course what else the fellow do not reply at once these opium fiend have no bowels of compassion he be doubtless chuckle to himself at he own guile when he do speak the malice behind he word lend they point you money the five you give I 'll keep I a week and after that i 'll come for more with that the voice die away and ajax mutter : it look to I as if this be a case of put up the shutter we have forget all about the babe which be not surprising under the circumstance put _ up _ the shutter pull they down you mean there must be a window of sort in this room but after careful search we come to the conclusion that we be directly under the road-bed and that the only opening of any kind be the door through which we have pass i thought of that door and the face of the man behind it for what purpose save robbery and murder be such a room design i could not confront the certainty of violence with a jest as ajax do but i be of he opinion otherwise express : we have be trap like rat in a blind drain and would be knock on the head -- presently the uncertainty begin to gnaw at we vitals we do not speak for darkness be the twin of silence but we thought run riot i remember that i almost scream when ajax lay he hand on my shoulder and yet i know that he be stand by my side i shall try the heathen chinee he whisper so we feel we way to the door and tap three time very softly on the center panel to the oriental mind those tap spell bribery but the door remain shut what have you be think about say ajax after another silence my god -- do not ask I brace up say my brother i confess that he have steadier nerve than mine but then you see he have not my imagination i put my hand into he and the grip he give I be reassure i reflect that man build upon the line of ajax be not easily knock on the head it be a tight place he continue but we have be in tight place before although none that smell as close as this infernal hole now listen : i be prepared to lay odds that the babe be not a opium fiend at all and have never be near this den he write that letter at the saloon do not he and ten to one he borrow the paper from the bar - tender that be why it smell of opium the handwriting be very shaky why because the babe be only half alive after a prolonged spree that account for the tone of the letter the babe be think of the parsonage and he mother 's knee and all that you follow I -- eh now then i think it barely possible that instead of we rescue the babe he will rescue we we get in late last night but we name be chronicle in the morning papers for i see they there if the babe see a paper he will go to we hotel and -- if we be hang by that thread to eternity god help we i reply bitterly for the grim humor of my brother 's speech chill my marrow it _ be _ a slim chance but -- hang it -- a slim chance be better than none so we hug that sorry comfort to we heart and fall again into silence \* \* \* \* \* i remember that the folly the fatuity of what we have do oppressed I like a iron band around the skull common sense tell I that the man who have decoy we into chinatown would not be satisfy with robbery and what be the life of two white devil to the owner of this den suffer to escape we might inform the police the logical conclusion of my reflection be not worth record when that scoundrel empty the till into he pocket he make up he mind there and then never to come back say ajax in my ear he thought have be travel along the same line as mine and at about the same pace i be convince of this when he add slowly : starvation may be they game it would be the safest to play then the mad riotous desire to fight get hold of both of we we begin to search for a weapon : anything -- a stick a stone a bit of iron but we find nothing we have never carry pistol and we pocket knife be hardly keen or strong enough to sharpen a pencil despair be again grip I when ajax touch my arm we have examine the filthy floor of the room very systematically kneel side by side in the darkness and grope with eager finger in the dirty sand for there be no floor i have something he murmur then he seize my right hand in he left and guide it to some solid object lie deep in the sand the object prove to be a log san francisco be build on sand dune and in early day the house be log-cabin for the most part construct of log that two stout man could handle after many minute of silent but most vigorous excavation we joyfully decide that one of these very log have come into we possession we work steadily for about half a hour pause now and again to listen we be practically certain that the opium fiend have go to he pipe and it be more than probable that the fat mongol be no longer on guard know that we be safe in a strong-box to which he alone hold the key event prove we be wrong in both conjecture when the log be ready for use as a battering-ram we hold a council of war which last about half a minute if there be obviously only one thing to be do the sooner it be do the better i grasp the forward end of we weapon ajax be the heavier take the other and we charge that door with such hearty goodwill that at the first assault it yield lock and hinge be tear from the woodwork and the door itself fall flat with a crash like the crack o ' doom ajax the log and i roll into the next room and as we be grovel on the floor i see that the room be full of chinaman and that we late guide be in the middle of they the light be so bad that i be unable to see more than this it be plain that we have to deal with a organise gang of criminal thug who practice they trade as a fine art despite all proverb the foresee be what generally happen and we amazing advent in they midst create a sort of panic whereby we take advantage the celestial carry knife but they dare not use they because the light be so dim and the room so crowd the first thing that i see when i scramble to my foot be the fat dull face of the guard shine like a harvest moon and present a mark for my fist as round and big as a punching-bag i hit he once -- and that be enough then i begin to hear the measure thud of my brother 's blow the blow of a workman who know how to strike and where to strike at first they take they medicine without a whimper then they begin to squeal and chatter as the fear of the white devil get hold of they very soon i see red as we tommy say and remember nothing till i come to myself in the passage at the foot of the rotten stair we scurry up these and through the warren above like rabbit when the pole-cat pursueth and finally find ourselves in the alley where we call a halt by jove say ajax that be a ruction i look at he and burst out laughing : then he look at I and laugh louder than i we clothes be in rag we face be red and black with blood and grime every bone and sinew and muscle in we body ache and ache from the strain of strife it be not time to laugh yet say my brother and we run on down the alley out into a small by-street and straight into the arm of a policeman who promptly arrest we \* \* \* \* \* the rest of the story be in the newspaper next day although there be no mention of we name when the police reach the battlefield they find one dead man -- the opium-eating and smoking bar-tender he have die -- so say the doctor -- of heart failure few whites can smoke the pipe with impunity and he be not of they number the wound have be carry away and despite the strenuous endeavor of the police not one be arrest which prove that there be honor amongst these yellow-faced thief for a handful of gold-piece and no question ask be well know in chinatown to be the price offer for any information that would lead to the capture of one or more of the gang when we reach we hotel we find the babe patiently await we he complexion be slightly the worse for wear but he eye be as blue as ever and almost as guileless how wide they open when he listen to we story how indignant he wax when he learn that we have condemn he the son of a archdeacon as a opium fiend however he be very penitent and return with we to the ranch where he dig post-hole for a couple of month and behave like a model babe ajax write to the archdeacon and in due season the babe return to england where he wisely enlist as a trooper in a smart cavalry regiment a corps that he grandfather have command the pipeclay be in he marrow and he become in time rough-riding sergeant of the regiment i be tell that soon he will be offer a commission this story contain two moral : both so obvious that they need not be record xiii the baron of the many queer character who take up land in the brush hill near we ranch none excited greater tongue-wagging than the baron the squatter call he the baron he sign he name -- i have to witness he signature -- réné bourgueil the baron build himself a bungalow on a small hill overlook a pretty lake which dry up in summer and smell evilly also he spend money in plant out a vineyard and orchard and in make a garden what he do not know about ranching in southern californium would have fill a encyclopedia but what he do know about nearly everything else fill we and we neighbor with a ever-increasing amazement and curiosity why do such a man bury himself in the brush hill of san lorenzo county more he be past middle-age : sixty-five at least not a sportsman nor a naturalist but obviously a _ gentilhomme _ with the manners of one accustomed to the best society of society however he speak mordant word -- soziety in europe to-day he say to I shortly after he arrival ee a big monkey-house and all ze monkey be pull each ozer 's tail i pull no tail _ moi _ and i allow no liberty to be take wiz my person about a month later the baron be dine with we and i remind he of what he have say he laugh shrug he shoulder _ mon cher _ ze monkey in you backwoods be more -- _ diable _ -- moch more aggr-r-ressive zan ze monkey in ze old world they pull tail there say ajax but here they pull leg as well -- eh the baron smile ruefully stick out a slender delicately form foot and ankle yes he say thoughtfully old man dumble he pull my leg the dumble be neighbor of the baron and they sterile acre march with he john jacob dumble 's word might be as good or better than he bond but neither be take at par it be say of he that he prefer to take cash for tell a lie rather than credit for tell the truth dumble as we know have sell the baron one horse and saddle one frisian-holstein cow and a incubator the saddle give the horse a sore back the horse fall down and break its knee the cow dry up in a fortnight and the incubator cook egg to perfection but it would not incubate they i use it as a stove say the baron next summer when the pretty lake dry up and begin to smell we advise the baron to take a holiday we tell he of pleasant hospitable people in san francisco in menlo and at del monte who would be charm to make he acquaintance san francisco _ jamai jamais de la vie _ come with we to del monte del monte we explain that del monte be a huge hotel standing in lovely garden which run down to the sea _ jamai -- jamais _ repeat the baron we do not like to leave you at the mercy of john jacob dumble say ajax you have right i make not harmony wiz ze old man dumble we go home sorely puzzle obviously the baron have private reason and strong one for keep out of san francisco and del monte and it be significant -- as ajax say to I -- that a man who could talk so admirably upon art politics and literature never speak a word concern himself at del monte we happen to meet the french consul from he we learn that there be a certain réné comte de bourgueil-crotanoy the château bourgueil-crotanoy in morbihan be nearly as famous as chaumont or chénonceau the consul possess a _ almanack de gotha _ from this we glean two more fact réné comte de bourgueil have two son and no kinsman whatever you man say the consul discreetly must be somebody -- you say he be _ somebody _ -- well somebody else another wilkin say i pooh ejaculate ajax no frenchman of the comte de bourgueil 's position and rank -- he be a godson you know of the comte de chambord -- would come to californium without my knowledge say the consul the day after we return to the ranch we ride over to see how the baron fare we find he in a tent pitch as far as possible from the evil-smelling lake pass the bungalow we have note that six week ' uninterrupted sunshine have play havoc with the baron 's garden the man himself moreover seem to have wilt the sun have suck the color from he eye and cheek of a sudden old age have overtake he he greet we with he usual courtesy and ask if we have enjoy we holiday we tell he many thing about del monte but we do not mention the french consul then in we turn we beg for such news as he might have he reply solemnly -- i speak no more wiz ze dumble old man dumble ee a fraud _ moi _ i abominate fraud -- _ hein _ he obtain my money onder false pretence be it not so ah yes but i forgive ` im because he be poor but also since you go he obtain my secret -- i haf a secret -- under false pretence oh ze _ canaille _ i tell ` im that if ' e

at free-born american citizen what spitting be do here they do themselves you have right ze _ canaille _ say to I to _ I _ ` come ' he say ` come baron i have one six-shooter one shot-gun two pitchfork three spade and one mowing-machine take you choice ' he say ` and we can fight till ze cow come home ' he use zose word _ me amis _ 'till ze cow come home ' _ tien _ ze frisian - holstein cow who go dry when zey do come home -- _ hein _ he be so furiously angry that we dare not laugh but we be consume with curiosity to know what secret dumble have steal the baron do not inform we fortunately for we peace of mind dumble come to we early next morning he go to the marrow of the matter at once boy say he i want you to fix up thing between I a ' that crazy frenchman how 's that you friend wal he _ be _ a frenchy a ' he be crazy as i be prepared to prove but i do not want no trouble with he he be my neighbor and there ought to be nothin ' between I a ' he there 'll always be a barb wire fence say ajax boy when that ther ' pond o ' the baron 's tuk to smellin ' like dead cat he come to I and ask I to find someone to take keer o ' the bungalow i undertake the job myself i be to water they foreign plant o ' he do odd chore and sleep in the house night he offer good pay and i get a few dollar on account i aim to treat the baron right as i treat all my neighbor i mean to do more more than be agree on that be the right sperit -- be not it ya a ' so when i find out that there be a room in that ther ' bungalow lock up by mistake as i presoomed and that the key o ' the little parlor open it why naterally boy i jest peak in to see if everything be ok as for pryin ' and spyin ' why sech a idee never enter my head wal i peak in a ' i saw -- hold on say ajax what you see be something which the baron wish to be keep secret i reckon so though why in thunder -- then keep it secret -- but mercy sake i see nothing not a thing boy save two picter and a few old stick of furniture a ' see that thing be ok i shet the door but doggone it the cuss key would not lock it nex ' morning the baron find it open and jeeroosalem i never see a man git so mad and that be all that be all but I a ' the baron be not speakin ' we promise to do what we could more it must be confess on the baron 's account than for the sake of old man dumble accordingly we try to persuade the baron that he secret at any rate be still inviolate he listen incredulously he say he see nothing -- but some picture and old furniture _ mon dieu _ a ' zey tell ` im nossing _ saperlipopette _ come wiz I i can trust you you shall know my secret too we follow he in silence up the path which lead to the bungalow and into the house the baron unlock a door and unbolt some shutter we see two portrait splendid portrait of two handsome young man in uniform above the mantelpiece hang a emblazon pedigree : the family tree of the bourgueil-crotanoy peer of france the baron lay a lean finger upon one of the name i be réné de bourgueil-crotanoy he say we wait when he speak again he voice have change it be the voice of a very old man tire out indifferent poignantly feeble my boy say he indicate the two young man zey be dead no one of ze old bourgueil-crotanoy be leave except I -- and i as you see be half dead perhaps i be too proud my confessor tell I so always i be -- i be still -- proud of my race

bourgueil-crotanoy be bury a mural tablet record the name and the manner of death of the two son also a line in latin : ` tis better to die young than to live on to behold the misfortune and emptiness of a ancient house xiv jim 's pup jim misterton be a quiet reserved fellow who have come straight to paradise from a desk in some dingy london counting-house he tell we that something be wrong with he lung and that the simple life have be prescribe he be very green very sanguine and engage to be marry -- a secret confide to we later when acquaintance have ripen into friendship every Sunday jim

if ever a man count he chicken before the egg have be place in the incubator jim misterton be he ajax and i listen in silence to these outpouring ajax contend -- perhaps rightly -- that misterton 's optimism be part of the cure he bid I remark the young fellow 's sparkling eye and ruddy cheek he call that forsake claim of he eden say my brother shall we tell he what sort of a hade it really be one day some month after this we ride up to eden it present the usual heart-breaking appearance so familiar to man who have live in a wild country and witness year after year the furious struggle

to the ranch to give a luncheon in the bride 's honor the table be set under some splendid live-oak in the home-pasture which in may present the appearance of a fine english park a creek tinkle at we foot and beyond out of the soft lavender-coloured haze rise the blue peak of the santa lucium mountain remind one a little of the old country i remark to angelum who be all smile and quite conscious of be the most interesting object in the landscape oh please do not speak of england she pretty forehead pucker and she mouth droop piteously then she laugh as she launch into a vivid description of she first attempt to bake bread whenever she speak i see jim 's large slightly prominent eye fix themselves upon she face he beam satisfaction in everything she do or say would have be delightful have i be able to wean my thought from the place which he still believe to be -- eden at interval i hear he murmur this be rippin ' after luncheon angelum ask to see the ranch-house and almost as soon as we be out of hearing she say with disconcerting abruptness -- do you ranch pay she add half-apologetically i do so want to know it do not pay i answer grimly you be not go -- behind she falter use the familiar phrase of the country in which she have spend as yet but three week we be go behind i answer angry with she curiosity : not old enough or experienced enough to see beneath it fear and misery angelum say nothing more till we pass into the house then with lack - lustre eye she survey we belongings murmur endless commonplace phrase presently she stop opposite a photograph of a girl in court dress what a lovely frock she exclaim with real interest i do wish i would be present at court who be she oh a cousin i wonder you can bear to look at she without another word she burst into tear heart-breaking sob the more vehement because obviously she be try to suppress they i stare at she helpless with dismay confront for the first time with a emergency which seem to paralyse rather than

she say with a certain calmness -- i could not help it you and you brother have this splendid ranch you have experience capital everything look so prosperous and yet you be go -- _ behind _ and if that be the case what be to become of we i dare say thing will brighten up a bit brighten up she laugh derisively that be the worst of it the brightness be appalling these hard blue sky without a cloud in they this everlasting sunshine -- how i loathe it again i become tongue-tied jim think it _ be _ eden when he show I that ugly hut and he sickly fruit tree and that terrible little garden where every flower seem to be protest against its existence i have to make - believe that it be eden to I each day he go off to he work and he always ask the same question : ` you will not be lonesome little woman will you ' and i answer ` no ' but i be lonesome so lonesome that i should have go mad if i have not find someone -- you -- to whom i could speak out i be frightfully sorry i stammer thanks i know you be and you brother be sorry and everybody else too the woman my neighbor in the brush-hill look at I with the same question in they eye : ` what be you do here ' they say how impertinent pertinent i call it from that moment i regard she with different eye if she have brain to measure obstacle she might surmount they for brain in a new country be the one possession which adversity increase mr misterton i say slowly you be in a tight place and i will not insult you intelligence by call it by a prettier name but you can pull yourself and jim out of it and i believe you will thanks she say soberly for some week after this we see little of the misterton then jim ride down to the ranch with a exciting piece of news i have get a pup come out a pup in californium mean a young english gentleman generally the fool of the family who pay a premium to some fellow-countryman in return for board and lodging and the privilege of learn not so much how to do thing as how not to do they -- the latter be the more common object-lesson afford he ajax and i have glean experience with pup and we have long ago determine that no premium be adequate compensation for the task and responsibility of break they in jim go into detail it be tomlinson-thorpe you fellow have hear of he of course never say ajax the international you ought to see he go through a scrum with half a dozen fellow on he back a footballer say my brother thoughtfully one of the best naturally he put on a little side he have money and i tell he he could double it in a year or two _ you _ tell he that have you double you capital jim well -- er -- no but i be rather a juggin thorpe be as ` cute as they make 'em a man of mind and muscle murmur ajax and my greatest pal add the enthusiastic jame \* \* \* \* \* both ajax and i take a profound dislike to tomlinson-thorpe the moment we set eye upon he he present what be worst in the briton abroad -- a complacent aggressiveness temper by a condescension which nothing but a bullet can lay low but undeniably he be specially design to go through scrum or kitchen lancer the admire of all beholder a schoolgirl 's darling growl the injudicious ajax nothing of the sort retort jim i mean he add that thorpe appeal to -- er -- mature woman i know for a fact that the wife of a baronet be head over ear in love with he i hope he do not tell you so say ajax i should think not first and last he be a gentleman during the next few week we have abundant opportunity of testing this assertion for thorpe be kind enough to consume much of we time and provision he buy himself a smart pony and very accurately turn out would canter down to the ranch-house three or four time a week there be nothing to learn up there he explain it be fair to add that he help we on the range and exhibit aptitude in the handling of cattle and horse meanwhile he advent have make a enormous difference to the misterton jim fetch a hire girl from town and angelum be relieve during a scorching summer of a housewife 's most intolerable duty also when jim be hard at work clear he brush-hill wrestle with refractory root of chaparral and manzanita he greatest pal be kind enough to undertake the entertainment of angelum the pair ride about together and jim tell we that it do he heart good to see how the little woman have brighten up thorpe for he part admit with become modesty that he be most awfully sorry for he friend 's wife my heart bleed for she he tell ajax the bounder with the bleeding heart say ajax to I that same evening we do not know that he be a bounder i object he bound and he be as unconscious of he bound as a kangaroo as for jim he be the apex of the world 's pyramid of fool angelum can take care of herself can she at we fall round-up ajax 's question be answer conspicuously angelum attach herself to tomlinson-thorpe regardless of the gaping eye and mouth of neighbor puritan to the backbone in everything except the stealing of unbranded calf most unfortunately thorpe -- i think more kindly of he when i do not give he he double-barrelled name -- be daily exhibit those quality which have carry he through scrum in a bar-room brawl with two pot-valiant cowboy he have come out supremely on top they have jeer at he riding-breeches at he bob-tailed cob at he english accent and thorpe have suffer they gladly then quite suddenly angelum 's name fall upon a silence as suddenly thorpe seize both man one in each hand and bring they head together with a crash which the barkeeper describe afterwards as splendiferous with a amazing display of physical violence he fling they apart each fall in a crumpled heap of profanity upon the floor do not fool with that feller be the verdict in the foothill the affair would have be of no consequence have not jim be present when the row take place jim might have play the _ beau rôle _ have he carry a pistol admittedly he would have be lick in a fight with either cowboy singly thorpe so i be tell entreated jim to keep the story from he wife angelum have it with slight exaggeration from the hero-worshipper 's lip within a hour it bring she heart into she mouth i tell you the simple fellow tell ajax and later ajax murmur to I : i wonder whether it strike angelum that jim would have tackle both of 'em if thorpe have not interfere a dozen trifle hardly worth record emphasise the difference between jim and he greatest pal thorpe master the colt which have throw jim thorpe when fresh meat be wanted kill handsomely the fat buck miss by the over-eager jame thorpe make a pretty profit over a hog deal at the psychological moment when poor misterton allow three poland-china sow to escape through a improperly construct fence thorpe be a man do angelum think of jim as a mouse \* \* \* \* \* after the fall round-up ajax and i spend a month fishing in british columbium when we get back to the ranch one of the first to greet we happen to be jim misterton he look so pale and thin that i think for a moment he old enemy have attack he however he assure we that he be perfectly well but unable to sleep properly we ask he to stay to supper rather as a matter of form for he have always refuse we invitation unless angelum be include to we surprise he accept he 'll uncork himself after the second pipe say the sage ajax he do and oddly enough we cousin 's photograph in court dress move he as it have move he wife boy he say i be the biggest fool that ever come to this burnt-up wilderness and i be a knave because i persuade the sweetest girl in england to join I oil may calm troubled water but it feed flame we say something nothing worth repeat then jim stand up tremble with agitation wave he briar pipe -lrb- which have go out -rrb- cursing himself and the brazen sky and the sterile soil and the jack-rabbit and barb - wire and he spring now a pool of stagnant mud when he have finish -- and how he tongue must have ache -- ajax say quietly -- be you any good as a clerk jim nod sullenly i know my business of course heaven what a soft job that be compare to what i have tackle out here it might be possible to find another such job in californium you never think of that jim 's face brighten never he declare fresh air and exercise be the prescription -- and i be feed up on both if i could get a billet as clerk in san lorenzo if -- he clench he fist unable to articulate another word then very slowly he go on : boy i would give my life to get angelum away from paradise we 'll help you say ajax mr misterton would be much happier in san lorenzo i add jim flush scarlet angelum marry the wrong man he say deliberately ajax interrupted jim fill you pipe he hold out he pouch which jim wave aside she marry the wrong man he repeat and that be what be keep I awake night she would have be happy with thorpe he could have give she all the little thing woman value and how about the great thing the little thing be great thing -- to she good-night boy we shake hand and he go to the door on the threshold he turn a tired face towards we i hope i have not give you fellow the idea that angelum be not the best little woman on earth she never complain and thorpe have be a pal in ten thousand he heart simply bleed for angelum so long ajax mix a stiff tumbler before he put it to he lip he look at I if that bounder 's heart would bleed and bleed and bleed to death i should not cross the road to fetch a doctor \* \* \* \* \* about a fortnight later the annual county fair be hold outside san lorenzo we drive to the buena vista hotel and to we surprise upon the broad verandah we discover angelum in the last of she pretty dress and thorpe angelum explain matter jim and she be thorpe 's guest for the week they be go to the race to the ball to all the show she finish breathlessly -- and there be a captive balloon thorpe add jim be rather blue you know as soon as we be alone ajax say savagely -- do you think jim understand understand what oh do not pretend we know we thorpe by this time he be a cutlet - for-a-cutlet fellow what do i say a cutlet-for-a-baron-of-beef gentleman hang he but angelum -- angelum be a reckless little idiot she be be starve for a lark and she be swallow it without count the cost but i trust she say i and jim be here ajax shrug he shoulder and walk away next day at the race jim attach himself to we while aloft in the grand-stand angelum sit with thorpe : the handsomest couple at the fair for the moment at any rate angelum be enjoy herself jim on the other hand look miserable contrast have discolor the good time he could not snatch pleasure out of the present because he see so plainly the future i be a wet blanket he say dolefully every time angelum laugh i want to cry and yet i ought to be thankful that old thorpe can give she what i can not he be do the thing well say ajax meaningly he have be leave a bit more money do not he tell you no and he be go to buy that big tract to the north-west of we mum 's the word but -- between ourselves -- the agreement be sign oh say ajax the big tract in question belong to a bank whose president a very good fellow be we particular friend early next morning i pay he a visit almost immediately he ask I question about thorpe which i be able to answer satisfactorily from a business point of view mr thorpe strike I as a very shrewd young man he 'll get there he play football for england ah well indirectly i suppose we can thank you for this deal you can thank jim misterton and he wife i have not the pleasure of know they they have something to do with this eh everything the president frown he voice be not quite so pleasant as he say -- be they likely to claim a commission certainly not all the same something be due without the misterton you would never have sell this ranch to thorpe one moment it be in you power to do these people a service and it will cost you nothing jim misterton be a clerk in london and a capable one but he health break down he come out here to the brush-hill he get back he health but he be lose everything else give he a place in this bank he be straight as a string and he know he work before i leave the bank it be understand that jim be to call upon the president and submit he credentials humanly speak the billet be secure nothing remain but to find jim to my surprise however ajax urge I to wait a few hour i want to see jim 's honest grin again as much as you do but we must tell he before thorpe when i upset a apple-cart i like to see the apple roll about do not you we 'll tell 'em after dinner to-night that afternoon we forgather in the fair grounds the racing be uninteresting and presently angelum suggest that we should go up in the captive balloon we have watch it ascend and descend with interest some of we friend bore we by describe at too great length the panoramic splendor of the view angelum and ajax want to soar thorpe and i prefer mother earth to jim be offer the casting vote he spin a dollar to decide and within a few minute the five of we be seat in the wicker-car i remember that we aeronaut inspire confidence in angelum because he wear the grand army medal a windlass and a donkey-engine control the big rope which hold we captive we go aloft in a series of disagreeable and upset jerk this may be a unusual experience but it be ours i be a bad sailor and so be ajax neither of we smile when thorpe address the veteran as -- steward suddenly there come a still sharper jerk and the cable split the balloon seem to leap upward swerve like a frightened bird and then catch by the wind sail upward and seaward swooping on with a paradoxically smooth yet uneven flight jeeroosalem ejaculate we aeronaut then he add coolly enough : sit tight you 'll none of you be the worse for this little trip he confidence diffuse itself agreeably angela laugh thorpe 's face relax jim peer over the edge of the car gad say he we seem to be go a tremendous pace the veteran take a squint alow and aloft as he finger the rope that open the valve next time he speak the confidence have leak from he voice leave behind a nervous squeak this yere valve will not work oh say angelum she look at thorpe as if seek from he some word some sign of comfort and encouragement at the same moment she make a instinctive movement towards he jim be stare at she very pale i see he half-open he lip and then close they frighten as i be i can swear that jim be think only of he wife and what he could read upon she face thorpe be quite impassive but he finger be twitch then i hear jim 's voice curiously distinct -- what be you go to do the valve may work loose anyway she leak a bit guess we be all right once more he confidence diffuse itself subtly and again a phrase shatter it how far be san lorenzy from the ocean eleven mile say ajax we be sailin ' plumb into the fog in late October the sea fog generally begin to roll up about four o'clock if the breeze be from the land the fog be keep at bay for a hour or two as a rule the breeze fail and then the fog assert its dominion over all thing on land and sea without know much of aerial navigation i grasp the fact that we be be sweep into the fog and that if we intend to descend on land there be not a minute to be lose thorpe i fancy have arrive at the same conclusion he say in a queer high-pitched tone -- can not you stick a knife into the balloon it be not easy and it be mighty risky jerking at the two rope in he hand he speak collectedly in a indifferent tone -- the tone of a man who have confront death often who realize he impotence who submit apathetically to impend fate whether good or ill it be very cold say angelum jim begin to unbutton he jacket do not she say sharply all the coat in the world would not warm I stick a knife into the confound thing repeat thorpe s ` pose you do it say the veteran snappishly thorpe stand up at once stagger and fall upon the floor of the car he could master a broncho but he have never attempt to boss a balloon the old man smile a man say he may be mighty smart on land and behave like a baby in a balloon you sit tight mister the balloon be now careen like a racing-yacht in a squall we have meet oppose current of air in the debatable area where wind and fog struggle for the mastery the fog have the mighty trade wind behind it force it landward already we be approach the sand-dune the very spot for a easy descent if we could descend gosh i have do it above i could hear the soft sibilant sound of the escape gas not unlike the hiss of a snake i be also sensible that my heart not to mention other important organ be try to get into my throat valve must ha ' bust say the old man stand by to throw out ballast the bottom of the car be cover with sack of sand ordinarily one untie the sack and the sand be allow to trickle out in a harmless stream i peer over the side the balloon be now so to speak on a even keel fall almost perpendicularly i see far down a flash of blue chuck 'em out boy several sack go overboard and at once my solar plexus feel easier again i peer down and see nothing the fog have engulf we but i could hear the crash of the big comber as they break upon the rock to the north of avilum what follow take place within a few seconds we be encompass by thick dank fog the balloon be perfectly steady descend less quickly but with inexorable certainty into the ocean around a uncanny silence encompass we above we could hear the hiss of the serpent below the menacing roar of the breaker then the old man say curtly -- hurry up boy if we can get she up again we may just strike the dune what wind there be blow from the west we throw out the rest of the sack the balloon rise and slowly sink again the old man take off he coat i can not swim worth a cent he mutter grimly but i be a-going to try if she tumble quietly into the water the wind may blow we ashore a few more seconds pass i hear a queer noise and discover that my tooth be chatter thorpe be take off he boot the next moment the balloon give a tremendous bind i know that i nearly fall upon my face and angelum be throw violently into the bottom of the car for a appreciable interval not one of we realize that jim have slip overboard the trade 's get we say the old man we shall just make they dune oh thank god exclaim angelum by the tone of she voice by the smile parting she lip i could see that she do not know what have happen terror have dull all faculty save the one overmaster instinct of self-preservation thorpe be about to speak but ajax catch he eye and with a gesture silence he once more the balloon begin to fall -- \* \* \* \* \* we be throw out upon the dune some of we be badly bruise when we stagger to we foot angelum say quickly -- why where 's jim thorpe tell she let we give he credit for that when he have finish he put out he hand but she turn from he to ajax come she say she run past we towards the beach instinctively take the right direction as she run she call shrilly : jim -- jim ajax follow for a instant thorpe and i be alone face to face why do he do it he ask because he think that angelum have marry the wrong man but she -- do not when i catch ajax up angelum be still ahead run like a mad creature jim never take off he boot say ajax nor he coat all the same the love of life be strong we do not know how far he be from the water the fall may have kill he i feel in my bone that he be not dead and that angelum will find he we press on unwilling to be outstrip by a woman but sensible that we be run ourselves to a standstill the fog be thicker near the water 's edge and angelum 's figure loom through the mist like that of a wraith but we still hear she piteous cry : jim -- jim we be nearly spend when we overtake she she have stop where the foam from the breaker lay thick upon the sand listen she say we hear nothing but we thump heart and the raucous note of some sea-bird he answer I she assert with conviction there certainly my ear catch a faint cry to the left we run on forget we bruise again angela call and out of the mist beyond the breaker come a answering voice we shout back and plunge into the surf angelum kneel down upon the sand afterwards we admit that angelum have save he life although jim could not have fight he way through the breaker without we help indeed when we get he ashore i make certain that he be dead have angelum 's instinct or intuition fail have she hesitate for a few minute jim would have drown within a few hundred yard of the spot where the balloon strike since jim have maintain that he be sink when he hear she voice she faint attenuate tone infuse strength into he limb and hope into he heart we dine together and i deliver the president 's message in thorpe 's presence he shake hand with jim and say quietly -- i be happier to-night than i ever expect to be again bounder or not he mean it only the other day i receive a letter from angelum she write at length concern she eldest child my godson and she mention incidentally that jim be now cashier of the san lorenzo bank xv mary he real name be quong will but my brother ajax always call he mary because the boy 's round childish face have a singular smoothness and delicacy a good and faithful servant he prove during three year then he run away at the time of the anti-chinese riot despite we assurance that we wish to keep he and protect he I no likee coon dog say he with a shiver the coon dog be a pack of cowboy engage in hunting chinamen out of the peaceful but sometimes ill-smelling place which by thrift patience and unremitting labor they have make peculiarly they own from the coon dog ajax and i receive a letter command we to discharge mary a skull and cross-bone and a motto beware the bite of the coon dog embellished this billet which be write in red ink courtesy constrain we to acknowledge the receipt of it next day we put up a sign by the corral gate -- no hunting allow on this ranch in the afternoon mary disappear uncle jake be of opinion that mary have divine the meaning of we sign he have say to uncle jake : i go I makee heap trouble for boss later upon the same day we learn from a

after dinner say ajax frowning but i be go into town to-morrow to bring he back however mary bring himself back that same night we be smoke we second pipe after supper when ajax point a expressive finger at the window exclaim sharply : great scot what be that press against the pane glaring in at we be a face -- a face so blanched and twist by terror and pain that it seem scarcely human we hurry out mary staggered towards we in he face be the cruel venomous spine of the prickly pear the tough bough of the manzanita thicket through which he have plunge have scourge he like a cat-o ' - nine tail what clothes he wear be drip with mud and slime coon dog come he gasp i tellee you then he bolt into the shadow of the oak and sage brush we pursue but he run fast dodge like a rabbit till he tumble over and over -- paralyse by fear and fatigue we carry he back to the ranch-house prop he up in a chair and despatch uncle jake for a doctor before midnight we learn what little there be to know mary have be chase by the coon dog he of course be a-foot the cowboy be mount a couple of barbed-wire fence have save he from capture we have listen that afternoon too coolly perhaps to a tale of many outrage but the horror and infamy of they be not bring home to we till we see mary tattered scar bedraggled lie crumple up against the gay chintz of the arm-chair the poor fellow keep mutter : coon dog come i know killee you killee I heap bad man next morning uncle jake and the doctor ride up i can do nothing say the latter presently it be a case of shock he may get over it he may not another shock would kill he i 'll leave some medicine upon further consultation we put mary into ajax 's bed the chinaman 's bunk-house be isolate and the vaquero sleep near the horse corral a couple of hundred yard away mary feebly protest : no likee coon dog -- allee same debil -- killee you killee I heap bad man we try to assure he that the coon dog be at heart rank cur mary shake he head : i know you see the day pass night set in about ten mary say convincingly -- coon dog come coon dog come no no say ajax i slip out of the house from the marsh beyond the creek come the familiar croaking

know what subtle instinct warn he of the approach of danger who can answer such question it be a fact that the coon dog be on the road to we ranch and that they arrive just one hour later we hear they yell and shout at the big gate then the pop of pistol tell we that the sign clearly to be see in the moonlight be be riddled with bullet we must face the music say ajax grimly come on mary lay back on the pillow senseless pass through the sit - room i remind ajax that my duck-gun a eight-bore could carry two ounce of buck-shot about one hundred yard we must not fight 'em with they own weapon he answer curtly the pop cease suddenly silence succeed they be have they bad time too say ajax they be hitch they plug to the fence hullo uncle jake slip on to the verandah six-shooter in hand before he

old man 's voice express doubt quite sure shush-h-h uncle jake slide off the verandah but he retire -- so we discover later -- no farther than the water-butt behind it ajax and i go into the sitting-room from the bed-room beyond come no sound whatever through the window the pack be see -- slowly advance come in gentleman say ajax loudly he stand in the doorway a unarmed man confront a dozen desperado wheer 's the chinaman -- quong i recognize the voice of a cowboy whom we have employ : a man know in the foothill as cock-a-whoop charlie he be here ajax answer quietly a tall gaunt

which have come at last when ajax return he say quietly : come and see the end of what you begin what you hang back by god -- you shall come dominate by he eye and voice the pack slink into the bed-room upon mary 's once comely face the purple weal be criss-crossed and sore have break out wherever the cactus spine have pierce the flesh a groan escape the man who have work this evil and

last only five year and when the last penny be spend dick write to he father and demand a allowance he know that the parson be live in straitened circumstance with two daughter to provide for and he know also that he mother 's fortune should in equity have be divide among the family but as he point out to he dear old governor a carteret must not be allow to starve so the parson who love the handsome lad put down he hack and send the prodigal a remittance he have better have send he a hempen rope for necessity might have make a man out of master dick the remittance turn he into a moral idiot a carteret as you know can not do himself justice upon five pound a month so dick be constrain to play the part of mentor to sundry youthful compatriot teach they a short cut to ruin and share the while they purse and affection but very unhappily for dick the supply of fool suddenly fail and lo dick 's occupation be go finally in despair he ally himself to another remittance man a ex-deacon of the church of england and the two drift slowly out of decent society upon a full tide of bourbon whisky tiding must have come to the parson of he son 's unhappy condition or possibly he decide that the miss carteret be entitle to the remittance it be certain that one dreadful day dick 's letter contain nothing but a sheet of note-paper i can send you no more cheque -lrb- write the parson -rrb- not another penny will you receive from I i pray to god that he may see fit to turn you heart for he alone can do it i have fail dick show this letter to he last and only friend the ex-deacon the rev tudor crisp know to many publican and sinner as the ` bishop ' the two digest the parson 's word in a small cabin situate upon a pitiful patch of ill-cultivated land land irreclaimably mortgage to the hilt which the ` bishop ' speak of as my place dick -lrb- he have a sense of humor -rrb- always call the cabin the rectory it contain one unplastered unpapered room carpetless and curtainless a bleak and desolate shelter that even a sheep-herder would be loth to describe as home in the corner be two truckle bed a stove and a large demijohn contain some cheap and fiery whisky in the center of the floor be a deal table on the rough redwood wall be shelf display many dilapidated pair of boot and shoe also some fly-specked sport print and upon a row of nail a collection of shabby discolor garment ancient hartog manifest even in decay a certain jaunty dissolute air at once ludicrous and pathetic outside in front the ` bishop ' have lay out a garden wherein nothing might be find save weed and empty beer bottle dead man deny decent interment behind the cabin be the dust-heap a interesting and historical mound a epitome indeed of the ` bishop 's ' gastronomical past that emphasise he descent from olympus to hade for on the top be a plebeian deposit of tomato and sardine can whereas below if you stir the heap might be find a nobler stratum of terrine once savoury with _ foie gra _ and strasbourg _ pâté _ of jar still fragrant of fruit embed in liqueur of bottle that have contain the soup that a divine love -- oxtail turtle mulligatawny and the like upon rectory glebe and garden be legibly inscribe the grim word -- ichabod he mean what he say growl dick so far as he be concerned i be dead you ought to be say the ` bishop ' but you be not what be you go to do this question burn its insidious way to dick 's very vitals what could he do whom could he do after a significant pause he catch the ` bishop 's ' eye and hold he pipe as it might be a pistol put it to he head and click he tongue do not say the ` bishop ' feebly the two smoke on in silence the rev tudor crisp reflect mournfully that one day a maiden aunt might withdraw the pittance that keep he large body and small soul together this unhappy thought send he to the demijohn whence he extract two stiff drink no say dick push aside the glass i want to think to think curse it there must be a way out of the wood if i would capital we could start a saloon we know the rope and could make a living at it more too but now we can not even get one drink on credit why do not you say something you stupid fool he speak savagely the past reel before he eye all the cheery happy day of youth he could see himself at school in the playing field at college on the river in london at the club other figure be in the picture but he hold the center of the stage god in heaven what a fool he have be the minute glide by and the ` bishop ' refill he glass glance from time to time at dick he be somewhat in awe of carteret but the whisky warm he into speech look here he say with a spectral grin what be enough for one be enough for two we 'll get along old man on my money till the time mend dick rise tall and stalwart and then he smile not unkindly at the squat ungainly ` bishop ' you be a good chap he say quietly shake hand and-good-bye why where be you go ah who know if the fairy tale be true we may meet again later crisp stare at the speaker in horror he have reason to know that dick be reckless but this dare-devil despair apall he yet he have wit enough to attempt no remonstrance so he gulp down he whisky and wait it be no use crane at a blind fence continue dick sooner or later we all come to the jumping-off place i have come to it to-night you can give I a decent funeral -- the governor will stump up for that -- and there will be pickings for you you can read the service ` bishop ' gad i would like to see you in a surplice please do not plead the rev tudor he 'll be good for a hundred sov continue dick you can do the thing handsomely for half that for god 's sake shut up pooh why should not you have you fee that hundred would start we nicely in the saloon business and -- he be walk up and down the dusty dirty floor now he stop and he eye brighten but crisp note that he hand tremble give I that whisky he mutter i want it now the ` bishop ' hand he he glass dick drain it and laugh do not say the ` bishop ' for the third time dick laugh again and slap he on the shoulder then the smile freeze on he lip and he speak grimly what do the apostle say -- hey we must die to live a straight tip well -- i shall obey the apostolic injunction gladly i be go to die to-night do not jump like that you old ass let I finish i be go to die to-night but you and i be go into the saloon business all the same yes my boy and we 'll tend bar ourselves and keep we eye on the till and have we own bottle of the best and be perfect gentleman come on let 's drink to my resurrection here be to the man who be and be and be to be you be a wonder reply the ` bishop ' fervently i understand you mean to be you own undertaker i do my lord now give I the baccy some ink and paper and a hour 's peace but the hour pass and find dick still compose the ` bishop ' watch he friend with spaniel-like patience at last the scribe fling down he pen and read aloud as follow -- the rectory san lorenzo _ September 1 _ to the rev george carteret dear sir -- i beg to advise you with sincere regret on my part of the sudden demise of you son richard beaumont carteret who die at my house just three day ago of heart failure quite painlessly you will find enclosed the doctor 's certificate the coroner 's report and the undertaker 's bill _ pay and receipt _ i have a very honest friendship for you son although i deplore a misspend youth but i rejoice to say that poor dick live long enough to heartily repent he of he sin which after all be sin against himself he often talk of home and you allude feelingly to the sacrifice you have make on he behalf -- sacrifice that he confess be far greater than he desert i be a poor man but i feel impel to give you son the funeral of a gentleman the bill i have pay as you will observe in full include the purchase in perpetuity of a lot in the cemetery should you see fit to refund I these amount i shall not refuse the money if on the other hand you repudiate the claim i shall let the matter drop i could not permit my friend to be bury as a pauper it be possible that you may wish a stone place at the head of the grave a suitable cross of plain white marble would cost about two hundred dollar if you care to entrust I with the sad commission i will give it my earnest attention i refer you to my aunt miss janetta crisp of montpelier road brighton and also to the clergy list very truly yours tudor crisp -lrb- the rev -rrb- there exclaim mr carteret that will do the trick the bill and other document we 'll forge at we leisure to-morrow i do not quite like the use of my name protest the rev tudor crisp dick explain that he reverence would be entitle to half the plunder and that discovery be almost impossible still despite dick 's eloquence the ` bishop ' submit that such a cruel fraud be tough on the old gentleman on the contrary retort the other he will assume that i die in the odour of sanctity in the atmosphere of a rectory in the arm of a parson he 'll worry no more poor old chap about my past or my future this be the turning-point of we fortune do not look so glum man here -- hit the demijohn again but the ` bishop ' decline this invitation and betook himself to he blanket mutter inarticulate nothing dick relight he pipe and refill he glass then he walk to the mantelshelf and gaze long and critically at three frame photograph of he father and two sister these be almost the only property he possess it be significant from a ethical point of view that dick keep these picture where he could see they the ` bishop ' have photo also but they lay snug at the bottom of a old portmanteau he reverence be sensible that he be not worthy to keep company with even the picture of honorable and respectable person no such qualm affect dick he regard these photo as credentials he father have a charming face -- one of those human document whereon be inscribe honor culture benevolence and the wisdom that be not of this world the sister too have comely feature and stranger introduce to the family group always feel more kindly dispose to the prodigal so far from such nice people dick have impetrate more than one loan use these portrait as collateral security do he heart soften as he bid they farewell who can tell \* \* \* \* \* within six week the rev tudor crisp receive a cheque from distant dorset and the proceeds be duly invest in a saloon in san clemente a town some twenty mile from san lorenzo moreover the business prosper from the start the partner crisp and cartwright -lrb- dick deem it wise to alter he name -rrb- keep no assistant so there be no leakage from the till they understand that this liquor traffic be a shameful trade but they pronounce themselves unable to follow any other curiously enough the work prove a tonic to the ` bishop ' he allow himself so many drink a day and observe faithfully other rule to he physical and financial betterment he start a reading - room in connection with the bar for he have have experience in such matter when a curate at home and the illustrated papers send regularly by he maiden aunt be in great demand indeed the mere reading about football match and the like create a unquenchable thirst in cowboy and sheep-herder moreover the ` bishop ' enforce order and decorum be a muscular christian and the boy learn to curb obscene tongue in he presence dick marvel at the change in he partner but he be shrewd enough to see that it bring grist to the gin-mill once a parson always a parson dick would say and the rev tudor would blush and sigh he never speak of he clerical day but once dick catch he furtively examine a picture of himself in surplice and cassock each week a division of the profit be make the ` bishop 's ' share be deposit in the local bank but where dick 's dollar go it would be indiscreet to tell he have no stomach for economy and observe no rule when he apprehend the general drift of thing he be content to let the ` bishop ' have he way and say in regard to the conduct of the business he reverence buy the cigar and liquor dick could hardly be call a sleep partner for he take the night watch but the ` bishop ' do most of the work and keep the book before two year have pass a capital restaurant be add to the reading-room where the best of steak and chop might be have hot and hot at all hour and at a reasonable price dick never know it but the ` bishop ' write to miss janetta crisp and beg she to send no more cheque he tell he kind auntie very modestly that he have a bank account of he own and that he hope one day to thank she in person for all she have do for he towards the close of the third year the ` bishop ' tell dick that it would be well for they to leave they saloon and to purchase a small hotel then offer for sale dick tell he old friend to go ahead he reverence supply dick 's share of the purchase-money and the saloon know they no more but the hotel under the ` bishop 's ' management prove a tiny gold mine all this time however the memory of that dirty trick he have help to play upon a honest gentleman fester in he memory he fear that nemesis would overtake he and time justified these fear for in the spring of 1898 come a second letter to the rev tudor crisp of the rectory san lorenzo a letter that the poor ` bishop ' read with quicken pulse and then show to dick my very dear sir -lrb- it begin -rrb- a curious change in my fortune enable I to carry out a long-cherished plan i purpose dv to pay a pilgrimage to my poor son 's grave and shall start for californium immediately perhaps you will be good enough to let I spend a couple of day at the rectory it will be a mournful pleasure to I to meet one who be kind to my dear lad i will write to you again from san francisco very gratefully yours george carteret if the hotel uninsured have suddenly burst into flame the ` bishop ' would have manifest far less consternation he rave incoherently for nearly ten minute while dick sit silent and nervous beneath a storm of remorse i 'll meet you father in san francisco say the unhappy crisp and make a clean breast of it that spell ruin say dick coldly the governor be a dear old gentleman but he have the carteret temper he would make this place too hot for you and too hot for I i have a voice in this matter and for once he add with unnecessary sarcasm i propose to be hear what do you mean to do if necessary i 'll resurrect myself i 'll play the hand alone you have no more tact than a hippopotamus and i 'll meet the governor do not stare do you think he 'll know I not much i leave dorset a smooth - face boy to-day i be beard like the pard my voice my figure the color of my hair my complexion be quite unrecognisable it may be necessary to show the governor my grave but i sha not bring he down here now i must commit murder as well as suicide what i must kill you you duffer do you think my father would return to england without thank the man who be kind to he dear lad and you would give the whole snap away yes i 'll call upon he as cartwright the administrator of the late tudor crisp 's estate if it be not for that confound grave and marble cross i could fix he in ten minute do not frown i tell you ` bishop ' you be not half the fellow you be perhaps not reply he reverence humbly but when dick be alone he mutter to himself : now what the deuce do the governor mean by a curious change in he fortune \* \* \* \* \* the rev george carteret be sit at ease in he comfortable room at the acropoli hotel the luxury of they be new to he yet not unplease after many year of rigorous self-denial and poverty it seem strange however that in the evening of life riches should have come to he -- riches from a distant kinsman who live have hardly notice the obscure scholar and parson five thousand pound a year be fabulous wealth to a man whose income heretofore have number as many hundred and -- alas he son be dead not that the parson love he daughter the less because they be girl but as the cadet of a ancient family he have a tory squire 's prejudice in favor of a salique law with the thousand go a charming grange in the north country and many fat acre which should of right be transmit to a male carteret if -- futile thought -- dick have only be spare thus reflect the bellboy bring he a card the parson place he glass upon a fine aquiline nose ahem mr -- er -- cartwright the name be not familiar to I but i 'll see the gentleman and so after many year father and son meet as stranger dick fluently explain the nature of he errand mr carteret 's letter have be give to he as the administrator of the late mr tudor crisp 's estate he happen to be in san francisco and see mr carteret 's name in the morning paper have venture to call and you sir say the father softly do you know my son dick admit that he have know himself -- slightly a friend perhaps you be a englishman dick pull he beard ah sigh the father i understand my poor lad be not one i fear whom anyone would hasten to call a friend but if i be not trespassing too much upon you time and kindness tell I what you can of he what good i mean dick keep on pull he beard be there no good say the father very sorrowfully he friend mr crisp write kindly of he he say dick have no enemy but himself dick be sensible that he task be prove harder than he have expect he could not twist he tongue to lie about himself man be strangely inconsistent dick have prepare other lie a sackful of they and he know that a few extra one would make no difference to he and be as balm to the question spirit opposite yet he dare not speak good of the man whom he count rotten to the core the parson sigh and press the matter no further he desire he say to see dick 's grave then he hope to return to england now dick have make he plan in a new country where five year bring amazing change it be easy to play prank even in churchyard in the san lorenzo cemetery be many nameless grave and the sexton chance to be a illiterate foreigner who could neither read nor write so dick identify a forlorn mound as he last resting-place and tell the sexton that a marble cross would be erect there under he -lrb- dick 's -rrb- direction then he tip the man and buy a monument take care to choose one sufficiently time-stained there be score of such in every marble-worker 's yard upon it be cut dick 's initial a date and a appropriate text within three day of the receipt of mr carteret 's letter the cross be stand in the cemetery none know or care whence it come moreover dick have pass unrecognised through the town where he have once ruffle it so gaily as lord carteret he have change greatly as he say and for obvious reason he have never visit the mission town since he bogus death and burial thus it come to pass that dick and he father travel together to san lorenzo and together stand beside the cross in the cemetery presently dick walk away and then the old man kneel down bareheaded and pray fervently for many minute later the father point a tremble finger at the initial why he demand querulously do they not give the lad he full name and to this natural question dick have nothing to say it seem murmur the old man mournfully that mr crisp with all he kindness feel that the name should perish also well amen aman will you give I you arm sir so arm in arm they pass from the pretty garden of sleep dick be really move and the impulse stir within he to make full confession there and then but he strangle it and he jaw grow set and hard as yet he be in ignorance of the change in he father 's fortune mr carteret assume none of the outward sign of prosperity he wear the clothes of a poor parson and he talk flow along the old channel a limpid stream not without sparkle but babble of no pactolian sand and then quite suddenly and simply he say that he have fall heir to a large estate and that he wish to set aside so much money as a memorial of he son to be expend as the experience of the bishop of the diocese might direct you -- you be a rich man falter dick my son sir have he live would have be heir to five thousand a year dick gasp and a lump in he throat stifle speech for a season presently he ask politely the nature of mr carteret 's immediate plan and learn that he be leave san lorenzo for santa barbara on the morrow dick have determine not to let he father stray from he sight till he have see he safe out of the country but he tell himself that he must confer with the ` bishop ' at once the ` bishop ' must act as go-between the ` bishop ' by jove should let the cat out of the bag the ` bishop ' would gladly color the fact and obscure the falsehood so he bid he father good-bye and the old gentleman thank he courteously and wish he well to speak truth mr carteret be not particularly impressed with mr cartwright nor sorry to take leave of he dick soon secure a buggy and drive off _ en route _ he whistle gaily and at interval burst into song he really feel absurdly gay the ` bishop ' however pull a long face when he understand what be demand of he it be too late say he do you funk it ask dick angrily i do reply he reverence well he must be tell the fact before he go south dick little know as he speak so authoritatively that he father be already in possession of these fact within a hour of dick 's departure mr carteret be walk through the old mission church chat with my brother ajax from ajax he learn that at san clemente not twenty mile away be another mission of greater historical interest and in finer preservation than any north of santa barbara ajax add that there be a excellent hotel at san clemente keep by two englishman cartwright and crisp of course the name crisp tickle the parson 's curiosity and he ask if this crisp be any relation to the late tudor crisp who have once live in or near san lorenzo my brother say promptly that these crisp be one and the same and be not to be budge from that assertion by the most violent exclamation on the part of the stranger a synopsis of the rev tudor 's history follow and then the inevitable question : who be cartwright fate ordain that this question be answer by a man who know that cartwright be carteret and so at last the unhappy father realize how diabolically he have be hoax of he suffer it become we not to speak of he just anger something remain to be say he drive up to the san clemente hotel as the sun be set and both dick and the ` bishop ' come forward to welcome he but fall back panic-stricken at sight of he pale face and fiery eye dick slipped aside the ` bishop ' stand still root in despair be you name crisp yes falter the ` bishop ' the rev tudor crisp i -- er -- once hold deacon 's order can i see you alone the ` bishop ' lead the way to he own sanctum a snug retreat handy to the bar and whence a eye could be keep on the bar-tender the ` bishop ' be a large man but he halt feebly in front of the other who dilate in he wrath stride along like a avenging archangel carry he cane as it might be a flaming sword now sir say dick 's father as soon as they be alone what have you to say to I the ` bishop ' tell the story from begin to end not quite truthfully you dare to tell I that you hatch this damnable plot the ` bishop ' lie : yes -- i do and with the money obtain under false pretence you buy a saloon you a deacon of the church of england the ` bishop ' lie : yes -- i do the devil take care of he own say the parson look round and mark the comfort of the room not always say the ` bishop ' thinking of dick well sir continue the parson i be tell that money

' wearily you can shoot if you want to you money can put I into gaol as you say and keep you out of it if -- if you use that pistol mr carteret stare the ` bishop ' be begin to puzzle he he stare still harder and the ` bishop ' blush a awkward habit that he have never rid himself of now a country parson who be also a magistrate become in time a shrewd judge of man will you kindly send for my -- for you partner he say suddenly please sit or stand where you be i think you 'll admit that i have a right to conduct this inquiry in my own way accordingly dick be send for and soon he take he stand beside the ` bishop ' face the flaming blue eye of he father then mr carteret ask he point blank the question he have put to the other and receive the _ same _ answer the ` bishop ' enter a inarticulate demurrer it appear say mr carteret that there be two way of tell this story one of you possibly have tell the truth the other have unquestionably lie i confess he add dryly that my sympathy be with the liar he be the honester man yes say dick i be about as big a blackguard as you 'll find anywhere but i be you son all the same father -- forgive I one must confess that dick play

the scene about they the enchantress spring have touch all thing with she magical finger the time have come when half of the world a bridegroom be and half of the world a bride very soon -- within a month at most -- the creek which run so joyfully to the great ocean yonder would have run altogether out of sight leave a parched and desolate watercourse in its place the grass now a vivid green bespangled with brilliant poppy would fade into premature age and ugliness the tree would have assume the dust - cover livery of summer the bird would be mute sadie shrug protestingly she slender shoulder suppose we talk of something else this lovely day but jeff pay no attention in a crude boyish fashion he have come to a decision shall i tell you a story oh please it happen to a friend of

seem to hang upon jeff 's next word unfortunately she be the daughter of a thief a thief that be not the right word embezzler i reckon would fit better leastwise he would make away with other folk ' money meanin ' to put it back no doubt if he happen to strike the right lead luck be dead against he mind ye he be a good citizen enough as westerner go i do not deny that he would average up as well as most i remember the case well because i read about it in the papers the dry year have bust he and the most of he friend too some o ' these friend he would help he be on they note of hand ye

towards he suddenly he release she o my god he exclaim you be right i feel in all my bone you be dead right i ought to do my duty i be feeling and behave like a madman sadie stare at he in troubled silence she believe that in lose he heart the poor fellow have lose he wit also yet she be sensible that love for she lay at the root of he distress and he pain for he suffering be pitiful to behold puckered she brow twist she lip with a soft cry she touch timidly he shoulder if you think she smile faintly that because we have only known each other a few hour i -- jeff laugh the laugh hurt the

a due sense of he physical and mental qualification he have be appoint boss of the camp by the real owner -- a syndicate of rich man who know that log be worth ten dollar a thousand foot and that the man to make they so be tom barker the syndicate wisely give tom a free hand know that in everything which concern the working of man and machinery to the limit tom would begin at the point where they less elastic conscience might leave off the syndicate therefore remain in victorium or vancouver or san francisco and say of tom that he be a rustler from way back and as lively as they make 'em it will be guess that tom 's principal difficulty be engage man have engage they he be certain to get plenty of work out of they and they could not leave till they have earn sufficient money to take themselves elsewhere all the boy come to tom stoney-broke otherwise they would never have sign on to be treat like a hog to root assiduously for tom or to starve stare several able-bodied man in the face one genial californian remark it be a choice between death and damnation you will now understand why tom smile when denni brown ask for a job he know that denni be a cow-puncher and not a star performer on he own pitch and he have only to look at the man to realize how unfitted he be for the rough work of a logging-camp a derisive chuckle gurgle from he huge hairy throat as he growl out -- say this be not like teachin ' sunday-school i know it be not say denni cheerfully but he heart sink at the mention of the sunday-school long ago he have teach in a Sunday - school it be simply awful

red roof it stand some distance from the collection of shack and cabin at the mouth of the coho river and it overlook some of the most glorious scenery in the world in front stretch the sound a silver sea just dimpled by the soft spring breeze to right and leave and behind lay the forest -- that silent land of the north illimitable as space everlastingly green when the snow have melt shadowy mysterious terrible as denni approach the house he hear a terrific sound -- the crash of a fell and fall tree -- some giant who have hold he own in the struggle for existence when william the norman rule in england and then from all point of the compass the echo in vary cadence repeat that tremendous awe-inspiring sound -- the last sobbing cry of a titan a moment later mamie receive he and usher he into the parlor where a small piano a table of shellwork and crimson plush curtain challenge the interest and curiosity of all who be privileged to behold they let I take yer hat say mamie the hand she hold out tremble slightly dennis perceive that she be thinner and paler yer well fix he murmur a ' happy as a clam i reckon i would oughter be happy say mamie dubiously then she add hastily never

the only woman in the camp i do not mind that say mr barker something in she tone arrest he attention stupid and slow though he be he divine that mamie 's thin white cheek and tremble hand be not

above the chimneypiece hang a enlarged photograph of she husband take a couple of day after he wedding mr barker have face the camera with the same brutal complacency which distinguish all he action he smile grimly thrust forward he heavy lower jaw invite inspection obviously pleased to exhibit himself as a ferocious and untame animal through the sleeve of he ill-cut black coat the muscle of he arm and shoulder show bulgingly the ordinary observer look at the photograph for the first time would be likely to reflect : here be a ruffian who need a lick but he have not get it yet how 's paw say mamie la ' time i see the old man he be paralyse drunk as usual yes he would be that assent mamie indifferently after this conversation languish and very soon the visitor take he leave when mamie hand to he he hat she say awkwardly you never tell I good-bye and to this indictment denni reply laconically holy mackinaw i could not those who know the wilder portion of this planet will understand that all be say between these two weakling who have love each other dearly denni return to the bunk-house mamie run to she bed-room and cry she eye out within a week the camp know two fact concern the newcomer he name be -- denni and he have love tom barker 's dough-faced wife tom 's selection of he first instrument of torture indicated subtlety he buy from a siwash indian the most contemptible-looking cur ever behold at the inlet and he christen the unfortunate beast -- denni there be a resemblance between dog and man each in the struggle for existence have receive more than he due share of kick and the sense of this in any animal manifest itself unmistakably and each moreover exhibit the same amazing optimism which be perhaps a sure sign of a mind not quite balanced dennis the dog follow he new master wherever he go tom would introduce he with the remark he name be dennis _ too _ and if denni the man happen to be present tom would swear at the dog call he every evil name which come to the tip of the foulest tongue in british columbium always at the end of these commination service tom would say to denni the man i a not a-speakin ' to you old sock so keep yer hair on that the cow-puncher -lrb- who in he day must have carry a gun -rrb- do keep on he hair become a topic of talk amongst the boy confirm a conviction that denni have be aptly name certainly he lack backbone and jawbone moreover change of sky bring to he no change of luck within a fortnight he be badly hurt and oblige to remain in bed for nearly a week i get mix up with a log he explain to mamie it bruk loose a ' i do not quite get outer the way see I too whisper mamie same trouble here -- ` zactly twice while he lay upon he back she bring to the bunk-house a chocolate layer cake and some broth upon the occasion of she third visit she come empty-handed with she too pale eye full of tear and she heart full of indignation i be not get nothing she mutter tom say it be he grub that be all right reply denni note that she walk stiffly but look ye here he be not be wallopin ' ye have he yes he have when he be through i tole he i would sooner have he blow than he kiss any day i have not oughter hev come here say denni never see the sun shine till you do murmured mamie at this he try to take she hand but she evade he grasp then with a extraordinary dignity look deep into the man 's eye she say slowly : i tole you that because it be god 's truth and sorter justify you comin ' but i aim ter be a honest woman and you must help I to remain so with that she flit away next day denni go back to work and what work for a man never at best strong and now enfeebled by severe pain and illness some magnificent timber have be find a couple of mile inland situate not too far from the coho the expert have already fell strip and saw into log the huge tree to denni and other remain the arduous labor of guide with the help of windlass these immense log to the river whence they would descend in due time to the inlet there to be join together into vast raft later on again to be tow to they destination of all labor this steering of log through dense forest to they appoint waterway be the hardest and roughest denni of course wear thick glove but in spite of these he hand be mutilate horribly because he lack the experience to handle the log with discretion even the best man be badly knock about at this particular job and the duffer be very likely to be kill outright at the end of ten lamentable day denni come to the conclusion that tom barker want to kill he by the chinese torture of ling or death by a thousand cut more than one of the boy say : why do not you get what dough be comin ' to ye and skip denni shake he head not be able to explain to himself why he stay he hold he tongue and thus gain a reputation for grit which lighten other burden jim doolan the big irishman be of opinion that denni brown be little better than a deny baby with a soft spot in he head but he admit that the cow-puncher be white and obviously bent upon self-destruction by this time the camp know that the boss be take a unholy interest in denni although he continue to treat he with derisive civility the rage he could not suppress be vent upon the dog and denni never see the poor beast kick or beat without reflect : he do that to mamie when nobody be not lookin ' in he feeble fashion he try to interfere dollar to tom barker be dearer than cardinal virtue and he have never be know to refuse a opportunity to make a bit on any deal denni offer to buy the dog what be he worth say tom thrust out he jaw i 'll give five for he five for a dog that i have learn to love not much ten nope fifteen tom laugh you be not get money enough to buy he he say i be go to have more fun than a barrel o ' monkey out o ' this yere dog and do not you forget it after this denni the sunday-school teacher the man whose golden slipper be await he in the sweet by-and-by begin to lie awake at night and wrestle with the problem : be a man ever justified in break the sixth commandment the camp hold that tom bear a charmed life man have try to kill he more than once and have perish ingloriously in the attempt he coolness and courage be indisputable there be moment in a lumberman 's business when nothing will save a almost impossible situation but the instant exercise of the most daring and devil-may-care pluck determination and skill tom be never find want at such moment to see he ride a log be a sight to inspire admiration and respect in a texa broncho - buster to kill such a superb animal might well rack a simple and guileless cowboy whose name be -- denni it be relevant to mention that denni the dog lick the hand that beat he fawn upon the foot that kick he and render unto he lord and master implicit and invariable obedience the siwash he former owner have train he to retrieve and of this tom take shameless advantage he would throw he hat or a glove or a stick into the middle of a rapid and the gallant denni would dash into the swirl water regardless of collide log fanged rock or spiky stump one day the dog get catch tom with a oath leap on to the nearest log from that to another and another till he reach the poor beast whom he release with incredible skill and audacity return as he have come follow by the dog the boy yell they appreciation of this astounding feat jimmy doolan ask -- what in thunder make ye do that tom tom scowl i dunno he answer denni brown know that i think the world of that cur within a fortnight by a admittedly amazing coincidence denni the man be catch in a precisely similar fashion as a river-driver denni be begin to catch on but he have not yet learn what he could or could not do river-driver wear immense boot heavily spike denni upon this occasion have be send with a crew to what be technically call sweep the river after a regular drive such log as have wander ashore or be hang up in back eddy be collect and send on to join the other this be hard work but exciting and not without its humor certain obstinate log have to be coax down the river it would almost seem as if they know the fate that await they in the saw-pits and in every fiber of they be exercise a instinct for self-preservation for instance a log may refuse to pass a certain rock in the river which have offer no obstruction whatever to other log then the lumberman arm with he long pole with its spike to push and its sharp hook to pull must reach that rock and pull and prod the recalcitrant traveller on he appointed way denni in attempt this have slip upon the rock and he heavy boot have be catch and hold between the log and the rock below be a boiling rapid above the river swirl in a heavy oily mass denni to save he life hold tight on to the rock he be in the position of the drunken scot who dare not abandon he grip of the rail of the refreshment bar because if he let go he would fall down and if he do not let go he must miss he train denni hold on with both hand if he endeavor to unfasten he boot he would be sweep into the rapid if he do not let go and none come to he rescue the log would grind he leg to powder tom happen to see he and plunge into the river denni have crawl on to the rock from the other side a feat easily achievable tom might have go round any other man in the camp would have do so the odds be slightly against he reach the rock for the river be run like a mill-race five minute later both man drip wet be safely ashore and the log be career down stream ye have save my life gasp denni never see such a blame fool as you in all my day reply tom as he stare savagely into denni 's mild blue eye you would hurt yerself rockin ' a baby 's cradle you would ` bout time you quit man 's work be not it not yet say denni during these week upon the river denni have not see anything of mamie tom barker as supreme boss visit all crew and then return to he wife with either a leer or a frown upon he face she have come to loathe the leer more than the frown in the different camp the boy tell the same story -- he knock the stuffin ' out of she the stay-at-home briton warm with roast beef and indigestion will wonder that one man amongst a hundred should be suffer to ill-treat a thin dough-faced little woman why do they not arise and slaughter he have tom steal a colt in the cattle-country he would have be lynch let publicist resolve the problem finally one Sunday morning denni and mamie meet again holy mackinaw exclaim denni anything wrong everything i do not understand but of course she do it be god 's truth then what the boy say she hang she head i think he would quit when i go up the river say denni say let 's you a ' I skin out o ' this i 'll get my dough to-night oh dennis she murmur in piteous protestation we have burn in eternal torment we would burn together say denni anyways if this be not torment and if barker be not beelzebub himself i be a liar she shake she head with the tear streaming down she thin white cheek gee say denni reduce to silence i tuk he for better and worse sob mamie you might ha ' guess that it would be worse growl denni then desperately he blurt out because you be dead-set on keepin ' the seventh commandment you be jest naterally drivin ' I to break the sixth what i have say it and he save my life too but when i look at yer i get to think he voice sink to a hoarse whisper i think lot night he come back to ye alone through they tree and there be one place where the pine needle be thick as moss and i mind I what a dago tell I onst he would kill he man he have stab he from behind with a knife he show I : jest a ordinary knife only sharp a ' he tell I how he do it whar to strike -- savvy it go in slick he stop see that mamie be regard he with wide-eyed horror and consternation denni yes my name 's denni right enough that be the trouble i hav 'n' t the nerve to kill barker and you hav 'n' t the nerve to skip off with I be two of a kind mamie scairt to death of what come after death and you know it so long she catch at he arm you be not a-goin ' to leave the inlet it be a mighty big country this denni reply austerely but i have a notion it be not quite big enough for barker a ' I so long i be comin ' up to-morrer denni to see 'em run the last rapid mebbe you be fullish to leave the range he mark the interrogation in she tone and answer for he almost roughly -- mebbe i be but not so fullish as you by a long sight with that he return to the bunk-house \* \* \* \* \* not half a mile from the inlet the coho gather itself together for its last wild rush to salt water and here there be a huge pool where log lie peacefully as alligator in the sun at the end of the pool the river flow gently in a channel free from rock and snag then the channel narrow and a little farther on you behold the head of the rapid and half-way down the coho fall thunder everlastingly when the log reach the fall they be meat for the mill nothing can stop they then one after another they rise on end to take the final plunge some twist and writhe as if in agony as if conscious that the river and forest shall know they no more thousand have travel the self-same way not one have ever return the lower rapid of the coho hardly deserve its name half a mile farther on it be a estuary across which stretch the boom the crew assemble on each side of the pool the log be prick into slow movement this be duffer ' work be assign to the less experience the pick river-driver stand upon the rock of the upper rapid pole in hand and here watch they with a lack-lustre eye stand mamie in the shade of a dogwood tree in full blossom now and again a soft white petal would fall upon the water and be sweep away above the hemlock sough softly at she foot the giant maidenhair raise its delicate frond till they touch she cheek she watch the log go by in a never-ending procession the scene fascinate she although in a sense she be singularly devoid of either imagination or perception movement beguile a woman whose own life have be stagnant for five-and-twenty year deep down in she heart be the unformulated but inevitable conviction that the log be move and that she be stand still tom loom large in the immediate foreground he too move so swiftly that he huge form lack definition she see he snatch a pole from one of the man and stab viciously at a log which refuse to budge and every time that he arm rise and fall a little shudder trickle down she spinal column the log seem to receive the blow apathetically a bad jam be imminent she could hear tom swearing and the other log float on and on seem to hear he also and tremble he bull 's voice rise loud above the roar of the fall mamie look down at she foot crouch denni the dog and he also be tremble at those raucous sound and mamie could feel he thin rib press against she own thin leg at that moment light come to she obscure mind she be like the log she refuse to budge funk the plunge submit to unending blow and word which be almost worse than blow and by she obstinacy and apathy she be drive the best man on god 's earth to premeditated murder that morning let we remember tom have beat the dog and because she have interfere with a pitiful protest she husband have strike she close to the temple ever since this blow she have hear the roar of the fall with increase intensity why do not it move she ask herself as she put the question the log do move bear away by the full current mamie follow by the dog run after it with she eye aflame with excitement denni bark divine something uncanny eager to distract the mind of he mistress from what seem to be engross it still she run on with she eye upon the log the dog know that she must stop in a moment that no one could pass the fall unless they go over they do he divine also that she mean to go over they -- that at last with she poor imperfect vision she have see that way out of captivity she reach the point where farther advance be impossible to she right rise a solid wall of stone opposite rise its twin between the two the river rush tumultuously toss the great log hither and thither as if they be spilikin mamie watch she own log after its goading it keep a truer course than most of its fellow but she have outstrip it stand upon the edge of the precipice feel the cold spray upon she face hear the maddening roar of the monster below less to be fear than that other monster from whom she realize that she have escape she wait for the final plunge what be pass in she mind at this supreme moment we may well believe that she see clearly the past through the mist which obscure the future always she have be a log at the mercy of a drunken father she mother have die in give birth to she but she know vaguely that this mother be a church member she do not know -- and know could never have understand -- that from she she have inherit a conscience -- or shall we call it a ineradicable instinct -- which constrain she to turn aside shudder from certain temptation to obey without reasoning certain ethical law solemnly expound to she by a calvinistic grandmother but nature have be too much for she even as she have turn instinctively and with horror from the breaking of a commandment so also she have select the mate who possess in excess the physical quality so conspicuously lack in she she have fall a victim and a reluctant victim to the law of compensation when tom barker hold up he finger and whistle she crawl to he the log slightly roll as if intoxicate near the brink of the fall and then it stop again where the river be narrowest and the current strongest no log have stop in this place before mamie see that it be catch by a small rock and hold fast by the other log behind it it will not go over she murmur within a minute a terrific jam impend across the river tom be swearing horribly and between husband and wife rise a filmy cloud of spray upon which be imprint the mysterious color of the rainbow which long ago mamie have be teach to regard as the most wonderful symbol in the world -- god 's promise that in the end good should triumph over evil afraid to move fascinate she stand still stare at the rainbow presently tom disappear when he return mamie could see he very plainly he have a stick of dynamite and a fuse mamie see he glance at he watch and measure the fuse then leap from log to log he approach the one in midstream which lay passive block the advance of all the other with splendid skill and daring he adjust the dynamite upon the small rock which hold the log and light the fuse he return as he have come and mamie could hear the cheer of the man upon the opposite bank it 'll hev to go now she reflect at this moment denni the dog must have realize that he master have leave something behind on the rock mamie see he spring from log to log and then hold the dynamite between he tooth with the splutter fuse still attach follow he master tom she scream look out tom turn and see and the other -- dennis brown mamie the river - driver -- saw also and tremble tom begin to curse the dog adjure he to go back to drop it _ drop it _ drop it but the faithful creature who have risk life to retrieve stick throw into fierce rapid run steadily on mamie see the face of she husband crumble into a expression of hideous terror and palsy he lip mouth inarticulately with he huge hand he try to push back the monstrous fate that be overtake he the dog lay the dynamite at he master 's foot at the moment when it explode \* \* \* \* \* and the man whose name be dennis know that he turn have come at last end of the project gutenberg ebook of bunch grass by horace annesley vachell
