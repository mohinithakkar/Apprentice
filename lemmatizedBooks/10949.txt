place xxix and suddenly the last the romance of zion chapel chapter i of a curious meeting of extreme on the dreary suburban edge of a very old very ignorant very sooty hardhearted stony-streeted meanly grim little provincial town there stand a gasometer on one side of this gasometer begin a region of disappointed field which however have hardly begin before a railway embankment cut across at a angle convenient for its entirely obscure the few meadow and tree that in this desolate land do duty for a countryside the dull workman 's street that here abruptly present unfinished end to the universe must console themselves with the gasometer and indeed they seem more than content for a street boast the best view as it run out its sordid line longer than the rest be proudly call gasometer street some of the street that be deny the gasometer cluster narrow and dark hardly build twenty year perhaps yet long since drearily old -- with the unattractive antiquity of old iron and old clothes -- round a mouldy little chapel in what we can only describe as the wesleyan methodist style of architecture case in weather-stained and decaying stucco it bear upon its front the word new zion and the street about it be name accordingly : zion passage zion alley zion walk zion street there be a house too which have be lucky enough to call itself zion view the very morning before the house at the corner have contemplate do the same at zion view live and still live mr moggridge the huge good-natured guffaw pillar of new zion -- on whom at the moment however we will not call a nice dull place you may say from which to issue invitation to a romance well of course it must seem so if pretty place be the reader 's idea of romance curiously enough the preference of the lady romance herself be for just such dull place these dreary soot-begrimed street be the very street she love best to appear in on a sudden some astonished day with a sound of silk skirt and a spring wind of attar of rose contrast surprise -- these be she very soul dull place and bright people -- these she love to bring together and watch for laughter and tear you be never safe from romance and the place to seek she be never the place where she be last find well at all event it be to gasometer street and new zion that you be respectfully invite and before you decline the invitation with a shrug i will tell you this about the gasometer the romantic eye of one of the greatest french poet once look on that gasometer i will not pretend that they dwell there but look on it they once do -- the eye of that great sad scandalous religious french poet -- on a night of weary rain that set someone quote -- also in that street -- il pleure dan mon coeur comme il pleut sur la ville yes and that french poet pass the gasometer on he way to new zion actually romance why i would not exchange gasometer street for the isle of greece chapter ii introduce more unromantic material that french poet only concern we here as so to say the highest light in the contrast which it be the happy business of theophilus londonderry jenny talbot and two or three devoted friend to make in the vicinity of gasometer street and indeed in little coalchester at large theophilus londonderry it be rather a mouthful of a name yet it be so like the long expansive good-natured eloquent fellow it stand for that i must not shorten it though we shall presently abbreviate it for purpose of affectionate reference he himself like theophil for its reminiscence of another french poet though theo be perhaps the more suitable abbreviation for one of he profession really or perhaps rather seemingly theophilus londonderry have two profession -- or say one be a profession and the other be a vocation a call by day he profess to be a clerk in a cotton-office -- and he be no fool at that -lrb- there be no need for a clever man to be a fool at anything -rrb- but by night and occasionally of a afternoon -- when he get leave of absence to solemnise a marriage or run through a funeral -- he be a spiritual pastor the young father of he flock here i must permit myself some necessary remark on the subject of nonconformity its influence on individuality and its direct relationship to romance in the church of england or of rome -- though he sometimes look wistfully towards the latter -- theophilus londonderry with he disability of worldly condition would have find no place to be himself in he be a organism that could not long have breathe in any rigid organization it be the non-establishment the comparative free-field of nonconformity that give he he chance conscious soon after he first few breath of a personal force that claim operation in some human employment some work not make with hand but into which also enter the spirit of man and be quite poor and entirely hopeless of family wealth or influence there be only two field open to he art or nonconformity to art in the usual sense of the word he be not call but to the art of demosthene he be unmistakably call and for this nonconformity -- with a side entrance into politics -- be he opportunity this bourne of he faculty have indeed be predestine for he by no remoter influence than he father himself a lay-preacher when he be not the business manager of a large hardware store -- a lay-preacher with a very gentle face the face of a father a woman a saint and a failure all in one i say failure by no means unkindly londonderry 's father be make to be a good bishop to radiate from a hallowed security sweet light of blessing he talent be gentleness not in itself a fight quality -- a quality that need a place prepare for it need the hand of strength or opportunity to set it upon the hill that he have make himself learn that he sympathy know much of the soul of man that he be conscious of a very near communion with the divine -- be qualification that alone might not avail yet be they not lose for apart from they own restricted exercise in the circle of he own little cause and the other cause for which in the technical phrase he would occasionally supply they have pass into he son and meet in he other more energetic quality such as a magnetic eloquence a love of laughter and a mighty humanity thus theophilus londonderry be partly he father lick into shape and partly something bigger and more effectively vital at sixteen he be learn in all the theology at nineteen he be say to have preach a great sermon at twenty-two he be the success of a big political meeting and at twenty-four he be the new lay-pastor at new zion this be not to be the theological history of a soul so i shall not attempt to decide upon the exact proportion of literal acceptance of christian dogma underlie the young pastor 's sermon i doubt if he could have tell you himself and i be sure he would have consider the point as unimportant as i do he be a message of humanity deliver in term of christianity the message be good the meaning honest he would no doubt have prefer another pulpit with other formula but that pulpit be not forthcoming so like all the strong and the wise he choose the formula offer to he use as few as possible and humanise all he use and never for a single second of time whatever the apparent contradiction on the surface be theophilus londonderry that poorest of all god 's creature -- a hypocrite however you may judge he you must never make that mistake about he chapter iii of eli moggridge and the new spirit new zion despite its name be as i have hint no longer new the fiery zeal which have once make it a living schism have long since die out of it carry year before a little blaze ember of faith from a flourishing hearth of nonconformity some street away it have puff and gleam a little space in the eloquence of the offended zealot who carry it hotfoot that Sunday morning but its central fire have be poor and for a long time no evangelistic bellows have awaken in it even a spark its original elder have long since lose heart and pass away a dwindle remnant of they child from old association just keep its door from actually close and make a mournful interruption in its musty silence on sunday life be too low to support a Wednesday prayer-meeting and Sunday by Sunday that life ebb lower new life from the outside must come and speedily or it must die but new life be already on the way on the town side the sad street round new zion lead one into a more prosperous high street and indeed zion street itself as it turn the corner flame into quite a jovial and ruddy shop -- a provision merchant 's and keep by elus moggridge the name do its owner considerable wrong for its suggestion of puritanical sanctimoniousness be a flat contradiction of the jovial and ruddy personality the huge red-whiskered laugher for whom it stand and of whom the shop with its healthy smell of cheese and its air of exuberant prosperity be a much more truthful expression well the business be grow with such gusto that mr moggridge feel he might afford a home away from he shop and thus he come to take the biggish empty house which presently put on new paint and once more seem quite proud of be zion view till this time mr moggridge have attend elsewhere but he be not so young as he have be and somewhat stouter and the stealthy approach of comfortable habit have suggest to he that he old chapel be rather at a unnecessary distance then too the fact of he house be call after new zion seem to impose a sort of obligation towards the sad old chapel besides mr moggridge be not inhumanly above the pleasure of self-importance and though he do not express it in just those word or indeed in any word at all the idea of he be the maecena of new zion be suddenly bear within he now quick be even the word with mr moggridge as become a successful man of business and for he to conceive a idea be to carry it out as goods be always deliver from mr moggridge 's shop with despatch also in some dim far-off way mr moggridge 's mind have all unconsciously be stir by vibration of what we call the new spirit the new spirit of any age work its way even into its business and though mr moggridge would not have so describe it it be the new spirit that have make the success of he provision shop speaking of the need of new zion mr moggridge call it new blood he mean the new spirit and it be in reply to he advertisement for a new pastor that the new spirit in the person of theophilus londonderry come one Sunday to preach at new zion chapter iv end quite romantically eli moggridge be a judge of man and he like theophilus londonderry at a glance theophilus londonderry be also a judge of man and he like elus moggridge in fact two man that need each other have meet you could not help laugh a little at mr moggridge at first soon you could not help respect he -- theophilus londonderry be almost to know what it be to love he indeed that mr moggridge be just the man he be be a matter of no small importance to the young minister a chief deacon be nothing less than a fate and it be in he power to be no little of a tyrant have mr moggridge 's interest in new zion be of a different character he would inevitably have be as great a hindrance as he be to prove a help fortunately that interest be recreative rather than severely religious it be to be for he a sort of sunday-business to which he be to devote he vast spare energy he want to see it a go concern and hate stagnation in he neighborhood he look about for a specialist whom he could trust to make it move and hum and whizz luckily in so far as he be a amateur theologian he be broad with further mental allowance for expansion what be want at new zion he explain to the young minister at supper after the close of a evening service which have more than keep the promise of the morning be not dogma but common-sense every-day religion a religion to help a man in he business not a sunday-coat religion a cheerful human religion and it happen that something of this very sort be what theophilus londonderry be eagerly prepare to supply the stipend be small a poor sixty pound a year but mr moggridge guarantee to swell it to a hundred if necessary from he own resource and he want it clearly understand that short of course of the broad general principle of christian teaching no restriction be to be place either by he or anyone else on the young man 's expression of the faith that be in he all we want you to do he say in conclusion be to make the place go give it new blood new fire as to how you do it that be you own business -- and i shall no more interfere with you in that than i should expect you to instruct I on the subject of york ham we must all be specialist nowadays -- specialist repeat mr moggridge with a feeling that he too have discover planet so it come to pass that the rev theophilus londonderry pastor presently light up with a sudden vehemence of new gold-leaf the fade dusty name board of the chapel and that he own home be at too great a distance for he ministration he come to lodge with some nice old-fashioned people call talbot at no 3 zion lane i want you to like funny old mr talbot and i want you to love she little daughter jenny so to make it the easier i shall not describe they at too great a length old mr and mr talbot be the sole survivor of the less active founder of new zion meekly not militantly pious stubborn as sheep in a dumb obstinacy of ancient faith but in no sense dialectical and in every sense harmless mr talbot be a work stone-mason and on rare occasion when front parlor people catch glimpse of he he be observe to be sit in the kitchen in some uncomfortable attitude of unoccupation like white-haired saturn quiet as a stone it be not record that he ever think on any subject and it be certain that he seldom speak he would flee from a stranger as from a lion and when confront by such from the wild of the front parlor he would bob he old head pathetically and make no attempt at speech beyond a muffle good-even it disconcert he to be expect to speak and he tongue slumber in he mouth -- for he be a old weary man and perhaps very wise old mr talbot whose wifehood have long since be submerge in a immeasurable motherhood and the best of cook would do the little think the house require take charge of the old man 's earnings pay the rent and the burial club and scheme little savings against jenny 's marriage -- which she keep not in a old stock but in a precious teapot of some old-fashioned ware repute valuable and itself carefully wrap up in a yellow handkerchief of cashmere the old lady have a heart of fun in she and even she notion of romance and she withered old apple of a face with its quaint ringleted hair have once be bonny and red you might be sure but she be half blind now and a good deal deaf and she sweet old mouth be hard to get at when she kiss you as she have a motherly way of insist if she like you she too be very old and she i know be very wise jenny -- well there be really not much to describe about jenny beyond that she be sweetly little have a win old-fashioned air about she be very good that be very kind and be adore by the school-child whom she teach first for love and then for dress and pocket-money she be but nineteen and all unminted woman as yet no lover have yet come to stamp she feature with he masterful superscription be she pretty heroine ought to be either very pretty or very plain well the beauty that be go to be be as yet only begin at the eye they be already beautiful no she be not pretty yet but she be not plain jenny 's face sleep as yet when the fairy prince come and kiss it there be no tell to what beauty it would awake the fairy prince that be go to be we friend theophil of course well of course though it be a little early on to admit it however i be unequal to the task of conceal from the hawk-eyed reader through a succession of chapter that jenny and theophil be to be each other 's fate of course he have not be there a month before jenny 's face be begin to wear that superscription of he passionate intelligence to grow merry from he laughter and still sweeter by he kiss of course theophil and jenny fall in love do you think it be merely to save new zion and to bring the renaissance to coalchester that theophilus londonderry be send to live in zion place -- or for any other purpose less important than to love jenny yes we may as well take that for grant as we begin the next chapter chapter v of the artist in man and he material there be only one way to give life to the dead or the moribund the way of the hebrew prophet -- to give it one 's own theophilus londonderry instinctively know this and he begin at once to breathe mightily upon new zion the goldsmith blow merrily all day through he little blowpipe but it be gold he be work on the poet breathe upon the dictionary and lo it flush and break into flower but then he be breathe on word the material of such artist be a joy in itself they be worker in the precious metal theophilus londonderry have very different material to mould -- a old chapel and some very dull humanity humanity be not a precious metal but if you know how to use it it be excellent clay -- a clay not without streak of gold what be theophilus londonderry 's purpose with he material he will towards the uncreated world over which he young vitalise spirit be move to save it yes incidentally but primarily to express himself by means of it to set it vibrate to the rhythm of he nature to set it dance to a tune of he piping already he be be stamp in gold on jenny 's face the coarser face of the world be to wear he smile too for the pebble have only be throw in at new zion who know to what coast of fame the imperious ripple of he personality would circle on before they touch the shore of death we may be polite as we please to humanity in the mass and humanity in occasional rarely encounter individual be -- well divine and to such we gladly and humbly and rapturously pay divine honor but in any give thousand human being poor or rich what would be you calculation for the average of such divine -- how many face would you fall down and worship how many hand would you care to take how many heart would you dare to trust alas the rather good eye must go so often with the disastrous chin the mouth succeed where the nose fail the expansive impulse be check by the narrow habit the little gleam of gold be lose in the clay preponderant charm do not crowd into chapel or anywhere else to be mint it be busy on some vantage height of its own impress its own image and it be with mind maim by the cruel machinery of life nature stunt and starve by adverse and innutritive condition that the artist in man must be satisfy with what pathetic little flash of faculty what fleeting and illusory glimpse of insight what waif and stray of attractiveness must he work and be happy and with what a thankfulness that the tenth rate be not twentieth or thirtieth then too how often must the intractible material be impressed again and again and again before it begin to wear the first trace of you image once a poet have impress himself with mastery upon word the impression remain for ever the word do not disperse in idle crowd when he have do speak to they never again to reassemble in a like combination whereas the greatest oratorical mover of man be doom even after he most electrical self-impression to see he image as soon as take fade away with a shuffle of escape foot and a scramble for hat and cloak it be a masterpiece but with the last touch see the color be fly in a hundred direction and the very canvas itself be off in a thousand thread of hurry disintegration but all this of course have to do entirely with the poetry of the ministerial life prosaic even as preaching and pray to the new zioner may sound there be yet a drearier prose for these artistic material have not only to be preach and pray to -- they have to be in a measure live with listen to personally study and individually consider each be a atom to be set in vibration and each need to be set or keep go in he own way all this prose have to be make help in the poetry how skilful you have to be to rouse the interest you need and escape the many interest you do not need to awaken the single gift without bring upon you all the rest to suffer the fool wisely -- that be to the extent of he tiny wisdom and no more to encourage say miss annie smith in she district-visiting -- what a talent she have for that -- but firmly to forget she at concert to welcome mr jone 's service at collection but gently to discourage he at prayer meeting in short to meet all at the point where they nature be really and usefully alive but at no other point of they circumference however nature have make this as easy as breathe to the reverend theophilus for apart from he humor and good nature he be a lover of character for its own sake and to the student of character there be no such person as a bear brother saunderson be no doubt as wearisome a old man as the world hold but he manner of neigh to the lord in prayer be worth it all and it be rather a pity if the reader imagine that to laugh at he neigh be to forget respect for he venerable faith thus mightily gently cunningly coaxingly theophilus londonderry breathe upon new zion and elus moggridge be a noble second accord to he word at every service of every kind and at all time he be there swell out from a pewful of ruddy daughter and endlessly beam round at he fellow-worshipper as much as to say do not i say he be the man for new zion the old channel be begin to fill with the new spirit the old disused machinery be once more in motion in two month ' time every possible form of meeting be in a healthy condition of attendance prayer-meeting church-meeting mother ' meeting bible class dorca society band of hope sunday-school all briskly in motion and the lady lead by jenny be all as busy as bee over a bazaar new zion have indeed become a veritable merry-go-round of religious and social activity yes it be begin to move indeed it be almost begin to hum -- another few month and it would fairly whizz as elus moggridge have foresee and the sound of the hum and the speed of the whiz would grow louder and louder and faster and faster till not merely zion place and zion alley and zion passage and zion street hear it and be catch up in the infectious dance but the very high street itself should hum and whizz the high street what be high street to the soul of theophilus londonderry what be coalchester itself -- though that shall soon be hum and whiz too this be but the whirling center of the ever-spreading wheel of force that have begin to turn at new zion coalchester will spin soon and then the disappointed field around it then the neighbouring town would join the reel and so on and on faster and faster madder and madder till even london itself move and the world that change its axis at the will of any strong spirit will whirl its immeasurable velocity around the vortex pulpit of theophilus londonderry yes the pebble have only be throw in at new zion chapter vi of a wonderful quality in woman darwin expend many year of he life in the study of disagreeable animal that he might prove the adaptability of organism to environment how much pleasanter and briefer have be he task if he have begin he study at once with the creature whose long history have be one unbroken succession of inspired and noble adaptation woman 's adaptability to man be one of the most mysterious as it be perhaps the most pathetic of all the mode of she mysterious be like certain protection-seeking animal she be always the color of the rock the husband-rock in whose shadow she live sometimes of course she be she own rock but in such case man be never she chameleon to a like degree or indeed in a like manner such adaptability be not one of the form of he greatness and even when he achieve it it be not become to he for woman 's adaptability be not the domination of a weaker nature by a stronger it be in itself a noble and world-necessary form of strength strength be need as well for the take as the making of a impression -- something more than mere ductility weakness may never bear the stamp of power -- it break in the moulding and it be rather because woman be so strong that she be able to take the caesarean stamp of any form of power nor care she by whose hand she be moulded whose image she wear be it warrior poet or priest so long as she feel the veritable grasp and impress of power some woman be already make in the image of the man they be to love before they meet he very wonderful very terrible then be the meeting and it be a meeting that usually come too late but oftener god give a man a little measure of porcelain and a handful of star and leave he to make the woman he need for himself and very wonderful too be that make -- though the man will always have be the father before he be the lover why one may ponder should a man who be great enough to mould a woman to help he be great not be great enough to do without she at all let lover of the unfathomable ask at the same time : why be man man and woman woman and what be both this gentle doll with the sweet breath which he nip up in he arm and kiss and give a tongue that she may talk back to he he own word endow with brain that she may think he thought -- a quaint little helpless lovely parody of he wisdom and power a toy yes a refreshment yes a place of peace yes -- but how much more yes more by all that we do not understand when we say woman why a great man should need not a great woman but a little woman a very little woman -- how be it to be explain unless it be that woman however little be mysteriously great just because she be a woman a little woman unknown property be wrap up somewhere in that porcelain to press it with the lip be to feel strange virtue come into one -- the devil be in those star great man be only nourish on the element woman be a element all the element in one -- earth air fire and water meet together in a rose she be a spring among the rock and she come up dimple from the root of the world she be just as simple and just as strange o little shine spring of woman that be call jenny a great man must draw up through you the unfathomed deep strength of the old world he bend above you and drink and as he drink he face be mirror in yours jenny i do not think i would read ` miss -- ' if i be you would say the great man no dear so jenny be presently read ruskin instead and wonder how she could ever have read miss -- and deep in she dear heart she be say of course not great man 's wife never read ` miss -- ' and yet have the great man say read gaboriau instead -- as a certain very great man do -- jenny 's heart would have say of course great man 's wife always read gaboriau no great man 's wife read sesame and lily and sartor resartus and marius the epicurean and richard feverel and virginibus puerisque -- they even try to read newman 's apologium such be the book on the sunnier side of theophilus londonderry 's little library in no 3 zion place in dark corner behind easy-chair be the deep-sea pool of theology -- pool which have long since give up all the fish they have in they for they owner -- slab of antique divinity such as you would find likewise in the equally cherish library of londonderry senior such be the father that slumber on in a well-earned repose and which far from desire new reader be so old that they be glad to rest undisturbed -- be far too self-important to confuse a considerate regard for they repose with neglect and many of they be really quite valuable as decoration because of they fine old coat of gilded leather and such be range in the more penetrable shadow or even in the lamp-light theophilus would point to they as to a portrait-gallery of dead ancestor one might admire the quaint and distinguished cut of they clothes without dream of wear the same -- and indeed old divinity he use to say be poor food for young divine he divinity indeed be feed on the technical side it be to be fear by the more destructive biblical criticism like most destructive engine come all the way from germany and at its more vital centre by importation of strong meat from russium and scandinavium tolstous and ibsen be he archprophet there be likewise a great pari moralist call zolum and a strange old american father call walt whitman and beauty that can never be far away from strength find many new and wonderful prophet in that little library -- poet and painter and musician of whom hardly anyone else in coalchester have yet hear and certainly no one above the age of twenty-five surely youth be in nothing more marvellous than in its mysterious power of attract to itself into the most out-of-the-way place the sustenance and companionship it need in the unlikeliest wilderness inspire youth be never without the mysteriously-brought food and the company of angel power of the air will sweep across continent to rescue it from prison soft gale travel from south to north to sow seed of beauty in its narrow way and little song will flutter like butterfly for hundred of mile to cheer its heart the time-spirit have give its angel charge concern these young people and remote as they be from all the fiery centre of thought and the dream school of art zion place no less than the rue de rivoli take its thought of the newest and its beauty of the best chapter vii the literary and philosophical society of coalchester i have say that coalchester be a very ignorant old town i do not mean to imply that there be no ma 's there in fact there be quite a number you may be sure that if spiritual and intellectual life have its representative as we have see spiritual and intellectual death have its representative too -- by which i do not mean either to imply that the ma 's be dead ma 's dead and bury with latin over they in the old brassed and effigied church which be so old and large that it be hardly less conceited than a cathedral spiritual and intellectual death in coalchester as elsewhere be officially represent by the literary and philosophical society which still unblushingly go on retain its adjective even in the face of its transaction which seem mainly compose of treasurer 's report with a occasional paper on fossil indeed the one spark of life in the pathetic old society be its real interest in the antediluvian and prehistoric for the life that be dead it have a perfect passion and it sometimes hold conversazione to gaze at it through microscope occasionally it would waken up to literature with a paper on akenside in everything that do not in the least matter some of these mild old gentleman be genuinely learn not that they have not read the great poet even in the original greek latin and italian poet in dead and foreign language be a form of fossil and english poet -- with that divine bloom upon they -- they have a way of fossilising by spectacles so that they never read they alive thus they have never read shakespeare even in the original once long ago in coalchester a hundred year ago there have be a little circle of elegant literati connoisseur of literature and art -- man so far as man of that age might be genuinely if timidly and old-maidishly affectionate towards belles-lettres man who have get so far as to appreciate the freshness of a elizabethan song minor bishop percy and such lavender be the true love of anything that they memory still hang about the wall of the old lyceum along with they portrait while so necessary be great name for little town to boast of that the compiler of the local gazetteer imply that coalchester glow at night with quite a lustre from they name besides they prove very useful in damp young man and yet you would not know they name if i be to write they -- as i would rather like to do the learn dr sibley he write a pleasant little essay on taste you know with a few additional note on chiaroscuro and then there be the learn dr ambrose who write quite a pretty little treatise on song-writing no of course you will not know any of they yet they be all once and be still the learn you 'll never hear theophilus londonderry speak of as that i be afraid as it be the property of fame to grow with time and the way of a great name to begin with brain and end with lord a great man 's descendant be not unnaturally find person of much greater consequence than the original great one in like manner the dignity and importance of the member of the literary and philosophical society have grow in direct ratio to they distance from the original founder of it and the learn doctor sibley and ambrose who really do know something about art and poetry and certainly love they can never have be person of such consequence as one or two of they descendant who be nameless and who certainly know nothing about either one of the real object of this sad little society be passionately to ignore what they contemptuously call local talent it be true that there be not much to ignore and after all it have now to be record to they credit that they do unreservedly give theophilus londonderry he chance by what quaintness of accident he could not imagine he suddenly find himself invite to lecture before they the invitation read something like a command and there seem to be a implication that if all be satisfactory he might thus earn the right of acknowledge the patronage of the literary and philosophical society of coalchester theophilus londonderry 's subject therefore be walt whitman -- a name which convey no offence to the committee for the simple reason that it convey nothing it be a strange and humorous thing for the young man to think of that he be to be the first human voice that have speak that name of the future aloud in coalchester as he rise to give he paper he pronounce its title slowly with he full carry voice and allow the strange new name to roll away in menacing echo through the old lyceum : w-a-l-t w-h-i-t-m-a-n even yet no one see the come doom hear not the voice that toll a funeral bell through all lyceum and other haunted house of dead learn the canon in the chair smile benignantly with a expression that i can only compare to buttered roll he be just three hundred year old that very day and the audience -lrb- a scanty fifty or so -rrb- run from a hundred and fifty upward the only young man present besides the lecturer be two friend of he i have yet to introduce -- rob clitheroe a fiery young poet and pamphleteer of many ambition and jame whalley -lrb- little jame whalley he be always call -rrb- a gentle lover of letter with perhaps the most delicate taste in the whole little coterie _ and _ mr moggridge -- not entirely comfortable it have be by some mysterious atmospheric effect convey to he that he be a tradesman and a dissenter in which latter capacity he feel a certain traditional resentment towards he complacent fellow listener a quite recent ancestor have refuse to pay tithe that ancestor be in he blood to-night jenny be not there lady be not admit to the meeting of the society there be a sort of implication that masonry of learn occult science of the brain be practice at they meeting -- matter which never come out in the transaction the lecture be a straightforward and eloquent account of whitman 's writings and doctrine with extract from the leaf of grass and from begin to end you might have hear a pin drop particularly during one or two of the quotation when it be end the buttered-roll expression have fade from the canon 's face and he we young friend expression be ready for the chairman 's remark londonderry 's sit down awaken a few sad echo that be no doubt hand-clapping but seem like the napping of the wing of night-birds frighten by a light but the lit-and-phil be not frighten they be entirely bewilder and rather indignant that be all it be characteristic of they incapacity to grasp the humanity of any subject even when it be dangerous that the criticism which follow be direct almost entirely against whitman 's metrical vagary this be not poetry have not they revere founder the learn dr ambrose the canon kindly say show he pastoral interest in the local newspaper that the verse which they young friend mr rob clitheroe who be present with they that evening occasionally contribute to the coalchester argus be in he opinion better poetry than anything walt whitman have write though he confess that he acquaintance with walt whitman be of the slightest this disastrous compliment send the blood to young clitheroe 's cheek and he feel surer than ever that he would never be a real poet -- though as a matter of fact he have write some quite pretty line it be a occasion that of course only the lit-and-phil could take seriously and the way home to new zion be a laughter of four beneath the star -- mr moggridge 's deep guffaw come every now and again like the bay of some distant watch-dog at the young minister 's brilliant mimicry of the ancient man they have leave behind then the gentle voice of little jame whalley take advantage of a silence : be not it high time that we bring the renaissance to coalchester capital cry londonderry come in for a bit of supper all of you and let we talk over the plan of campaign chapter viii the plot against coalchester old mr talbot have be prepare for some such invasion and have a excellent rabbit-pie await they there be a delightful trait of old mr talbot 's which i would like to record a curious chronological method of remember great occasion and startling event by the food of the day thus for example when with eye that would still fill with tear though it be ten year ago she would tell the story of how she only boy have be bring home dead one night from a accident at he workshop she would fix the date by say it be about six o'clock at night and i would just get a nice little bit of liver and bacon cooking for you father 's dinner when there come a knock at the door sometimes it be i would just send liz out for a little bit of fish or it would be spanish onion maybe or a lovely little rabbit that mark the day the night when the attack on coalchester be plan be mark as i have say by rabbit-pie mr talbot would hardly have understand the significance of that rabbit-pie though in the course of she occasional bobbing in and out of the room to see that the young man be do justice to she food -- she have a curious notion that young man never eat enough -- she would hear snatch of what she call deep talk or shake she old head at she coming son-in-law whom she already adore and mother with a law what a boy it be she be not quite sure sometimes as to the soundness of he doctrine but wisely decide that she business be rather with he stomach than he brain -- which no doubt god almighty would look after for himself wit at the expense of coalchester can only be of interest to coalchester wit and they butt so i shall not record the bright and animated talk which help to digest mr talbot 's rabbit-pie but confine myself to a practical outcome of it what interest I specially about these young man be they rare practicality they be no mere dreamer helpless visionary with idea they have no notion how to embody dreamer of course they be -- otherwise there have be no point in they be practical -- but they be dreamer who understand something of how dream be best get on to the market of reality characteristically it be the poet of the party from whom the most practical suggestion come in itself of course there be no great originality in the idea of a weekly paper to be call the dawn devote to the dissemination of the new light on every possible subject -- politics and municipal misgovernment the new social ideal the newest and most delicate form of art music and literature it be in the suggest method of publication and circulation that the originality lay the paper be to be give away and make to pay its expense by tradesman 's advertisement a guarantee of a certain minimum distribution be give this method have of course be try before for purpose of mere publicity but never i think for the dissemination of truth and beauty the truth about life be to be pay for by lie about bacon and butter -- or let we say business exaggeration render innocuous by custom and therefore as harmless as truth obviously mr moggridge who not unnaturally have feel a sense of move about in world not realize during much of the deep talk be here a authority of importance and the idea at once appeal to he he would promise a permanent advertisement and he even promise illustration in the form of block already engrave and occasionally use by the argus of the flourish shop at 33 34 35 high street and 58 59 zion street he have also some block of gigantic ham most hammily picture which might also be of use and he would also be able to bring in a number of he fellow tradesman invaluable mr moggridge what be truth without you the poet on he part guarantee to supply all the poetry that might be require and indeed agree to do special rhyming advertisement at say half a guinea apiece he would also assist londonderry in the political and municipal department not only in the higher flight but lend a hand even in castigation of local job abuse and absurdity gentle jame whalley would write round-about essay for which he have a charming gift and generally take in charge the aesthetic interest of the paper though as all be lover of art and literature those subject would be handle now by one and now by another even jenny be to have she place on the staff and write dress article which would not only tend to improve the aspect of coalchester street but attract millinery advertisement she already announce the title of she first article which be very grand : dress as a form of self-expression it be two in the morning before the proceedings terminate and even then good old mr talbot be still up to press steam bumper of very hot whisky and water upon the wayfarer to keep the cold out she explain -- though i need hardly say that the project have not wait till that hour to be suitably recommend to the god of all enterprise chapter ix the dawn next to the delight of hold new and unpopular opinion be the delight of have a medium for they unedited expression though this be a delight give to few reformer the dawn however be to be such a medium and when the first number appear as it do nearly a month from the meeting record in the last chapter four people nay five -- for we must not forget mr moggridge -- be supremely happy with the exception of the poet who as we have see occasionally irradiate the poet 's corner of the argus and mr moggridge it be a first appearance in print for three out of the five contributor and though each talk most of the article by the other they be secretly longing to get away with the little paper to some corner where they could gloat over they own special contribution not that they have any ridiculous idea of the literary importance of the article in question but because it seem so strange to see the warm word of they mouth thus condensed into cold print so strange to think that people all over coalchester be read they little jenny in particular feel quite a cold but pleasant shiver of notoriety as she think of it while to she lover the delighted perusal and reperusal of a large-type leading article head in darkest coalchester bring a new sense of power the poet as be only to be expect have he little grievance with the printer who in spite of all he remonstrance and correction in proof -- the printer be a little wrong-headed scotchman -- have insist at the last moment in head he tyrtean proem a fine aerial trumpet-blast somewhat shelleyan in style with the word that be evidently intend namely poem however he be somewhat console by read he caustic column of note head the world outside coalchester the very head of which be a revelation then too he very much enjoy he article on bad lighting in coalchester with its evident allegoric insinuation that coalchester need lighting in more way than one and that the dawn be prepare to undertake free of charge the top-lighting of which it be most in need jame whalley contribute a review of mr swinburne 's new poem through which article mr moggridge 's illustrated ham plainly show from the other side new truth be too often print in very worn-out type but the promoter of the dawn have wisely remembered how hard truth be to read and have give it good clear type and generally make it a very comely and attractive little paper it bear a motto that sound almost like a threat we come to stay -- a boast which it manfully keep for several year as i lift my eye from this paper they rest on no less than ten great half-yearly volume which flash the dawn -- the dawn -- along a darksome folio shelf as they have flash it week after week across darkest coalchester and the dawn cease at length not from lack of power and encouragement to continue but because the world have grow sadder by then and it have lose the will to go on living in spite of this hardy existence i suppose the dawn will win no record of itself in the history of the press though merely as spirited journalism it deserve to do so while in the history of the human spirit at coalchester it demand a grateful celebration such as it will again most surely not receive from the literary and philosophical historian of the town at all event honor or forget as it may be should you ever come across its strange young page i know you will agree with I that it be a wonderful little paper it be not you may suspect conservative be as it be very alive and very young in fact its radiant radicalism bring tear to one 's eye to-day when so many of the noble ideal it champion to the length and strength of its little angry arm be lie smash beneath the iron blow of the capitalism that have outlive even the noble eloquence of theophilus londonderry like all young people it be all for the young the new and i think you will be astonish if you do ever turn over its page at the remarkable instinct for the crescent life possess by these young man and be it worth while i could easily prove that several of the more exquisite continental writer now the fashion this many a year first find a humble welcome in that quaint little organ of new zion yes it be a triumph for new zion too this modest and hitherto obscure corner of the town suddenly find itself comparatively in a blaze of publicity for a column head work at new zion evidently mean to be weekly leave no doubt from what quarter of the town the dawn be to be look for this be perhaps the most delightful thing about the paper -- its calm assumption that the real aristocracy of the town be to be find in that little back street and that if coalchester be to have any spiritual or intellectual life it must seek it there in zion street and nowhere else in coalchester be the angel descend into the water and the best part of the joke be that the assumption be literally true chapter x how they bring the good news of a morri wall-paper to coalchester coalchester be too much take by surprise by the dawn to pretend to ignore it and its first recognition be appropriately make in a ludicrously abusive article in the argus -- the one-eyed argus as it be mockingly nickname in the next week 's issue of the new paper the joke be one that be lose on coalchester which have never dream of expect a hundred eye in its argus which to it be but the usual name for a sleep newspaper it be however to do they justice see and chuckle over by one or two member of the literary and philosophical society the young beggar know they -- classical dictionary at all event say one of they maliciously which be quite bright for a lit-and-phil one tangible result of the little paper be the almost immediate doubling of the attendance at new zion curiosity have be arouse in this militant young minister with the strange idea and theophilus londonderry wish for nothing better than to gratify it in the oxygen of success even the dullest metal will scintillate and it need but such small beginning of he future to make theophilus as nearly irresistible as natural gift and success together can make a man some people go to chapel to worship a few to learn but most odd as it may sound to be entertain a vivid and magnetic preacher be as near as many will allow themselves to approach the theater theophilus be a bear actor -- of himself a part so few can or dare play he give you good stimulating truth but it be not so much in the newness of the idea which he pass on from he book to he hearer as in the newness of himself that of course the charm lay a few people not many or important dislike he but all have to listen and a good many come to new zion again above all the woman hear he gladly and to this sure sign of a future theophilus be far from blind he have woman at he back he can not fail be a phrase he sometimes recall out of he favorite _ brand _ yes and have he not one little angel-woman at he side it have be the spring of 1886 when he come to new zion it be now the autumn and early in September announcement have be make of a series of autumnal lecture to be give by the rev theophilus londonderry rob clitheroe esquire jame whalley esquire and other distinguished lecturer at new zion in the list be papers on the duty of novel reading henrik ibsen a morri wall-paper the nude in art and the darwinian theory by mr londonderry himself coalchester its past and its future by mr rob clitheroe together with ireland 's sacred right to home rule by the same lecturer wagner and the new music by mr jame whalley with a paper on some really new book by the same and a paper-on good taste in dress by miss jenny talbot -- the virago the battery be to be turn on poor coalchester with a vengeance for some time past there have be uneasy suspicion in the town that strange and somewhat ungodly form of new learning and beauty be be store as in a arsenal in that little house at 3 zion place a large cast of the venus of milo it be know have come from covent garden london _ via _ a poor little dealer in artistic material in the town who on one occasion have show a bewildering picture to one of he customer with the remark what do you make of this mr littlejohn mr littlejohn could make nothing of it nor indeed could the artist ' colourman who have be use to picture all he life no wonder for it be the first rossettus that have ever be see in coalchester and it be the same at the little paperhanger 's shop where theophilus have order some piece of morri wall-paper for he room law what a taste to be sure have exclaim the paperhanger 's wife as they open the parcel how any one dare live with such pattern be beyond I the paperhanger 's wife verb better than she know few be those indeed who dare live with beauty when the paper be hang in theophil 's room so great be the sensation in the household that even old mr talbot venture to look in at it keep very close to he wife it be so the old man have stand open-mouthed before the first steam-engine and here again be the devil plainly at work lord a-mercy jane he say to he wife what be the world come to the world be indeed change beneath the old man 's foot and the heaven open as never before in he time -- with he might be right some assistance from beneath and -- it be undoubtedly safer in the kitchen mr talbot in these matter live and love by faith in she boy as she call he but even she have she doubt which she express in a way that show funny old woman as she be that she be not without a sort of blind insight i suppose it be all right boy she say and it sound silly to say about a lot of harmless line and flower but it seem to you old mother that there be something wrong about that paper -- something almost wicked in it it remind I of that nasty music you and jenny be so fond of play here theophil envelop she in a huge hug and laughingly mock she with playful caress smile to himself all the same for the music she have refer to be dvorak chapter xi a little about jenny meanwhile as new zion move and hum and whiz and as the dawn go on dawn week by week -- you could not expect the dawn oftener than once a week in coalchester -- the love of jenny and theophil grow more and more perfect there be a long while to wait yet before jenny be to bear what seem to she the finest of all name for old mr talbot easily manageable as a rule have a way of quietly put she foot down on occasion that would have surprise you jenny be only just pass nineteen and be no fit wife for any man yet least of all for a great sprawling fellow like that let she get a little more flesh on she bone something more than all spirit and nerve let she get well turn twenty and it might be think of but not now no it be no use come with you nonsense you silly big fellow you know when the soft old mother say a thing she mean it so it prove old mr talbot on this point remain a homely form of adamant however the lover be not badly off live in the same house they see almost as much of each other as if they have be marry and from the evening she spend there jenny have come to regard theophil 's room and he book as hers too she have develop wonderfully in these month have jenny she be a real little great man 's wife now and as theophil look at she with she light eager face she whole soul so alive to help he in however humble a way she whole life he he he -- such love seem almost tragic in its very beauty and joy it be so irremediably -- love at time he almost tremble before it he would almost chide she with its divine completeness what if he be to be take from she ought not she to keep just a little of herself for foothold we ought all to belong to ourselves as well as to another it be such a risk suppose he be to die jenny no doubt it be very wise but jenny be wiser she could never belong to herself again she be he and he only for ever and if he die -- if he be to be take away but he could never be take from she any other way no one else nothing but death could take he no nothing but death -- and perhaps not even death you be sure darling o you be quite quite sure sure from my soul little child look in it and see a lover 's eye be he soul yes theophil loved jenny love she even more with she own dependence on love than he know of he be the reader need scarcely be tell a almost wildly ambitious man and a few month ago he would have say that there be nothing which be more to he than the expression of the power that be in he but there be something that be even more to he now and if it could be imagine that he might some day be ask to choose between he ambition and jenny he could honestly have answer from he soul give I jenny whoever think this a easily natural answer to make may know something about love but evidently know little about ambition still life seldom set we such silly examination question as that and need one say that that question be never put to jenny 's lover he be far too proud of the woman he have make of that little measure of porcelain and that handful of star chapter xii how the renaissance come in person to new zion the winter month have go by all but one of those incendiary lecture have be give not without storm and tempest the dawn still come up each week with anger and singing and the first year of londonderry 's ministry at new zion near its close the lecture season be presently to end on the last Friday in march with a concert which be to include a series of recitation by a lady-reciter from london londonderry have write to a lecture agency for the name of a likely reciter man or woman and they have send he the name of isabel strange on the occasion of the last lecture mr moggridge have not be satisfy with the color of the platform it want repaint and i think it very likely that it be a strain of that boyishness which i hope survive in we all and one of whose quaint fancy be a envy of house-painter so happy all day with paint-pot and brush and great smooth board to dab and smooth that decide he to do the job himself mr moggridge have this great element of refinement that he think nothing honest beneath he it be the Friday of the entertainment about one o'clock and though mr moggridge have practically finish the work the day before he have slip in during he lunch-hour to give it a final touch or two he have bring he lunch in the form of a pork-pie and while with one hand he plunge the pie occasionally among he red whisker with the other he would lean forward and touch up a knot or a nail-hole that need a little more paint and he be proud as a boy of the simple bit of slap-dashing and entirely absorb in it and the pork-pie presently he become aware that he be not alone someone have enter the schoolroom at the far end he turn round with the paint-brush in one hand and the pork-pie in the other and become abashed for a beautiful lady have enter the room and be evidently about to make a enquiry the surreptitiousness that seem to inhere in pork-pie prompt mr moggridge to slip the pie into he trousers ' pocket -- for he coat be off and a white apron have take its place just do a little bit of amateur painting he explain rather awkwardly advance to the lady so i see say the lady with a pleasant smile this i believe be zion chapel -- and i suppose this be the room where i be to recite my name be isabel strange and i have come a little earlier i daresay than you expect but i always like to see the room i be to recite in -- just to try my voice in and run over my piece certainly of course say mr moggridge but you have come all the way from london and so early you will have some refreshment first and if you 'll honor mr moggridge and I -- i may as well explain that i be the chief deacon say mr moggridge dexterously slip off he painter 's apron and get into he coat so with a wistful glance at he work of art mr moggridge carry off the beautiful london lady to zion view but be isabel strange beautiful it be a new sort of beauty if she be -- or perhaps a very old sort yet beautiful be the first word that have spring into mr moggridge 's mind as she have surprise he in the schoolroom perhaps wonderful be the exacter word wonderful in a way that include beauty -- wonderful and with a strange air about she that suggest exceptional refinement exquisite sensitiveness to refine thing beautiful o dear no say mr moggridge to whom feminine beauty do not appeal as the young lady freshen herself up after she travel in mr moggridge 's best bedroom why she have not a regular feature in she face mr moggridge herself have neat little pretty feature set in fat look at that long upper lip and she nose mr moggridge omit mention of eye singularly powerful and very true and sweet as also of a long lithe mouth that remind you of a beautiful serpent a serpent which the true eye plainly say would do you no harm presently however mrs moggridge have to admit that she be very attractive she know she mean fascinating but she would not admit that to mr moggridge who have drop the subject though a mind which again have assert its dim preference for new fashion be perhaps grope after expression of some such perplexity as this : why if a face have the same effect upon you as beauty may it not be describe as beautiful if mr moggridge really get so far even as cloudily to ponder that it be evident that he be not far from the kingdom of beauty it be of course true enough that some face be spoil by flaw such as every mr moggridge can point out -- face that begin in one style and end in another half greek perhaps and half gothic yet even such face if they individuality be strong enough have they own rococo charm for all but supremely great face of which perhaps the world have not see half-a-dozen absolute regularity so-called correctness of feature be a calamity and regular beauty on the ordinary human level be only another form of mediocrity wonderful english girl face after face indistinguishable from each other as rose after rise how sweet you be how fragrant what a bloom it be a wonderful rose-girl-farm from which you come how pretty you look lace up one after another on you standard and how skilfully you be guard against any form of variation perhaps no woman pottery in the world produce so exquisite a surface delicate as a lily and strong as marble indeed you be wonderful porcelain you fair english girl wonderful porcelain but where be the star mr moggridge have also remark that miss strange be very easy in she manners this be not always the case with lady in coalchester and mr moggridge do not mean the remark as a unreserved compliment she like a certain stiffness in stranger it be not however in isabel strange 's nature to oblige she in that particular she way of pour she grace into mr moggridge 's great arm-chair suggest at once that she have live there for ever so long and to he particularly she chat as with a old acquaintance you could not make a stranger of she she eat some cold fowl which presently appear entirely without embarrassment though two miss moggridge sit like dummy and watch she that be a interesting face she say presently point to a conspicuous portrait of a young man on the mantelpiece that be mr londonderry say mr moggridge o _ that be _ mr londonderry be it she say h be i have not expect he to be so young yes he be a wonderful young man for he position say mr moggridge start on what be now he favorite topic he 'll be a great man some day will mr londonderry isabel look up at mr moggridge with add interest such a genuine interest in great man as he voice betoken be a surprise in he then mr moggridge proceed to narrate the history of new zion tell of its former desolation he lucky advertisement and its present prosperity yes it be a dead-and-alive place be new zion when we move in here be not it missus turn to he wife but now since mr londonderry come there be always something move yes there be always something go on at new zion he repeat rub he hand gleefully mr moggridge do so love anything that be alive mr moggridge also tell the story of the dawn and generally as he would have say post she up in the position of thing at new zion at the end she find herself generally look forward to meeting this young minister and he friend who be evidently a little nest of surprise-people in what have indeed seem a most unpromising corner of the world -- perhaps the most unpromising corner that she nomadic wander minstrel existence have bring she to isabel strange accord to old-fashioned reckoning be not a very young woman that be she be already twenty-eight though have to fight a silly world with its own silly weapon she call herself twenty-five which it be still quite safe for she to do and though the nerve-intensity of she face be the worst thing in the world for wrinkle they would when they come be very interesting wrinkle and she eye and mouth would keep the world from look at the rest of she feature for a long time to come a face so full of the mystery of light could only be eclipse by one darkness and even in that those magnetic eye would shine through the cold close lid surprise be welcome to she for she get few she life be rather a dreary one as the life of a elocution teacher may well be at one time she have dream of the stage but she voice be not quite big enough for that some manager have say and indeed she mettle be perhaps a little too fine for the stage the positive and enduring joy of she life be that she live in london -- for which she have the kind of passion that some people have for the earth-mother -- and love beauty as some woman love religion she have be love many time but never quite as she need as she demand to be love vivid passionate and exquisite she be what we call modern to the tip of she beautiful finger that be she unite the newest opinion on all thing with many ancient charm at the same time she be a good woman though very wonderful and highly dangerous presently mr moggridge who from where he sit command a view of the street exclaim why here be mr londonderry himself rise as he speak and pass into the hall where he be meet by a curiously rich and mellow voice which isabel strange thus hear for the first time and then the glorified original of the photograph enter the room as she eye and hand meet he she soul give a little half-humorous oh of surprise for photography which seem to have be invent to flatter the mediocre and belittle the exceptional have indeed give londonderry a interesting face as we have hear but miss all the rest -- all the rest of a large mobile talk face not exactly handsome perhaps but decidedly good-looking and full of various command and appeal think on the brow and laughter in the eye humor and eloquence all along the large and somewhat loose mouth with plenty of go in the powerful but not anxiously determine chin these be the moral quality of the face which isabel strange do not miss but it be the fascination of its general vitality that strike she most as a important introduction be make to the usual fantastic accompaniment of small talk let we not prolong the small-talk of the situation further but introduce miss strange as speedily as possible to jenny also and to the little study in 3 zion place here she eager examination of the shelf be one succession of cry of sympathetic delight why you have get all the book i ever want to read again she exclaim what wonderful people you be how have you do it -- in zion place i suppose the book must have be blow here answer theophil gaily on the same fair wind that blow miss isabel strange yes say little jenny affectionately press she shoulder as the three lean forward look at the shelf for if we seem wonderful people to you what must you seem to we -- here as you may well say in zion place what _ do _ she remind you of say jenny presently with candid admiration i know why of course she just _ be _ the very woman wait -- i 'll go and fetch it and theophil and isabel be thus leave for a moment or two alone -- a fact of no importance beyond this that it be the first moment in they life that they have ever be together alone jenny return presently with a small copy of botticellus 's primavera which hang in she bedroom and it be undoubtedly true that the figure of flora might well have pass for a portrait of isabel the nose be a little longer that be all but the rest of the face -- particularly the eye and mouth -- be all but exact and the general correspondence between the two face in subtlety strangeness and so to say determine refinement be complete it be strange that i should have love that face so say jenny it be very sweet of you -- jenny i have almost say -- but you be too kind to I and a little selfish too -- you give I no time to admire you i wonder if mr londonderry be modern enough to allow lady to smoke in he study and thus it come out that jenny often smoke there the smoking-sister be now almost as common as a taste for botticellus and perhaps equally insincere but in 1886 there still remain that sense of contrast in both which we have declare the essence of romance at present those curious people who resent the popular acceptance of a ideal of beauty which they have do they best to popularize be begin to affect that a taste for botticellus be a mark of the _ bourgeoisie _ so do the whirligig of time bring in the paradoxer a new kind of woman while she be always the despairing hope of man be seldom acceptable to woman yet when the evening come and isabel stand up to recite in new zion schoolroom woman as well as man be instantaneously attract she stand very simply with one hand lightly touch the table at which londonderry sit as chairman and the other at she side and before she begin she first recitation she glance quietly over the audience as though she eye be thus prepare the proper magnetic atmosphere for she voice she begin with some simple longfellow poem that new zion might feel at home then she recite a fairy poem call the forsake merman which of course be only a fairy tale and yet somehow be so full of human pathos that it be more real than if it have be really real that be prosaic for impress the imagination of she audience she rely mainly on she own imagination and she voice striking no attitude and allow herself nothing of that facial distortion which be the resort of the unimaginative and destroy not create illusion of course she face change but the change be one of which she be probably unconscious and which she could not have reproduce to she mirror it be not a play of feature but a play of light and shadow and nerve a flow or a ebb of radiance in the eye a subtle sensitiveness of the lip and nerve and she effect be mainly produce by she voice over which she wield indescribable power of modulation it be a voice so sympathetic so intimate that it almost seem too intimate too appealingly sympathetic it be so a woman might recite to a man she love but you almost feel as though the voice be too personal a revelation for a audience -- feel a impulse so to say to throw a veil over it though you be glad from you soul that no one throw it and the voice be a wonderful actor too it could act the scenery as well you see it all you hear it all you feel it all in the voice : -- the great wind blow shoreward the wild white horse in the spray the white-walled town and the little gray church on the windy shore and when she say down down down you be indeed in the very depths of the sea -- and be all sit mr moggridge with the rest amid coral cave and seaweed and in a curious green and shimmering light but what a world of heart-break there be in she come dear child come away you feel you simply could not bear she to say it again next time you would have to cry and cry you do and you be not ashamed for suddenly when you come out of the trance of the voice you find that every one else be cry too and mr londonderry have quite forget that he be a chairman and have to be nudge to announce the next piece this be a very strange poem and make you feel like a stained-glass window it be full of incense but it be full of something else too it begin the bless damozel lean out from the gold bar of heaven and there be something in the voice that suggest such a height up above the world that you draw you breath lest she should fall over and there be a lover cry in the poem you could hear he cry far away down on the earth and there be some line which go : we two will lie i ' the shadow of that mystic living tree within whose secret growth the dive be sometimes feel to be that make you feel what a strange holy thing love be after all and then there be a curious verse with nothing but woman 's name in it yet somehow it seem the loveliest of all and when again you come out of the voice you be not cry but feel wonderfully blest somehow and rather frightened jenny send a wonderful look to theophil -- it be so they should bathe together in god 's sight -- and theophil send back as wonderful a look as a chairman dare venture on otherwise of course it would have be as wonderful as jenny 's thus do isabel strange recite at new zion and perhaps one can best judge of the impression she make from the fact that the little boy at the back who during the last lecture on henrik ibsen have discover a most exciting new way of make continued existence possible quite forget it and would have to keep it for Sunday afternoon sunday-school everyone go home in a dream and little jenny shone like a light with the excitement and wonder of it all how wonderful you be do not it seem strange to be so wonderful say jenny afterwards as the two girl take off they outdoor thing in jenny 's room dear child say isabel kiss jenny on she brow it be you that be wonderful there be no joy in the world better worth see better worth living than the joy of young people with the same dream the same thought and -- so important -- the same word for they blow together by some unexpected conjunction of the four wind meet by some blissful dispensation of the planet of youth there have be period in history especially favourable for the ecstasy of such meeting early morning of the human spirit when lovely new truth and lovely new beauty be dawn wild and dewy in the strange east and while the deep breathing of the older generation still asleep make a more wonderful loneliness of dawn for the hushed and happy band of young people hold each other 's hand and watch in the magic twilight to have be young in italy in the time of dante in england in the time of shakespeare and to have meet in such a mighty morning -- with danger too to keep we grateful ah we have miss those dawn and yet i doubt if the whole recover beauty of greece and rome or the thrilling new fashion in romance and poetry waft across the sea from italy to help make shakespeare ever give young people a keener thrill of newness and mystery than the book and picture so eagerly discuss by the little group that gather over supper that night in 3 zion place to have read the house of life -- to have see the venus verticordium ah that be life and isabel have actually be to mr gf watt 's studio -- walk about there a whole afternoon the young new zioner look at she o theophil we _ must _ go to london cry jenny she mean when they be marry theophil press she hand tenderly as she impulsively seek he for sympathy and he eye leave isabel 's face a moment to smile a true yes into jenny 's of course no one have eye for anyone but isabel that night be she not as the announcement have say of london a ambassadress of beauty from the capital of the great queen there be really little she could tell these clever young people who amaze and attract she by they reality -- the unreality of intensity and modernity and the rest have of course already begin in london -- but she represent to they the sparkle of the new beauty and truth they love she know little intimate anecdote of the poet and painter they love piquant gossip and brilliant _ mots _ and then she be one of those woman who be like incense in a room enrich by she very presence exhale mystery and distinction like a pomander of strange spice you might love she for a long time or a little but love she you be oblige to while you be with she whoever else you love too there be no other word for it even little jame whalley have conscience-pang as he look at isabel for he have be engage for five year but the poet 's heart that be all the combustible portion of it be already burn to a cinder poet ' heart however be use to burn the inflammable air of sigh about they be ever in a perpetual state of ignition so it have come no doubt from long custom that nature have make they at they center as fireproof as the phoenix otherwise indeed the poetic life would be impossible to live poet could not go on maintain the deadly fire of love to which it be one of the condition of they precarious art that they must daily expose themselves sometimes indeed as we know even these fireman of the emotion dare the burning house once too often and we hear they death-song amid the flame theophil well we can talk of theophil again meanwhile jenny be as much in love with she herself and he hold jenny 's hand and love she o yes so dearly -- and be quite safe fear not little jenny it be only death you remember that be to separate jenny and theophil mr talbot -- if she will not bear you -- have make a interesting remark she have not escape isabel 's charm but there be something something a little alarming about she -- a little like that wicked wall-paper jenny divulge this criticism over supper when she mother be out of ear-shot how very clever of she exclaimed isabel she say the same of dvorak 's music say jenny good again say isabel how clever of she do not you feel how right she be we be all like that wall-paper and everything we care about be like it the new spirit -- that be the devil -- be in that wall-paper a psychometrist could detect wagner and keat and schopenhauer and rossettus and swinburne and all the rest of they in that wall-paper just as surely as he could have detect tupper and eliza cook in the wall-papers of 1851 be i not right if we could only paper new zion like this exclaimed theophil a curious new feeling of joy and pain shooting through he to hear a woman thus express herself as a independent brain yes new zion i would quite forget all about new zion it seem impossible to think of you together and a little absurd i suppose say theophil it be uncouth material i admit he continue and yet somehow it amuse we to mould it all the more and then you must not forget that we have be give no other -- but i do not suppose you can understand -lrb- theophil often use we in this imperatorial sense meaning himself as of course he have every right to mean -rrb- o yes but i can isabel hasten to correct i understand power beauty always do be the young minister 's reply besides he presently resume we be glad to have be nonconformist -- once a puritan training be a good thing -- to look back upon you be all the more thorough in you pleasure the truer humanist for something of it still lurk in you blood yes of course you be right i do not like the word ` pagan ' but for want of a better we might say that the best pagan have come of puritan stock besides it be half the romance of life to have something to escape from be not it and someone to escape with the other half respond theophil nimble as a real town wit o it be a wonderful night let we build five tabernacle good-night dear jenny good-night dear wonderful isabel so at last the two girl bid each other good-night at the door of jenny 's bedroom where isabel be to sleep masterful youth so wild to take so eager to surrender the christian name strange what passion sometimes can be put into a _ christian _ name when the door be shut on isabel she make no haste to undress indeed she sit down on the side of the bed as though she have be wait to sit down for ever so long sit very still as in a dream and a hour go by and she be still sit and gaze in front of she and downstairs in the study where the lamp be still burn theophil be sit by the fire in just the same curiously work and withdraw way with just the same eye isabel 's room be over he presently she hear he move about then she hear he come upstairs for a moment the air seem to grow warm as she hear he softly pass she room then she hear he close he door she shake she reverie from she as though it have be a black veil full of star and begin to undress presently she eye fall on a little pile of handkerchief with needle and cotton and little letter print on dainty tape beside it jenny have forget to put away she sewing isabel take up one of the handkerchief to which the needle and thread be still attach and read jenny lond -lrb- do not you know that be bad luck jenny -rrb- so soon as that be it so soon as that she sigh happy jenny chapter xiii in which jenny kiss mr moggridge isabel be leave very early next morning for london so good-bye must be brief jenny and theophil see she off at the station but before leave zion place there have be a moment in which for the second time in they life she and theophil have be alone they have stand together in the little study and take each other 's hand without a word and they have look into each other 's face as those look whom a look must last a long time they do not even say good-bye for if they be never to meet again the look be not good-bye and meet again it be not unlikely they would for it have be already arrange that isabel be to lead off the autumn entertainment but the look do not mean that either as life have be plan for they all subsequent meeting must be merely triviality they have meet once and fate have decide that they must never meet like that again in that long look each know that they meet and part for ever autumn arrangement notwithstanding each come out of that look as out of a great cathedral and from that moment till the train leave theophil with a unwonted sense of loneliness by jenny 's side they enter that cathedral no more they devotions be do for that day and they must resume they secular duty ripple idly over the great deep of themselves one always leave a station from which a dear friend have just go with a certain subdue air a certain bereaved hush in the voice and even jenny feel a momentary loneliness too but it be not long before the door of home open again for she in the sound of theophil 's voice and in the sense of the old familiar nearness to he she be back again safe in the only world she ever wish to dwell in it be more of a effort with theophil and the voice that make home for jenny have a strange sound in he own ear as though it be still talk to isabel but the effort be soon make and though jenny tease he a little and say she believe he have quite lose he that be to say _ she _ heart to isabel of course she believe no such thing doubt be too terrible a toy for true love to play with you only dare to doubt as you must sometimes face the fear of death i wish next October be here say jenny artlessly it seem such a long time to wait to see she again do theophil wish the same he hardly know distance be such a silly thing go on jenny it seem to have be invent just to separate those who want to be together it seem so arbitrary so unnecessary i suppose death be a form of distance say theophil irrelevantly life too i be afraid say jenny yes indeed life too assent theophil dreamily if i be to die say jenny suddenly would you still do what we say why do you ask that dear you be a very serious little woman this morning of course i would you know but why do you ask I now oh only dear because i wonder whether we really ought to somehow isabel 's visit have make I feel that life be a bigger fuller thing than i have dream and that man like you at all event have duty towards it even greater than you love for a little thing like I jenny dear do not talk like that why should you you do not surely doubt my love of course not theophil it be only my silly little brain think for once in a while -- and i do not mean to be unkind but really i rather mean it be you still quite sure there be nothing in the world more important than love quite sure he answer surer than ever -- if that be possible you be not begin to doubt that certainly it be a silly little brain if that be what its thinking be come to i do not mean it for myself little woman have nothing but love to think of but great man man with a mission in the world please jenny well dear i mean it and i sometimes think that perhaps perhaps i be hinder you life that if you be to be bother with love at all you should have marry some clever wonderful woman -- woman say like isabel jenny of course dear i know you do not think so she continue and he realize that it be all artless accident on she part -- still i can not help think it for you sometimes dear and sometimes i feel very selfish to have you love -- as though so to say i be wear someone else 's crown jenny dear will you promise never to talk like that again a clever woman to be a woman be to be a genius but to be a clever woman be to be another man of talent that would not be fair to isabel no assented theophil isabel be different too and that bring they to theophil 's office and good-bye till the evening for the evening there have be fix a important church meet the first annual business meeting of minister and deacon since londonderry have come to new zion it be a occasion of jubilation all round particularly for mr moggridge who give voice to new zion 's general satisfaction you may be sure in no uncertain term of praise new zion be indeed _ new _ zion once more he say thanks to they indefatigable young pastor -- a play on word which be receive with the applause due to so unmistakable a union of wit and truth nor do the proceedings result in mere compliment the church find itself rich enough to increase its minister 's stipend and when theophil take mr moggridge back to supper another surprise await he in the form of a suspicious-looking letter which be open reveal a quite unexceptionable # 50 note enclose in a sheet of note-paper on which be write -- from never mind who the writing be unknown to londonderry but there could be only one culprit of course mr moggridge this be from you really no sir indeed you make a mistake there protest moggridge lie badly and grow purple who do _ you _ suspect jenny why of course it be mr moggridge mr moggridge exclaim jenny impulsively throw she arm round mr moggridge 's surprised shoulder and kiss he somewhere in he whisker -- mr moggridge you be the dearest kindest man in the world and jenny be not far wrong mr londonderry say mr moggridge by way of change the subject and warmly grasp the young man 's hand new zion 's proud of you sir -- and so be eli moggridge and that moment would have be as good for all three even without the fifty-pound note chapter xiv the great event of mr talbot 's life i realize that any attempt henceforth to enchain the reader 's interest with church meeting or the like enthralment will be more than hopeless that be the worst of allow love to creep into one 's story he insist on have the stage to himself and in that determination the audience be entirely with he previously you may have be interested in all kind of peaceable unexciting thing far more good for you but enter love and all the rest be suddenly fall tame beyond endurance it be of no use to urge that life 's bill of the play include many hardly less brilliant and attractive performer they be all well enough in they way till the eternal paganinus be there with he old fiddle once more at he shoulder then there be a end of all seriousness or a beginning as you please well i 'll do my best to get over the six month between march and October as quickly as possible and indeed it will not be very difficult after all for very little happen to speak of during that time to any of the chief actor engage in make this history perhaps it be this consideration that prompt old mr talbot -- o bother old mr talbot -- that prompt old mr talbot i say to take the important step of die when poor old man he death would give the least possible trouble there seem as little reason for he die as there have seem for he living for as far as anyone know there be nothing the matter with he except a extreme sleepiness of a evening which be but natural in a old weary man who still keep at he stone-masonry though he be full seventy night after night for some week he have be get sleepier and sleepier why dad i never see such a old sleepy-head -- he wife have rally he good-naturedly one night look at he with a sudden odd expression in she face eh lass but i be noddin ' and no mistake say the old man struggle drowsily with the heaviness and presently succumb once more he be off again say mr talbot to herself as she lift the lid of a pent saucepan in which some boil onion be mightily bubble in a wild little world of steam presently the old man sigh deeply -- so you would have think but mr talbot hurry to he know that he have try to say jane and have say it for the last time yes he have be get sleepier and sleepier all he life he have be try to sleep and at last he sleep to most people mr talbot 's death be the first intimation of he ever have live and one rather resent for the old man the one day 's publicity which death enforce upon he it be indeed well for he that he be dead for such unwonted excitement would surely have kill he this important come and go of undertaker this populous invasion of friend talk like muffle drum in the front parlor and pass up and down and up and down the stair in and out and in and out of he still room this throng of neighbor await he in the street these plumed impatient horse and these carriage of dark grandeur -- jane why ever do not you bury I by the back door would surely have be the old man 's pitiful complaint could he have know however the day pass and the old man be safe at last where no front-parlour visitor should affright he more and where no one would trouble he old brain for speech any more and to all save one he death be but as though he have move a little farther into the kitchen it seem almost strange that even he wife should miss he one have think so little of they as man and wife one could hardly even by process of think realize that between these rinded and wrinkled being love have once hang like a rosy cloud from which one day have spring jenny on one or two occasion indeed they have be surprise in a uncanny semblance of a caress and once in a while a almost supernatural retrospect have light up and vanish again in a unaccustomed tender word and to have be present then be to feel somehow frightened ah the gay young leaf no longer kiss across in the morning sun but the stern old tree have meeting you know not of far beneath the ground they root be twist and twine in a wonderful embrace there there in the dark they be very close together and shall not be wrench apart without groaning that can not be utter jenny can hardly be say to have miss she father except through she mother who seem suddenly to grow a little deafer a little more dim-sighted just a trifle less brisk and busy than before and with a touch about she of that old-age awesomeness that mutter to itself in corner and seem to know strange thing yes jane miss she john she old heart know that he be no longer sit in the kitchen chapter xv jenny 's bottom drawer jenny and she old mother begin to grow closer to each other at this time perhaps it be because the old woman feel lonelier and perhaps too because the loss of she old man have send she thought wander among the enchanted field of she young day that she begin to talk sometimes to jenny about she marriage and to give she quaint advice on the subject of manage husband as if jenny smilingly say to herself a old man like father be the same belong even to the same race as theophil perhaps mr talbot scented some such reflection in jenny 's expression at all event she answer it with a eh but all man be alike my dear under they skin -- all alike and they need humor and manage just in the same way prince or peasant the idea of manage theophil have something repulsive in it for jenny there be a element of deceit of cunning imply which do not go with she idea of true love and the life beautiful of which she be dream she do not believe that man and woman who love be really different from each other and perhaps she be right about this time too mr talbot begin to produce from mysterious treasure-cave enter apparently from a old press in she bedroom all kind of wonderful thing which would be useful to jenny some day in she house : terrible little ornament -- very sacred though -- sad quaintness of the spirit of beauty pathetically fumble about in country brain wool mat work in the primary color and such wool wonder as a wool basket of flower in which real wool flower grow out of a wool basket which you hold by a over-arching wool handle the whole work with undeniable but how forlorn ingenuity -- a prehistoric relic of mr talbot 's legendary school-day : survival from a period which be best sum up in the one wonderful word antimacassar a period when for some unrecorded reason man and woman have to protect they furniture against they oleaginous self and beautiful lock be guard from lover 's finger by coat of triple oil but these be thing worth have too -- bit of old lace and prim embroidery that bear the stamp of a refinement that be never old-fashioned and when mr talbot descend from the beautiful she could show you real treasure i do not think there be any word in the language not even bible word which mrs talbot pronounce with such a accent of solemnity as the word linen the word china and cut glass and perhaps silver run it close but linen be undoubtedly the word in which all mr talbot 's sense of the seriousness of live she sense of household distinction she deep sense of the importance of prosperity and she stern love of cleanliness find most impressive utterance mr talbot could never have smile as she say linen and the linen she have be store for jenny might indeed have be the very stuff of which lily be make lily smell of lavender such pair of sheet a queen might even fear to await she lord lie amid such linen for white indeed must be the body that dare rivalry with mr talbot 's sheet -- sheet which might indeed be say to settle that old question of the snow of yester-year _ mai ou sont les neiges d'antan _ surely they have be settle flake on flake year after year in mr talbot 's linen-press till at last there be quite a snowdrift of fair white linen for jenny and theophil to lie in yes another six month and christmas will be here and after christmas be turn the week till February the 12th -- the second anniversary of theophil 's come to new zion -- will fly by in no time meanwhile mr talbot and jenny -- with occasional contribution from theophil -- begin to busy themselves with jenny 's bottom drawer translate into the language of those more magnificent circle in which this simple-hearted romance have no desire to move a bottom drawer might be describe as a trousseau though such translation would be only partially correct a bottom drawer be a good deal more than a trousseau it be the corner of a girl 's wardrobe usually its bottom drawer where the home that be to be begin to take shape in deposit of various kiss object minor article of apparel of ornament or use -- handkerchief such as we have already see jenny mark in defiance of the old prophecy that the bride who dare even to write she married name before she marriage will never know a wedding day quaint candlestick that have to be pick up in some old curiosity shop as come upon or be miss altogether pretty shoe of a pattern you be not likely to meet with again occasionally perhaps even a anticipatory wedding present that some friend who would be far away in australium when the day come have already contribute a pretty tea-service theophil have suddenly take a fancy to buy for jenny one day -- any straw will help a nest a sweet and rather naughty picture that must never be hung anywhere but in they little sacred bedroom -- o love we little room how often do jenny bend lovingly over that drawer which by now have spread itself over a whole chest of drawer -- for home be grow grow -- only a few more month and it would have grow so big and real that nothing but a little house would hold it and theophil be bring sometimes to peep in too -- o love think of it -- we little home chapter xvi theophil all this time have i seem to shirk the subject of theophil 's feeling all this time well i confess i have rather shrink from write down in so many word that he be in love with isabel -- obvious as the fact have be -- just as he himself shrink from admit the same truth even to he own soul when he have sit up in he study that night of the recital he have look the whole sad splendid truth in its wonderful face have love it wildly for a hour and then shut he eye to it for ever he know that isabel be the woman god have make for he sweet dear jenny the woman he have make for himself and he bow before the work of the greater artist never voice nor look nor touch of woman have affect theophil before as the least tone or glance or movement of isabel stir he to the center of he be to meet she eye be to release a music that go shudder through the whole world she lightest word be fill with echo of infinite thing not a lover only but anyone with instinct for such perception look at isabel would have say : there be a woman who be need to make some man a great poet a great artist some kind of great man she belong to the history-making woman hundred of woman will attract man by the hundred where she will attract comparatively few but that few will be the pick of man and some day when the other woman have go the way of all sweet rose she will still remain -lrb- if she have find a artist to understand she face -rrb- the frontispiece of some distinguished biography or hang in a gallery of the period among the few face that be indestructibly personal not the face that have live but the face that still go on live the face that be influence still the unique daemonic face isabel be indeed a muse that wait for she poet the mere idea of such a woman cherish across divide sea and separate year will help a man be great to grow great near or far be the one way to be hers and to pile up great work for she sake be perhaps the best way to love she she could never be he wife but she might still be he muse resolve theophil feign in that reflection for the moment a more human comfort than alas there really be but be there to be no loss to jenny in this true love in this differ from gold or clay that to divide be not to take away it be the convenient old plea of the poet and yet it be sometimes true it be true here there be i know a sort of primitive man or woman -- i believe they will some day be exhibit in menagerie -- who can not be on with a new love without be ungratefully off with the old all depend of what the two love be make if it be bodily fire and no more of course the new love will put out the old as the great sun put out a little smouldering fire and the majority of so-called love-story be merely disastrous conflagration of that sort in such case the new love be no sooner find than the old become grievous a burden by a malignant witchcraft the old charm have grow veritably repellent and all the heaven that be irretrievably disenchant which be the illusion one wonder -- the original enchantment or the final disenchantment when however love can give a better account of its preference than this and point out say in jenny many good reason why she be at first and must for ever remain love-worthy whatever rival reason for love another woman may bring when too there be add to those reason for loving jenny the dear habit of loving she the gratitude -- love must forgive the word -- which have accumulate interest upon the original love the beauty that have be gain by become familiarity and the familiarity that have become beauty by very use -- well really be it such a hardship after all for a man to be expect to keep true to he jenny oh but passion do not reason like this indeed o passionate reader be passion then merely a wild beast a savage a blind fire must it forfeit its fine name if it remember mercy or own duty be it any less passion because it refuse sometimes to glut itself and dare to go hungry all its day instead any less passion because it choose to burn up its own heart in a agony of its own consuming fire mere violence be not a strength but a weakness in passion and sometimes there be more passion in patience than in anything else in the world a passion that know not pity be merely a daemonic possession and should be take to the madhouse i confess that there be nothing in the world more amazing to I than the easy brutality with which one hear of some man do what be call break off they engagement only a new face have to show itself and the old face at once disappear with a blow and a wail murder of course be one way out of many difficult situation and the worst kind of murder be by no means capital offence it be true that all engagement be not make by the same vital bond as that of jenny 's and theophil 's but many be for a man wilfully to break a engagement mean sometimes that the whole love-life in a woman be atrophy all that make she woman stab to the quick of life yet no one who know anything of woman can have fail to remark that woman themselves be even more brutal in this matter nothing could exceed the executioner-like promptitude with which a woman will despatch a man for whom she have cease to care but in she case there be to be urge that though fundamentally love be of equal importance to man and woman it do not so often mean the absolute saving or wreck of a man 's life as it do a woman 's it be not a disgrace to a man to be jilt it be to a woman for a woman to be jilt be for she to have fail -- as a woman and for a woman to have fail as a woman be for she to value no other success all this to maintain in spite of the reader that londonderry be no milksop because he be not go to jilt -- that be murder -- poor little jenny throw up new zion and seek he new love on the wild wind but the agony of it none the less o jenny jenny sweet and true and good and dear as ever -- if only you would just take a sudden fancy for someone else meanwhile the month be go by and the day draw nearer when for a brief moment of fire the orbit of those two separated life be to touch once more what of isabel during these month the woman whom god have create for theophilus londonderry do not forget she promise to write to the woman whom theophilus londonderry have create in he own image wonderful letter of course why do not woman publish volume of they letter as man collect they scattered essay there be no writing in the world more immediately conqueringly personal than a really clever woman 's letter and they be not always compromise isabel 's letter be the perfection of self-expression she handwriting sweep across the page just as she would walk down a street at once eager and yet stately and subtle-rhythmed the shape of some of the word remind you of she hat -- hat everyone think she pay guinea for but which she make for herself at a cost perhaps of five shilling : hat which be pari with a touch of fairyland somewhere a unobtrusive feather of the fantastic somewhere a personal magic in the inimitable twist or lie of a bow -- she face look out at you from a _ g _ or a _ x _ a gesture flash back to you in a sudden distinguished stroke of the pen and she voice be somewhere everywhere among the word like a violin without any apparent literary device she contrived to make you while you read she letter do what she be do see what she be see and form as though act on by some magic property in the word picture of all she tell you one piece of news you would not expect she to have tell i have say that woman be both executioner of the tiresome in this isabel i fear be no exception to she sex like most independent girl in london she have a little theatre-guard of devoted man friend who take it in turn to companion she to play or picture-gallery and these with admirable tact she contrived to keep in to they the unsatisfactory relation of brother one of these however have of late be grow dangerously unfraternal he present have be grow expensive cigarette and chocolate and pretty edition like glove and box of flower be every pretty woman 's lawful spoil but costlier gift be to be look on with suspicion besides the doomed man 's letter have be grow warmer indeed isabel remember with something like a shudder so soon as she be back in she little room with its curious picture and its general sense of exotic refinement that she have allow he to kiss she the last time they have be together the reminiscence decide she theophil could never be hers but at least no facile or mediocre attachment should fill he place so at once there be post a letter as kind as cruelty can make it and with it go a little ormolu clock a pair of mother-of-pearl opera-glass a lovely fan it be hard isabel to part with -- and there be a end of that not after theophil she sigh as she take up she great persian cat and like it sit gaze into the fire that flicker dreamily among she fantastic possession -- a mystery gaze idly into a mystery chapter xvii o that ' t be possible well the month have at last go by -- dark solid body of absence not a day mercifully lose count of by the old calendar-maker not a hour of the long sentence remit for a brave patience in the wait they be reckon by week at last and now excitedly by day breathlessly now by little fast-dispersing hour the blackness that fill the world be a month ago streak with gray three week ago there be a line of faint color in the east a fortnight and there be scarlet plume in the far heaven and a faint twitter of song a week and the whole sky be a commotion of glory and bird to meet again o to meet again just to look at each other again we be philosopher we be brave we shall remember jenny but o the rapture of just behold each other again thank god you be alive you be real o theophil there be the little scar on you forehead i have be longing to see yes it be isabel she walk just as she do a thousand year ago i be carry she rug how well i remember she umbrella how fantastic absence be say isabel as the three friend sit once more that evening in the little study where nothing seem to have change and where they seem to have be sit all the hour of those now quite disrespectfully forget month yes but how real say jenny it be jenny who say how real how fantastic too be the present sometimes perhaps nearly always it torture we with the unreality the unrealisability of precious moment that be fly fly and can never come again and at other time it equally elude we with a sense of they indestructibility to-night the present have choose to seem real theophil feel as he look at isabel that this wonderful nearness could never pass away she dress she coiled _ cendr _ hair she soft smile she very attitude seem to wear a curious expression of everlastingness yes she would sit just like that and he and jenny would sit near she for ever and ever no mere abstraction like time and space could fill with emptiness the place where she now sit and smile in some mystical way eternity have breathe upon this hour and give it immortality it have be suddenly touch with a wand into a enchanted permanence theosophist tell of a astral light where every moment of time endure in strange painting upon space isabel and theophil and jenny be sit together in the astral light and yet the hour have already be fly for the recital be already over -- new zion more in love with isabel than ever the same little supper as six month ago have be merry and come to a end the guest have go the house be quiet and this hour that seem so real be the frail last of that day of dream yes but a arrangement have be make which perhaps account for the security of that hour isabel 's agent have plan for she a little circular tour in northern town comparatively adjacent to coalchester and when a fortnight of such recital be end she be to return and give still another recital at new zion then there must be parting real black parting again meanwhile the fortnight that lay between the two day of meeting gain a curious sense of be really spend together as two walk together on a long road may separate and one walk till almost out of sight of the other and then slowly return but the two endure no sense of parting feeling together all the time so isabel and theophil feel about this fortnight but do they speak no word look no look all these hour of all they heart cry out to say be jenny there all the time nearly still there be a moment grant they which add to the two moment previously record make a total perhaps of four minute which life so far generously allow they to be alone together in yet such be love 's miraculous velocity that it have say all it need to say give all in those four minute all it have to say to-night be just two christian name say so solemnly so tenderly so honestly just isabel just theophil and a long quiet clasp of hand and eye it be enough it be write chapter xviii one day out of all the year it be not enough if you would safely renounce a joy you have best enjoy something of it first renunciation must have something to live on you can take up the whole of love and utter it and _ then _ say adieu for ever but not before i have ask mercy for jenny though it be perhaps hardly necessary for the world always pity jenny now i would ask it for isabel and theophil who be thus quietly to sacrifice the greatest thing in they life the one reality for which they have come into existence for jenny 's sake great be they love for each other but even greater and stranger must be they involuntary love for a invisible goodness a ideal of ineffable pity they be go to die that jenny may live strange this gentle heroism of human creature one for the other would it be unfair to ask that each should support the anguish of he own destiny and that when jenny 's turn have come she should take she lightning hers have she know it be the cup of anguish here for theophil and isabel have be decree the cup of joy but will they drink it no they will change the cup perhaps the bitter cup will grow sweet near the dregs be drunk together yet this love of theirs this perilous chance for jenny be none of they make they joy have be give to they by unseen hand it be fairly theirs next time perhaps it will be they turn to suffer it be jenny 's now but no the good heart of humanity will defeat the cruel ruling of the god let the lightning come upon they -- not little jenny yet for this jenny you will not grudge they they piteous reward yours be all the year jenny you will spare they one day out of all the year think jenny of the hour and hour and hour you and theophil have spend in careless happiness and they -- one almost laugh to think of it -- have just so far be grant four minute for four minute out of infinite time life have privileged they to be alone together it will be far safer too otherwise you know not with what fearful flame love will fill the chasm under ground circling and seethe in the fiery darkness theophil love you but some day you home will suddenly be rent from cope to base unless he poor heart may speak yea babble itself just once in isabel 's ear a temptation have come to theophil at first he put it aside then passion wiser for once than reason tell he that it be a necessity and he know that passion be right a week of the fortnight have go and theophil remember that isabel would now be in the neighborhood of certain famous wood where in he boyhood he have often wander and he remember that she be to have the Monday quite free that Monday they should spend together in those enchanted wood he secular business often take he to town thirty or forty mile away and it be not startling for he not to return till late at night thus isabel and he should steal they one day out of all the year so there go a note without one word of love in it to tell isabel that love be come by the morning train and so on that morning isabel stand wait for love at that little wayside station and presently with a mighty rush sound of iron and brass love come and stand very quietly by she side and look into she eye they take each other 's hand quietly and leave the station without a word nor do they speak for a long while walk blissfully side by side through a village street which be to take they to the green and lonely wood soon the house be pass and they still walk on silent listen to the song of they nearness now as they drink each other 's presence through every feast nerve they know how starve they have be as the lane narrow and gloom green dip through cavern of bright leaf they draw closer and smile gently on each other but they be not go to speak for a long while yet have they not come away into this loneliness that they might be silent together that they might sit hour after hour and just watch each other lose in a ecstasy of contemplation a trance of recognition a fascination that be almost fearful that be so kind and yet so cruel in its very power the wood be very still but there be nothing in the world so still as these two lover as they lie down on the green earth and gaze on each other hour after hour when they find a word as great as they silence they will speak it -- but they will find none except it be isabel except it be theophil and great passion have as little use for caress as for word and kiss which gay sensual love gather greedily like little golden flower and pay for nimbly with little pretty word will be almost as rare as word kiss it be not to eat bonbon that these two have come out into the wood kiss what kiss of the blind lip could match the kiss of those rapt tragic eye kiss be but the diminutive of the great word love they be but the small change of passion meteorite star-dust of the great and terrible planet they soul be swing high above time and space in one never-ending kiss -- the kiss of that predestined irrefragable union of which meeting and parting and kiss and caress and word and every other fragmentary mode of expression be but trivial accident to which distance be still nearness and nearness be still distance they love be a property of eternal element it be fate as the union of magnetic power it obey chemic law of irresistible combination they be isabel and theophil -- that be they love they be in the world together -- that be they marriage but passion will not be all day a tragedian he have many mood he be a great wit -- how bright how bright he make the brain -- a merry comrade a little tender silly child and these two sad one laugh together too in the still wood -- for be not the most exquisite humourist in the world they companion love who be all thing by turn and all thing wise and they feast together wine and great grape spread out on the earth 's green table and they call each other silly beautiful name and they feign sad little glad story -- and call the wood they home : this be they breakfast-oak and that glade should be they great hall and high high up in yonder beech where the squirrel be sit should be they secret little bed-chamber hang in blue and green with a ceiling of star they should climb it each night on a ladder of moonlight and slide down from it each morning on the first strong ray of the sun and sometimes if it frighten they with be too near heaven they would seek out a dell of fine moss and creep close together into the arm of the kind earth-mother and then sleep while the star keep watch o yes it would be a wonderful life together then suddenly the child 's play would cease as the bird stop sing with the come of the star and silence would sweep over they again and a great kiss would leap out of the silence like a flame that light up heaven from north to south and they would hang together lose in a anguish of desire the setting sun be turn the wood into hall of strange light and spread golden couch here and there in its deep recess theophil sigh isabel wife sigh theophil -- -lrb- ah jenny -rrb- and then a voice that seem to be neither 's and yet seem to be the voice of both -- a voice like a dive smother in sweetness between they breast -- say let we go deeper into the wood later when the star have come two white face come glimmer from the innermost chancel of the wood 's green darkness they pass close together still as phantom among the tree and when they come out on to the lane they stand still theophil say one voice if i should be die and i should send for you will you promise I to come isabel say another voice if i should be die and i should send for you will you promise _ I _ to come and each voice vow to the other and say i would come and i would go with you and all these word have once be jenny 's but they have be isabel 's first chapter xix preparation for a fast and other sadness as the sharing of a cruel or unworthy secret must be the most terrible of all human relationship the sharing of a beautiful secret be the most blest thus for the week follow this day of day theophil and isabel go about they daily life with all heaven in they heart and divide though they be possess by a mystical certitude of inner union which they feel no extension of space or endurance of time could destroy such a marriage as theirs be of course the dream of all separated lover the love that wait and in wait die the theme of many poet and there have be great historic love-story to prove such love a possibility of human heart yet alas for the experiment that must so often fail for the weak will of loving that will so truly and yet must loose they hold -- the fire that promise itself food in memory for a thousand year but need the sensual fuel of sight and touch after all the love that believe it could go on trust through century of silence yet die at last of little earthly doubt for this tremendous fast which you be to make believe a feast trust in each other be the one condition that may avail this trust must come of no mere exchange of vow or deeply-sworn and eloquent promise it must be knowledge one heart of the other clear and absolute and such knowledge in you short hour of revelation you must have learn so passionately that like poetry learn in childhood it be henceforth no longer a forgettable detachable part of you mind 's furniture but a well-spring of instinct for ever be you lady true you will ask that only when you ask : be she beautiful such confidence as this be comparatively common in friendship but it be very rare in love : whether it be to be justify in the case of isabel and theophil time alone could show meanwhile they feel calm and happy as only two can feel who have discover in each other the one unchanging reality in a world of flow shadow it be very wonderful in quite a new way to meet again they love be no longer hunger and unrest it have gain the impassioned peace of great accept reality it be marry love now as the quiet firm hand hold each other again there seem to be long retrospect of try and tender intercourse in they very touch they eye hold a past in they as well as a future there be no hurry of the emotion now no reason for haste in the seek and give of tenderness no need to snatch and clutch the good gift of love as though there be but a short day for the give they love have grow conscious of its eternity it hold but one last sadness -- that it might not be reveal to jenny so little do they regard they love as one essentially for concealment that the temptation to include jenny in they bond be at moment a danger it be so beautiful and actually though unconsciously she be so integral a part of its beauty theirs be that dream of a threefold union in which so to say jealousy shall be so take into the confidence of so hold to the heart of love that it shall transform itself into love too and from be the lonely tragic third become as the other two one of a indivisible trinity such union of nature of especial grace have be bear under like condition of fate intercourse and they have be union of a strange beauty the more blest by the sense of a conquest over love 's one unworthiness its egoism as the _ goisme  deux _ be finer than a egoism of one so this _ goisme  troi _ if you will be again finer by its additional inclusiveness perhaps it have prove wiser in the end to yield to this temptation too but the tragic risk be one to dismay experiment the strength of such a union be literally the strength of its weakest link jenny love both isabel and theophil and both isabel and theophil love jenny and in the love of the two girl there be a element of affection that be more impassioned than friendship jenny indeed love isabel so much that it might well have prove that she love with nothing but gladness could have add its volume to theophil 's and the three love meeting in one river of love flow on together to the eternal sea but the tragic risk the alternative be -- heart-break death they have vow to save jenny from the lightning perhaps it would not destroy but only transfigure after all -- yet the test be lightning and for whom that we love dare we venture such a ordeal though it be to win they paradise no jenny must never know and yet perhaps if jenny have be tell well the greatest love for another can not guard all the gate of chance and alas these two loyal as they be for one unguarded moment be to leave open a gate of they paradise -- when we withdraw into paradise we should see that all the gate be close -- and jenny by a like chance be to take into she soul one blind glimpse of they there it be the evening of the last recital and theophil and isabel have go down to zion a few minute before the hour arrange jenny who for some trivial reason be detain to meet they at the hall a audience be already gather there but this theophil and isabel avoid enter the building by the minister 's private entrance into he vestry which communicate by a dark staircase with the chapel and the lecture-hall where the recital be to be give there be a light in the vestry but no one be there though they might have expect mr moggridge for a moment to they eternal sorrow they forget all but that they be once more alone and together and as they seek each other 's arm standing in the center of that grim little room a weak anguish come over theophil and he exclaim -- oh isabel to think that i have lose you lose you but isabel be stronger : no dear you have not lose you have find I to have lose each other would have be never to have meet dear i love to think that you might be weak for my sake no woman can help a man be strong who can not first make he weak ah love how weak i could be for you sake -- and how strong but be strong for mine be strong for jenny 's sake i love that best then for a moment they stand lose once more lock in a embrace so touchingly kind so shelter so calm that they very attitude be home and have they have ear or eye for a world outside that home they might have see at that dark half-opened staircase door a little face look in happy and draw back dead for jenny have follow they more quickly than she or they have expect and not find they in the lecture-hall have seek they here with a light heart she have hear none of they word she have only see that look of home upon they face and write across they arm very quietly she steal away she feel very dazed and tire the shock have be so swift that already it seem half unreal she feel she must sit down and pass into the silent chapel light only with dim reflection from without she sink on to a seat and thought of little but that it be good to be sit down and that the darkness be good and that there loom out of the shadow be theophil 's pulpit and beneath be she little harmonium -- to-morrow night would be she choir-practice she must not forget that no she must not forget that -- and then the darkness begin to frame flash picture of that dreadful glimpse of brightness -- be they still stand like that -- how happy they look -- and would they always go on standing together in brightness like that while she sit here in the darkness well the darkness be good how she should dread brightness for the future if only she need not go to the recital -- might she not be spare that no she must have courage she must go they must not know she have see they not yet not till she have think what must be do not till she have make she plan it would have to be talk of if she let they know that would be terrible isabel would be go to-morrow and then she might speak to theophil might set he free but now she must go -- she must not be later than they they would be pass down to the hall presently she must be there before they -- she must be quick -- she must go now as isabel and theophil enter the hall together and smile a recognize smile at jenny already in she place she be able to smile back at they though there be some who think she look very white and find she very quiet when they try to talk to she she could not help remark to herself how little of the common resentment she feel towards the two on whose face she now see a happiness which she wonder she have not see before but she anguish be too great for resentment she feel towards they love as she might have feel towards death -- it be a terrible fact and in she good heart there be already the beginning of pity for they too perhaps she feel that it be a little unkind of they not to have trust she -- just as a child might who have feel worthy of we trust but have be deem too young to share it if they have only tell she might she not have love they love -lrb- ah if we would only trust the deep in those we love -rrb- have isabel only see that white face in the dark doorway she would have spare jenny one of she recitation that night it be a poem of mr brown 's perhaps the most poignant poem of renunciation ever write and isabel have choose it as love will choose a song for the fearful joy of singing it where all may hear but one only may understand it be the poem of a like renunciation to theirs though for different reason but there be sufficient literal application to they for jenny now to understand it too it be call a denial and begin : -- we have meet late -- it be too late to meet o friend not more than friend death 's forecome shroud be tangled round my foot and if i step or stir i touch the end in this last jeopardy can i approach thee -- i who can not move how shall i answer thy request for love look in my face and see i might have love thee in some former day oh then my spirit have leap as now they sink at hear thy love-praise before these fade cheek be overwept have this be ask of I to love thee with my whole strong heart and head -- i should have say stillye but _ smile _ and say ` look in my face and see ' but nowgod see I god who take my heart and drown it in life 's surge in all you wide warm earth i have no part -- light song overcome I like a dirge could love 's great harmony the saint keep step to when they bond be loose not weigh I down be _ i _ a wife to choose look in my face and see -- while i behold as plain as one who dream some woman of full worth whose voice as cadenced as a silver stream 's shall prove the fountain-soul which send it forth one younger more thought-free and fair and gay than i thou must forget with brighter eye than these which be not wet -- look in my face and see so farewell thou whom i have know too late to let thee come so near be count happy while man call thee great and one beloved woman feel thee dear -- not i -- that can not be i be lose i be change -- i must go farther where the change shall take I worse and no one dare look in my face and see the agony of this verse as one read it be heart-breaking but as isabel recite it it be unbearable and other in that audience besides jenny feel the personal cry in the voice though none but jenny know its destination but to jenny 's ear the exquisite wifeliness of the last verse be fuller of pain than all the rest -- meantime i bless thee by these thought of mine i bless thee from all such i bless thy lamp to oil thy cup to wine thy hearth to joy thy hand to a equal touch of loyal troth for I i love thee not i love thee not -- away there be no more courage in my soul to say ` look in my face and see ' when isabel sit down amid hushed clap it be observe that miss jenny talbot have faint theophil spring with other to she assistance and jenny be carry into a ante-room for air and water presently revive ask faintly for mr moggridge to take she home the thought of the big kind man come into she mind with a sense of homely refuge there there he say you 'll be better in a minute and when she be strong enough to walk he take she home theophil fill with sudden misgiving have to see the evening 's entertainment to its close mr moggridge blame the bad ventilation as he tenderly help jenny along the few yard to home no say jenny with a big tear sigh i do not think it be that it be that last poem i think it seem so terrible to think of two people have to part like that do not you think so mr moggridge mr moggridge do and then he say miss strange have such a way of give it out it be almost more than human nature can bear yes she voice say jenny seem like a stream of tear when theophil and isabel return from zion they seem so full of real anxiety as indeed they be that jenny 's poor heart feel just a pass ray of warmth a little less cast out into eternal loneliness she give the same explanation as to mr moggridge not significantly but half intend a kind veil message to they it seem so terrible to think of two people have to part like that she say again and presently she plead weariness to go to bed earlier than usual but do not you hurry isabel say jenny you and theophil will not see each other for a long time again sleep well say isabel kiss she and as she do so she think there be a curious convulsiveness in jenny 's embrace when she have go the two look at each other she seem strange say isabel i think i will go and see she for a moment say theophil so it be that tap at jenny 's door he find she lie across she bed with the gas still down cry dear he exclaim o theophil dear do not come she say it be only silly nerve go back to isabel i shall be better when i have have a sleep do go dear like a kind boy i be better by myself no it be nothing -- nothing but nerve do go dear good-night and with a foreboding heart theophil go back to isabel yet as jenny have say they be not to see each other for a long time again and if presently theophil forget jenny cry upstairs be it not because he do not know the reason of she tear on the morrow jenny plead weariness and stay in bed so that theophil see isabel off to london alone and he do not see jenny again till the evening chapter xx in which jenny cry jenny be not at the door that evening to welcome theophil home as she usually be and she make some excuse not to join he at dinner but at last when the quiet secure hour which have always be theirs between dinner and bedtime have come she come into he room quietly and sit in she accustomed chair she have be fight all day to gain strength for this hour and she will be bravely set to speak what must be speak but she must firmly choke back all the sweetness of the memory which spring to she with kind eye as the familiar little room that have not change open its arm to she alas a ironical symbol of unchangeableness one touch of tenderness too vivid and she would break down and here be theophil rise from he desk and come to she with true love in he eye as he have do so many many happy night be it after all a dream -- that terrible picture of two light figure that be for ever in she eye no there be a voice that go day and night with the dream a voice of terrible tenderness that keep cry : meantime i bless thee -- i bless thy lamp to oil thy cup to wine ah no it be real real the trial be not to pass from she in a dream theophil have kneel down at she side and take she hand gently and would have kiss she but that she eye be so full of pain as she turn they to meet he besides strange word to hear she be ask he not to kiss she theophil dear do not kiss I yet i have something to say and if you kiss I i shall have no strength to say it jenny dear she begin with a voice that seem to bleed at every word i want to be so kind i do not want to hurt you with a single word you 'll believe that will not you theophil press she hand for assent but already in a flash the whole revelation be upon he jenny know he love isabel this awful pain that be all over she be the lightning from which they have will to save she theophil jenny have go on and there seem a death in every word i know that you love isabel o jenny i see you together dear in the vestry last night it be a accident you do not hear I o my jenny i would rather have die than this yes i think you would dear but you must not be too sad life be terrible -- like this i understand it now i know it be not you or isabel or I it be just fate -- and we must try and help each other do not think i have be only sorry for myself do not think that of I but i think you should have trust I dear we long to tell you say theophil with he head bow in distress in jenny 's lap while she softly stroke he hair with a absent tenderness though she eye look straight in front of she and she voice be as if she be talk to herself we long to tell you he repeat o i wish you have we fear it dear yes yes i know i be only a little child the day before yesterday i have never be worthy to be you wife dear i have know it all the time i should never have take you love it have never be mine but she continue i will give it all back now it be not too late i have keep it pure for isabel i can give it to she darling with a kind heart -- for she be worthy she be bear for you dear we be not bear for each other after all -- be we dear i be the woman of that poem not isabel it be i who must say good-bye i can do it i be a woman now love -- not a little child any more ` look in my face and see ' the tangle of theophil 's emotion and thought as he listen to jenny in silence be a revelation to he of the strange heart of love and of the insufficiency of those formula by which we image ourselves to ourselves how little we know of ourselves till we be test by the powerful reagent of love and danger and in how many way must those test be apply before we learn anything of the element of which we be compose one love will reveal to we one side of we nature and its need another will reveal to we another with its need and till we grow old we can never be certain that there be not other side to we that have never be illuminate other need that have never be awaken by a emotion a man may love two woman equally : the woman he most need and the woman who need he most -- and in a crisis of choice he will probably choose the latter again the power of the woman we have love first have wonderful reserve to draw upon humble pawn of feeling memory association not so brilliant to the imagination as the royalty of romance and sentiment on the other side but incalculably useful in a battle too humble be some of these to gain acknowledgment indeed they be often so submerge in a total of vague impulse that they escape any individualisation in the very hour where all seem lose to jenny theophil 's love for she be pass in the fire of this ordeal from a love whose element have never perhaps quite combine into that miraculous metal of true love which can never again be separate into anything but itself -- the true gold of love which in some magical second of projection have suddenly spring out of those troubled ingredient of earth and iron silver honey and pearl this do not mean that theophil 's love for isabel have grow any less real but that he love for jenny have grow more real for the first time in its history it move on the stage of the heroic up till now it have live secure domestic day there have be no danger to test its truth no light of tragedy or romance throw across it it have seem a simple little earthborn love whereas theophil 's love for isabel have from its very condition walk from the first the high heaven of dream isabel indeed still remain the heavenly love but those who understand will know the strength of jenny when i say that she become confirm in this hour of trial as the household love of theophil 's life isabel remain the muse but it be jenny after all in spite of those solemn word in the wood of silence that be the wife and if at first sound there seem less of heaven in such a love it be surely only because when heaven have become incarnate upon earth we forget to call it heaven in the few moment of silence which follow jenny 's word it be some such turmoil of feeling and thought questioning and conclusion which pass through theophil 's mind at last resolve itself into word that sound unexpected even in he own ear jenny he say it be quite true that i love isabel and that she love I but it be true that i love you too love you more truly in this moment than i have ever love you and that no other woman can ever take you place if you give I up for isabel 's sake it will be no gain to she for i would not go to she i love you indeed i love you and i want no other woman to be my wife jenny 's face brighten for a moment they be good word and they sound real but then that embrace how real that be nothing again could ever be so real as that ah theophil dear but you stand as though you love she so you arm be so tender it be just as though they say ` wife ' you be deceive yourself dear believe I you be god know how i love you i have nothing in the world but you and ifif jenny try and believe let I show you how i can love you i seem never to have show you before let we begin we love over again from to-night i know you heart be bleed but let I heal it dear i know this sorrow must lie heavy upon we for a long while yet but it will pass you shall see o you shall see how i love you let we be marry soon dear let we wait no longer theophil have raise he head and as he speak pour on jenny all the appeal of he strong eye with all the might of he soul he will she back to happiness as orpheus strove by he singing to bring back eurydice from the shades she could not look into he set longing face without feeling that he be speak true word hope flicker for a moment in she sad eye yes he want to come back to she he want to be hers again but be it not too late have not something go forever something be kill could even theophil himself ever make she happy any more then the misery flood over she again in a irresistible sea in which all kind word fall powerless as snowflake she resolution break down and with terrible sob she fling herself into theophil 's arm o theophil my heart be break my heart be break theophil be to feel she cry thus against he bosom till the end of he life he shudder with dread at this terrible cry -- it be as though all she life be leave she in sob as though she be bleed to death in tear it be grief piteously prostrate wild convulsive unutterable jenny be right she heart be break theophil 's terror be right it be too late to love she this be the death-crying of a broken heart chapter xxi in which jenny be mysteriously honor still a moment do at last come when the sob subside and jenny dry she tear she be go to try try to be happy again try to forget it and she try so well that in a few day she face have grow even bright again -- bright as silver it could never again be bright as gold and theophil 's love be like a sun pour down upon she day by day yes he love she she could not doubt that though there be time when he true word and caress suddenly seem to wear a torture falsity as she think of isabel but such feeling she put from she bravely jealous of isabel in the common way she have not be she herself love she too well and soon she be able to talk of she again to theophil they have agree that isabel should not know what jenny have see that night of the recital for jenny could not bear to think of the letter it would mean let that be we secret dear she say to theophil and thus when isabel write she write back in she usual way theophil and isabel never write to each other it be no part of they love to deceive jenny in letter they love be vow to silence and absence and in theophil 's life it must be more and more of a starlit background so the week go by and the marriage of theophil and jenny be now finally fix for the 12th of February on second thought as they love grow serene once more they have decide not to anticipate that date for old mr talbot 's sake and meanwhile jenny be admonish by that old mother to make haste and get that flesh on she bone the admonition be not without cause for it presently become noticeable that jenny be not merely negatively disobey she old mother in this not only be she not grow fatter but indeed she be for one reason or another slowly and almost imperceptibly grow thinner it be not those at home who notice this first but outside friend who suddenly meet she would remark that she be not look half the girl she use to be she have already begin to remark it herself as with she bare arm she would coil up she hair standing before she mirror and she think nothing of it till one day as she stand there she notice a curious expression flash into she face and go again almost before she could mark it she face which have always be round and plump seem suddenly to gaze back at she very narrow and pinched and white strangely sunken too and rigid it be all a mere flash and go again and she real face be presently back once more but the look fill she with solemn thought in which she be surprise to find a certain comfort as of a sad wish fulfil itself she speak to no one of that look but it must have be the same look that theophil see a few night after as she sit listen to he read in she usual chair suddenly as he look up at she he throw down the book and with concern almost terror in he voice exclaim good god jenny be you ill dear what be that terrible white look in you face he spring across and take she hand the look have go again before he have finish speaking but it be a look he be never to forget one day jenny put out she arm and ask he to feel how thin it be grow it _ be _ thin dear but you must not be anxious perhaps you be a trifle run down you must see the doctor mr talbot do not believe in doctor and suggest nourishing soup and port wine as a substitute these however make those dear arm no fatter they put none of that promise flesh on jenny 's bone -lrb- why do theophil rather creep one day as mr talbot make use of that expression -rrb- and jenny be grow tired too she be not so ready on she foot as she use to be small exertion exhaust she she breath be not so available for run up and down stair as it have be then theophil would have a doctor who sound jenny and look a little grave but finally reassure ask she if she have have a shock -- jenny smile rather knowingly but deny it -- declare she a little run down and in need of brace and nourishment prescribe phosphite and steel then jenny get very wet one day on she way from school and she begin to cough she have to stay at home and bed be perhaps the best place for she so jenny go to bed and look very pretty there and be quite merry of a evening when theophil bring she flower -- he be already bring she flower -- would draw up the arm-chair by she side and read to she those be very sweet hour perhaps the sweetest they love have ever know so cosy and homelike and yet without fear but one evening when jenny have be cough there be blood on the bosom of she nightdress and as theophil see it he heart stand still with terror jenny grow very white too as she see it though the awful thought which be behind the still look they give each other be not quite new to she sometimes she might have be hear softly say over to herself -- i be lose i be change i must go farther where the change shall take I worse and no one dare look in my face and see yet although death 's voice call we from afar may seem all sweetness he voice come nearer have a note of dread in it that appal the most death-desirous heart and in that silence those poor lover both hear he singing it seem not many street away i must be very ill dear say jenny o my love o my love theophil strive with himself to say word with a real ring of the future in they when this cloud should have pass away and for he sake jenny pretend to believe they yes this very week he would take she away to bright sky and healing air -- though jenny feel a little tired at the thought of rise any more from the bed to which she be grow curiously accustomed then there come a new doctor to see jenny he be a very clever specialist from a distant town but for he the business of death have not yet obscure its tragedy -- though word like tragedy be not often on he tongue consumption be a strong enough word for he he heart go out to that little household and when he see jenny it ache for that young man downstair it be more than a professional contempt for the general practitioner that make he silently curse what he call the death-doctor as he look at jenny jack of all disease and master of none two month ago a month he think as he listen and listen for a sound of hope that might come to he ear through jenny 's waste side -- even a month and i could have save she and yet as he talk to she he be not so sure after all he miss something in she voice it be the will to live have you have a shock at any time he say jenny be take by surprise for a moment -- the other doctor have ask she that too -- and she do not deny it so convincingly as she try to o that be all right say the doctor aloud to jenny and she mother who stand by though inwardly he say i see that be the reason and again he say i be afraid you must not get up just yet that chest of yours have to be take care of but you need not be anxious in a month or six week you 'll be all right again only a month or six week say jenny with a sink voice she mean -- be that all that be leave to she of life and love downstairs theophil stand wait with a beating heart he spring to the door and draw the doctor into he room the doctor lay a kind hand upon he arm and there be a look in he face that make theophil 's heart die within he you mean she be go to die he say with fearful calmness _ you mean that _ my poor fellow god know what i would give to deny it she -- be -- go -- to -- die -- _ to die _ it be impossible not jenny and between that exclamation and he first stunned cry it seem as though bell have be toll a thousand year it seem as though he have be sit there as in a cave since the beginning of time say over and over to himself jenny be go to die there be a decanter on the sideboard the doctor pour some spirit into a glass drink this he say theophil drink it raw as though it have be water and presently a certain illusive hope begin to stir like a opening rise in he brain and when the doctor have go he turn to that decanter again perhaps if he drink enough he would find that jenny be not to die after all at all event the spirit give he nerve which else he could not have find to go and sit by jenny once more it help he even to be gay so that jenny say to herself the doctor have not tell he that i be go to die the doctor say i shall be better in a month or six week she say aloud and try to look as though she be happy do not i say so dearie say old mr talbot whom curiously love make blind instead of prophet-sighted yes and then we 'll go together to those blue sky and that bright air say theophil yes dear say jenny close she eye wearily presently she open they again and say will not you read something to I theophil what shall i read dear something amusing love ` alice in the looking-glass ' eh it be such a long time since we read that do not you remember how once long ago we could never get the walrus and the carpenter out of we head so theophil read the hallowed nonsense once again strike with the fantastic incongruity of the moment even the die have to go on living and must be treat like live folk -- for a little while longer and though they be slip away slip away under you very eye there be merciful hour when you forget that they be die you read to they talk to they gossip about neighbor -- they be go to die and yet they be quite interested in mr smith 's new baby -- you laugh together over little joke in the newspaper and then suddenly the bell of you thought go toll : they be go to die -- have you forget they be go to die -- think there be so much to say before they go -- o think of it all -- miss nothing watch they face every moment of the day -- for soon you shall torture yourself in vain to remember just that curve of the mouth that droop of the chin ask they everything now -- tell they all -- delay not -- take farewell of that voice that laugh those live eye -- for they -- be go to die death be kind as long as he might be to jenny 's face so that for some day old mr talbot still fail to see he shadowy mark there but at last she know what jenny and theophil have both strive to hide from she and from each other my poor little girl my poor boy she say over and over to herself from that time but she do not cry or break down it be a pathetic sign of what be come that she now allow theophil sometimes to be jenny 's nurse through the night hour there be to be no bridal bed for these lover but thus the tender quiet hour of the night be theirs even in so sad a fashion one night in the haunt hushed middle of it the old mother have softly push open the door to ask if all go well and in a whisper theophil have assure she a night-light give a uncanny shadow-breeding light in the room jenny be sleep peacefully she tired ivory face with she dark elf-lock fall about it frame on the pillow theophil raise himself softly in he chair and look at she she would sleep some while yet then from sheer weariness -- grief 's best friend -- he too fall into a light sleep from this he be awaken with a start jenny be sit up and bend over he with she dark hair hang about she face and in that light there be something weird and unearthly about she as though she be already dead and have rise in she shroud something of a shiver go through he as she put she thin arm round he neck and clutch he in a sudden agony of longing all the strength of she poor little body seem to pass into that kiss so eager so convulsive jenny dear it will make you so ill lie down little girl -- and jenny fall back on she pillow exhaust and cough and with eye unearthly bright theophil she say suddenly in that startling way sick people have you know that i be go to die he could not answer he voice would have choke in sob he lean he head close to jenny and press she hand and in spite of himself two great tear fall upon jenny 's cheek but jenny be curiously calm there be almost a note of scolding in she voice as she say it be no use cry theophil -- it be get to be bear she be already grow strangely wise and a little remove from earth the first fear of she dark journey be pass as she be more and more sinking among the shadow in moment there seem to be something almost trivial in earthly grief but there be still one earthly joy one earthly pride of which she soul begin to conceive the desire it have come with the thought of she grave that one day take she less with fear than of a new home to which she would presently be go in she fancy she have see she name : _ jenny talbot the beloved daughter of john and jane talbot aged twenty-one year _ and it have strike she that the name be wrong talbot that be not she name this be not the legend of she day the world would be all wrong about she if it only read that in after day no she tomb could only bear one inscription -- and what sweetness amid all the bitterness of death there be to say it over and over again to herself : _ jenny londonderry the beloved wife of theophilus londonderry aged twenty-one year _ only twenty-one year -- she think of those who would perhaps some day stand and read those word and think what a sad little life -- and yet all that matter of life have be live in those short year aye in two of they and the violet breath of young love would come up to those who read from she young grave as it would never breathe from the earth of long-wed late-dying lover perhaps it be a beautiful chance for love to end like theirs they love have never grow old so it would remain forever young a spring sign a star in the front of love 's year for ever jenny speak she wish to theophil in the quiet of that night the wish have be in he heart too and the wish be presently fulfil bride have seldom be happier than jenny as she look on the wife 's ring that hung loose on she thin finger and bride have often be sadder death be come very near now so near that jenny begin to forget that she be go to die she forget too that she be marry to theophil and would sometimes babble she heart-breaking fancy of the little home that be so near now till sometimes theophil have to hurry away with he unbearable grief to some other room and jenny 's once rosy apple of a face make one 's heart ache to look on now it make one frighten too : it be so dark and witchlike so uncanny almost wicked so thin and full of inky shadow she would sit up in she bed a wizened little goblin and laugh a queer dry know laugh to herself -- a laugh like the scrape of reed in a solitary place a strange black weariness seem to be crush down she brow like the unwilling sleep of a strong narcotic she would begin a sentence and let it wither away unfinished and point sadly and almost humorously to she straight black hair clammy as the feather of a dead bird lie in the rain she hearing be strangely keen and yet she do not know be not to know how be one to talk to she -- talk of be well again and book and country walk when she have so plainly do with all these thing how bear it when she with a half-sad half-amused smile show she thin wrist how say that they would soon be strong and round again ugh she be already begin to be different from we already put off we body-sweet mortality and put on the fearful garment of death change from ruddy familiar humanity into a being of another element -- a element we dread as the fish dread the air soon we should not be able to talk to she soon she would have unlearnt all the sweet grammar of earth she be no longer jenny but a fearful symbol of mystery at which the flesh creep she be go to die it be a bitterly cold night toward the end of January when jenny die she have be curiously alert and restless all the afternoon once when theophil and she have be alone she beckon he with a grave significant gesture to she side she be lie down and she make as if she would sit up humor she theophil raise she and pack up the pillow at she back then with indescribable solemnity she take he face in she hand and kiss he do you love I theophil she say will you ever forget I i will love you for ever i will never forget you he take she gently in he arm and with terrible tenderness she hold he close to she for a moment and then sink back with a sigh for a moment he think she be dead but presently she revive though that be the last flicker of jenny 's conscious life towards evening she begin to take strange fancy which have to be humor she complain of intrude face in the room she call with dreadful peevishness to unseen people who would not leave she bedside and even sit at its foot then she forget they and imagine she be pick daisy on the counterpane then she beg theophil to go downstairs and see isabel it be a shame to keep she wait all that time by herself in the study and when theophil try to persuade she that isabel be not there she shake she head and say : you must not mind I theophil dear i be not unhappy about she now i be not a silly little girl any more i be a woman now ` look in my face and see ' then towards midnight a sudden accession of strength come to she and she say she would get up they try to dissuade she she grow angry and struggle so hard to rise that it seem best to humor she once more so wrapt round with blanket theophil lift she from the bed into a great chair by the fire then she ask to be take to look into she bottom drawer so they lift she across to it and open it she dabble with she hand aimlessly among its piteous treasure laugh low to herself suddenly a fit of cough take she and a great choke be in she throat she be see to be battle for she breath for a instant she draw herself up and lift she hand as though she would wave farewell smile a faint little smile at theophil make too as if she would speak then she fall back she whole body relax she have cease cough and a wonderful sweetness be steal over she face she have go all alone into the darkness and theophil be alone in the world chapter xxii the tryst lethean jenny have go into the darkness and she have go alone theophil have not go with she that he have remain behind mean certainly no selfish clinging to life and indeed there be a sense as be presently to appear in which very really he have keep young love 's old promise and die with jenny that he have not literally fulfil it be due to those physical condition of die of which in the hour of that promise young love be happily ignorant for the promise be usually make in moment of keenly conscious physical life die together be then figure perhaps as climb hand in hand the radiant topmost peak of life with a last splendid leap together into some immortal morning and such a marriage in death a last union of two life in some fiery consummation of die have be the lot of some lover supremely bless some indeed there be whose last earthly moment be a vivid reassertion of the glory and loveliness of life they drink the great cup to its last golden drain and by they death-bed we seem to be stand at the laughing fount of be they be radiant victorious even witty to the last when at one swoop of blackness they be extinguish like a light plunge into a stream but for other the cold mist that hang low by lethe 's bank have already bring forgetfulness before they foot grow icy with the first step into the dark water to meet on lethe-side be to meet maybe but with a sad unrecognising meeting to lie together in oblivion with sightless eye and dull heart and listless hand -- that be not love 's meaning and not only be the die thus drug out of knowledge before they die but those who stand near they grow drowse too by the fume of the poppy of death the die have forget the living be numb and foolish and in a dream all they love on earth be pass away beneath they very eye and they can not understand -- can not realize that this _ this _ be death except in moment of pierce agony day and week afterwards moment that be similarly soothe away again by that mysterious narcotic property which pain at its highest bring with it -lrb- pain at its highest be its own anesthetic -rrb- theophil never realize that jenny have die and least of all at the moment when she be die long after he remember how he have say to himself : there be jenny die die a few more seconds and she will be beyond the sound of you voice for ever call to she she can still perhaps hear you o my jenny my jenny louder louder -- hold she tighter tighter -- she be slip away o god she be slip away no love can hold she back my jenny my jenny and all the time he have be curiously calm almost unfeeling -- as one standing stupefy in the presence of fate the air seem full of bode sound echo of low thunder as from a distant world in the throe of portentous change and he tell himself mechanically that he should know the meaning of those sound some day he should wake up soon from this unnatural torpor of pain to a empty house of life through the cold hall of which he would seek in vain for jenny for evermore meanwhile he suddenly find himself stand with he back to the fire in the light study talk to mr moggridge who late as be the hour have call for news and have stay on from a perception that the young minister have best have some one to talk to as far into the morning as he would go on talk they be talk in a business-like way of zion and theophil be smoke cigarette after cigarette he be terribly clear-headed and bright-witted and mr moggridge look at he sometimes with a sort of fear it be about three in the morning when the door be softly open by mr talbot will you come now and see we little girl she say with a voice that could say no more theophil follow she and still in a dream he stand in jenny 's room grow strangely solemn and sweet since he be last there -- be it a thousand year ago and there be jenny lie asleep with a wonderful smile on she face she have a little gold chain round she neck and a white crysanthemum in the bosom of she night-gown and you think of some princess lie in enchanted sleep in a arabian night it seem so light a sleep and yet somehow so eternal you stept softly you speak low lest you should awaken she -- not carelessly shall one disturb that imperious slumber yes the distinction of death sit like a invisible crown upon jenny 's brow she be no longer little jenny but a mysterious princess upon whose sleep it be permit thus to gaze the pain which have fill these week with bitter human anguish have be the process of some mysterious ennoblement she have be find worthy to die in the peerage of god 's creature she have now outsoar those whom she love the nature of it be a mystery but no one could look on she face and doubt that a great honor have come to little jenny but o jenny may it be you gain indeed for the loss to we be greater than we can bear -- greater than we can bear not theophil only -- not young love that for all he smitten heart have somewhere hide away the potency of he unspent life and will still have he dream though sorrow itself should become that dream -- but this poor old mother all the force of she day spend the sap of she spirit dry up hers be the terrible sorrow of age with not a hope leave betwixt she and death pity she jenny -- speak one word to she hearken to she sob as she kneel by you side and can you not hear the hard cry of he heart that know no tear be you become as the god jenny that you still smile on at the sound of mortal tear will you not stretch out one of those fold hand to each and lead they away with you they be pray to follow you only to be with you wherever you be and it do seem as though in some strange way the soul of the mother have still some sure communication with the soul of she dead child motherhood have give she a nearness in the hour which no love of a lover could gain she alone speak to the dead girl as though she be still really alive as one speak to the deaf whom only one voice can reach but theophil be conscious in he wildest most heartbroken word that jenny could not hear they he talk to she as though she be a picture of herself and as one would implore a picture to answer we he symbolise the cry of he soul in cry that he know be vain yet though jenny be sculpture now theophil could not forget that this icy marble have once be the flesh he have love o god that little tender body whose every part be sweetly join together like the word of a song it be marble now ah jenny be you smile to think of what you and i know you and i and no one else in the world jenny we shall never forget never forget shall we and you will not breathe we secret even in heaven do you really hear I after all but be forbid to say be you glad somewhere to see how i love you and be you at this moment look into my face wildly for a sign as i into yours be it i who seem dead jenny and be you beat wildly at the gate of life to win back to I as i be beat at the gate of death but jenny we shall find each other _ must _ find each other some day i shall be so true jenny -- will you be true to I in heaven then would sweep across he soul a pitiless vista of the long cold year that lay between he and jenny he be not twenty-five through what a weary pilgrimage of useless year must he journey on before there be jenny 's face shine at the end how he envy the old woman whose sorrow be in this alone less cruel than he that she be already fifty year farther on the road to jenny perhaps another year or two and she would meet she to meet so soon -- be hardly to have part at all but why live those year have you forget that old promise be it too late to follow surely little jenny will not speed so swiftly from the earth she love but that you shall overtake she who know but she be flutter still at the gate of death put off the heavenward journey hour after hour in hope that the face she wait for will at last light up the dark portal -- i 'll take he hand and go with he to the deep well of light as unto a stream we will step down and bathe there in god 's sight but be this the way to find jenny the universe be so full of dark trap for lover ' foot to lie down cold as jenny by jenny 's side be that the way to find she when death 's gate open for jenny have theophil at that very instant hand in she hand eye fix upon she eye slip through too then surely they have be together but the door have close and whither on the other side jenny have already wander who could tell perhaps that be the very way to miss she when two have lose each other in a crowd it be best that one should stand still and await the other perhaps it be best for he to stand still here in life jenny would know where to seek he then -- and maybe the dead have mysterious way of bring news to the living he could wait a little while and see for a little he could live -- and listen chapter xxiii jenny 's lie in state but there be other besides those who stand so near who mourn jenny passer-by on the road of friendship who would miss she sunshine in the street and carry with they one bright think the less for that bright face that death have thus blow out there be especially some little people to whom death be as yet hardly even mysterious but be merely perplexing like many other grown-up thing in which they parent be interested these be the little scholar of jenny 's sunday-school class to whom simple jenny have be a personage quite a great lady full of gentleness to these jenny be teacher a name of gentle awe and to these teacher be as deeply dear as anyone can be to very young heart jenny have feel like a little mother to these little one and when she lay ill she thought would often go to they while from they would come tiny present to show how sorry they be that teacher be ill several time before she grow too ill jenny have have she favorite up in she room on Sunday evening to read bible story with she and have send they away happy with magnificent text-card that have hitherto be the arduously win reward of attention and the practice of such school-time virtue over many week now when they hear that teacher be dead they feel a vague sorrow they know that people who die be never see at school any more and that people always burst out cry when anyone die so they cry bitterly these little girl and the heart of one or two of they perhaps really ache for a little while one of they ask the new teacher if they would meet they old teacher in heaven and be tell yes if they be good girl -- which be something to be good for among the wreath that already fill jenny 's room with that pierce smell of lily which still cling there -- unless it be theophil 's fancy -- for many month afterwards be one send in loving memory by she sunday-school class and it be a part of that informal lying-in-state which be a involuntary recognition of the divine honor due to death that these little awestruck scholar should be take in three and fours to look at teacher for the last time this be the third day and jenny be already in she coffin the first bloom of death that light that linger awhile in the face like a sunset tranquil and bless a smile of immortal promise in the very moment of mortality have fade jenny 's face by this be really dead a mask of draw and sunken wax she seem now some fantastic doll some ghastly waxwork image of death such as we see carry on the stage in tragic play the reality of death have go with the come of its funereal trappings but the little girl who have to be lift up one by one to gaze with curious scared face into that harsh box deeper and deeper into which as through bed of flower and veil of gauze teacher be sink know nothing of these thought they look and wonder in hushed bewilderment and go they way it be evidently a occasion when child be to keep more than usually quiet -- and be it really teacher in that strange deep box it be rather meaningless but it be certainly very strange and solemn and you be allow to cry of the other who come to see jenny i shall not speak -- the vulgar sight-seer the creepy old woman connoisseur in beautiful death for whom a neighbor 's funeral be like a invitation to the grand opera but on whom perhaps one should not be too severe for even such coarse sensitiveness to a mystery be the crude beginning of the poetic the night before jenny be give back to the element theophil dream a dream and afterwards he like to think that he have dream it while jenny 's body be still in the house with he for then it might be interpret that she spirit be still there too wait for its final release from the clay which god have send she to animate for a while as a artist imprison a lovely thought in a vase of alabaster theophil dream that he and some friend be gay together in a room just before set out for a theater and as they laugh and talk there come a little tap on the wall so that they grow silent and listen then through the wall be hear a faint but glad little voice speak it be jenny 's voice i can hear you all she say you be off to the theater i wish i be go with you never mind we be not so far away from each other as you think i be only on the other side of a wall and theophil awake on a bright wintry morning with those word still it seem in the room i be only on the other side of a wall be it but the metaphor-making of dream which will so often take we forget speculation and dramatise they for we into reality or be it indeed a message a instinct which be unamenable to reason and which be perhaps only a desire tell he it be a message and it be no less a message though it be merely a pictorial symbol of a sense which be already he in the daytime of a new and very real nearness to jenny he have sleep right through that night out of sheer bodily weariness week of watch and anguish have worn he out and he never know that the poor old mother have lay a benediction on he sleep look in upon he as he sleep the only waking be in that house of sleep he will wake soon enough poor boy she have say as she go once more to watch till daylight by the side of the other sleeper o jenny jenny why do you leave I you be the apple of my eye my jenny what will you old mother do now that you be go so she sit and wail hour after hour and sometimes she would raise the dead girl from she coffin and press she to she bosom for though even jenny 's lover fear she now that cold unresponsive clay have no fear for jenny 's mother it be jenny still and though the old woman 's creed tell she that jenny be already a angel in heaven she heart belie she faith and she love make she a sadducee and yet it be she belief in a literal resurrection of the body that be sorely troubling she old soul during these last hour of watch for while jenny be still conscious of the come of death she have be much tortured by hideous churchyard fancy imagination of the darkness and noisomeness of the grave and she have wring from she mother the promise that she should first be cremate and she ash be afterward bury in the family tomb this be the promise which be lie heavy on the old woman 's heart to-night and though she reason tell she that the way of the flame and the way of the flower alike lead to dust yet the disintegration by fire seem to give she a sense of entire destruction such as the more desultory operation of the earth do not give if jenny must indeed pass right away the dainty architecture of she body so lovingly build be lay in ruin not by the fierce finger of fire should she be tear asunder but beneath the kind breath of the sun and the gentle tear of the rain might she change and change and on the wing of soft wind might she be carry to and fro in fragrance about the world and perhaps in the old christian 's mind there be a imagination of a mysterious recreation in the earth which when the dust have quite return to dust should begin anew the building of a incorruptible jenny lie prepared there like a new garment against the hour when the soul should seek anew its earthly vesture for the last great day thus strangely will imagination build its dream in defiance of imagination and in what different way will love argue with itself this way of the flame that bring such a terror to the poor mother be one of the great consolation of the lover and when at length on the morrow jenny be no longer to be seek in she room and the darkened house be once more fill with a empty light that be crueller than darkness it bring a sense of warmth to think that jenny be not lie stark and lonely out in that bitter churchyard where the grave be cover with sheet of snow and hang with hood of ice but that through the cleanse gate of flame she have pass into the eternal element and be already about the business of the dream spring and in other way this prove a consolation that never fail he it save he love from those cruel foulness of the grave which have haunt jenny that cleanse fire cleanse he fancy too however morbid he fancy might become _ desiderium _ could never take any but beautiful form jenny could never come to he in any fearful image of corruption nor could he picture she in any moulder shape of catacomb or charnel she have come like a sylph out of the air and she have return again whence she come she have move awhile about certain ever sacred room and as she move she have hum a little song which be she life she have touch certain object she have write she name in some book she have make little everlasting memory with she hand -- that be she history and now suddenly she have go she have come like a dream and she have go like a dream the invisible wind have for a while rock a flower and now the flower be go only its perfume remain no one as long as the world last could take up some crumble relic and give the lie to love 's divine answer to the dust say this be jenny no but sometimes when a bird sing in the stillness when the moon rise above the tree when a breath of secret violet cross one 's path one know not whence sometimes when the rain be sob at the window or the wind plain about the door sometimes when a unknown happiness fill the heart when a great deed have be do when a lovely word have be speak in season of music and in all high moment then can one say there listen _ that _ be jenny jenny be already a legend she be with the great lover theophil remain behind only to write she name across the high star then he too would pass through the gate of fire to she side as he lay down to rest that night he eye fall with a sudden sense of freshness upon the familiar botticellus 's mother and child which hang over he fireplace and a need that could never be fulfil awake in he soul if only jenny could have leave he a little child -- a little girl he have not seem so lonely then it be so he think yet perhaps jenny 's child would but have deepen he loneliness like a bird singing in a garden where we love walk long ago yet the cry be from he heart and the longing bring with it he first tear o jenny he sob if only you have leave I a little child chapter xxiv the beginning of the pilgrimage -- message from jenny if every inclination of he heart have not desire it too theophil would have go on live at 3 zion place for old mr talbot 's sake for now he be literally all she have leave in the world and what greater joy remain for either than just to sit close by the fire and talk of jenny 3 zion place be now a little chapel of memory where a bow ancient woman and a sad-faced young man keep up perpetual service to the holy dead a woman of she own year also acquaint with grief come to companion the old woman a sort of lay sister in this little monastery of grief it be so piety begin and thus piety be purest and tenderest in the worship of the dead everything in that house which have take the impress of jenny 's finger be jenny 's to use or handle remain exactly as and where jenny have place it they be as yet as fragrant of jenny as a fresh-gathered flower of its own perfume in a very real sense indeed jenny have not die or she be come to life again as she have never live before and it be no merely idealised jenny who be henceforward to fill up all she lover 's thought and speak to he in every sight and sound but just the human jenny with she fault and all on these -- such little fault -- theophil ever love to dwell they save jenny from become a abstraction a saint even those bitter little quarrel which all lover must suffer -- how sweet they seem now the old mother 's method be no doubt again different from she son-in-law 's she would never have admit that jenny have a fault such be the difference in reality between the new idealism and the old in such small matter as the minutiae of mourning that difference be again illustrated theophil could permit himself no outward insignia of sorrow which he could not wear for ever already he profession have clothe he in black and it be only for he that he black seem now to gain a deeper distinction but such ugly symbol of beautiful memory as that note-paper whose diminish edge of blackness be rather a cynical witness of a graduate forgetfulness be not for a real grief like he as if sorrow while it may and will change can ever end why in the world of faithful heart man and woman have not yet dry they tear for romeo and juliet theophil conceive this grief that have come to he as one more activity add to he life till life should end he know that it would not outcast joy but that it would live side by side with it that it must alternate with joy for it to go on live jenny 's death be not go to be less sad less a factor of the eternal tragedy at the end of a year -- that he might go to a theater once more as some widow joyously don color when the clock strike the end of a year of lose dance for it be not jenny alone that have die but it be a consolation to theophil in those hour of self-torture which be among the earliest and most cruel development of grief to realize how much of himself have die with she after all it be not merely the apathy of the first week that tell he this the sense of vacuity of uselessness in all thing but the sense that never leave he even when he have awaken to a activity he have never know before that nothing really matter however vigorously he might seem to act to the contrary since jenny have go it be with difficulty sometimes that he could take important issue with necessary seriousness for whatever the odds of life henceforward might be what be there worth gain now that jenny be lose could any energy or haste save jenny from die that have happen the worst have happen all the terror life have to appal the human spirit have be face in that moment when the doctor 's hand upon he shoulder have tell he jenny be to die he eye have look on the medusa-face of life that turn the bravest to stone and he be no longer vulnerable humanity on the battle-field of existence he bear a charmed life and sometimes as he move among he fellow he feel a certain sense of the unfairness of he advantage in this respect and pause to pity those who could still be so eager so tragically set upon this little issue the virulence of those enemy whom he be already make and who be to multiply as he activity awaken again seem particularly pathetic and he would smile in sad amusement at they quaint little effort to hurt he -lrb- no man be so strong for this world 's fight as he who have lay up he treasure in heaven and when the mystic condescend to the common trade of life he be a easy master -rrb- it mean so much to they so little to he he be a humbug he be a hypocrite he be not even a good speaker he be a ignoramus be he all right they might think so if they choose it hardly interested he he have be sit draw angel and somehow they irrelevant voice have break in upon he another be with I really even for jenny 's sake it seem hardly worth while to fight so poor a world be the fame that such a world could give a distinction one would seek for jenny would not jenny smile in heaven at the toy honor of such a world on the other hand there be something repellent to he once ambitious soul in the thought that such a world might seem to have the victory and therefore when the first numbness have leave he and the color and sound of thing be once more come back he throw himself with galvanic vitality into the work that lay to he hand and particularly into those political activity for which he gift of speech and he power of organization fit he two month after jenny 's death have speak at a great meeting on some momentous question of the hour he find himself the acknowledged leader of the radical rather forlorn hope in coalchester and before long invitation be come to he to help on the same hope in other town never in he life -- and he use often to meditate on the fact with wonder -- have he be so vital so efficient so brilliant he power have acquire a firmness a alertness a force of influence and attraction they have never possess before of a sudden he find himself mature a calm master of he gift yet those who sit near he at those meeting might have notice that as he sit down pale amid plaudit and cross he hand upon he knee and while he political colleague be compliment he to the audience on the mellow thunder of he political oratory he be smile furtively to himself it be all very funny be not it jenny he be say in he heart indeed it be hardly recognisable to himself as a fancy that whenever he speak jenny be somewhere in the audience sometimes a remote face might bear a chance resemblance to she and he would humor himself with the thought that that be jenny for with that self-consciousness which no modern mind can escape he find a certain sad pleasure sometimes in note the trick grief play with he loving and encouraging all its fancy -- if fancy indeed they be when at other time he try to think clearly to strip himself of the illusion as other would no doubt call they in which he now live he thinking rather confirm than disperse they and the more he ponder the more he fail to realize that jenny be dead the surer become he consciousness that she be nearer to he -lrb- a very part of he as it be -rrb- than she have ever be in the day when other could still hear she voice and note she presence in a room she very death have give he a paradoxical certitude of she immortality yet this recognition of she presence on some plane of spiritual apprehension be none the less consistent with a pierce sense of she loss on the plane where love once move in visible beauty that heavenly lover in he be able to give none of the comfort of its assurance to the earthly lover that the eye of the spirit could touch she bring no healing to the eye that at midnight would look up from the desk in theophil 's study to jenny 's empty chair no touch of she to the hand that be so idle and empty now yet there be little service these hand might still do for she there in she own little room she own book still stand in they place these could be take care of she little desk could still be keep as she have leave it with she pen lay down as she have last lay it there be note-paper and envelope and ink and blotting-paper all ready if some day by a miracle -- who could tell -- she might steal into that room and want to leave a message there should be fresh flower for she to find there too if she do come and that new edition of scott which be not finish issue when she go away she would find that complete when she come back she little collection of fairy book too -- she be sure to glance at that and then she would find two or three new one there finer than any of the old one alas so many beautiful book keep come out now that she have go yet somehow she might see they after all if they be take softly to that little room and lay on that table altar when it be quite sure that no one be look or listen the shy soul might steal out of the air and turn the page with a sigh just so some savage lover might bring gift of fruit and color bead and bright plumed bird to the grave of he dead love for the future anthropologist to draw he moral of the childishness of all human idealism one day as theophil have steal quietly into that room on some such votive errand a impulse have come to he to open the drawer of the desk there might be some message for he there any writing of the dead we have never read before be a message among various odds and end he come first upon one of those little tradesman 's account-book interleave with bad blotting-paper in which the housewife write she order week by week it be full of jenny 's writing and though the entry be merely weekly repetition of the same string of grocery : -- 2 lb of the best tea 6 lb loaf sugar 6 nutmeg and so on -- yet the hand be hers they make a record that could only be read through blind tear and one page which bear a severe little note to the effect that the tea have be far from good of late read almost like a personal revelation theophil kiss the page and replace the book take up another and he heart leap to find it be a little diary he hesitate for a moment it seem wrong to read it and yet he know that jenny 's soul hold nothing she would not have share with he and he be so hungry for a word from she though it be only a word out of the past the entry be not many nor long but it smite he heart to find how large a space he name he interest he success fill there the entry of honor be little heart-note of evening together especially happy there be two birthday still sing for joy and sometimes there be a say of he she have put down because it be so helpful or a poem she have copy out and also there be clever little criticism of book she have read and sometimes a wise little reflection of she own -- which bring home to he with a certain pang that the little child who have seem so dependent on he have be a independent personality after all as he come to the last entry he put the book down with a gesture of pain the last entry have be make the day after jenny have discover theophil 's love for isabel it be very brief just a sob : have realize that i be no fit wife for theophil and yet how i love he as theophil read this all that sad night come back to he with unbearable vividness and he feel once more a little sobbing body cry its heart out against he at that moment he would have endure century of torment just to have undo what could never be undo and a awful thought that he have not dare allow into the daylight of he mind suddenly spring hideous in full view of he stricken soul : the thought that however he might soothe its intolerable pain he it be who have -- kill jenny she seem to have have a shock a voice be say over and over again she seem to have have a shock a shock yes and isabel whom all this time he have keep thrust in the outer darkness of thought forbid he soul to breathe she name now spring into vivid light again in company with that think in that moment he feel to hate she and it be with a cruel mental oath he hurl she back again into the dark it be she _ she _ who have make he -- kill jenny but this be a think that either must kill he or be make endurable by some advocate of the stricken conscience and it be with no wish to deceive himself or to escape from he sin that theophil tell himself that this murder of a soul to which he plead guilty be indeed no wilful act but the accident of two tragically condition soul who have plan at they own agony a fate of happiest life for jenny yet the accuser urge be not theory of life which thus jeopardise the happiness of human soul theory which it be criminal to hold shall you try you new way to heaven at the risk of broken heart but a voice say -- be it jenny 's -- this poor theophil and isabel love by reason of no theory it be yours o ruling fate of man whatever you be who must support that accusation theophil and isabel loved by the compelling dispensation of the star they fight they destiny and have conquer it it be you ye star not they that kill jenny and this be true : but still the little figure sob at theophil 's side as again and again it would come and sob there till theophil 's own heart break -- that old death-crying of jenny 's broken heart chapter xxv jenny 's poste restante after jenny 's death two letter have come for she from isabel who have no knowledge of what have be happen to she friend of new zion there be something peculiarly sad about the letter that for a little time go on come for the dead perhaps nothing more simply bring home the fact that they be no longer with we even little bill circular offer new spring goods at sale price come charge with pathos and theophil smile at he own folly as he keep they all sad little _ poste restante _ will the letter ever be call for theophil do not open the letter but as day go by and no more come he sometimes find himself take they from they drawer and look at they isabel 's handwriting though he soul would not confess it to himself still hold the power of a rune over he heart have no traitor think ever whisper deep down in the darkness of he consciousness that the way be now open to isabel such thought indeed have come to he but unwelcomed involuntarily as those foul thought which will sometimes torture the pure or those base thought which may appal the noble the mind like the body have its foul humor which can only be accept with patience as a part of the inscrutable mechanism of human organism in moment of anger this filth and poison of the mind sometimes come to the surface to wrong we -- for it be not we it be in truth just all that we be not thus at time in theophil 's mind that be one prayer of faithful love for jenny the thought of isabel would steal like -- so he stern faithfulness picture it -- a fair devil in a church yet if he open one of those letter he know there would ascend from it a cloud of subtle incense which would well which he must never again breathe so he would replace they in they drawer and again some other day take they out once more perhaps after all it might be he duty the mere duty of a friend to open they what if isabel should be ill should be need he should be die but still the fanaticism of he sorrow conquer and still week after week they remain unread meanwhile isabel be live she life as she have live it before she have hear of new zion with the difference of a internal sense of completion which she love have bring need one say that she have she hour of loneliness and longing when she would have exchange a thousand year of love in heaven for a touch of theophil 's hand upon earth but these she know how to conquer and for most day that union of two separated heart remain to she as real as when it have be vow in those silent wood at the very moment when jenny be die and theophil have thrust isabel away into the furthest highest starlight of memory she be think how real they union be how near he seem chapter xxvi further concern theophil 's life after the death of jenny know the quick but little love much mention of the dead i hesitate further to continue that history of a grief of which nevertheless this book have now little heart or purpose to be other than the record and as what i shall write in this chapter must seem meaningless and wearisome to all but those who belong to the great secret society of sorrow it be no doubt just as well that those who have know nothing but joy should follow they natural impulse and leave it unread i confess too that i should feel the more comfortable without the regard of they happy ignorant eye sorrow be a mysticism and to talk of it to those who have never know the initiation of tear be like talk alchemy to a child sorrow too be a aristocracy and when theophil come to realize that as jenny have be find worthy to die he have be find worthy to suffer it seem to he almost vulgar only to have be happy happiness be such a materialist a creature of coarse taste and literal pleasure a _ bourgeois _ who have not yet attain the rank of a soul the influence of sorrow on the individual be much what the influence of christianity have be upon the world christianity no doubt have rob we of much -- but then it have give we sorrow it have take away the sun but it have bring we the star it be only in the starlight of sorrow that we become conscious of other world the sun flatter we own little world with the illusion of a transitory importance the star show it its place in the universe and teach it a nobler meaning for itself no consciousness of he gift have ever give theophil any such sense of he belong to the choose and dedicate minority of mankind as this initiation into the secret society of sorrow he have be choose to represent a sacred order he stand for no lesser interest than those of love and death though he be to represent coalchester in the house of common what honor be there in that to one already so mysteriously honor tear bring a strange new sight to the eye and a new perception both of grieving love make theophil see and love to see many thing in the world he have never notice before he eye be open to behold the many mourner who go about the street the widow who walk in darkness and all the shape of blackness move phantom-like through the color traffic not all true child of sorrow indeed though wear its habit but true or not symbol of the power and majesty of death in the world for the involuntary honor pay to death even by the ignorantly busy and happy he keep ever a grateful and a jealous eye and as some funeral _ cortge _ pass like a dream charon 's barge amid all the motley craft of merchandise and pleasure he would watch sternly to see if the fat and prosperous moment would do honor to the carriage of the king for a bow head or a doff hat he feel a personal gratitude and since jenny die he seem to be always meet that phantom procession in the street once as he pass along the high street he have notice a crowd round a die horse he stand with the crowd a moment and then go on he way in a hour 's time he repass the place and there be the dead horse lie solitary on the side of the street but he note with a curious gladness that some hand have cover it reverently with a horse-cloth so honor be death he muse to himself that even the humblest animal on which he shall have set he seal be hold sacred from the common day and shall not be gaze upon heedlessly by the passer-by this seem the greatest honor he have know pay to the king the fascination with which from this time death and all that related to or remotely suggest it absorb he be he reflect one day with a surprised recognition of the paradox no longer the fascination of hate or dread but almost love death the arch-enemy of joy the assassin of youth the murderer of jenny -- death have rob he of he life 's one treasure and here be he love he watch for he face listen for he step like a lover surely this be the strangest of conclusion but perhaps the explanation be very simple theophil love death because jenny have die as he would have love anything jenny have choose to do as he would have love life have jenny go on living by die jenny have make death beautiful and its gloomiest association be but so many allusion to jenny death be to theophil as a foreign land of which before he have only hear the name and hear it almost without interest as one hear listlessly of peru but now that jenny have go to peru the book of the world could not tell he enough about the new land where jenny have go and everyone who have friend there be at once he friend and every little dark-robed company gather sadly to godspeed some new emigrant to its distant shore be dear to he for jenny 's sake besides some of these might have hear from they friend there might have news to tell he of the dark land one would walk far would listen late for such precious tiding do such tiding ever come yes some have even see they loved one again shine strangely on the air why do jenny never come like that how he have pray and call to she for just one sign out of the silence one swift uplifting of the veil but none except that dream have ever come yet one could never be sure by what common unnoticed sight and sound the dead might fumblingly be strive to reach we in the deaf and dumb language of the dead perhaps it be they who lead we to passage in book we have never notice before pointed they finger to bright page of faith and leave we here and there many a message of hope we never dream have come from they or might it not happen that the dead like the living could be unfaithful : -- be death 's long kiss a richer kiss than mine be wont to be or have you go to some far bliss and straight forget I perhaps jenny already love another in heaven and he gift of faithfulness might some day be a burden to she this love of death be no mere morbid absorption it be but one of the activity of a faithfulness to which the tree about the temple have become dear as the temple 's self and he jealousy for those honor pay to death be only one expression of he eager watchfulness for the sign of human faithfulness not all unrewarded be that watch the world hold some faithful heart -- let we not ask how many -- lover of invisible face and voice hear no more man and woman who still share they joy and sorrow with unseen comrade and drink the cup of life as a sacrament of remembrance this share with the dead seem to theophil the essential of faithfulness -- faithfulness take many form sometimes maybe misrepresentative of itself and seldom perhaps inform its conventional externals a time will come in the profoundest grief when those ritual to which young grief be so eager to vow itself will grow lifeless and conventional the daily task of remembrance become as the tell bead of pattered prayer let the worshipper of relic beware lest he treasure some day turn on he hand to so much irksome lumber and true sorrow be thus humiliate no the service for the dead which be most likely to remain a vital offering of the heart be not the ceremonial sorrow of specially consecrate time and season but rather the simple longing in hour of joy that _ they _ could have be with we to think of we dead friend as always in they shroud be a way of remembrance which we shall not long have heart or even interest to follow it be only by take they to we feast keep up with they the same old human companionship that we may hope to keep the dead as friend a modern poet have write eight line which be of great comfort to theophil -- you go not to the headstone as aforetime every day and i who die i do not chide because dear friend you play but in you play think of he who once be kind and dear and if you see a beauteous thing just say : ` he be not here ' here it seem to theophil be the whole duty of faithfulness the dead know that if we remember they in we hour of joy they be indeed remembered and if they know anything at all they will understand the waywardness of sad heart better than sad heart understand themselves yet indeed save in the exercise of he faculty theophil have no joy to reproach himself with surely return spring with its terrible exuberance of warm life be no joy perhaps he have look on jenny lie dead with less anguish than he one day behold a apple-tree thick with blossom in the hot sun yes the world have the heart to go on to bud and build and sing -- though jenny be go and in that bright spring see horrible and useless age still hobble out into the beam what be life but one huge mephistophele laugh beneath the window of we dream that spring jame whalley persuade theophil to walk with he for a week of country lane far beyond coalchester let he talk of jenny all the time jenny have never be here if only jenny could have see that view jenny have never know that flower do he remember those verse from jame thomson : -- the chamber of the mansion of my heart in every one whereof thine image dwell be black with grief eternal for thy sake the inmost oratory of my soul wherein thou ever dwellest quick or dead be black with grief eternal for thy sake i kneel beside thee and i clasp the cross with eye for ever fix upon that face so beautiful and dreadful in its calm i kneel here patient as thou liest there as patient as a statue carve in stone of adoration and eternal grief while thou dost not awake i can not move and something tell I thou wilt never wake and i alive feel turn into stone strange joy of sad poetry for sad heart experience indeed be now divide for theophil into what jenny have not see or know and into what she have see and know and it be one of the trick of he grief as time go on to confuse the two sometimes he would think that jenny have be with he at a certain place or perhaps have read a certain book which on take thought he know she could never have see ally perhaps to this confusion be the fancy that possess he on certain day that he catch glimpse of jenny in little flitting figure of woman about the street a sudden poise of the head the way of do the hair a trick of walk -- just a flash and go again though sometimes he be haunt with more persistent resemblance which bring he a curious mixture of joy and pain and this perhaps be the place to record what only those acquaint with grief will understand and not all of those -- for grief have many contradictory fashion till he have love jenny woman have play little or no part in theophil 's life but with jenny 's death he find to he surprise that the idea of woman be strangely sweet to he he eye be draw after woman in the street and he find himself longing sometimes for some woman on whose shoulder he might lean he head and weep out he grief for jenny he love death because jenny have die be he to love woman because jenny have be a woman perhaps he foot have wander in dangerous path at this time have it not be for the restriction which he call lay upon he these however do not deny he the theater which it have be part of he program at new zion to advocate though there be seldom anything worth see at coalchester theater royal yet sometimes a good london company would call there on its provincial progress and it chance one day look into a shop window that theophil catch sight of a photograph of a woman that startle he with its remarkable resemblance to jenny it be the prima donna of a gaiety burlesque such be the strange shape jenny have for the moment take for the first time after she death theophil be at the theater that evening the bright light and the music pierce he as with sword once more he see that apple-tree thick with blossom in the hot sun yet he fancy find grim spell to lay the insolent ghost of life and death ever at he side whisper that all this light and music and dancing be for but a little while that those gay rouged face so confident in laugh beauty and all those nimble shape be to the eye that have look beyond life already stark in they coffin with chin-cloth about they nerveless jaw surely the lover would trip in the shroud that be plainly to be see from he foot to he lip like sudden snow on a summer meadow a white silence fall from he imagination across that fiddle jigging gleaming atmosphere and everywhere the dead sit around he watch in a trance strange antic of the grimace dead curiously in these mood he never think of himself as dead alas life be too cruel to release he so soon to death and jenny suddenly the theater spring back to life again with the entrance of the prima donna yes the resemblance be even greater than in the photograph she be a little taller and more heavily build than jenny and it be not jenny 's voice but for the rest she _ be _ jenny the fascination of watch she be terrible it seem impossible that one form could so mockingly resemble another and yet be so hopelessly someone else theophil could hardly bring himself to believe that the woman yonder with jenny 's eye and mouth and hair have never even hear of jenny 's name surely if he be to come and look into she face she would recognize he at once and the old common interest would rise to she lip as of old theophil go again to the theater the next night and again the next which be the last of the company 's stay in the town and the spell of the false florimel grow so strong upon he that at the close of the final performance he send up he card to the actress and presently as in a dream find himself stumble among scenery and dip under beam on he way to the actress 's room if she be only as like jenny close to he feel he must follow she to the end of the world and indeed the illusion still hold as he enter the little mirror room smell of powder and litter with lace and silk -- fancy little jenny here among the grease-paint and the bouquet it be only with the lack of recognition in the polite welcome the actress give he that the illusion begin to waver or be it only that jenny have forget he so possess have he be with the hallucination that he have not think what excuse he would have to make to the actress for he visit and it be with a embarrassing shock that the necessity of speech come to he when he have stumble through some mechanical word of salutation she look at he with a little air of bewilderment and motion to she attendant to leave they alone as the door close theophil have determine to tell she the simple truth i have to ask you pardon he begin for a very strange intrusion the reason of it be simply this you be so like someone i love who be dead that i feel i could not rest till i have speak to you i trust you will excuse I and try to understand yes you be terribly like she the story appeal to the actress 's instinct for romance and she enter into its spirit besides the young clergyman be very interesting to look at and the charm of sorrow be on he face a actress can hardly complain she answer of be take for someone else and though i do not know you i feel that you have do I a honor be i indeed so like she how strange it must seem to you it be very strange say theophil still fascinate then he tell this image of jenny the story of how jenny have die the tear come into the actress 's eye as he talk and it be as though jenny shed tear for jenny 's death poor little girl she say i be so sorry for you both but she continue presently you should both be very happy too -- for it would be worth while to suffer for so beautiful a love i feel happy she add half gaily even to resemble a woman who be so wonderfully love theophil linger on still fascinate till the actress suggest that he should walk with she to she hotel arrive there theophil to the possible scandalising of coalchester accept she invitation to a further chat over supper and when at last he be back at zion place he heart be aware of a new comfort and a new pain he have lean he head on a woman 's kind shoulder and she have let he talk and talk about jenny but she shoulder have be warm and it have be sweet to be near she a creature might forget to weep who bear thy comfort long and theophil go to sleep that night with the taste of honey upon he lip but with the morning there come to he remorseful misgiving and he tell himself that it have be one of the sophistry of the flesh a call of the sens take in vain the sacred name of jenny and then for he comfort he remember how the greatest of all lover dante have crave in like manner for the solace of a very pitiful lady very young and have be similarly remorseful on account of he momentary preoccupation with she take down he vita nuova he read : _ at length by the constant sight of this lady mine eye begin to be gladden overmuch with she company through which thing many time i have much unrest and rebuke myself as a base person : also many time i curse the unsteadfastness of mine eye and say to they inwardly : ` be not you grievous condition of weep wont one while to make other weep and will ye now forget this thing because a lady looketh upon you who so looketh merely in compassion of the grief ye then show for you own bless lady but what so ye can that do ye accursed eye many a time will i make you remember it for never till death dry you up should ye make a end of you weep _ ' moreover dante have marry gemma within a year of the death of beatrice and have even live so scandalously meanwhile as to bring down upon he the stern reproof of he friend guido calvancantus yet the world still regard he as the type of all faithful lover faithfulness be a attitude of the mind and all it touch turn to beatrice yet -- except by death we must not any way forget we lady who be go from we chapter xxvii isabel call if woman be thus henceforth to influence theophil why might not isabel the woman whom jenny have love be count amongst they isabel be the one woman in the whole world whom theophil 's faithfulness could not transform into jenny that it have be he fatal love for she that have bring jenny to she death he reason except in moment of self-injustice be robust enough to put aside there be excuse that we owe to ourselves and we have a right to expect justice even from we own conscience a sentimental conscience be the most tiresome of all altruist and wilfully to indulge in remorse that we have not justly incur be to blunt we conscience for real offence the best repentance for we sin be a clear-eyed recognition of they nature and the temptation in some flurry of feel to take on we shoulder the mistake of destiny with which we chance to have be involuntarily associate be one to be resist in the interest of that self-knowledge which be the beginning of self-development before we take the scourge in hand for we own shoulder let we be quite sure that we have sin there be hour particularly those hour of sudden wakefulness in the middle of the night when we mind lose they sense of proportion in which theophil agonise beyond endurance and as on that afternoon when he have find jenny 's diary say to himself with merciless reiteration she seem to have have a shock -- it be you who kill jenny these hour have to be support as we support hour of purely physical pain the morning bring a saner larger view the tragedy of jenny 's death be not to be so easily explain in it be implicate more August responsible cause it be part of a more general tragedy as the original instinct to blame himself and isabel be part of man 's ancient theological habit of make man the scapegoat of the universe but as the thought of isabel thus become bearable once more it become for that very reason a think the more faithfully to be resist it might become sweet it be sweet one day the casuistry of grief bring theophil the reflection that as isabel be the only woman he know whom jenny have know too and that as jenny have love she also she be thus destine for he even by jenny herself besides as he have realize no unfaithfulness to jenny in he love for isabel during jenny 's life there could equally be no unfaithfulness now that she be dead moreover if jenny still in some mysterious way keep watch over he life she would understand he heart as she could never have understand it when she be alive these thought bring deep sorrow to he for many day during which once more he rebuke himself as a base person but curiously enough in one who so despise the world and its opinion it be a apparently superficial consideration that be the mainstay of he faithfulness against these disloyal suggestion of a life that be thus reawaken in spite of himself there be moment when he could conceive he go to isabel and ask she to share he life with he but never could he endure the thought of she bearing that name which seem so inviolably jenny 's even though jenny have come to he in a dream and ask he to give she name to isabel there be still the world though jenny might understand the world would think he have forget jenny the minority of faithful heart would grow sadder by he seeming apostasy and the cynic would strengthen he pessimism by one more illustration of human inconstancy the world might hear that he be loving isabel in some aegean isle and still deem he faithful for grief be allow mistress but with a wife it be understand to die no so long as the world last no other woman should steal she name from jenny 's grave and this be a unassailable symbol here the vital principle of he faithfulness be entrench as in a impregnable fortress he would see isabel 's heart break ere she should bear jenny 's name yet while he make the vow he love for isabel be musical as spring within he soul and he dare to tell himself that in god 's sight he be still isabel 's as well as jenny 's thus it come about that one autumn day when isabel 's letter have lie unopened through spring and summer in one sudden impulse of mere desire he have open and read they -- not as jenny 's letter but as message for which he himself be hunger he have release the incense and as he kiss the dear write he momentarily forget that it be write to jenny and only remember that it have come from isabel in the snare of the incense he even accuse himself for have leave they unread so long and then to think that nearly six month have go by since the second letter have bring its half-playful reproach for forgetfulness ah jenny i be afraid you be a fickle little person after all how strange it seem to hear jenny talk to like that -- now yes of course jenny be dead jenny be dead and isabel be call be jenny lose she power in this intoxicating fragrance of isabel 's word -- as though for once the cross should lose its virtue in some subtle air of hellish sweetness o lily from jenny 's white coffin o little chrysanthemum that lay in she bosom o violet from jenny 's tomb pierce with you faithful breath this cloud of incense that be enwrap jenny 's lover alas the power of the dead be but the power of the ideal at once the strongest and the weakest force in the world -- a power indeed that prevail but which may in some moment be shatter by the frailest whisper of the real isabel be call and theophil be mad to go come back he might but go he must he would yes he be go there be only one possible way of spending that fever night -- in the train and it be in the train speeding on to london and to isabel he heart on fire he eager eye waste themselves on the fly darkness that theophil spend it purpose he have none only a desire -- just to see isabel again that immediate future be too effulgent for he to think of anything beyond it he would see isabel again from a distant starry name withdraw into the abyss of heaven she would turn again to woman and a wonderful nearness the thought of be once again in a little room together envelop he in a cloud of sweetness as though the train be pass through hide orchard isabel isabel do not you hear love 's wing beat towards you across the night have you not just awaken suddenly from you first sleep in the rosebush where you lie and say : surely out there across the silent wood and meadow where the night swallow london like a camp-fire a train a move street of light window be speed through the darkness and the dew and in one of those little travel room sit theophil with he eye fix on I be it jenny 's name that theophil be thus take to isabel no not jenny 's name never jenny 's name he be go to look on isabel again -- that be all perhaps he would die with the mere joy of see she again -- and then he would not need to think of the future yes the deep of he soul have want she as much as that it be about half-past six as he reach london and though it be impossible to call on she for some hour yet theophil drive straight to isabel 's little square shutter and still in the early-risen london morning he eye choose the second storey for hers and pick out two dainty window as she room he half expect to see the blind suddenly draw aside and she face a sleepy flower bloom through the curtain he linger awhile loving each individual brick of the house with he eye and then kiss he hand to the sleep window he rejoin he cab which he have leave at the street corner shy of awake the hushed square with its clatter he give isabel till ten o'clock which be perhaps hardly enough for a young london lady 's toilette and breakfast and then call a pleasant housemaid answer the bell and tell he that miss strange be away and be not expect till to-morrow here be a surprise he have never even think of that possibility beg leave to write miss strange a note he presently find himself in isabel 's room it be the same he eye have bless from the street so this be isabel 's room so evidently hers she very self isabel picture isabel wall-paper isabel chair isabel cushion isabel desk isabel book isabel bibelot isabel litter -- all isabel and there hang a arras portire over a doorway to the right of the fireplace that be she bedroom dare he peep in that be she little bed would the housemaid catch he if he slip in and leave a kiss on she pillow by the mirror be a grotesque little china monster with he mouth full of hat-pin he steal one for a memory over a chair lay a little dressing-jacket he take it up and kiss it then he sit down to write to she what a tidy methodical little desk everything in its place dear business-like sea-witch isabel here be she engagement book he must not begin read she letter after he first disappointment he be half-glad he would have to wait till to-morrow to see she -- for of course he would wait to have thus sit in she room be almost enough for a first meeting it be like steal upon she while she sleep then he begin a letter but as he write who be this suddenly stand at he side be it isabel noit be a little sobbing body quite near to he cry as if its heart would break oh jenny jenny -- god forgive I the spell be break the fit be over theophil leave no letter for isabel and no message and the same evening he be once more back in he little study in zion place wild with remorse o for the scourge and the fire but what penance shall avail to ease that poor little creature 's broken-hearted cry she seem to have have a shock -- she seem to have have a shock chapter xxviii back in zion place the shame of that wild unfaithfulness burn in theophil 's soul for many day it humiliate he like a physical degradation to have be so drunkenly untrue it be one of those shock to the moral nature from which it never quite recover and theophil 's face lose some of its steadfastness he walk some of its firmness for this perfidy towards jenny there be only one way to make the sense of it endurable and he throw himself into he work with a waste vehemence where be he ambition there be so much yet to do new zion have long since move and hum and whiz the neighbouring town have in a measure begin to dance to he piping but it must be a long while yet ere he name be to london and to the world what it be already to coalchester -- that mere microcosm of he fame and till london know he as well as coalchester there be no real monument to jenny london -- no longer the city of isabel -- must learn to say theophilus londonderry so naturally that it would some day serve as a unforgettable remembrance of jenny he must become a great man because a great name be the one shrine in which love 's memory may escape oblivion in the arm of he name jenny would then be carry down the year one woman-star save from the night of death again the world for which in one way he have so little care be to help he indirectly to keep he troth to jenny in a sense the mountain be already come to this young prophet for with the winter some of london 's finest spirit be now and again to be meet in that incongruous zion place as visit lecturer to new zion and each one as he come be impress as isabel have be on that old evening when she have discover she colony of surprise-people each realize in that gravely masterful young minister a power and a force of attraction which could not long remain hidden in that little country town meanwhile they visit enable he to test he own calibre by comparison with theirs and to realize that he instinct have not befooled he but that he too have be call to the stage of the great world it be in the operation of this method of invite the mountain that the french poet with a reference to whom we begin this history make he fantastic appearance in zion place it be to be fear that it be a conscious love of paradox that prompt a invitation from which indeed new zion must derive the most mystical of benefit and the most imaginary of delight but it be theophil 's whim to crown the renaissance in coalchester by this _ reductio ad absurdum _ the subtlest poetic art of france should come in person to coalchester and after day should tell that theophilus londonderry while still a young country minister have bid pari sing she loveliest siren-song in the musty little lecture-hall of new zion it be thus power bend the bow of the world till the end meet and shoot the arrow of he name among the star with the reawaken of he ambition theophil begin to realize that he work at new zion be near its end and that before long he must seek that larger stage yet all he heart remain in that dull little zion place and while jenny 's old mother live he could not conceive tear himself away could he indeed even bring himself to say good-bye to these mean little romantic street along which jenny have trip could he bear to think of the commonplace little house which jenny have transfigure to a shrine be desecrate with vulgar occupation if he could only raze it to the ground as a cup from which a queen have drunk be shatter lest it should be soil with usage of common lip some day he might have grow rich enough to buy it and set it apart for ever as a little house sacred to love and youth but meanwhile with what ugly and noisome presence would it have be defile he would stand in jenny 's room with its quiet book and flower and he heart would ache to think that some day harsh hand must noisily break in upon that sacred silence and strip it of all its delicate memory jenny 's room the lair of wild beast a nest of foulness and serpent sometimes he be thus haunt with the ghost of those who be to riot up and down these stair when jenny 's memory have quite die out of these wall like a fragrance of musk overborne with coarse odour yes in this perhaps be the rich most enviable of the poor that they can afford chapel for they memory and they house thus save from external taint from generation to generation become temple of which the very wall breathe nobleness whereas the very birthplace of genius itself become a butcher 's shop and though that genius be shakespeare and the old house be some day purify seventy time seven and garnish as you please the smell of slaughter beast will still cling about its room and the butcher insist upon immortality too jenny 's old mother be soon to turn into a memory also she have from time to time declare that she would not see another may and have indeed on one occasion name the day on which she would die with a curious precision as though she have see it written somewhere in a book or learn it from private or unimpeachable information latterly she have meet jenny twice in full daylight on the stair and it be evident that the old woman would soon complete that little family circle in paradise but she still keep about and whereas she old husband have grow sleepier as he end near she seem to be grow more active again fidgety and restless she sleep badly and return to she old habit of be first down in the morning and light the kitchen fire in spite of remonstrance indeed she might sometimes be hear up in the middle of the night make herself a cup of tea in the kitchen the kitchen have be she world and she be already begin to haunt it there it be one wintry morning they find she sit in the old arm-chair in which she husband have die and then they recall she word for she have die on the very day she have predict she know nothing of book this quaint old woman and have a very antiquated taste in wall-papers yet there would seem to be other way of be wise and it may indeed be hold that book act too much as insulator between we and the earth to the mysterious current of which gnarled shape of unlettered old man and woman may be the more sensitive as lie closer to the mother at all event old mr talbot do seem to have win certain confidence from life and death refuse to more consciously alert ear hers have be that hearing beyond listen to which secret be sometimes reveal she death be more of a loss to she son-in-law than he might have conceive for not only be she the last of jenny 's flesh and blood but she be the only one else in the world who miss jenny as he miss she other might through sympathy share he sorrow but she and he be partner in a actual loss something have definitely go from each jenny seem to be twice dead with the death of she mother and theophil 's loneliness suddenly become more absolute and cut off than ever before there be now no one leave who could involuntarily recall remembered word and trait of jenny and who would for they own sake want to sit down and talk of she all that be leave that really know jenny be the old house itself that remember and talk of she still in its dumb way and as he realize this he mood once more change he forget he aspiration toward a broader world and feel that not only would it be a sort of unfaithfulness to leave zion place but that to do so and to break up this familiar harmony of home this little cosmos of friendly furniture in accustomed relation -- picture hang so from time immemorial room dedicate to this use and no other -- would be to destroy the one mirror from which could come to he still glimpse of jenny 's living face in just that look of the room be the best portrait he possess of jenny though he have always be fond of mr moggridge it have not before occur to theophil to make of he a companion but about this time as mr moggridge would drop in of a evening to discuss church matter the young minister would be surprise to note how lonely he feel when he have go indeed mr moggridge possess that great undefinable gift of companionability what be need in a companion be not brilliance of conversation but the power to make you feel that you be not quite alone in the universe dog and even child possess this quality for some happily constitute individual but for other it be a necessity that the companion be a human be a human be the quieter the better if possible a rather large man diffuse a sense of warmth and safety with perhaps no other gift than kindliness and a pipe and sometimes you have the best of company and mr moggridge as we know have brain too and interesting instinct for new thing but he best gift be he humanity thus theophil encourage he evening call and contrived to prolong they though the two would often sit almost silent by the hour they pipe alone make a sort of conversation sometimes the young lion of the dawn would come to supper as in the old day as theophil call a year ago but supper be a poor thing without mr talbot pop in and out of the room though she have seem comparatively unimportant then -- not to speak of eager little jenny -- not to think of isabel yes the sparkle have go out of they meeting which begin to have a air of make-believe youth about they theophil 's interest be indeed centre in the purlieus of new zion but it be entirely retrospective and though outwardly new zion be more alive than ever it seem to he that activity which once start go on of itself and he realize that in he heart he care nothing for the work itself but only for the music to which it have once be set in motion incomplete as in one sense it be in another and more personal sense he life seem already complete and while in some mood he would dream of its resounding continuance in other he would sigh that it might end however for a while he would still go on live with the shadow he love and as he sit alone of a evening in that silent house he would sometimes half fancy that he hear the other occupant move about or walk overhead that be mrs talbot with a creak basket of clean linen on the stair and surely that be the opening and closing of a drawer in jenny 's room perhaps it be only mr talbot move he chair in the kitchen chapter xxix and suddenly the last have anyone tell theophil that in another six month he too would be a memory and that the future to which he look now with a sense of new world to be conquer now with a sense of weariness be suddenly to close down on he like a drop curtain he would have smile half sadly and half proudly no such good fortune for he sad heart no such miscarriage of he young life young life be so sure of its long lease all about it lie the broken dream the unfinished project of other but that _ its _ life-work should suddenly suffer the final interruption be not to be think of it will die if it please of its own choose it will despise life and coquette with death but to die unconsulted with not so much as will it please you honor to die to-morrow week be a indignity inconceivable to youth however visionary and devoted to the worship of the dead yet for quite simple reason as this mysterious world go it have be decide that theophil be for as brief a while as possible allow for the leisure of natural cause to support the life he think he hate even while jenny live fate mercifully foresee have will he a brief pilgrimage for on that night when jenny have lean over he with that terrible hunger of damp breath it have be write that of that kiss theophil should some day die and it be of that kiss that the follow may theophil all he plan lay aside engagement cancel on every hand eager life suddenly trap in this choke cul-de-sac be die death it be a outrage he be young he be powerful he would not die there be may at the window he too be full of may he would get up and go about he work he know he could if they would only let he it be the mere rebellion of unspent energy that crave to be use like the muscular vivacity of suddenly sever limb that still toss and twitch with hot life yet it inspire theophil one afternoon when he have be a fortnight or so in bed during a brief absence of he nurse to rise and dress and as by a miracle keep a appointment to speak at a neighbouring town where he have be promise for a great agitation on the home rule question surely it be a strange enough contradiction of a year ago when such meeting have seem such triviality in the thought of death now when they say he be die -- have this world grow suddenly so significant that he could rise from he death-bed to make one last appearance in the paltry list he speak with a overcoat button up to he throat and a tumbler of port wine at he side and as the audience look on he white hollow face and listen to he terrible eloquence they realize with a shudder that this be the last tragic effort of a die man alas the great world be not to be stamp with he image and superscription after all and only a little faithful company of friend would know that theophilus londonderry be a great man this escapade though it bring on death with double swiftness bring too a calm of satisfaction which make it easier to die and in the revulsion which it set up life once more shrink into the background and its little triumph grow paltry once more strange he half smile to himself that the man who be at last really go to jenny should even momentarily care about do anything else yes he be go to jenny so soon soon he would be on the other side of that wall soon be travel that strange highway on the other side of light and darkness in a few more week he _ he _ would there still be _ he _ anywhere in the universe jenny perhaps there have be no jenny all these month perhaps jenny stop be jenny forever in that last moment when she have try to wish he good-bye and all he daily consciousness of she presence all the fancy of he faithful heart have be idle as the word of a man talk in he sleep those little offering he have bring to she altar -- she have never see they for perhaps jenny have be a idol he have make out of air while he have be she lonely and unheeded worshipper be it really like that and in a few more week would he too be as a eye that have cease see a ear that have cease hearing for evermore all the wonderful color and sound of thing be these wane day to be he last poor opportunity to sit at the great show yes the world be slip like water between he hand -- and he might not be go to jenny after all as these thought begin to possess he another thought which he have so far resist grow more importunately plead -- the thought of isabel perhaps he be go to jenny but surely he be leave isabel have he he could not but ask himself immolate a warm living heart in a fanatical devotion to a heart long since senseless and cold have it not after all be a superstitious veneration towards a ideal of faithfulness which have be jenny 's rather than he own have he in he heart ever cease to love isabel and have he really believe that to love she too would have be unfaithfulness to jenny yes life be nearly over but it hold the possibility still of one supreme blessedness he might look into isabel 's eye again she have but to stand by he side and he poor remnant of life would grow radiant and round as the most complete and blissful destiny he heart tell he that if isabel could but once enter the room again and stay with he to the end however near he would die singing the song of magnificent life life be tragic do you say life be cruel life be a splendid portico -- to nothingness ah no not if in that portico you have stand for a moment loving and beloved by the side of isabel life be splendid life be kind life be abound deep-cupped and each minute of it be a prodigal eternity thus it be that one may morning isabel sit very still in she little room with a telegram just open on she lap the telegram run : jenny be dead and i be die theophil and this be the first message isabel have receive from she lover since they have part at coalchester station eighteen month ago she know nothing of theophil 's wild visit to she room for the housemaid have forget to mention he call and the strange and perhaps somewhat cruel silence could of course only mean one thing for she -- that jenny have divine they love and that for jenny 's happiness theophil have determine that they must never see each other again yet even so it could not have wrong jenny for he to have send so much in write word have he cease love she no that she could never believe they have _ meet _ too really for that and after all this silence be no more than they sad marriage-bond sad truly and a little tired these month have make isabel but they have have no power over she love that belong to the reality that could never change jenny be dead and i be die isabel keep say over to herself divine with love 's intuition something of jenny 's tragedy and something of theophil 's conflict during those silent month jenny be dead and i be die -- a sad a tragic message surely and yet as from the first shock and consequent turmoil of that message its real significance slowly evolve even isabel be perhaps surprise to find it rather a happy than a unhappy significance jenny be dead and theophil be die and yet when at last she shake herself out of she reverie she face be curiously light with peace she presently discover that there be a train north in two hour and then she turn to she desk and with that business-like carefulness with which we often act in a dream she go over its contents and methodically transfer its various accumulation to the tiny grate which be soon blaze with unwonted summer fire a little handful of letter she save and from the diminutive lock cupboard in the center she take out a small sealed packet which be to be include among she luggage all train do not separate there be also glad train which bring together and soon isabel be in one of these and soon it have take she to theophil -- to whose ear at last have come the sound of wonderful wheel in the dead street wheel that have stop beneath he window a rustle of alight a opening and shut of door a approach whisper on the staircase and then with reality unutterable -- isabel isabel you could hardly have tell that theophil be die and the face that isabel thus find again be mark by none of the dreadful writing of death he eye be brighter he brow more hollow he cheek thinner -- that be all and he be to be of those of whom we have speak whose flame of life burn brightly to the end no heavy mist of lethe hang about he bed till he last heartbeat he be to be conscious of the nearness of isabel for a fortnight he be thus to lie within sight and touch of she how good life be think of it a whole fortnight how extravagantly bless isabel be live in the same house with he day after day she be no visitor but go in and out of the room with the step of one who be at home if he grow weary and doze a moment she would still be sit there when he awake she be wear home thing one morning when she have be busy in the kitchen prepare some little delicacy for he she have leave she task for a moment to see if he need anything and as she have bent over he she have wear a household apron -- a wife 's apron yes she be at home she would never leave he again never leave he -- till he die oh isabel -- to die he moan one night as she sit by he side but think dear she answer with she head turn away think of jenny perhaps there _ be _ no jenny no jenny isabel 's heart give a little cry no jenny then there could be no harm theophil she say after a silence have you forget something we say to each other that day -- something we promise for answer he look at she with awed and suddenly enlighten eye do you mean that he ask you must not mean that do you think i could care any more for life she ask would you no he answer simply may i then he eye could alone answer he know she love too well to affect that there would be any loss to she in the life she would thus be leave but jenny if jenny be there she will understand now i can conceive no happier completer moment than that which follow for these two no more unassailable peace if they life be to be quite put out they would be extinguish together if they be to begin anew elsewhere they would begin anew together and meanwhile nothing that could happen could harm they could rob they of the desire of they heart at the worst they would attain they best at the very least they would win they most : they would die together to end together it matter not how few or many year love and the beloved live they day side by side even though they love be but the morning and the evening of one divine day so that there be no bereaved and lonely to-morrow the hour that take one and not the other take with it too all the accumulate happiness of all the year that hour these two be to escape yet be there no need of haste so long as they might they would sit together in the sun of life for a little longer they would say how wonderful life be -- for a little longer make sure of each other you eye isabel you hair isabel you dear mouth isabel a little longer shall we go to-night not yetperhaps to-morrow isabel but theophil be now very near death and he might forget if he linger on much more not wearily but with music and singing must they pass through the strange gate of death so at length one June evening isabel make for they one last little feast -- once more wine and great grape set out upon a little table at theophil 's bedside and on the table too be the little sealed packet isabel have take from the cupboard in she desk draw she chair close up to he pillow she pour out they wine and they drink it and eat the grape together -- no happier people in god 's strange world as the feast near its end isabel rise and stir the little fire into a blaze turn out the lamp so that the room be light only with the light from the fire then she refill they glass with wine and break the seal of the little white packet take from it a small bottle of green crystal the contents of which she mingle with the wine then she and theophil hold up they glass to each other let we go deeper into the wood she say softly how wonderful life have be say theophil and the two drink with they eye firm and sweet upon each other then isabel sit down again by theophil 's side and lean she head against he on the pillow she take he hand and the room become a heaven of silence whoso would say of these two life how sad let he consider the quality of he own happiness and whoso would regard the life of theophilus londonderry as a failure let he too consider the value of he own success end of the project gutenberg ebook of
