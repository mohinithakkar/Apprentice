editor _ to gertrude mccall chatelaine of mac manor -lrb- illustration -rrb- and discoverer of the sulphitic theory be you a bromide the term bromide and sulphite as apply to psychological rather than chemical analysis have already become among the _ illuminatus _ so widely adopt that these denomination now stand in considerable danger of be weaken in significance through a too careless use the adjective bromidic be at present adopt as a general vehicle a common carrier for the thoughtless damnation of the philistine the time have come to formulate authoritatively the precise scope of intellect which such distinction suggest and to define the shorthand of conversation which they use have make practicable the rapid spread of the theory travel from sulphite to sulphite like the spark of a pyrotechnic set-piece till the thinking world have be over-violently illuminate have obscure its genesis and divert attention from the simplicity and force of its fundamental principle -lrb- 1 -rrb- in this its progress have be like that of slang which gain in popularity must inevitably decrease in aptness and definiteness -lrb- footnote 1 : it be in April that i first hear of the theory from the chatelaine the follow August in venice a lady say to I : be not these old palace a great deal more sulphitic in they decay than they be originally during the renaissance -rrb- in attempt to solve the problem which for so long be the despair of philosopher i have make modest use of the word theory but to the sulphite this simple convincing comprehensive explanation be more it be a opinion even a belief if not a _ credo _ it be the _ crux _ by which society be test but as i shall proceed scientifically my conclusion will i trust effect rational proof of what be a _ a priori _ hypothesis \* \* \* \* \* the history of the origin of the theory be brief the chatelaine of a certain sugar plantation in louisiana in prepare a list of guest for she house-party discover in one of those explosive moment of inspiration that all people be easily divide into two fundamental group or family the sulphite and the bromide the revelation be apodictic convincing it make life a different thing it make society almost plausible so too it simplify human relationship and give the first hint of a method by which to adjust and equalize affinity the primary theorem spring quickly into she mind and such be they power they have attain almost the nature of axiom the discovery indeed be greater more far-reaching than she know for have undergo the test of philosophical analysis as well as of practical application it stand now a vital convincing interpretation of the mystery of human nature \* \* \* \* \* we have all try we hand at category philosophy be itself but a system of definition what then make the chatelaine 's theory remarkable when civilization have weary itself with distinction the attempt to classify one 's acquaintance be the common sport of the thinker from the fastidious who say : there be two kind of person -- those who like olive and those who do not to the fatuous immemorial lover who say : there be two kind of woman -- daisy and the other kind \* \* \* \* \* previous attempt less fantastic have have this fault in common : they category be susceptible of gradation -- extreme fuse one into the other what think person have not feel the need of some definite final absolute classification we speak of my kind and the other sort of those who understand of impossible and outsider some of these category have attain considerable vogue there be the bohemian versus the philistine the radical versus the conservative the interesting versus the bore and so on but always there be a shift population at the vague frontier -- the type intermingle and lose identity you philistine be the very one who say : this be liberty hall -- and one must drink beer whether one like it or not it be the conservative business man hard-headed stubborn who be convert by the mind-reader or the spiritualistic medium -- one extreme fly to the other it be the bear who at time unconsciously to himself amuse you to the point of repress laughter these term be fluent -- you friend have a way of escape from the label box into which you have put they they seem to defy you definition you order and genus fifteen minute ' consideration of the great sulphitic theory will as the patent medicine say convince one of its efficacy a bromide will never jump out of he box into that ticket sulphite \* \* \* \* \* so much comment have be make upon the terminology of this theory that it should be state frankly at the start that the word sulphite and bromide and they derivative sulphitic and bromidic be themselves so sulphitic that they be not susceptible of explanation in a word they be empirical although accidentally it might seem they do appeal and convince the most skeptical i myself balk at first at these inconsequent name i would have suggest the term gothic and classic to describe the fundamental type of mind but it take but a short conversation with the chatelaine to demonstrate the fact that the word be inevitable and the rapid increase in they use have prove they something more real than slang -- a acceptable and accept terminology swallow they whole therefore and you will be so much better for the dose that upon finish this thesis you will say why _ of course _ there be no other word possible let we therefore first proceed with a general statement of the theory and then develop some of its corollary it be comparatively easy to define the bromide let we consider he trait and then classify the sulphite by a mere process of exclusion \* \* \* \* \* in this we world the bromide constitute alas by far the larger group in this the type resemble the primary body or other system of classification such as the philistine the conservative the bore and so on _ ad nauseam _ the bromide do he thinking by syndicate he follow the main travel road he go with the crowd in a word they all think and talk alike -- one may predicate they opinion upon any give subject they follow custom and costume they obey the law of average they be intellectually all pea in the same conventional pod unenlightened prosaic living by rule and rote they have they hair cut every month and they mind keep regular office hour they habit of thought be all ready-made proper sober befitting the average man they worship dogma the bromide conform to everything sanction by the majority and may be depend upon to be trite banal and arbitrary so much have a mere name already do for we that we may say boldly and this be we first theorem : that all bromide be bromidic in every manifestation of they be but a better comprehension of the term and one which will perhaps remove the taint of malediction will be attain if we examine in detail a few essential bromidic tendency the adjective be use more in pity than in anger or disgust the bromide can not possibly help be bromidic -- though on the other hand he would not if he could \* \* \* \* \* the chief characteristic then seem to be a certain reflex psychological action of the bromidic brain this be evidence by the accept bromidic belief that each of the ordinary act of life be and necessarily must be accompany by its own especial remark or opinion it be a association of idea intensify in each generation by the continual correlation of certain group of brain cell it have become not only unnecessary for he to think but almost impossible so deeply these well-worn path of thought have become he intellectual process be automatic -- he train of thought can never get off the track \* \* \* \* \* a single illustration will suffice for analysis you have hear it often enough fie upon you if you have say it _ if you see that sunset paint in a picture you would never believe it would be possible _ \* \* \* \* \* it must be bear distinctly in mind that _ it be not merely because this remark be trite that it be bromidic _ it be because that with the bromide the remark be _ inevitable _ one expect it from he and one be never disappointed and moreover it be always offer by the bromide as a fresh new apt and rather clever thing to say he really believe no doubt that it be original -- it be at any rate neat as he indicate by he evident expectation of applause the remark follow upon the physical or mental stimulus as the night the day he can not then be true to any other impulse originality be inhibit in he since he great-grandmother 's time he have get the habit accept he irresponsibility and with all charity to he undeveloped personality we may note a few other example of he mental reflex the list be long but it would take a large encyclopedia to exhaust the subject the pastime recently come into vogue of collect bromidiom -lrb- 1 -rrb- be a pursuit by itself worthy enough of practice if one appreciate the subtlety of the game and do not merely collate hackneyed phrase irrespective of they true bromidic quality for we purpose in elucidate the thesis in hand however we need cull but a few specimen leave the list to be complete by the reader at he leisure -lrb- footnote 1 : for this apt and cleverly coin word i be indebted to mr frank o'malley of the new york sun who have be one of the most ardent and discriminate collector of bromidiom -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* if you both happen to know mr smith of des moines the bromide inevitably will say : _ this world be such a small place after all be not it _ the bromide never mention such a vulgar thing as a birth but _ the year baby come _ the bromide 's euphemism be the slang of she caste when she depart from she visit she say : _ i have have a perfectly charming time _ _ it be so good of you to have ask I _ _ now do come and see we _ and when she caller leave she mind spring with a snap to fasten the time-worn farewell : _ now you have find the way do come often _ and this piece of ancient cynicism have run through a thousand change : _ of course if you leave you umbrella at home it be sure to rain _ but comment to the sulphite be unnecessary these remark would all be in he index epurgatorius if one be necessary except in jest it would never even occur to he to use any of the follow remark : \* \* \* \* \* i _ i do not know much about art but i know what i like _ ii _ my mother be seventy year

they to eliminate the obvious from they conversation they have find for instance that green be restful to the eye and the fact go without say in a hint in a mere word they be aware that heat be more disagreeable when accompany by a high degree of humidity and do not put forth this axiom as a sensational discovery they have notice the coincidence know as mental telepathy usual in correspondence and have long cease to be more than mildly amuse at the occurrence of the phenomenon they do not speak in awe-struck voice of supernatural apparition for of all fiction the ghost story be most apt to be bromidic nor do they expect other to be impress by they strange dream any more than with they pathological symptom hypnotism they be convinced have attain the standing of a science whose rationale be pretty well understand and establish and the subject be no longer a afford subject for anecdote sulphite can even listen to tale of oriental magic miraculously-growing tree disappear boy and what-not without suggest that the audience be mesmerize above all the sulphite recognize as a principle that if a story be really funny it be probably untrue and he do not seek to give a adjuvant relish to it by dilate with verisimilitude upon the authenticity of the fact in the case but you bromide be impressive and assert i know the man that die the sulphite too have little need for euphemism he can speak of birth and death without metaphor but to the bromide all such matter of fact and fancy be perpetually picturesque and a discoverer he leap up and shout out enthusiastically that two and two be four and defend he statement with eloquent logic each scene each incident have its magic spell -- like the little woolly toy lamb he press the fact and _ ba -- ba _ the appropriate sentiment come forth do he have back in the shadow of he mind perhaps the ghost of a perception that the thing have be say before who can tell but if he do he vanity exorcise the spirit bromide seldom listen to one another they be content with talk for talk 's sake and so escape all chance of education it be this fact most likely which have endow the bromidiom with immortality never hear it seem always new appropriate clever no it be not so much the thing they say as the way they say they do you not recall the smug confident look the assurance of have say a particularly happy thing they come inevitably as the alarm clock when the hand of circumstance touch the hour the bromidic remark will surely go off \* \* \* \* \* but lest one make too much of this particular symptom let we consider a few other tendency the bromide have no surprise for you when you see one enter a room you must reconcile yourself to the inevitable no hope for flash of original thought no illuminating newer point of view no sulphitic flash of fancy -- the steady glow of bromidic conversation and action be all one can hope for he may be wise and good he may be love and respect -- but he live inland he put not forth to sea he be there when you want he always the same bromide also enjoy pathological symptom they be fond of describe sickness and death-bed scene he face swell up to twice its natural size they say in awed whisper they attend funeral with interest and scrutiny \* \* \* \* \* we be all bear with certain bromidic tendency and child be the greatest bromide in the world what boy of ten will wear a collar different from what he school-mate be all wear he must conform to the rule and custom of the majority or he suffer fearfully but if he have a sulphitic leaven in he soul adolescence free he from the tyrannical tradition of think in costume perhaps man still be more bromidic than woman a man have for choice a narrow range in garment -- for everyday wear at most but four coat three collar and two pair of shoe fewer woman become sulphite the confession be ungallant and painful but it must be make we have only to watch they to listen -- and to pity but stay if there be anything in heredity woman should be most sulphitic for of all bromide adam be the progenitor while eve be a sulphite from the first alice in wonderland however be the modern type -- a bromide amidst sulphite \* \* \* \* \* what then be a sulphite ah that be harder to define a sulphite be a person who do he own thinking he be a person who have surprise up he sleeve he be explosive one can never foresee what he will do except that it will be a direct and spontaneous manifestation of he own personality you can not tell they by the look sulphite come together like drop of mercury in this bromidic world unknown unsuspected group of they be scatter over the earth and we never know where we be go to meet they -- like firefly in summer like american in europe the bromide we have always with we predicate the obvious the sulphite appear uncalled \* \* \* \* \* but you must not jump to the conclusion that all sulphite be agreeable company this be no classification as of desirable and undesirable people the sulphite from he very nature must continually surprise you by a unexpected course of action he must explode you never know what he will say or do he be always sulphitic but as often impossible he will not bear you but he may shock you you find yourself watch he to see what be come next and it may be a subtle jest a paradox or a atrocious violation of etiquette \* \* \* \* \* all crank all reformer and most artist be sulphitic the insane asylum be full of sulphite they not only do ordinary thing in unusual way but they do unusual thing in ordinary way what be more intensely sulphitic than when you have say you farewell to go immediately or as you swim out to rescue a drown girl to keep you pipe burn all the while they do not attempt to entertain you but let you choose you own pastime when they present a gift it have either rhyme or reason to it they letter be not pass about to be read by the family \* \* \* \* \* hamlet be a sulphite polonius a bromide becky sharp be sulphitic amelium sedley bromidic so we might follow the line of cleavage between the two group in art religion and politics compare for instance president roosevelt with he predecessor in office -- the unexpected versus the sedate thermometer of public opinion compare bernard shaw with marie corellus -- one would swear that they very brain be differently color they epigram and platitude be merely the symptom of different method of think one need not consult one 's prejudice affection or taste -- the sulphitic theory explain without either condemn or approve the leopard can not change he spot \* \* \* \* \* but if along with these contrast we take for example lewi carroll as oppose to dr johnson we be bring up against a extraordinary inconsistency it be however only a apparent paradox -- beneath it lie a vital principle dr johnson be himself a sulphite of the sulphite but how intensely bromidic be he writings one yawn to think of they as for lewi carroll in he classic nonsense so sulphitic as often to be accuse by bromide of have a secret mean he private life be that of a bromide read he biography and learn the terror of he formal set entertainment to the little girl whom he patronize they know what to expect of he and he never however agreeably disappointed they no unfortunately a sulphite do not always produce sulphitic art how many writer we know who be more interesting than they work how many who be infinitely less so you professional humorist be usually a dull melancholy fellow in he private life -- and a clergyman may preach infant damnation and be a merry father at home \* \* \* \* \* such consideration point inevitably to the truth that we theory depend essentially not upon action or talk but upon the quality and rationale of think it be a question of potentiality rather than of dynamics it be the process of reasoning which concern we not its translation into conduct a man may be a devoted supporter of mr grundy and yet be a sulphite if he have in he own mind reach a original conclusion that society need she safeguard he may be the wildest-eyed of anarchist and yet bromidic if he have accept another 's reason and swallow the propaganda whole it will be doubtless through a misconception of this principle that the first schism in the sulphitic theory arise already the cult have become so important that a newer heretic sect threaten it these protestant can not believe that there be a definite line to be draw between sulphite and bromide and hold that one may partake of a dual nature all such logic be fatuous and found upon a misconception of the theory \* \* \* \* \* there be however a subtlety which have perhaps have something to do with confuse the neophyte it be this : sulphitism and bromidism be symbolically the two half of a circle and they extreme meet one may be so extremely bromidic that one become at a leap sulphitic and _ vice versa _ this may be easily illustrated \* \* \* \* \* miss herford 's inimitable monologue be each the apotheosis of some typical bromide -- a shopgirl a country dressmaker a bargain-hunter and so on -- become through she art intensely sulphitic they be excruciatingly funny just because she represent type so common that we recognize they instantly each express the crystallize thought of she particular bromidic group do then by a person who be herself a sulphite _ par excellence _ the result be droll one have say emerson but to remove a object from its environment and instantly it become comic \* \* \* \* \* the same thing be do less artistically every day upon the vaudeville stage we love to recognize type and what browning say of beauty : we be make so that we love first when we see they paint thing we have pass perhaps a hundred time nor care to see can be easily extend to we sense of humor in caricature a recent hit upon the variety stage do still more to illustrate the problem the cherry sister arouse immense curiosity by a act so bromidic as to be ridiculous be they rank amateur do they simple best or be they clever artist simulate the awkward crudeness of country girl that be the question in a word be they sulphite or bromide what such artist have do histrionically hillaire belloc have do exquisitely for literature in he story of manuel burden this tale affect to be a serious encomium upon a middle class british merchant show plainly that all satire be in its essence a sulphitic juggling with bromidic topic it be do unconsciously by many a simple rhymester whose verse be buy by sulphite and read with glee \* \* \* \* \* in the terminology of we theory we must therefore include two new term describe the variation of intensity of these two different state of mind the extreme meet at the point of nitro-bromidism and hypo-sulphitism respectively intensity of bromidism become then nitro-bromidism and we have see how through the artist 's or through a sulphite 's subtle point of view such nitro-bromide become immediately sulphitic by a similar reasoning a hypo-sulphite can at a step become bromidic the illustration most obvious be that of insanity we be not much amuse usually by the quaint mode of think exhibit by lunatic and madmen it can not be deny however that they process of thought be sulphitic indeed they be so wildly original so fanciful that we must denominate all such crazed brain hypo-sulphite such person be so surprising that they end by have no surprise leave for we we accept they mania and cease to regard it it in a word become bromidic so in they way be all crank and eccentric all whose set purpose be to astonish or to shock we end by be bore at they attitude and pose \* \* \* \* \* the sulphite have the true gothic spirit the bromide the impulse of the classic one wonder relish the impossible manifest himself in characteristic spontaneous way the other delight in rule and rhythm in order sequence in authority and precedent follow the law one carve the gargoyle and ogrillion working in path untread the other limit himself to harmonic ratio balanced composition and to predestined fenestration one have a grim _ naïf _ virile humor the other a dead even beauty one be hot the other cold the dark age be sulphitic -- there be wild deed then man explode the renaissance be essentially bromidic art dance in fetter man look back at the past for inspiration and chew the cud of greek thought for the sulphite fancy for the bromide imagination \* \* \* \* \* from the fifteenth century on however the wave of sulphitism rise steadily gradually drop at time into little depression of euphuistic manners and interval of sensibility but climb with the advance of science and the emancipation of think to a ideal -- the personal original interpretation of life the nineteenth century show curiously erratic variation of the curve from its beginning till 1815 sulphitism be upon the increase while from that year till 1870 there be a sickening drop to the veriest depths of bromidic thought then the bromide infested the earth with he black-walnut furniture he jig-saw and turning-lathe method of decoration he lincrusta-walton and press terracotta he chromo wax flower hoop skirt choker side whisker and pantalette go a horrific revival of mock modesty inspire by the die effort of the old formulate religious thought and then -- when steam have have its day impress its materialism upon the world make what should be hard easy and what should be easy hard -- come electricity -- a new science almost approach a spiritual force and with a rush the telephone that make the commonplace bristle with romance the curve of sulphitism arise a wave of oriental thought lift many to a curious idealism -- and as so many other century have do before there come to the nineteenth a _ fin de siècle _ glow that lift up the curve still higher the renaissance of thought come -- come the cult of simplicity and mission furniture -- corset be abandon -- the automobile free we from the earth -- the yellow book begin mr eddy appear radium be discover and appendicitis flourish \* \* \* \* \* so there be bromidic vegetable like cabbage and sulphitic one like garlic the distinction once understand apply to almost everything thinkable there be bromidic title to book and story and title sulphitic the something of somebody be at present the commonest bromidic form once as in the court of dinah shadd and the damnation of theron ware such a title be sulphitic but one can not pick up a magazine nowayear without come across the -- of -- as most magazine be edit for middle western bromide such title be inevitable i know of one with a million circulation which accept a story with the sulphitic title thin ice and change it to the bromidic word because other girl be free one of o henry 's first successful story and perhaps he best humorous tale have its title so change from cupid _ à la carte _ to a guthrie woo this be one of the few exception to the rule that a sulphitic thing can become bromidic time alone can accomplish this effect literature itself be either bromidic or sulphitic the dime novel and melodrama with hackneyed situation once provocative be so easily nitro-bromidic that they become sulphitic in burlesque and parody \* \* \* \* \* metaphysically sulphitism be easily explain by the theory of absolute age we have all see child who seem to be mentally with greater possibility of growth than they parent we see person who understand without experience it be as if they have live before it be as if they have a definite absolute age we recognize and feel sympathetic with those of we caste -- with those of the same age not in year but in wisdom now the standard of spiritual insight be the person of a thousand year of age he know the relative importance of thing and it might be say then that bromide be individual of less than five hundred year sulphite those who be over that age in some dim future incarnation perhaps the bromide will leap into sulphitic apprehension of existence it be the person who be absolutely young who say alas i never have a youth -- i do not understand what it be to be young and he who be absolutely old remark blithely oh dear i can not seem to grow up at all one be a bromide and the other a sulphite -- and this explanation illuminate the paradox \* \* \* \* \* the sulphite bring a fresh eye to life he see everything as if for the first time and not through the blue glass of convention as if he be a martian newly come to earth he see thing separate from they environment tradition precedent -- the dowager without she money the politician without he power the sage without he poverty he see man and woman for himself he prefer he own observation to any _ a priori _ theory of society he know how to work but he know too -lrb- what the bromide do never -rrb- how to play and he play with man and woman for the joy of life and he own particular game though he view he eccentric it be he own view and though you may avoid he you can never forget or ignore he \* \* \* \* \* and so too use a optical symbolism we may speak of the sulphite as be refractive -- every impression make upon he be split up into component ray of thought -- he see beauty humor pathos horror and sublimity the bromide be reflective and the object be throw back unchanged unanalyzed it be accept without interrogation the mirror bromidic mind give back only what it have take to use the phraseology of harvard and radcliffe the sulphite be connotative the bromide denotative \* \* \* \* \* but the theory be constructive rather than destructive it make for content and peace by this philosophy one see one 's friend reveal though the bromide will never say whether he prefer dark or white meat though he inflict upon you the word why if two hundred year ago people have be tell that you could talk through a wire they would have hang the prophet for witchcraft though he repeat the point of he story roll it over on he tongue seek for a second laugh though he say dinner be my best meal -- he can not help it you know he be a bromide and you expect no more \* \* \* \* \* you will notice also in discuss this theory with you friend that the bromide will take up with interest only the bromidic aspect of life the term will amuse he and never think that it should be apply to himself he will use the word bromide in season and out of it to the sulphite however sulphitism be a thing to be watch for cultivate and treasured he will search long for the needle in the haystack and leave the bromidiom to be observe by the careless thoughtless bromide and as the supreme test it may be remark that should button be put on the market bear the name bromide and sulphite in blue and red a few minute ' reflection will convince the sulphite that before long all the bromide would be wear the red sulphite button and all the sulphite the blue bromide such be the rationale of the perverse \* \* \* \* \* bromide we may love and even marry you own mother you sister you sweetheart may be bromidic but you be not less affectionate they be restful and soporific you may not have understand they before you hear of the sulphitic theory you be annoy at they dullness they dogma but with this white light illuminate they you accept they now for what they be and expect nothing original from they you find a new peace and a new joy in they society you may estimate you capacity for the comic say meredith -- and the statement might be apply as well to the bromidic -- by be able to detect the ridicule of they you love without love they less \* \* \* \* \* the bromide have no salt nor spice nor savor -- but he be the bread of society the veriest staff of life and if like little jack horner you can occasionally put in you thumb and pull out a sulphitic plum from you acquaintance be thankful for that too end of the project gutenberg ebook of be you a bromide by gelett
