upon she collar in succession than the thought of become mr bumstead 's bride lose the charm of its first wild novelty and become utterly ridiculous he be a man of command stature which he linen duster make appear still more long the dark circle around he eye would disappear in time and he have a abusive way of refer to woman which make he inexpressibly grand to woman as a true poet-soul but would it be safe would it be religiously right for a young girl not yet conscious of she own full power of annual monetary expenditure to blindly risk she necessary expense for life upon one whom the cost of a single import bonnet in the contingency of a general european war might plunge into inextricable pecuniary embarrassment possibly the general european war might not occur in a ordinary married-lifetime as france be no longer in a condition to menace england russium would be wary about provoke the new prussian giant and austrium and italy be not likely soon to forget they last military misadventure yet while all the great american journal have for the last twenty year publish daily editorial by young writer from the country to show that such a war could not possibly be avert longer than about the day after tomorrow would it be judicious for a young girl to marry as though that war be absolutely impossible no she woman 's heart sternly reiterate the pitilessly negative and as the ritualistic organist have plainly evince a earnest intention to let no foreign military complication prevent she marriage with he she feel that she only safety from he matrimonial violence must be seek in flight with whom though could she take refuge if she go to magnolia pendragon all she dearest schoolmate would say that they have always love she despite she great fault yet could not disguise from themselves that she seem at last to be fairly run after miss pendragon 's brother besides mr bumstead offend by the seeming want of confidence in he evince by she flight would probably take measure publicly to identify magnolia 's alpaca garment with the covering of he lose umbrella and thus direct new suspicion against a sister and brother already bother almost into hysteric during the last few week a attack of dyspepsia have lay the foundation of a mind in the flowerpot as it generally do in other young female american boarding-school thinker and she be now capable of that subtle line of reasoning which be the great commendation of she sex to a recognize perfect intellectual equality with man once decide by she apprehension of a general european war against marriage with j bumstead she take a rather irritable view of that too attractive devotional musician and infer from he not be wealthy enough to stand the test of possible transatlantic hostility that he must himself have kill edwin drood he umbrella it be well know have be present at that fatal christmas dinner and a thoughtless insult offer to it even by he nephew might have make a demon of he suppose that edwin upon return to the dining-room that night after he temporary exercise in the open air with montgomery pendragon have find he uncle flush with clove endeavor to force a social glass of lemon tea upon the umbrella under the impression that it be a person and have unthinkingly accuse he thereat of be momentarily unsettled in he faculty probably then hot word would have pass between they each tell the other that he would have a nice headache in the morning and find it impossible not to look very sleepy even if he fix he hair ever so elaborately blow might have follow : the uncle in he anger hew the nephew limb from limb with the carve knife from the table and subsequently carry away the remains to the pond and there cast they in suppose in he natural excitement the uncle have hurriedly use the umbrella open and hold downward to carry the remains in and after come home again and snatch a nap under the table have forget all about it and thus be ever since inconsolable for he alpaca loss as the young orphan argue thus exhaustively to herself the extreme probability of she supposition make she more and more frenzied to fly instantly beyond the reach of one who in the event of a general european war would not be a husband whom she head could approve after pen a hasty farewell note to miss carowther to the effect that urgent military reason oblige she to see she guardian at once flora lose no time in pack a small leather satchel for travel two bottle of hair oil a jar of glycerine one of cold cream two box of powder a package of extra back-hair a phial of belladonna a camel 's - hair brush for the eyebrow a rouge-saucer for pink the nail four flask of perfumery a depilatory in a small flagon and some tooth paste be the only article she could pause to collect for she precipitate escape and with they in the satchel on she arm and a bonnet and shawl hurriedly throw on she steal away down-stairs and thus from the house hasten to the roach house from whence start a omnibus for the ferry she be quickly rattle out of bumsteadville in a vehicle remarkable for the great number and variety of noise it could make when madden into motion by a span of equine rival in a immemorial walking-match now bonner she say to the driver take leave of he at the ferry-boat be sure and let miss carowther know that you see I safely off and that i be not a bit more tired than if i have walk all the way blush with pleasure at the imply compliment to he equipage from such lip the skilled horseman have not the heart to object to the wildly mutilate fragment of currency with which he fare have be pay and go back to where he steed be take turn in hold each other up as happy a man as ever lose money by the change in woman reach the city miss pott be promptly worship by a hackman of marked conversational power who whip in hand assure she that he carriage be widely celebrate under the title of the rock chair the old shoe and the glider on account of its incredible ease of motion and that owe to its exquisite abbreviation of travel to the emotion those who ride in it have actually be know to dispute that they have ride even half the distance for which they be charge do he know where mr dibble the lawyer live in nassau street near fulton if she mean lawyer dibble near fulton street in nassau next door but one to the second house below and directly opposite the building across the way there be just one span of buckskin horse in the city that could take a carriage build expressly for lady to that place as naturally as though it be a stable it be a place that he -- the hackman -- always associate with he own mother because he be so familiar with it in childhood and have often think of drive to it blindfold for a wager proud to learn that she guardian be so well know in the great city and delighted that she have meet a charioteer so minutely familiar with he house of business flora step readily into the providential hack which thereupon instantly begin rocking-chair-ing old-shoe-ing and glide any one of these celebrated process by itself might have be desirable but they indiscriminate and impetuous combination in the present case give the flowerpot a confused impression that she whole ride be a startling series of incessant sharp turn around obdurate street corner and keep she plunging about like a early young protestant toss in a romish blanket instinctively hold she satchel aloft to save its fragile contents from fracture she rock shoed and glide all over the interior of the vehicle without hope of gain breath enough for even one scream until nearly unconscious and with she bonnet drive half-way into she chignon she be help out by the hackman at she guardian 's door i be die she groan then please remember I in you will to the extent of two dollar return the hackman with much humor you be only a little sea-sick miss as often happen to people in humble circumstance when they ride in a kerridge for the first time still pant miss pott pay and discharge this friendly man and weariedly enter the building follow the sign up-stair to she guardian 's office after knock several time at the right door without reply she turn the knob and enter so softly that the venerable lawyer be not arouse from the slumber into which he have fall in he chair by the window with a copy of _ putnam 's magazine _ still grasp in he honest right hand good mr dibble sleep like a drugged person nor could the young girl awaken he until by a happy inspiration she have snatch away the monthly and cast it through the casement be i dream exclaim the aged man when thus suddenly rescue from he deadly lethargy at last be that you my dear or be you you late mother i be you ridiculously unhappy ward answer the flowerpot tremulously oh poor dear absurd eddy and you have come here all alone yes and to escape be marry to eddy 's perfectly hateful uncle who have the same as order I to become he utterly disgusted bride oh why be it why be it that i must be thus persecute by young man without property why be it that perfectly horrid madman on salary be allow to claim I as they own my dear cry the old lawyer lead she to a chair and strive to speak soothingly if mr bumstead desire to marry you he must indeed be insane such a man ought really to be confine he continue pacing thoughtfully up and down the room this must have be the idea that be already turn he brain when -- bless my soul -- he actually intimate first that i and then that mr simpson have kill he nephew he think now that i or magnolia pendragon may have do it -- the hateful creature say flora passionately i see i see assent mr dibble nodding when he have you in he head my dear he himself must clearly be out of it you shall stay here and take tea with I and then i will take you to french 's hotel for you accommodation during the night it be a sight to see he tenderly help she off with she bonnet and suggestive to hear he say that if a man could only take off he brain as easily as a woman hers what a relief it would be to he occasionally it be curious to see he peep into she bottle-filled satchel with a old man 's freedom and to hear he audibly wonder thereat whether after all man be any more addict than woman to the social glass when they want to put a better face on affair and after the waiter bring he toast and tea from a neighbor restaurant have bring a additional slice and cup for the guest it be pleasant to behold he smile across the office-table at that guest and encourage she to eat as much as she would if a member of he sex be not look it must be absurdly ridiculous to stay here all alone as you do sir observe flora but i be not always alone answer mr dibble my clerk mr bladam now take a vacation in the country be generally here though to be sure i may lose he before long he be turn literary how perfectly frightful say miss pott he have set up for a genius my child and be now engage upon a great american novel discontented with the law he be give great attention to this but free trade will not i be afraid allow any american publisher to bring it out free trade repeat flora yes my dear free trade that be while american publisher can steal foreign novel for nothing they be not go to pay anything for native fiction yawn behind she hand the flowerpot murmur something about free trade be positively absurd and she guardian go on : nevertheless mr bladam be go on-with he work which he call ` the amateur detective ' and if it ever do come out you shall have a copy -- but by the by add the lawyer suddenly you have not yet fully describe to I the interview in which poor mr edwin 's uncle offer to become you husband she give he a full history of the ritualistic organist 's handsome offer to she of he h and h add she own final decision in the matter as precipitate by the possibility of a general european war and mr dibble hear the whole with a air of studious attention although i have certainly no particular reason for befriend mr bumstead say he reflectively i shall take measure to keep he from you now come with I to french 's hotel to-morrow i will call there for you you know and then perhaps you may be take to see you friend miss pendragon have obtain for he ward a room in the hotel name and see she safely to its shelter the good old lawyer visit the bar-room

bundle of pun detain he so long that he find that he would not be able to reach the 11 be boat without he make unusual haste rush into the street therefore he hail a pass hack and order the driver to take he as quickly as possible to the plymouth rock when the carriage stop and the man open the door mr p rub he eye for he have fall into a doze on the way and spring hastily out but what a sight meet he gaze before he be the hack cover with mud and dust and the horse in a position indicate utter exhaustion : to he right lay a huge unsymmetrical stone while behind he roll the heave water of cape cod bay the man have mistake he direction and have drive he to john carver 's old plymouth rock in massachusett instead of jame fisk jr 's steamboat at pier 28 north river there be the rock yer honor say the man point to the mis-shapen stone and a awful time i have have a drivin ' yer honor to it how long have you be come here ask the astounded mr p nigh on to three day yer honor and i drive as fast as i could hopin ' to get back by the Sunday in time for the centhral park but i have to stop sometimes for feed and wather and it be no use I whippin ' up afther all for sorra the good they horse will be for the centhral park on the Sunday and how much do i owe you for all this ask mr p well sir say the man i will not charge you honor nothin ' for the feed and my victuals for i would have to have find they if yer have not a hire I and i 'll only charge ye three dollar a hour for sure yer honor never give I the least thruble slapeing there as swate as a infant all the time and that 'll be jist two hundred and four dollar and if yet honor could give I a thrifle besides to drink yer health i would be oblige to yer honor mr p gaze alternately at the man the carriage the horse and the rock and then he pay the driver two hundred and four dollar and twenty-five cent the worthy milesian pocket the money and declare he intention of proceed to boston which be only about forty mile away and take the railroad for new york if i do not ye see yer honor i 'll never get back in time for the Sunday and the horse will be restin ' in the car as the man make he preparation and depart mr p stand and watch he until he slowly fade out of sight when he have entirely disappear mr p sit down upon the rock and reflect now that he be here what have he best do he have never see the rock before and as it strike he that possibly some of he patron might be in the same unfortunate condition he conclude that he would take a few sketch of it for they benefit but he do not succeed very well the first drawing he make have a strange appearance it look more like a old woman tie to a post and surround by what seem to be flame than anything else this surely be not a correct view of this famous rock and so mr p commence another sketch this however look so much like a man with a broad-brimmed hat hanging by he neck to a rope that he conclude to try again he next sketch bear a striking resemblance to something that certainly do not seem like a rock but which after some deliberation he find to look very much like a shrink southern negro force into the rank to supply the place of a citizen of massachusett everybody might not be able to see this but mr p think he perceive it plainly the last sketch make by mr p somewhat resemble one whose connection with the plymouth rock have certainly be of more practical benefit to the public than that of any of the old founder or anybody else -- at least so far as mr p can see if any one doubt this let he ask general grant now should he reader see anything at all suggestive of sober and beneficial reflection in these sketch mr p 's visit to plymouth rock be not make in vain \* \* \* \* \* a letter from l n dear punchinello : the

peccadillo such as the theft of a pig or a sheep or even a watch or a purse unless it contain a large amount and be take under the most aggravating circumstance from ourselves a robbery of a bank of a million when it happen to affect hundred of people or a midnight murder execute with the malignancy of a fiend will sometimes stir up the public for a few day but even that soon pass out of mind and society settle back into its imperturbable apathy retreat with each wave of excitement still further and become by degree proof against be stir by anything that do not affect ourselves personally not so however in those day of arcadian simplicity for the astounding temerity of the piper 's son in lay felonious hand on the property of the village butcher or baker cause a excitement second only to a hanging or a first-class sensational horror of later day poor tom be a deal to be pity as well as blame for although he be the one who commit the crime he be not the only one who reap a benefit therefrom but the traditional historian tell we he be the only one who be punish therefor so while we blame he let we shed a tear of sympathy because he alone get the beat the other the eat the scene be graphically describe thusly -- tom tom the piper 's son steal a pig and away he run here we see tom the good-for-nothing standing idly around listen to the witching strain of he father 's bagpipe play by the industrious musician before the door of the well-to-do villager with the laudable view of obtain the wherewith to purchase the meat that both might eat and while the instrument that have well serve its day and generation be groan and wheeze under the pressure bring to bear upon it tom 's eye rove around from window to door happen to light on a beautiful sucking-pig that repose in all the innocent beauty of baby pighood before the open door of a zealous stickler for human rights alas tom be not acquaint with the gentlemanly owner of the fascinating pig and he do not know how strong he principle be nor how far he will go to maintain they he gaze enrapture upon the dainty porker and as he look the desire to own just such a one grow upon he and soon it become a determination to own that identical one for never another could equal that he look stealthily around and find the eye of all be fix upon the musician and he bagpipe no one notice he and hail it as a happy omen he pounce upon the coveted quadruped grasp it tightly in he hand and skedaddle the music be end and the crowd disperse the absence of piggy be unnoticed till the red-headed urchin whose playmate it be look around for the loved companion of he childish sport and find it not great research amid loud outcry be make result only in the conviction that the pet of the family be go leave no trace behind tom with he prize exultingly hurry homeward he heart swell with joy at he luck like a dutiful son he rush to the arm of he maternal parent and deposit in she capacious lap the dainty prize vision of a luscious supper float through the mind of the female piperess as she bestow she motherly benediction upon she thoughtful son and proceed to put into execution the well-conned lesson of cook a suck pig have accomplish the first get you pig part the rest come easy and at night when the old piper return he olfactory be saint with a odor that startle he from he generally despondent mood and awaken he curiosity as to the cause of such a unusual flavor from he usually flavorless abode he enter and find a smile wife and son with a smoking pig await he come what next occur the poet tell we in the laconic word the pig be eat there be no necessity for describe the way of eat the fact be enough but alas there be always a dark side to everything and this happy family be no exception the bone be leave they could not eat they and they do not own a dog so they pick they clean and throw they away but murder will out and the tiny bone tell they own tale the village detective soon couple the foot of the miss pig with the unusual occurrence of a heap of bone before the door of the musician 's abode and by a process of reasoning unknown to the detective of the present day decide that those bone be a pig 's bone -- a steal pig 's bone from the fact that the piper do not earn enough to indulge in such luxury as sucking-pig now who steal the sucking-pig clearly not madame piper for she be too fat and heavy to have any light-fingered proclivity clearly not the piper himself for he be play he bagpipe and could prove a alibi there be no one left but tom circumstance point he out : he love

prepare to do this to-day in a happy and congratulatory frame of mind i have have breakfast this morning when i say this i mean that i have have this morning 's breakfast this morning any one who have achieve so remarkable a success at this place can safely plume himself on he patience and physical endurance for instance this morning for the first time i order broiled spring chicken the waiter give I a disconsolate look and proceed to gird up he loin with a base ball belt in a few moment he dash past the window in hot pursuit of a fowl of venerable appearance but of a style of go that would have put to shame any ostrich that dr livingstone ever see i ask the head waiter if he call that a _ spring chicken _ he say he guess that chicken could out-spring any chicken in the place this clear up another great hotel mystery the man outflank this gentle birdling on the eighth time round in 623 which be consider very good indeed and beat the time of the late harvard and yale foul considerably i say outflank because it be not the intention of these sunny amendment to put a end to these feathery dexter immediately but to drive they into the ten-pin alley where they be leisurely bowl to a untimely end as however pony ball be generally use and there be always half a dozen darky stand around ready to bet that the chicken will not be kill in forty ball or sixty as the case may be this part of the process be rather tedious to the guest sometimes when the chicken be not very active there be not more than nine or ten-pin feather leave well the next place the boat stop at be call sabbath day point in consequence of abercrombie have land there on a Wednesday morning its name will therefore be consider a joke by such as see the point a gentleman on board inform I that the water be so clear at this place that one could see object when thirty foot from the bottom i have think and think over this remark but be unable to see what one 's distance from the bottom have to do with he see object i give it up on the opposite side of the lake be a hill call sugar loaf mountain -- because it be a sweet place for loafer i suppose finally we pass roger ' slide which be a rocky precipice three hundred foot high sloping nearly perpendicularly into the water a decidedly unpleasant-looking place for cellar-door practice there be a great many romantic tradition about this same roger who be regard by the simple native as have be a altogether high-minded and gorgeous character -- the fact be that he be one of those unmitigated old scamp who owe to the accident of have live in revolutionary time the distinction of be hold up to the emulation of primary school as a patriot hero literally he be simply a unmixed evil fight only to steal something and devote what time and talent he could spare from he legitimate profession -- which be _ seven-up _ -- to generally bedevil and encroach upon the neighbor indian as a enchroachist he be immense the noble red-skin allude to finally conclude that enough be enough and appoint a special commission to put a permanent end to the delicate attention of the marked back this _ sobriquet _ they confer upon he partly on account of the fact that he usually receive he wound while leave they immediate vicinity and partly because of a peculiar characteristic of the kind of card he use the commissioner catch roger out hunting and chase he until he come to this precipice down which he slide into the lake below and unfortunately escape unharmed the indian who be pursue he by the imprint of he snow-shoe soon arrive at the brink see what have occur they conclude to let he slide hence the name evidently they think from the trail that he must have go over though he be by no mean a missionary the track he have leave produce a profound impression on they untutored mind they at once conclude that he be drowned or have get in with some bad spirit it be obvious however to the most casual observer of the place that the reverse must have be the case the bad spirit be in he the mark worn by mr r 's cheviot in he descent can still be distinctly see about half way up be a shine object which be generally believe to be a suspender button this however be merely conjectural the clerk of the boat of whom i have speak before tell I that until within a few year back the hole in the water where roger strike could be see but it be all go now he say shake he head sadly nothing can escape the vandal horde of tourist and relic hunter piece by piece they have carry the hole away and there be no trace of it leave now and he weep at my tranquillity at the north end of the lake we take stage for fort ticonderoga these vehicle be run by a man who be point out as a character which mean a sort of licensed nuisance the monomania of this individual be speech making and much reflection incline I to the belief that he be some unappreciated politician who have invent a way of take it out on the unhappy public as follow : he wait until he five immense stage arrive at some remote and solitary part of the road then draw they up in a semi-circle mount a stump and -- on pretence of exhibit the beauty of nature -- proceed to harangue the helpless fare to the top of he very high bent or until one of the slumbering outside create a welcome diversion by fall off and break he neck we come to what be really a curiosity --
