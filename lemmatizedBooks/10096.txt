dlitt regius professor of greek in the university of oxford 1915 the trojan woman in he clear preface gilbert murray say with truth that _ the trojan woman _ value by the usage of the stage be not a perfect play it be only the cry of one of the great wrong of the world work into music yet it be one of the greater drama of the elder world in one situation with little movement with few figure it flash out a great dramatic lesson the infinite pathos of a successful wrong it have in it the very soul of the tragic it even go beyond the limited tragic and hint that beyond the defeat may come a greater glory than will be the fortune of the victor and thus through its pity and terror it purify we soul to thought of peace great art have no limit of locality or time its tiding be timeless and its message be universal _ the trojan woman _ be first perform in 415 bc from a story of the siege of troy which even then be ancient history but the pathos of it be as modern to we as it be to the athenian the terror of war have not change in three thousand year euripide have that to say of war which we have to say of it to-day and have learn that which we be even now learn that when most triumphant it bring as much wretchedness to the victor as to the vanquish in this play the great conquest seem to be a great joy and be in truth a great misery the tragedy of war have in no essential altered the god poseidon mourn over troy as he might over the city of to-day when he cry : how be ye blind ye treader down of city ye that cast temple to desolation and lay waste tomb the untrodden sanctuary where lie the ancient dead yourselve so soon to die to the city of this present day might the prophetess cassandra speak she message : would ye be wise ye city fly from war yet if war come there be a crown in death for she that striveth well and perisheth unstained : to die in evil be the stain a throb of human sympathy as if with one of we sister of to-day come to we at the end when the city be destroy and its queen would throw herself live into its flame to be of the action of this play the imagination need not to travel back over three thousand year of history it can simply leap a thousand league of ocean if ever war be to be end the imagination of man must end they to the common mind in spite of all its horror there be still something glorious in war preacher have preach against it in vain economist have argue against its wastefulness in vain the imagination of a great poet alone can finally show to the imagination of the world that even the glory of war be a empty delusion euripide show we as the center of he drama woman batter and break by inconceivable torture -- the widow hecuba andromache with she child dash to death cassandra ravish and make mad -- yet do he show that theirs be the unconquered and unconquerable spirit the victorious man flush with pride have remorse and mockery deal out to they by those they fight for and go forth to unpitied death never surely can a great tragedy seem more real to we or purge we soul more truly of the unreality of we thought and feeling concern vital issue than can the trojan woman at this moment of the history of the world franci hovey stoddard _ may the first 1915 _ introductory note judge by common standard the troädes be far from a perfect play it be scarcely even a good play it be a intense study of one great situation with little plot little construction little or no relief or variety the only movement of the drama be a gradual extinguishing of all the familiar light of human life with perhaps at the end a suggestion that in the utterness of night when all fear of a possible worse thing be pass there be in some sense peace and even glory but the situation itself have at least this dramatic value that it be different from what it seem the consummation of a great conquest a thing celebrate in paean and thanksgiving the very height of the day-dream of unregenerate man -- it seem to be a great joy and it be in truth a great misery it be conquest see when the thrill of battle be over and nothing remain but to wait and think we feel in the background the presence of the conqueror sinister and disappointed phantom of the conquer man after long torment now rest in death but the living drama for euripide lay in the conquer woman it be from they that he have name he play and build up he scheme of part : four figure clearly light and heroic the other in vary grade of characterisation nameless and barely articulate mere half-heard voice of a eternal sorrow indeed the most usual condemnation of the play be not that it be dull but that it be too harrowing that scene after scene pass beyond the due limit of tragic art there be point to be plead against this criticism the very beauty of the most fearful scene in spite of they fearfulness be one the quick comfort of the lyric be another fall like a spell of peace when the strain be too hard to bear -lrb- cf p 89 -rrb- but the main defense be that like many of the greatest work of art the _ troädes _ be something more than art it be also a prophecy a bearing of witness and the prophet bind to deliver he message walk outside the regular way of the artist for some time before the _ troädes _ be produce athen now entirely in the hand of the war party have be engage in a enterprise which though on military grounds defensible be bitterly resent by the more humane minority and have be select by thucydide as the great crucial crime of the war she have succeed in compelling the neutral dorian island of mêlos to take up arm against she and after a long siege have conquer the quiet and immemorially ancient town massacre the man and sell the woman and child into slavery mêlos fall in the autumn of 416 bc the _ troädes _ be produce in the follow spring and while the god of the prologue be prophesy destruction at sea for the sacker of troy the fleet of the sacker of mêlos flush with conquest and mark by a slight but unforgettable taint of sacrilege be actually prepare to set sail for its fatal enterprise against sicily not of course that we have in the _ troädes _ a case of political allusion far from it euripide do not mean mêlos when he say troy nor mean alcibiade ' fleet when he speak of agamemnon 's but he write under the influence of a year which to he as to thucydide have be fill full of indignant pity and of dire foreboding this tragedy be perhaps in european literature the first great expression of the spirit of pity for mankind exalt into a move principle a principle which have make the most precious and possibly the most destructive element of innumerable rebellion revolution and martyrdom and of at least two great religion pity be a rebel passion its hand be against the strong against the organised force of society against conventional sanction and accept god it be the kingdom of heaven within we fight against the brute power of the world and it be apt to have those quality of unreason of contempt for the counting of cost and the balancing of sacrifice of recklessness and even in the last resort of ruthlessness which so often mark the path of heavenly thing and the doings of the child of light it bring not peace but a sword so it be with euripide the _ troädes _ itself have indeed almost no fierceness and singularly little thought of revenge it be only the cry of one of the great wrong of the world work into music as it be and make beautiful by the most tragic of the poet but its author live ever after in a deepen atmosphere of strife and even of hatred down to the day when because almost all in athen rejoice at he suffer he take he way to the remote valley of macedon to write the _ bacchae _ and to die g m the

again and the woman go out in the darkness _ note on the trojan woman -lrb- 1 -rrb- poseidon -rrb- -- in the _ iliad _ poseidon be the enemy of troy here the friend this sort of confusion come from the fact that the trojan and they greek enemy be largely of the same blood with the same tribal god to the trojan athena the war-goddess be of course _ they _ war-goddess the protectress of they citadel poseidon god of the sea and its merchandise and apollo -lrb- possibly a local shepherd god -rrb- be they natural friend and have actually build they city wall for love of the good old king laomedon zeus the great father have mount ida for he holy hill and troy for he peculiar city -lrb- cf on p 63 -rrb- to suit the greek point of view all this have to be change or explain away in the _ iliad _ generally athena be the proper war-goddess of the greek poseidon have indeed build the wall for laomedon but laomedon have cheat he of he reward -- as afterwards he cheat heracle and the argonaut and everybody else so poseidon hate troy troy be chiefly defend by the barbarian are the oriental aphrodite by its own river scamander and simoi and suchlike inferior or unprincipled god yet trace of the other tradition remain homer know that athena be specially worship in troy he know that apollo who have build the wall with poseidon and have the same experience of laomedon still love the trojan zeus himself though eventually in obedience to destiny he permit the fall of the city nevertheless have a great tenderness towards it -lrb- 2 -rrb- a steed marvellous -rrb- -- see below on

and leda and sister of castor and polydeuce but she human father be tyndareus a old spartan king she be treat as a prisoner and a prize _ ie _ as a capture enemy not as a greek princess deliver from the trojan -lrb- 5 -rrb- in secret slay -rrb- -- because the greek be ashamed of the bloody deed see below p 42 and the scene on this subject in the _ hecuba _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- cassandra -rrb- -- in the _ agamemnon _ the story be more clearly tell that cassandra be love by apollo and endowed by he with the power of prophecy then in some way she reject or betray he and he set upon she the curse that though see the truth she should never be believe the figure of cassandra in this play be not inconsistent with that version but it make a different impression she be here a dedicated virgin and she mystic love for apollo do not seem to have suffer any breach -lrb- 7 -rrb- palla -rrb- -- -lrb- see above -rrb- the historical explanation of the trojan palla and the greek palla be simple enough but as soon as the two be mythologically personify and make one there emerge just such a bitter and ruthless goddess as euripide in he revolt against the current mythology love to depict but it be not only the mythology that he be attack he seem really to feel that if there be conscious god rule the world they be cruel or inhuman being -lrb- 8 -rrb- -- ajax the less son of oïleus either ravish or attempt to ravish cassandra -lrb- the story occur in both form -rrb- while she be cling to the palladium or image of palla it be one of the great typical sin of the sack of troy often depict on vase -lrb- 9 -rrb- face of ship -rrb- -- homeric ship have prow shape and paint to look like bird ' or beast ' head a ship be always a wonderfully live and vivid thing to the greek poet -lrb- cf p 64 -rrb-

phoenician the sister land be the district of sybari in south italy where the river crathi have or have a red-gold color which make golden the hair of man and the fleece of sheep and the water never lose its freshness -lrb- 14 -rrb- talthybius be a loyal soldier with every wish to be kind but he be naturally in good spirit over the satisfactory end of the war and he tact be not sufficient to enable he to understand the trojan woman 's feeling yet in the end since he have to see and do the cruelty which he chief only order from a distance the real nature of he work force itself upon he and he feel and speak at time almost like a trojan it be worth notice how the trojan woman generally avoid address he -lrb- cf pp 48 67 74 -rrb- -lrb- 15 -rrb- the haunt key -lrb- literally with god

and pathetic about this curious blindness which prevent hecuba from understand so plain a riddle -lrb- cf below p 42 -rrb- she take the watching of a tomb to be some strange greek custom and do not seek to have it explain further -lrb- 17 -rrb- odysseus -rrb- -- in euripide generally odysseus be the type of the successful unscrupulous man as soldier and politician -- the incarnation of what the poet most hate in homer of course he be totally different -lrb- 18 -rrb- burn themselves and die -rrb- -- woman under these circumstance do commit suicide in euripide ' day as they have ever since it be rather curious that none of the character of the play not even andromache kill herself the explanation must be that no such suicide be record in the tradition -lrb- though cf below on p 33 -rrb- a significant fact suggest that in the homeric age when this kind of treatment of woman captive be regular the victim do not suffer quite so terribly under it -lrb- 19 -rrb- hymen -rrb- -- she address the torch the shadowy marriage-god hymen be a torch and a cry as much as anything more personal as a torch he be the sign both of marriage and of death of sunrise and of the consuming fire the full moon be specially connect with marriage ceremony -lrb- 20 -rrb- loxia -rrb- -- the name of apollo as a oracular god -lrb- 21 -rrb- cassandra 's vision -rrb- -- the allusion be to the various suffering of odysseus as narrated in the _ odyssey _ and to the tragedy of the house of atreus as tell for instance in aeschylus ' _ oresteium _ agamemnon together with cassandra and in part because he bring cassandra be murder -- fell with a axe -- on he return home by he wife clytaemnestra and she lover aegisthus they body be cast into a pit among the rock in vengeance for this oreste agamemnon 's son commit mother-murder and in consequence be drive by the erinye -lrb- fury -rrb- of he mother into madness and exile -lrb- 22 -rrb- this they king so wise -rrb- -- agamemnon make the war for the sake of he brother menelaus and slew he daughter iphigenia as a sacrifice at auli to enable the ship to sail for troy -lrb- 23 -rrb- hector and pari -rrb- -- the point about hector be clear but as to pari the feeling that after all it be a glory that he and the half-divine helen love each other be scarcely to be find anywhere else in greek literature -lrb- cf however isocrate ' praise of helen -rrb- pari and helen be never idealise like launcelot and guinevere or tristram and iseult -lrb- 24 -rrb- a wise queen -rrb- -- penelope the faithful wife of odysseus -lrb- 25 -rrb- o herald yea voice of death -rrb- -- there be a play on the word for herald in the greek here which i have evade by a paraphrase -lrb- -lrb- greek : kaer-uke -rrb- as though from -lrb- greek : kaer -rrb- the death-spirit the one thing abhor of all mortal man -rrb- -lrb- 26 -rrb- that in this place she die -rrb- -- the death of hecuba be connect with a certain heap of stone on the shore of the hellespont call _ kunossêma _ or dog 's tomb accord to one tradition -lrb- eur _ hec _ 1259 ff -rrb- she throw herself off the ship into the sea accord to another she be stone by the greek for she curse upon the fleet but in both she be change after death into a sort of hell-hound m victor bérard suggest that the dog first come into the story owe to the accidental resemblance of the -lrb- hypothetical -rrb- semitic word _ s ` qoulah _ stone or stoning and the greek _ skulax _ dog the homeric scyllum -lrb- _ skullum _ -rrb- be also both a stone and a dog -lrb- _ phéneciens et odyssée _ i 213 -rrb- of course in the present passage there be no direct reference to these wild sailor-story -lrb- 27 -rrb- the wind come quick -rrb- -- _ ie _ the storm of the prologue three power : the three erinye -lrb- 28 -rrb- ff chorus -rrb- -- the wooden horse be always difficult to understand and seem to have a obscuring effect on the language of poet who treat of it i can not help suspect that the story arise from a real historical incident misunderstand troy we be tell be still hold out after ten year and could not be take until at last by the divine suggestion of athena a certain epeio devise a wooden horse what be the device accord to the _ odyssey _ and most greek poet it be a gigantic wooden figure of a horse a party of hero lead by odysseus get inside it and wait the greek make a show of give up the siege and sail away but only as far as tenedo the trojan come out and find the horse and after wonder greatly what it be mean for and what to do with it make a breach in they wall and drag it into the citadel as a thank-offering to palla in the night the greek return the hero in the horse come out and open the gate and troy be capture it seem possible that the device really be the building of a wooden siege-tower as high as the wall with a project and revolve neck such engine be -lrb- 1 -rrb- capable of be use at the time in asia as a rare and extraordinary device because they exist on early assyrian monument -lrb- 2 -rrb- certain to be misunderstand in greek legendary tradition because they be not use in greek warfare till many century later -lrb- first perhaps at the siege of perinthus and byzantium by philip of macedon 340 bc -rrb- it be noteworthy that in the great picture by polygnôtus in the leschê at delphus above the wall of troy appear the head alone of the wooden horse -lrb- _ paus _ x 26 -rrb- aeschylus also -lrb- _ ag _ 816 -rrb- have some obscure phrase point in the same direction : a horse 's brood a shield-bearing people launch with a leap about the pleiad ' setting spring clear above the wall & c euripide here treat the horse metaphorically as a sort of war-horse trampling troy -lrb- 29 -rrb- she that spareth not heaven 's yokeless rider -rrb- -- athena like a northern valkyrie as often in the _ iliad _ if one try to imagine what athena the war-goddess worship by the athenian mob be like -- what a mixture of bad national passion of superstition and statecraft of slip-shod unimaginative idealisation -- one may partly understand why euripide make she so evil allegorist and high-minded philosopher might make athena entirely noble by concentrate they mind on the beautiful element in the tradition and forget or explain away all that be savage he be determine to pin she down to the worst fact record of she and let people worship such a be if they like -lrb- 30 -rrb- to artemi -rrb- -- maiden at the shrine of artemi be a fix datum in the tradition -lrb- cf _ hec _ 935 ff -rrb- -lrb- 31 -rrb- andromache and hecuba -rrb- -- this very beautiful scene be perhaps mar to most modern reader by a element which be merely a part of the convention of ancient mourning each of the mourner cry : there be no affliction like mine and then proceed to argue as it be against the other 's counter claim one can only say that it be after all what they expect of each other and i believe the same convention exist in most place where keening or wail be a actual practice -lrb- 32 -rrb- even as the sound of a song -rrb- -- i have fill in some word which seem to be miss in the greek here -lrb- 33 -rrb- andromache -rrb- -- this character be wonderfully study she seem to I to be a woman who have not yet show much character or perhaps have very intense experience but be only wait for sufficiently great trial to become a heroine and a saint there be still a marked element of conventionality in she description of she life with hector but one feel as she speak that she be already past it she character be build up of _ sophrosyne _ of self-restraint and the love of goodness -- quality which often seem second-rate or even tiresome until they have a sufficiently great field in which to act very characteristic be she resolution to make the best and not the worst of she life in pyrrhus ' house with all its horror of suffering and apparent degradation so be the self-conquest by which she deliberately refrain from cursing she child 's murderer for the sake of the last poor remnant of good she can still do to he in get he bury the nobility of such a character depend largely of course on the intensity of the feeling conquer it be worth note in this connection that euripide be contradict a wide-spread tradition -lrb- robert _ bild und lie _ pp 63 ff -rrb- andromache in the picture of the sack of troy be represent with a great pestle or some such instrument fight with the soldier to rescue astyanax -lrb- -lrb- greek : ` andro-machae -rrb- = man-fighting -rrb- observe too what a climax of drama be reach by means of the very fact that andromache to the utmost of she power try to do nothing dramatic but only what will be best she character in euripide ' play _ andromache _ be on the whole similar to this but less developed -lrb- 34 -rrb- in salami fill with the foam & c -rrb- -- a striking instance of the artistic value of the greek chorus in relieve a intolerable strain the relief provide be something much higher than what we ordinarily call relief it be a stream of pure poetry and music in key with the sadness of the surrounding scene yet in a way happy just because it be beautiful -lrb- cf note on _ hippolytus _ 1 732 -rrb- the argument of the rather difficult lyric be : this be not the first time troy have be take long ago heracle make war against the old king laomedon because he have not give he the immortal steed that he promise and telamon join he telamon who might have be happy in he island of salami among the bee and the pleasant water look over the strait to the olive-laden hill of athen the beloved city and they take ship and slew laomedon yea twice zeus have destroy ilion -lrb- second part -rrb- be it all in vain that we trojan prince have be love by the god ganymêdês pour the nectar of zeus in he banquet he face never trouble though he motherland be burn with fire and to say nothing of zeus how can the goddess of morning rise and shine upon we uncaring she love tithônus son of laomedon and bear he up from we in a chariot to be she husband in the sky but all that once make they love we be go -lrb- 35 -rrb- pool of thy bathing -rrb- -- it be probable that ganymêdês be himself originally a pool or a spring on ida now a pourer of nectar in heaven -lrb- 36 -rrb- menelaus and helen -rrb- -- the meeting of menelaus and helen after the taking of troy be naturally one of the great moment in the heroic legend the version roughly speak divide themselves into two in one -lrb- _ little iliad _ ar _ lysistr _ 155 eur _ andromache _ 628 -rrb- menelaus be about to kill she but as she bare she bosom to the sword the sword fall from he hand in the other -lrb- stesichorus _ sack of ilion _ -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- menelaus or some one else take she to the ship to be stone and the man can not stone she as quintus of smyrna say they look on she as they would on a god both version have affect euripide here and he helen have just the magic of the helen of legend that touch of the supernatural which belong of right to the child of heaven -- a mystery a gentleness a strange absence of fear or wrath -- be feel through all she word one forget to think of she guilt or innocence she be too wonderful a be to judge too precious to destroy this supernatural element be the thing which if true separate helen from other woman and in a way redeem she be for that reason exactly what hecuba deny the controversy have a certain eternal quality about it : the hypothesis of heavenly enchantment and the hypothesis of mere bad behavior neither of they entirely convince but the very curse of those that hate she make a kind of superhuman atmosphere about helen in this play she fill the background like a great well-spring of pain this menelaus however be rather different from the traditional menelaus besides be the husband of helen he be the typical conqueror for whose sake the greek fight and to whom the central prize of the war belong and we take he at the height of he triumph the very moment for which he make the war hence the peculiar bitterness with which he be treat he conquest turn to ash in he mouth and he love a confused turmoil of hunger and hatred contemptible and yet terrible the exit of the scene would leave a modern audience quite in doubt as to what happen unless the action be much clearer than the word but all athenian know from the _ odyssey _ that the pair be swiftly reconcile and live happily together as king and queen of sparta -lrb- 37 -rrb- thou deep base of the world -rrb- -- these line as a piece of religious speculation be very famous in antiquity and dramatically they be most important all through the play hecuba be a woman of remarkable intellectual power and of fearless thought she do not definitely deny the existence of the olympian god like some character in euripide but she treat they as being that have betray she and whose name she scarcely deign to speak it be the very godlessness of hecuba 's fortitude that make it so terrible and properly regard so noble -lrb- cf p 35 why call on thing so weak and p 74 they know they know -rrb- such god be as a matter of fact the moral inferior of good man and euripide will never blind he eye to they inferiority and as soon as people see that they god be bad they tend to cease believe in he existence at all -lrb- hecuba 's answer to helen be not inconsistent with this it be only less characteristic -rrb- behind this olympian system however there be a possibility of some real providence or impersonal governance of the world to which here for a moment hecuba make a passionate approach if there be _ any _ explanation _ any _ justice even in the form of mere punishment of the wicked she will be content and give worship but it seem that there be not then at last there remain -- what most but not all modern freethinker would probably have begin to doubt at the very begin -- the world of the depart the spirit of the dead who be true and in they dim way love she still -lrb- p 71 thy father far away shall comfort thee and the last scene of the play -rrb- this last religion faint and shatter by doubt as it be represent a return to the most primitive pelasgian belief a worship of the dead which exist long before the olympian system and have long outlive it -lrb- 38 -rrb- the fire-brand 's image -rrb- -- hecuba just before pari ' birth

harrison _ prolegomenon _ pp 292 ff late writer degrade the story into a beauty contest between three thoroughly personal goddess -- and a contest complicate by bribery but originally the judgment be rather a choice between three possible life like the choice of heracle between work and idleness the element of the choice vary in different version : but in general hera be royalty athena be prowess in war or personal merit aphrodite of course be love and the goddess be not really to be distinguish from the gift they bring they be what they give and nothing more cf the wonderful lyric _ androm _ 274 ff where they come to a young man walk to and fro alone in a empty hut in the firelight there be a extraordinary effect in helen herself _ be _ one of the crown of life -- a fair equivalent for
