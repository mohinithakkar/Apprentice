produce by john hagerson kevin handy andrea ball and the online distribute proofread team parent and child by mosiah hall volume three child study and training 1916 for the deseret Sunday school union salt lake city a word of introduction home-making and the rearing of child be the fundamental business of this world to make a success of this business we must understand it the loving heart of many parent be suffer for a multitude of mistake that loving intelligence might have prevent we can not save we child in ignorance to perform the duty of parenthood well we must understand they more clearly we need light and uplift these day demand greater knowledge than ever before on the part of parent to meet and master the problem that now confront father and mother particularly do we need to study child nature a clearer understanding of the law govern the development of child would give parent great help in guide they child into path of righteousness and in minister to vary child need as they develop to give definite help and new spirit to we work this volume have be prepare the keynote of the book be _ a more enlighten parenthood _ it offer a series of lesson along a line most vital to parent -- _ child study and training _ these lesson have be write for we by mosiah hall associate professor in education of the university of utah and high school inspector for the state of utah we feel that he have do for we cause most excellent service and we gladly acknowledge we indebtedness to he this should be remember : a book give wisdom only in proportion to the thought that be put into it by the reader the suggestion of this volume will become rich only as they be enrich by study they will become valuable only to the extent that they find application in we daily life the lesson will be vitalize only as the teacher pour life into they to supplement and enrich the course reference be give with most of the lesson and a list of book be offer at the close of the book many of these volume have already be purchase and distribute through the parent ' class library each class should endeavor to procure at least one copy of each of these book as it be call for in the various lesson in this way a good library can be gradually build up we desire be to make these study bring lasting return for good may god add he blessing to make we work divinely successful you brethren in the gospel parent ' class committee of deseret Sunday school union board henry h rolapp howard r drigg nathan t porter ephraim g gowan a word from the author this treatise on child study and training have be prepare primarily for the parent ' class in Sunday school under the direction of the general board it be well adapt also for study by parent-teacher ' association and for reading in the home its purpose be to acquaint parent with the most vital problem of child life and character and to suggest some method of solve these problem the work be not offer as a complete course in this great subject it be intend rather to open up the field of child study for parent the welfare of the race depend upon the proper birth and the correct rearing of child that this little volume may add its mite towards the solution of the problem -- at once the hope and the despair of civilization -- be the wish of its author to the parent ' class committee and the general superintendency of the general board i desire to express my appreciation for the suggestion and help they have extend to I in the preparation of this work to my wife who achieve in practice what i imperfectly state in theory these study be affectionately dedicate mosiah hall the birthright of childhood _ it be the sacred right of the child to be well-born _ if the child have any divine right in this world it be the right to be well-born to be bring into the world sound of body and whole in mind to be give anything short of such a good beginning be to be handicap throughout life education and training can not make up for the defect impose on the child by the sin of the father which the good book tell we be visit upon the child unto the third and fourth generation it be a fact to challenge attention that the child be the product of the entire past he essential nature be comparatively fix at birth and be beyond the power or caprice of parent or environment to change in any fundamental particular during the short period of a lifetime this assertion must not be wrongly interpret the possibility of training and education be great but they can do little to overcome all of the defect place upon the child by heredity science tell we that normal child be bear with the same number and kind of instinct by instinct be mean the tendency to do certain thing in a definite way without previous experience in all child for example we find the instinct of fear the instinct for play for self-preservation these instinct begin to manifest themselves more or less strongly as the child develop child also have certain capacity capacity may be define as the possibility to develop skill in certain direction one for instance may have a greater capacity to develop musical ability than another so with art or business or ability for any other work capacity more than instinct seem to depend on the characteristic of parent or immediate ancestor thus a child may take after father or mother or grandparent in this or that particular ability instinct on the other hand seem to be he inheritance from the race but whatever he gift from parent or past the child be bear a distinct individual this be true not only with regard to he physical organism but in respect to he spiritual nature the relative strength of he instinct add to the number and quality of he capacity determine what be call individuality this be what make each child differ from all other and this distinctive nature can not be essentially change within we brief life though it do possess marvelous power of development and adaptation for illustration : cultivation may develop a perfect specimen of a crabapple but no amount of careful training could change the crabapple into a johnathan likewise no system of education can hope to change a numskull into a newton or to produce a solomon from a simple simon the first vital concern of parent therefore should be to see that the child be not rob of he sacred birthright to be well-born it be a matter of regret that the white race generally be such a sorry mixture of humanity the good and the bad the intelligent and the ignorant the feeble-minded and the strong the criminal and the righteous have be combine so frequently and in so many way that the marvel be that more of the human race be not degenerate as the result of contamination since the great characteristic of heredity be to breed true and thus perpetuate its kind and since training and education must take the individual as he be with only limited power to change he intrinsic nature or to develop any capacity not present at birth it become a matter of serious importance that parent do all in they power to guide properly the mating of they child the teaching of the gospel on this point be most significant heredity determine to a great extent the kind and the nature of the individual and thereby set limit which the environment may not overcome among these limitation be the following : 1 the relative strength of instinct 2 the number and kind of capacity 3 the form size and quality of bodily organ 4 susceptibility to or power to resist disease 5 the possibility of mental attainment 6 the possibility of emotional and spiritual response 7 the possibility to execute undertaking to control situation and to govern self as well as other heredity also endow a person with he peculiar temperament with he good or bad look and with the chief component of what be call personality on the other hand training and education have almost everything to say respect the relative standing of the individual among the member of he kind -- whether or not he shall be a blighted or a perfect specimen a fine sweet juicy crabapple be more desirable than a scrubby diseased jonathan it be the province of training and education to take the individual as he be bear and endeavor to make of he a perfect specimen of he kind a child leave to himself bringeth he parent to shame if leave alone or improperly train a child be almost certain to revert to a lower type of individual the same high possibility that properly direct produce the superior be if neglect or subject to a vicious environment produce the moral degenerate the child be bear morally neither good nor bad and while inherit tendency may make development in one direction easier than in another it be possible for a favorable environment assist by education to develop any normal child into a sweet wholesome product of he kind shearer in he management and training of child say : the child may inherit instinct but a kind providence have ordain that he shall not inherit habit he may inherit certain taste but he do not inherit temptation he may bring into the world tendency but he do not bring with he prejudice lesson i _ question for discussion _ 1 what do the expression be well-born mean to you 2 what responsibility be lay upon parent by the fact that the child be the product of the past read the second commandment here and discuss its significance in application to this point 3 what be some of the instinct and capacity give to the child by heredity 4 explain the difference between a instinct and a capacity what seem to be the source of we instinct -- we capacity 5 what be the chief limitation place by heredity upon the child 6 what may education and environment hope to accomplish _ reference _ : the right of the child to be well bear will be find a helpful book to study here it may be well if the book be available to have someone appoint to report on it or to read a few choice paragraph from it also read be well bear by guyer important law of heredity _ a wise application of the law of inheritance be the most certain means of develop a superior race _ in the preface of dr guyer 's remarkable book be well bear we read the following : it be no exaggeration to say that during the last fifteen year we have make more progress in measure the extent of inheritance and in determine its elemental factor than in all previous time if this be true it would seem to be almost criminal for teacher and parent to neglect to acquaint themselves with the fundamental law of heredity this author say further : since what a child become be determine so largely by its inborn capacity it be of the utmost importance that teacher and parent realize something of the nature of such aptitude before they begin to awaken they for education consist in large measure in supply the stimulus necessary to set go these potentiality and of afford opportunity for they expression _ mendel 's _ law be probably the most important known principle of inheritance through its application practically all of the improvement in plant and animal have be bring about this law may be explain as follow : a certain kind of pure breed fowl be find which be either pure white or black if either color be mate with its own color the result progeny will be true to the color of the parent but if a white and a black be cross the result will be blue fowl possess one-half the characteristic of each parent but strange to say if two blue fowl be mate the progeny will not be all blue one-fourth will be white like one grandparent another one-fourth black like the other grandparent and one-half will be blue like the parent if this experiment be repeat with plant and animal have opposite characteristic the same ratio as above always result this indicate that truly heritable trait or character be separate unit and be inherit independently the breeder be thus enable through select the trait or character that be wanted and cross they with a well-known stock to produce almost any trait or quality that he desire this law make it possible to estimate the result of cross breeding with almost mathematical exactness improve variety of fruit grain and vegetable have be produce in this manner and with animal marvelous result have be achieve luther burbank in he little book the training of the human plant say : there be not a single desirable attribute which lack in a plant may not be breed into it choose what improvement you wish in a flower a fruit or a tree and by cross selection cultivation and persistence you can fix this desirable trait irrevocably and further : if then we could have twelve family under ideal condition where these principle could be carry out unswervingly we could accomplish more for the race in ten generation than can now be accomplish in a hundred thousand year ten generation of human life should be ample to fix any desire attribute this be absolutely clear there be neither theory nor speculation _ acquirement of parent _ during they lifetime accord to the best authority be not transmit to any noticeable extent to they child this appear to be due to the fact that the cell concern in reproduction be set aside during embryonic life and from then on be practically unmodified by the succeed development and experience of the parent in fact during the lifetime of the individual the germ cell be so completely isolate from the grow organism that nothing but nourishment in the shape of blood can possibly reach they hence they can be affect only by a vitiate or poisonous blood supply it seem to be true therefore that only the old deeply-impressed trait capacity or racial character can be inherit this be no doubt the chief secret of the power of heredity to breed true it have be a popular belief that if parent acquire skill in music mathematics or special ability in any other particular that such ability could be impart to they child but in the light of the above fact this appear to be impossible of course if such ability be a slumbering inborn trait of either parent or of some immediate ancestor the ability might be transmit it be reasonable to suppose however that any acquire trait or ability of the parent if practice and continue steadily by he child and they descendant for many generation will come to be a inborn trait or character capable of be transmit otherwise it be extremely difficult to understand how the human family can progress and become permanently improve _ galton 's _ law be believe to be approximately correct it may be state as follow : child inherit on the average one-half they characteristic from parent one-fourth from grandparent one-eighth from great-grandparent and so on in ever diminish ratio to remote ancestor but owe to the fact that some inheritable trait or character be likely to be dominant and other recessive galton 's law must be modify so that only under the most favorable condition can it be regard as reliable owe to the fact that the primary element or trait of character contribute by each parent may combine in many way in the embryo considerable variation in the child of the same parent be inevitable -- one child may resemble the father another the mother and yet another some near ancestor variability be therefore the rule among offspring in the same family and in some instance it be decidedly pronounced but in all case the variation must be confine to the possible combination of character transmit from parent and ancestor _ the law of regression _ represent the tendency of the extreme element of the race constantly to seek the middle or mediocre level for example the child of superior parent be not likely to be so brilliant as they parent and the offspring of inferior people be somewhat better than they parent this drag of the race or pull of ancestor be no doubt due to the fact that selection have never be practice hence the two-thousand nearby ancestor be most likely a average lot of people and the pull be from the higher towards the lower level the pull be a help to the child of inferior parent but be a handicap to the superior if long-continued selection of parent be practice the regression would disappear and the pull would be upward selection of parent possess superior element of character and the prevention of the unfit and the criminal from propagate they kind seem the surest hope we have of produce a permanently higher type it be well know that the extreme of the race be less fertile than the means and since fertility be the chief factor in fix the type in the absence of selection and repression the race appear doom to remain at the dead level of mediocrity the tremendous significance of this fact be that the welfare of the race -- the gradual substitution of a superior for the present mediocre type -- rest absolutely upon the willingness and ability of the superior class to do they full share in propagate the race lesson ii question for discussion 1 what be the principle of heredity as discover by mendel explain by illustrate how it work out in plant and animal 2 what practical application be make of this law in produce better seed and better breed 3 illustrate galton 's law 4 what significance have these law in the improvement of the human race 5 account for the variability of child in the same family 6 why be some child inferior some superior to they parent 7 illustrate the pull of ancestor 8 how might this pull be make upward instead of downward as it now seem to be 9 what sacred responsibility rest upon superior people to propagate the race 10 what be the gospel teaching regard mixed marriage and the rearing of family 11 what practical step can and should be take to prevent feeble-minded and vicious people from propagate they kind _ reference _ : the jukes-edwards family by dr ae winship if this book be available have some member of the class make a report on it train the human plant and be well bear will also be find helpful here the mother and the embryo _ the care of the mother during the embryonic period determine largely the future welfare of the child _ in common with every organism the infant develop from a single germ cell of almost microscopic size wrap in this tiny cell be all the possibility of structure and character that combine to form the complicated bodily organism and the particular mental endowment of the come child it be once believe that almost any kind of physical or mental change could be bring about in the cell through appropriate control of the environment but the result of careful observation and experiment be oppose to this view all evidence point to the fact that no new character or element can enter the embryo from without the cell itself hold the secret of what the future individual shall be the sole connection between the embryo and the mother be the narrow umbilical cord which contain no nerve and whose only function be to carry blood to the grow organism it may be see therefore how impossible it be for mental impression and disturbance on the part of the mother to in any way reach and affect the embryo once start on the road to development the embryo be so thoroughly subject to inner law that nothing from without can modify or change the direction of its growth except some physical cause which interfere with the blood supply a adequate supply of pure blood be the principal requirement of the grow organism whatever interfere with the blood supply or in any way affect its purity have a injurious affect upon the embryo there be not the least doubt that lack of nutrition and serious ill-health on the part of the mother have a extremely bad effect upon the unborn offspring severe shock or grief worry nervous exhaustion disease and poison in the blood of the mother be the most serious source of injury they render nutrition defective and if poison enter directly the blood of the mother or be generate by toxin through disease the embryo will be poison and may be destroy among these poison be alcohol lead and the toxin from tuberculosis and the venereal disease gonorrhea and syphilis to gonorrhea be attribute 80 per cent of the blindness of child bear blind it be declare to be the cause of 75 per cent of all the surgical operation for female disorder and of 45 per cent of involuntary sterility in childless woman syphilis be the chief cause of feeble-mindedness paresis or softening of the brain and of most other mental defect in child from the foregoing it be evident that the proper care of the mother so as to insure a pure blood supply for the offspring ought to be one of the chief concern of society this should not be leave to the haphazard effort of individual but ought to be provide for by the state accord to the statement of life insurance company expectant mother be the most neglect member of we population dr van ingen of new york city estimate that 90 per cent of woman in this country be wholly without prenatal care luther burbank show that in order even for a plant to grow properly it must have abundance of sunshine good air and nourishing food but not many mother at this time may have even these poor luxury instead too many mother be slave to a insanitary kitchen where sunshine be scarcely know and where overwork and worry destroy all appetite for food the welfare of the race demand that the mother shall be properly nurture and protect during this critical period abundance of sunshine pure air light exercise and a variety of wholesome food be absolutely essential and the utmost pain should be take to prevent worry excitement sickness and above all contact with or exposure to poison or disease it be once think that whatever cause a mental disturbance in the mother leave its impress on the child it be fortunate that this old notion be false as we have show nothing but a physical change affect the blood supply can possibly influence the develop organism now and then a red flame spot or so-called birthmark be find on the new-born child but this be due always to some physical cause which may be easily explain never be it a result of fear of some red object on the part of the mother lesson iii discussion 1 how do embryonic life begin 2 what be characteristic of the cell 3 what secret do it hold 4 what be the principal need of the embryo 5 state fully how the blood supply may be vitiate and what terrible consequence may follow 6 how should the mother be care for during this critical period 7 how may mother drudgery in the home be reduce to a minimum 8

-rrb- 9 _ reference _ : the follow book will be find helpful : the training of the human plant by burbank the right of the child to be well bear by dawson be well bear by guyer if these be available they may be circulate through the parent ' library the plastic age of childhood _ prolonged infancy and the long period of plasticity in the infant make training and education possible _ the child be bear the weakest and most helpless of creature unlike the young of most animal which within a few hour after birth move about and perform most of the movement necessary to they existence the infant be so helpless that all its need must be supply by parent otherwise it would perish immediately after birth a colt or calf can walk or run almost as fast as its mother the chick just out of its shell can run about and peck at its food the child at one year of age can barely totter around and all of its need must be look after by other moreover the infant at birth be practically blind and deaf and the sens of taste and smell and touch just sufficiently develop to enable it to take nourishment this slowness of development or prolonged infancy as it be call be of vast significance to the child it mark at once the chief distinction between the human infant and the young of all other animal it make possible a long period of adjustment and training which otherwise would be impossible most animal be bear with a nervous system highly develop and with most of the adjustment to the environment ready make so that after a short time all the activity of life be perfect and thereafter automatic action and instinct rule they life because of this lack of infancy and absence of plasticity of the nervous system animal be little more than machine that perform they task with unvarying regularity in response to outside stimulation animal therefore be unable to adjust themselves to a change in environment and as a result they life be in constant danger in fact countless million of the lower form of life be perish every hour because of the lack of possibility of adjustment the child on the other hand have a extremely long period of infancy and as a result the nervous system be so plastic that it may be mould fashion and develop in almost any manner or direction accord to the will of parent and the nature of the environment the child consequently may be educate by education we mean the training and develop of desirable instinct and capacity and the inhibiting of undesirable one so that the child may be able constantly to adjust himself to a ever-changing environment fiske in the meaning of infancy chapter 1 say : the bird know as the fly-catcher no sooner break the egg than it will snap at and catch a fly this action be not very simple but because it be something the bird be always do be indeed one of the very few thing that this bird ever do the nervous connection needful for do it be all establish before birth and nothing but the presence of the fly be require to set the operation go with such creature as the codfish the turtle or the fly-catcher there be nothing that can properly be call infancy with they the sphere of education be extremely limit they get they education before they be bear in other word heredity do everything for they education nothing all mammal and most bird have a period of babyhood that be not very long but it be on the whole longer with the most intelligent creature the period of helpfulness be a period of plasticity the creature 's career be no longer exclusively determine by heredity there be a period after birth when its character can be slightly modify by what happen to it after birth that be by its experience as a individual it be no longer necessary for each generation to be exactly like that which have precede the door be open through which the capacity for progress can enter horse and dog bear and elephant parrot and monkey be all teachable to some extent and we have even hear of a learn pig and of learn ass there have be no lack in the world but this educability of the higher mammal and bird be after all quite limited conservatism still continue in fashion one generation be much like another it would be easy for fox to learn to climb tree and many a fox might have save he life by so do yet quick-witted as he be this obvious device have never occur to he the vital problem with parent be how to fill this period of plasticity how to provide a educative environment of the right kind luther burbank in the training of the human plant express complete confidence in the power of the environment through appropriate training to fashion the normal child just as he could a plant into a most delightful and beautiful specimen of its kind he say : pick out any trait you want in you child grant that he be a normal child be it honesty fairness purity lovableness industry thrift what not by surround this child with sunshine from the sky and you own heart by give the closest communion with nature by feed this child well-balanced nutritious food by give it all that be imply in healthful environmental influence and by do all in love you can thus cultivate in the child and fix there for all its life all of these trait and on the other side give he foul air to breathe keep he in a dusty factory or a unwholesome school-room or a crowded tenement up under the hot roof keep he away from the sunshine take away from he music and laughter and happy face cram he little brain with so-called knowledge let he have vicious associate in he hour out of school and at the age of ten you have fix in he the opposite trait you have perhaps see a prairie fire sweep through the tall grass across a plain nothing can stand before it it must burn itself out that be what happen when you let weed grow up in you child 's life and then set fire to they by wrong environment mr burbank be probably over-enthusiastic in he belief that natural education can do everything for the child but it be certain that environment do exercise a powerful influence during the plastic age in determine he character lesson iv question for discussion 1 compare the helplessness of the infant at birth with the ability of

child be give during this period good book for further study on these point be : the care and training of the child by kerr and fundamental of child study by kirkpatrick if these volume be in the library or otherwise available it may be well to have some member read and give a brief report on one or the other of they the need of the infant _ the infant 's first need be physical and may be sum up in the word nutrition _ the new-born child differ in nearly all particulars from the adult it be very unfortunate that the child in the past have be regard as a miniature adult and treat like a little man the structure of muscle and bone and the proportion of various part of the body differ materially the bone of the child for some time be soft and largely compose of cartilage which may be easily bent out of shape and permanently injure the ratio of some of the part be about as follow : \* \* \* \* \* height of head of adult to that of infant -- 2 to 1 length of body of adult to that of infant -- 3 to 1 length of arm of adult to that of infant -- 4 to 1 length of leg of adult to that of infant -- 5 to 1 besides these easily observe difference there be other of far more consequence not easily see such as difference in the size structure and activity of vital organ and in the almost total lack of nervous development in the child as compare with the adult all of these thing make of the child a individual so different from the adult that he must be treat in accordance with he own nature and need and with little regard to the way in which a adult be consider practically everything that the infant need may be sum up in the one word _ nutrition _ a sufficient supply of pure milk from the mother be the one supreme requirement if this be assure everything else be almost certain to follow of course the little one must be keep at the right temperature which be comparatively high during the first few month a abundance of pure fresh air also must be supply to both mother and child it be wise for both to spend much time in the open air and to sleep on a screen porch the child should be keep quiet and permit to sleep as long as nature dictate it be a positive sin to snatch the child from its bed toss it up and down and screech at it for the edification of curious visitor kiss the child in the mouth should also be positively prohibit the use of patent medicine likewise or even many of the old mother remedy should never be indulge except on the advice of a competent physician the need of the child for some time be strictly physical inner force be at work which can not be assist except indirectly through care of the physical organism so far as nervous or mental development be concern the rule should be hand off let nature take she course immediately after birth certain reflexive and instinctive movement such as suck cry sneeze and cling be manifest and the sense of taste and usually smell be also sufficiently active to enable the infant to take nourishment no other sens be active and no other movement possible except the automatic action of vital organ and a few vague spasmodic twitching and movement of part of the body know as impulsive nothing however can be do from without to hasten the mental awakening nature in she own due time will do this and do it much better if not hurry or interfere with lesson v question for discussion 1 show that the infant be not a adult in miniature 2 what be some important difference between the child and the adult 3 what be the supreme need of the infant why 4 what should be observe in care for the child 5 what should be avoid in care for the child 6 what should be the rule in early mental development 7 what be active in the child immediately after birth the care of the child in health by oppenheim will be helpful here if the book be in the parent ' library let someone prepare and make a brief report on it for next lesson the follow other help may be have for the ask by write to the we bureau of education : parental care by mr west series no 1 publication no 4 we department of labor child 's bureau the follow chapter be take from one of these bulletin prepare for parent by we government care of the baby in summer _ summer be a critical time for the infant during this time it should receive the most careful attention _ a baby must be keep as cool as possible in summer because over-heating be a direct cause of summer diarrhea even breast-fed baby find it hard to resist the weakening effect of excessive heat record show that thousand of baby most of whom be bottle-fed die every year in July and August because of the direct or indirect effect of the heat next in importance to right food in summer be measure for keep the baby cool and comfortable frequent bath light clothing and the selection of the coolest available place for he to play and sleep a baby should have a full tub bath every morning if he be restless and the weather be very hot he may have in addition one or two sponge bath a day a cool bath at bedtime sometimes make the baby sleep more comfortably for a young baby the water should be tepid that be it should feel neither hot nor cold to the mother 's elbow for a older baby it may be slightly cooler but should not be cold enough to chill or frighten he if the water be very hard a tablespoonful of borax dissolve in a little water may be add to three quart of water to soften it very little soap should be use and that a very bland simple soap like castile never rub the soap directly on the baby 's skin and be sure that it be thoroughly rinse off as a very troublesome skin disease may result if a harsh soap be allow to dry on the skin use a soft wash cloth make from a piece of old table linen towel knit underwear or any other very soft material and have two piece one for the face and head and one for the body the towel should be soft and clean also even in summer the baby should be protect from a direct draft when be bath lest he be too suddenly chill a young baby should be carefully hold while in the tub the mother put she left hand under the baby 's arm and support the neck and head with she forearm but a older baby can sit alone and in summer may be allow to splash about in the cool water for a few minute when the bath be finish the baby should be pat dry and the mother should take great care to see that the fold and crease of the skin be dry use a little pure talcum powder or dry sift corn starch under the arm and in the groin to prevent chafe if any redness chafing or eruption like prickly heat develop on the skin no soap at all should be use in the bath sometimes a starch or bran or soda bath will relieve such condition _ bran bath _ make a little bag of cheesecloth and put a cupful of ordinary bran in it and sew or tie the top let this bag soak in the bath squeeze it until the water be milky _ starch bath _ use a cupful of ordinary cook starch to a gallon of water -lrb- if the laundry starch have have anything add to it such as salt lard oil bluing it must not be use for this purpose -rrb- _ soda bath _ dissolve a tablespoonful of ordinary baking soda in a little water and add it to four quart of water _ clothing _ do not be afraid to take off the baby 's clothes in summer all he need in hot weather be the diaper and one other garment for a young baby this may be a sleeveless band which leave the arm and chest bare and for a older baby only a loose thin cotton slip or apron or wrapper make in one piece with short kimono sleeve toward nightfall when the day cool or if the temperature drop when a storm arise the baby should of course be dress in such a way as to protect he from chill cotton garment be best for the baby in summer all-wool band shirt and stocking should not be wear at any time of the year and in hot summer weather only the thinnest all-cotton clothing should touch the baby 's skin unless he be sick when a very light part-wool band may be need in general neither wool nor starch should be allow in the baby 's clothing in summer wool be too hot and irritating and starched garment scratch the baby 's flesh the baby should be keep day and night in the coolest place that can be find the kitchen be usually the hottest room in the house especially if coal or wood be burn for fuel while the mother be busy with she work the baby should be keep in another room or better out of door if he can be protect from fly and mosquito a play pen such as be describe in infant care a booklet publish by the child 's bureau and send free on request make it possible to leave the baby safely by himself on the porch or in the yard after he be old enough to creep a screen porch on the shady side of the house be a boon to every mother afford a cool secure place for the baby to play and also to sleep let he have he daytime nap on the porch and sleep there at night during the heat do not be afraid of fresh air for the baby he can not have too much of it night air be sometimes even better than day air because it have be cool and cleanse of dust by the dew the essential in the summer care of baby be : 1 proper food give only at regular interval 2 a clean body 3 fresh air day and night 4 very little clothing 5 cool place to play and sleep in do not give the baby medicine of any sort unless it be order by the doctor never give he patent remedy which be say to relieve the pain of teething or to make he sleep or to cure diarrhea for such medicine be likely to do the baby much more harm than good especially in summer when the digestion be so easily disturbed it be so much easier to keep the baby well than it be to cure he when he be sick that wise mother try to take such care of the baby that he will not be sick do not fail to give the baby a drink of cool water several time a day in hot weather boil the water first then cool it and offer it to the baby in a cup glass or nursing bottle baby and young child sometimes suffer cruelly for lack of drinking water lesson vi question on text 1 what be the chief cause of sickness and death among child during the summer time 2 what be the best preventative for baby ill during the hot

reference _ : selection from child nature and child nurture by st john child activity _ this activity be express in simple reflex complex instinct or internally cause impulse _ as already mention the physical need of the infant be supreme proper nourishment the right temperature bathing and a abundance of fresh pure air constitute all of he requirement the child be endowed however with a enormous capacity for movement which be the outward expression of he awaken mental life the first great mental fact to note be that the infant be bear with the capacity to respond to stimulus both from without and within touch the lip of the new-born child with the nipple or even the finger and immediately the suck instinct take place let a bright light shine into the open eye and the iris at once contract plunge the little one into cold water or let it be subject to any bodily discomfort and at once the cry reflex take place the simple direct response to stimulus such as sneeze cough wrinkle cry response to tickle etc be term reflex the more complex response which be purposeful and be design to aid or protect the organism such as suck clinging fear anger etc be call instinct besides the movement which be the direct result of stimulation other movement more or less spasmodic and uncoordinated take place which seem to be the result of internal cause not easily understand the whole body be usually involve in these movement and they be at first extremely random in expression these be term impulse and be undoubtedly due to the fact that the infant be a living breathing embodiment of energy seek the means of self-expression in other word the infant be active from the beginning and the slightest kind of internal disturbance be sufficient at time to turn loose a immense number of impulsive movement this activity at birth be entirely uncontrolled it seem that in contrast to reflex and instinct which have prearrange bodily means of expression the impulse must be subject to a long period of training and education before they be capable of be control and transform into that voluntary movement which be sometimes call will power the immense number and strength of these random impulsive movement in the infant be in great contrast to the few instinctive unchangeable mode of action in lower animal as already state most animal come to the world with the few movement necessary to they existence already provide for and so fix that future adjustment to new condition be practically impossible the child on the other hand have marvelous capacity for adjustment to new condition and present therefore possibility for training and education that have probably never yet be fully realize in any child the reflex and instinct however be much more fixed and certain in they action than be the impulse no matter what the training and education of a individual may be he will sneeze even in church if the right stimulus be present or he will cry and shed tear in public if the melodrama excite the proper nerve center when the sex instinct be fully arouse or the sentiment of love completely awaken no one can foretell what the action of the otherwise sane person will be all that training and education can do be to inhibit under ordinary condition certain undesirable tendency and instinct and to strengthen through exercise those that be desirable and even then when a crisis come the old hereditary instinct be apt to break through its thin veneer and actually frighten the individual at the unexpected strength it reveal slap any man in the face and see what chance he life-long education have against the old barbarous instinct for fight but notwithstanding the strength and tenacity of instinct training and education may inhibit some of they and so transform other into useful habit that for most purpose in life they subjugation seem complete a tremendous almost divine power rest therefore in the hand of parent -- the power to mold and fashion and transform the impulse and instinct of they child into whatsoever ideal of life and conduct they themselves possess where be the parent who fully realize he privilege and completely perform he sacred duty lesson vii question on the text 1 what be the supreme need of the infant 2 what be the first mental fact to note 3 illustrate reflex movement instinctive movement impulsive movement 4 contrast the impulse of child with the instinct of lower animal 5 what opportunity be give parent through the impulsive movement of the infant 6 what only may training and education hope to accomplish with the instinct of child 7 what almost divine power be possess by parent in the training of child 8 quote from the doctrine & covenant also a passage that deal with the responsibility of parent in teach the gospel to they child _ reference _ : for a further study of _ instinct _ selection from fundamental of child study by kirkpatrick will be find helpful also chapter from elementary psychology by phillip habit _ habit be the tendency to make certain action automatic it be a great time saver and form the basis for training and the acquirement of skill _ once activity start in any direction the tendency be to persist until satisfaction be reach if the movement result in pain or even discomfort or if the end reach be not satisfactory the movement will be inhibit or discontinue and probably will not be attempt the second time whenever the end reach do give satisfaction the activity be sure to be repeat and in these later attempt effort will be make to reach the end more quickly and with less effort this be do through eliminate the unnecessary movement and combine the right one until the complete process be perform with ease and skill the repetition alone be not so important as the intelligent improvement of the act through practice until a satisfactory degree of skill be obtain after the desire end be reach attention to the process will cease but thereafter whenever the right stimulus be present the act will be repeat and this will be do with much less effort than be first employ further repetition of the act require less and less conscious effort until at length it will be perform almost with the same sureness and ease with which reflex or automatic movement take place any activity whatsoever when reduce to this automatic stage be term habit the importance of habit in the development of the child can scarcely be over-estimate in truth it be the one great process which dominate nine-tenth of all the activity of the individual throughout he entire life habit ought to be we most helpful and reliable servant but they be too often enemy that bind we hand and foot and prevent the realization of we highest possibility much of the training and education of the child consist therefore in acquire a series of useful habit and in inhibit act that might result in habit that be undesirable a child leave to himself or improperly rear will acquire all sort of undesirable habit which may have the effect of hamper he every movement and which may cause eventually he disgrace and failure in life even the adult who fail to practice the detail of the various activity connect with he vocation until they result in effective habit of work will usually fail while the man who have master the detail of he occupation through reduce they to a series of effective habit will surely succeed note the ease and perfection with which the skilled workman perform he labor and compare it with the slow slovenly work of the unskilled laborer one important development of the future will be the employment of a expert in each occupation whose business it will be to teach the workman the most efficient and economical way of do he particular work even now in many factory high-priced expert be secure whose duty it be to teach the workman how to eliminate all unnecessary movement in they work and how to combine the right movement necessary to accomplish each task in the best way and in the quickest time in many instance the output of the factory have be increase from twenty-five to forty per cent through this sensible procedure theoretically good habit should be as easy to acquire as bad one but practically this be not the case only a few bad habit be the result of conscious choice and effort for example the acquire of a liking for tobacco and liquor the taste of which for most child be disagreeable if not nauseate at first but this taste through practice often become a uncontrollable craving most bad habit however come about unconsciously and be the result of just let thing happen this undoubtedly be what the proverb mean which state man be bear to trouble as the spark be to fly upward most good habit on the other hand be the result of conscious effort especially on the part of parent and teacher a reason for this be that the strongest instinct in child be those relate to self-preservation and the gratification of personal desire hence selfishness greediness anger and the fight instinct be natural to the child while generosity good manners respect for the rights of other and sympathy require in order to be properly develop persistent effort and education parent therefore must persevere in training up the child in the way he should go if they would cultivate in he habit that bless he whole life imitation also play a remarkable part in the formation of habit the child learn to walk talk use he hand in certain way and to eat sleep and dress after the manner of he elder he use good language or bad accord to the example hear in fact nearly everything a child do be the result of copying after other whether he habit be good or bad efficient or slovenly therefore depend largely on the nature of the example he have to follow lesson viii question for discussion 1 how be habit form 2 give example to show that habit dominate most of the activity of life 3 why be good habit more difficult to form than bad one 4 illustrate the power of imitation in the formation of habit 5 what be the relation of habit to training and education 6 what be the relation of habit to the skilled workman 7 in what way can the expert increase efficiency in every vocation and profession 8 how might much time be save in the home and on the farm by the acquirement of effective habit in work _ reference _ : for further study of habit see phillip 's elementary psychology habit continue _ right habit must be acquire early wrong habit be break only through tremendous effort _ whatsoever the parent desire in he child in the nature of attainment or skill of character or ideal if not foreign to the nature of the child may be realize through attention to habit but the training in right habit should be accomplish during the golden age of childhood when body and soul be plastic and impression be easily make too early the character harden like cement and thereafter become well nigh impossible to change think how difficult it be for the adult but how easy for the child to acquire skill in music or facility in speak a foreign language with respect to moral virtue and spiritual sentiment whatsoever good fruit you look for in the man usually appear as seed and flower in the child among the habit that should be impressed early habit that be absolutely essential to success in life be the following : 1 promptness and regularity 2 obedience to right and justice 3 truthfulness and honesty 4 thoroughness 5 industry or the habit of work 6 persistence 7 temperance 8 courtesy and respect for the rights of other crowning these and transcend they in importance be the supreme sentiment and ideal of life which can not properly be regard as habit they be sympathy love faith reverence for religious conviction and the ideal of freedom or liberty society itself could not endure but for the stability which habit afford it be easy to denounce custom and tradition as obstacle to progress and reform but it should be remember that they be the social habit which society have acquire through register the experience of the past and that while some of they such as intemperance and sexual vice be destructive of society other like co-operation and the ideal of freedom be absolutely essential to human progress a example by oppenheim in he mental growth and control well illustrate the power of habit a wealthy woman in new york city become interested in the crowded tenement of the east side she believe that constant sickness unclean habit and the vicious character of the people be due largely to overcrowding she secure therefore some well furnished cottage in the suburb and offer they rent free until such time as the occupant should become well establish she surprise be great when they refuse to move into these comparatively luxurious quarter they seem to prefer the dirt and disease the sickness and vice to which they be accustom she do not know the force of habit she be totally ignorant of the hard and fast condition into which people grow she have never stop to consider how necessary it be for the world at large to have such repression without this control there could be no peace no safety no steady growth in civilized society the poor would attack the rich the lawless and violent would assail the peaceful the indolent would refuse to labor the regularity and study discipline of well-ordered life would absolutely cease in they place anarchy would reign and each day would make confusion worse confound imagine if you can what animal would be if they lack restraint of habit man 's power over they would cease instantly and they strength would be a terrible engine of destruction man would be as much worse as human intelligence exceed brute intelligence one be quite safe in declare that habit be the great flywheel that regulate society desirable habit therefore together with all necessary reform must come about slowly they should be the result of conscious training and education in all the factor that make for a higher civilization lesson ix question for discussion 1 what be some habit essential to success 2 when should training to fix these habit begin why 3 why do many parent fail to fix right habit in they child 4 how may wrong habit be overcome and right habit establish 5 what do solomon say in regard to train the child 6 give reason why community habit be so hard to change what be the good side of this strength of habit 7 what be the quickest and surest way to bring about desirable social reform maxim on habit _ professor jame give four maxim to follow in break from a old habit or in acquire a new one _ 1 _ take care ' o launch yourself with as strong and decide initiative as possible _ reinforce the right motive with every favorable circumstance put yourself in a condition that will make the right act easy and the wrong one difficult take a public pledge if the case allow in short envelop you resolution with every aid possible 2 _ never suffer a exception to occur until the new habit be securely root _ each lapse be like the let fall of a ball of yarn that be be wind a single slip undo more than a great many turn will wind again it be necessary above all thing never to lose a battle every gain on the wrong side undo the effect of many conquest on the right 3 _ seize every opportunity to act in the direction of the desire habit and permit no emotional prompt in its behalf to escape you _ ` hell be pave with good intention ' hence to have good desire thought intention without actually work they out weaken and destroy the moral fiber ` character be a completely fashion will ' say j mill and a will in this sense be a aggregate of tendency which act in a firm prompt and definite way in every emergency of life when a resolve or a fine glow of feeling be allow to evaporate without bear fruit in action it be worse than a chance lose it be a positive hindrance to the carry out of future resolution nothing be more contemptible than a sentimental dreamer who be carry away with lofty thought and feeling but who never do a manly concrete deed positive harm be do through cultivate the emotion and sentiment if no outlet be find for some appropriate action 4 _ keep the faculty of effort alive by a little gratuitous exercise every day _ that be be heroic do every day something for no other reason than that you would rather not do it so that when the hour of dire need come it may find you nerve and trim to stand the test the man who practice self-denial in unnecessary thing will stand like a tower when everything rock around he and when he softer fellow mortal be winnow like chaff in a blast the hell which theology once teach be no worse than the hell we make for ourselves by habitually fashion we character in the wrong way could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walk bundle of habit they would give more heed to they conduct while in the plastic state we be spin we own fate good or evil and never to be undo every small stroke of virtue or of vice leave its never so little scar the drunken rip van winkle excuse each drink he take by say ' i will not count this time ' he may not count it and a kind heaven may not count it but down among he nerve cell and in the muscle fiber the molecule be count it register and store it up to be use against he when the next temptation come nothing we do in a strict scientific sense be ever wipe out each thought and every deed be register in the soul and help to compose that book out of which we will be judge on that great final day when we be call upon to render a account of we stewardship notwithstanding the difficulty however habit may be strengthen or abolish the older they be the more difficult they will be to modify the chief factor involve be the amount of labor require to make the change the possibility of make it need never be question break the habit of excessive use of drug tobacco tea and coffee or alcohol will occasion much discomfort hardship and even functional disturbance but these ill be only temporary and the organism soon return to its original normal condition to break a well-established habit require common sense decision and strength of purpose if you want to abolish a habit you must grapple with the matter as earnestly as you would with a physical enemy you must go into the encounter with all tenacity of determination with all fierceness of resolve with a passion for success that may be call vindictive no human enemy can be as insidious as persevere as unrelenting as a unfavorable habit it never sleep it need no rest it have no tendency toward vacillation and lack of purpose it be like the parasite that grow with the growth of the support body and like a parasite it can best be kill by violent separation and crush every time we make a unsuccessful attempt the final crush be indefinitely postpone every time we put off the attempt the desire result fade farther and farther away the habit persist and from time to time the path become deeper and broader in addition during such a period of weakness and indecision you may be foster another habit that of expect defeat from this lack of confidence and little faith in yourself and destiny you must by all means escape at any cost there be nothing more pathetic than the man who do not believe in himself no one else will believe in he but he who have the enthusiasm of belief in himself and never lose sight of he high purpose be the one who can perform wonder lesson x question for discussion 1 discuss fully each of the maxim give by professor jame illustrate by experience you have know 2 what expression from professor jame be most impressive to you 3 what hope be there for those enslave by a bad habit how can we best help they 4 what be christ 's way of deal with such people 5 what be the common habit that most trouble we how can they be best prevent or overcome habit of infancy and childhood _ the first physical habit acquire by the child be of vast importance and require heroic treatment on the part of the mother _ from the begin both physical and mental habit will be acquire by the child at first attention must be give chiefly to the regularity of care for the physical need of the infant such as give food at state interval and have a regular time for sleep bathing and for be dress it be astonishing how little trouble be cause by the infant when it be train in correct physical habit from the beginning compare with the babe that be treat in a spasmodic fashion -- everything overdo sometimes and nothing at all do at other time in the former case the little one be quiet and peaceful and sleep as it should most of the time especially at night in the latter case the child be fretful and cross and require the father to trudge it about at night much to he discomfort and loss of temper nature have give the infant a voice which be not only lusty but which be apt to be use from the first with unnecessary liberality it be the little one 's only means of respond to stimulus that cause discomfort at first the infant 's cry be reflex and unconscious but if every time it cry something happen a sort of dim consciousness be soon awaken and the habit of cry for nothing or on the slightest provocation be soon establish and thereafter the child will rule the household like a czar if on the other hand the mother understand that the cry reflex be largely unnecessary at the present time since she have learn to administer to the infant 's every requirement with clock-like regularity she will when assure that nothing ail the child let it cry if it want to without give it the least attention one can scarcely believe how soon the cry reflex will disappear under such treatment if on the other hand the child be take up whenever it cry and walk and rock and fondle it quickly learn that individual be make solely to wait on it and the great instinct of selfishness be arouse which be likely to carry in its wake a world of trouble and disappointment who have not hear a cry child in a adjoining room stop suddenly to listen for the sake of discover whether or not the noise he hear be the regular movement of a person come to he or merely the irregular noise of the wind or of move furniture which do not concern he not only be the child plastic but too often a portion of the environment be also plastic and yielding and usually to the lasting detriment of the child the young mother who would train she child to right habit must be heroic when the little one be old enough to sit up in he high chair at the table he conduct be not apt to be meek and good-mannered he will snatch at thing and tip they over plunge he fist into the gravy and fill he mouth with food stuff it in with both hand until he choke he mother be usually ashamed and grieve at he barbarous conduct but she need not be she should remember that good table manners be artificial not natural and that they be by no mean a racial acquirement she must resort therefore to necessary means to correct the child even at time to physical punishment though she herself must leave the room to shed a quiet tear over such seeming cruelty place the spoon in he hand and help the child to make the necessary movement and punish he slightly if need be whenever he depart too far from propriety and it will be astonishing how quickly the conventional habit of table manners will be acquire the kindest mother be the one who be brave enough to inflict some punishment when this be the surest way to develop need habit that be unnatural to the child soon the child learn to crawl he do this because of the primal pleasure he have in bodily movement and because he have reach satisfaction in handle object within he grasp and since distant object will not come to he he must go to they and this he do as soon as he be able if object would come to he whenever he desire it be probable that he would not learn to crawl for a long time sometimes exceedingly awkward mode of crawl be acquire which if note and correct when first attempt would save much labor and pain afterward so long as crawl answer all demand and give full satisfaction it will be continue but usually because the child see other walk and possibly also because he himself have the instinctive desire to walk crawl be no longer satisfactory so he attempt to imitate the walking of he elder and through the aid and encouragement receive from they he accomplish this marvelous feat -- the greatest physical habit he will ever require lesson xi question for discussion 1 what be the first physical habit that the child should acquire 2 what result from spasmodic training in these habit 3 how should the cry reflex be treat 4 how be selfishness early arouse how can it be avoid 5 why should the young mother be heroic 6 how may table manners and other conventional habit be teach 7 why do the parent fail to implant right habit in they child the following will be find helpful for further study on this subject : the care of the baby by holt the care of the child in health by oppenheim the meaning of consciousness _ consciousness be express in know feeling and willing each phase of which should be develop fully and in perfect harmony _ as already remark the chief characteristic of the young child be ceaseless activity from the time he be able to walk or even crawl the great instinct of curiosity be alive and this at first be likely to lead he into all sort of place where he should not go and cause he to investigate and even destroy some of the value possession of the household this be a critical period in the development of the child and must be handle with rare judgment some knowledge of child psychology be essential here to guide the parent about this time three type of mental activity will be note in the child -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ feeling _ be one phase or type which express itself sometimes in pleasure or pain and at other time in action or anger the feeling phase of consciousness give color and tone to every act of life it be the basis of interest without it neither happiness nor sorrow could exist nor could there be faith or worship when fully develop it culminate in the emotion and sentiment the highest of which be friendship and sympathy love and duty patriotism and reverence the opposite of some of these be anger hate and jealousy feeling make heaven or hell a possibility and sometimes a actuality -lrb- 2 -rrb- the _ know _ phase of mental activity be aware of the outside world as well as of itself it form image of thing and remember in its higher aspect it judge and reason this phase of consciousness make possible invention and scientific achievement by and through it man overcome he environment and make himself the master of the earth -lrb- 3 -rrb- the _ volitional _ or _ will _ phase of mental activity be first manifest in the impulsive spasmodic movement heretofore describe later these random movement be bring under control then come the ability to select a desire stimulus from among several that be possible and at length the power to choose between two or more possible mode of action this highest form be term voluntary action or will power it be extremely important to note that the will be not a separate power or faculty which can be cultivate apart from other phase of consciousness many foolish thing have be write about the power of the will and its capacity for infinite development as a matter of fact all three phase of consciousness must be develop together every act of the mind of necessity embrace all three phase since it be impossible to know without feeling or to experience feeling or know without activity the will therefore can never be quite so strong as the total consciousness and at every stage it need the feeling phase to give it motive and the know phase to make it rational know feeling and willing therefore be merely convenient term that express the vary change mode of consciousness which at one time may be predominately feel at another know and again willing the great fact to remember be that consciousness develop as a unit and the most highly trained mind be the one in which each phase be develop not only to its maximum but at the same time in perfect harmony with the other two as well as with the total consciousness it be impossible to say which of the three phase develop first in the infant nor be it important to know the significant fact be that all three evolve together and whenever activity be strong and well sustain it be evident that feeling and know also be well develop when the child be two year of age or over as above remark usually a appalling desire to destroy thing be manifest doll will be tear to piece the toy bank smash and if a hammer can be have nothing be too sacred to be knock to piece this be not depravity in the child much as it seem to be it be a legitimate desire to investigate to satisfy he curiosity and to find a means of satisfy he increase power to do something up to this time a object be to the child merely the activity for which it stand a ball be something to roll or toss a hammer be to strike with and it be a matter of supreme indifference to he what be strike at this stage the child have no sense of value and he can not possibly know that one object may be hit with a hammer while another object such as a mirror may not he must be teach this fact at first it be entirely beyond he experience but the child now have considerable capacity for know hence the wise parent can easily and quickly teach he to discriminate and even to be careful to avoid injury to certain object no attempt should be make to suppress this new-born power of this searcher after truth this instinct be the basis of invention and of scientific research it must be properly guide but not subdue give he plaything which can be take to piece and put together doll which can be dress and undressed horse which can be harness and fasten to cart block which can be build into various form and above all for a boy a large soft block of wood with plenty of nail tack and a hammer the amount of energy he will expend in fill the block with tack or nail be astonishing other appropriate way of express he energy should also be provide give the child something to do this rule ought to be rigidly observe : _ never cut straight across the activity of a child but always substitute some other act in place of the one not desire _ lesson xii question for discussion 1 how be the great instinct of curiosity at first manifest 2 what three phase of consciousness be there how do these develop 3 what be mean by a well-trained mind 4 what explain the child 's tendency to destroy thing how may this tendency be best overcome 5 what rule should the parent carefully follow with relation to the child 's activity 6 what be some sensible activity that may be easily provide for child 7 why be it worth while for parent to devote some time or even money to provide for the natural activity of child to express themselves in the right way for further study selection from elementary psychology by phillip will be find helpful positive vs negative training _ train the positive side of the child 's nature and the negative side will need little attention _ a negative method train the child to be hard and critical and to be constantly look for opposition to he wish it be the chief cause also of slyness ill-temper and disrespect the follow illustration be take from mr harrison 's inspiring little book entitle a study of child nature a mother come to I in utter discouragement say : ` what shall i do with my five-year-old boy he be simply the personification of the word _ will not _ ' after the conversation i walk home with she a beautiful child with golden curl and great dancing black eye come run out to meet we and with all the impulsive joy of childhood throw he arm about she ` do not do that jame you will muss mama 's dress ' i know at once where the trouble lay in a moment she say : ` do not twist so my son ' and ` do not make such a noise ' within a few minute the mother have use ` do not ' five time no wonder when she say ` run in the house now mama will come in a minute ' he reply : ` no i do not want to ' two older child be play in a room and soon become boisterous the busy mother do not notice they but the little two-year-old child turn round and call out impatiently : ` boy ` top ' baby like parrot learn the word they hear most frequently ` boy stop ' a negative command have no doubt be use frequently in that household how easy it would have be to substitute the positive statement : ` boy run out in the back yard and play ball ' or ` run out into the garden and bring I some flower for the table ' a four-year-old boy when he first enter the kindergarten be the most complete embodiment of negative training i have ever meet it be ` no i do not want to ' ` no i will not sit by that boy ' ` no i do not like block ' nothing pleased he nothing satisfied he he be already a isolate character unhappy himself and a source of discomfort to other soon after begin we work i hear a whiz sound and paul 's voice cry out : ` joseph have knock my soldier off the table and he do it on purpose too ' my first impulse be to say : ` why do you do that it be naughty go and pick up paul 's soldier ' but that would have be negative treatment too much of which have be heap upon he already so instead i say : ` oh well paul never mind joseph do not know that we try to make each other happy in kindergarten ' some time afterwards i say : ` come here joseph i wish you to be my messenger boy ' this be a privilege highly desire by the child joseph come reluctantly as if expect some hidden censure but soon he be busy run back and forth give each child the proper material for the next half-hour 's work as soon as the joy of service have melt he into a mood of comradeship i whisper : ` run over now and get paul 's soldier ' instantly he obey pick it up and place it on the table before its owner quietly slip into he own place and begin he work he whole nature for the time be be change continued treatment of this kind completely transform the nature of the child scolding and finding fault be the most common form of negative training employ by parent such treatment bring out and emphasize the opposite quality from those desire since they appeal to the very worst side of the child 's nature usually too the sympathy of the mother and the affection of the child be separate and coldness take they place suggest to the child at the right time the act you wish he to do and usually it will be quickly accomplish then if a child be praise a little for he promptness he will soon grow into the habit of do promptly other more important task the boy who dally over everything he do be soon cure by the simple device of count while he run a errand and then praise he for he quick return a little praise go farther than much censure sometimes a boy 's tone and manner be lack in respect to he mother or a girl become troublesome and defy authority this condition do not come about suddenly it be the result of continued negative treatment usually if a boy be disrespectful or a girl impudent it be because the parent through neglect or improper training have unconsciously foster such behavior some child be timid and superstitious too often they be laugh at and ridicule on the other hand fun should never be make of such child and they should be give every opportunity to develop courage and self-reliance if a child be irreverent he should have he eye open to the wonder of creation and to the majesty and power display by the maker of the universe so in all case the parent should beware of the almost universal negative mode of training which repress scold find fault and result in produce hardness slyness obstinacy and other undesirable quality instead positive method should be employ they suggest correct action substitute the right for the wrong praise for blame encouragement rather than discouragement and stimulate to higher endeavor however if occasion demand parent may be stern unrelenting and even resort to punishment lesson xiii question for discussion 1 what be the main point of this lesson 2 discuss the will not child 3 discuss the do not boy 4 discuss scolding and finding fault versus judicious praise 5 what be the value of suggestion in guide child illustrate 6 what often explain disrespect and impudence in child 8 illustrate some helpful way that give positive training to child selection from the dawn of character by mumford will be find helpful for further study on this subject food dress and toy _ the body be more than raiment and life more than meat _ the normal child be bear in a state of naturalness with respect to he taste and appetite and the endeavor should be to keep he in this natural state but too often he sens be stimulate to excess and a artificial appetite be begin which usually lead to some form of intemperance much of the excess in drinking be due not to inheritance but to vicious feed a false appetite lead to physical unrest and uneasiness and this naturally lend itself to the pleasure and excitement of drink why do you not eat the pickle my son say one father they be very nice no say the boy i do not see any use in eat spiced pickle it do not help to make I strong my teacher say so would that every child be thus train to prefer wholesome to unwholesome food we school be do good work along these line of personal hygiene parent should reinforce the effort of the teacher by bring the home hygiene up to the right standard the clothing of child also deserve some attention probably in nothing else be vanity and selfishness more easily display than in dress how rare a thing it be to find a beautiful child simply or even plainly dress who be neither vain of she good look nor of she rich apparel the sweetest object in the world be a beautiful child tastily dress free from vanity and perfectly natural and unspoiled the mother who praise she child 's curl or rosy cheek rather than the child 's action or inner motive be develop vanity of the worst kind -- place beauty of appearance above beauty of conduct fashionable party for child be abomination upon the face of the earth soon enough the child will come in contact with that which be unnatural and deceitful without have artificial conduct force upon he lesson xiv question for discussion 1 what may result from develop a artificial appetite in child 2 what should the young mother avoid in feed she child 3 what evil result from over-indulgence in candy nick-nacks soda water etc 4 in the dress of child how be vanity often develop 5 what may result from constant praise of the good look of the child 6 discuss proper dress in child for further help on these point read mr harrison 's study of child nature page 47 to 54 cultivate the emotion _ it be a serious mistake to begin educate the intellect before train the emotion _ in the history of the race art develop before science just as in nature the blossom come before the fruit so in the child emotion come before reason and he be attract and he sympathy arouse by nearly any appeal to he sens long before he understanding tell he why notwithstanding this fact nearly every educative effort be confine to the intellect and the feeling be allow to shift for themselves the result be that many a child grow up cold hard and matter-of-fact with little of color poetry or sympathy to enrich he life the common mistake be to starve the emotion in order to overfeed the understand the education of the heart must keep pace with that of the head if a well-balanced character be to be develop even in school the teacher too often proceed to stuff the child with information before first awakening interest in the subject once arouse the interest of a child in any subject and he will pursue it to success toy be of much value to child not only as promoter of play but because they appeal to they sympathy and give exercise to the emotion the two great obstacle to the exercise of the right emotion be fear and pity toy be great aid in overcome these tendency through dramatic play with toy child exercise they own imagination and put action into they own life and gradually fear and pity be overcome through the confidence the child develop in himself we find the instinct of the race renew in each new-born infant each individual child desire to master he surroundings he can not yet drive a real horse and wagon but he very soul delight in the three-inch horse and the gaily-painted wagon he can not tame real tiger and lion but he eye dance with pleasure as he place and replace the animal of he toy menagerie he can not at present run engine or direct railway but he can control for a whole half-hour the movement of he miniature train he be not yet ready for real fatherhood but he can pet and play with and rock to sleep and tenderly guard the doll baby through toy the child practise in miniature most of the activity of the adult and thus gradually bridge the chasm between he small capacity and the great reality and possibility of life the heart should be train as carefully as the head we emotion even more than we reason govern we train the child to feel rightly to admire the good the true and the beautiful and you need not fear he will develop a love of home of country and of god that will carry he safely throughout all he life this do not mean that we shall neglect the training of he intellect both heart and head should be train together but the heart must not be neglect for out of it say the good book come the issue of life lesson xv question for discussion 1 what may result from cultivate the intellect in child before stimulate the emotion 2 which govern we most we feeling or we reason 3 how can we develop best the right emotion in childhood such as kindness and unselfishness 4 in what way may toy help to develop the child discuss here proper and improper toy which be preferable doll or teddy bear in develop motherly instinct what about soldier firearm etc in they effect on boy for further reading on this point mr harrison 's study on child nature will be find helpful let some member report from the book if it be available deal particularly with page 66 to 70 the influence of love _ love be the vital element which transform human nature and make life worth live _ the sweetest word in all the language be _ love _ without it life be a frozen tundra where the sun never shine home be beautiful because there be love if a planet exist where love be absent then it contain no fire-side the laughter of child be never hear flower do not grow there and the singing of bird be unknown if selfishness be ever overcome if it be ever transform into service it will be when love be triumphant for love alone be great enough to sacrifice itself for another love only can reach the sublime height of faith and exaltation of reverence and worship love alone have the power to say though he slay I yet will i trust in he there be however a strange contradiction or opposition in love sometimes it be as weak and timid as a bashful girl at other time as strong and heroic as a amazon now it be like the harmony in music or the delicate coloring of a sunset again like the thunderous roar of niagara or the consuming fire of vesuvius love be a instrument with many string some so delicate that they catch the sweetest symphony of the soul other so powerful that they resound to the mighty storm and tempest of life and some so vibrant that they throb to the sorrow and heartache of a bleeding world affection be awaken in the child with he first smile in recognition of he mother 's face how shall this bud affection be rightly nurture and develop so that it shall flower and bring forth good fruit it be desire that he shall be generous and possess good will towards other that he shall have sympathy and the spirit of sacrifice for those dear to he but too often the fruit of promise be eat into by the worm of selfishness selfishness be the most universal of sin and the most hateful dante place lucifer the embodiment of selfishness down below all other sinner in the dark pit of the inferno freeze in a sea of ice well do the poet know that this sin lay at the root of all other think if you can of one crime or vice which have not its origin in selfishness as already state the primary instinct of the child favor the development of selfishness and the gratification of the appetite and passion the utmost care therefore must be exercise by the parent from the very begin if the affection and desire of the child be to be train away from itself and not permit to become self-centered happy be the child whose mother know how to direct those earliest manifestation of love the undisciplined sens and appetite easily degenerate into indulgence of passion or grow into that moral control which delight in temperance the inborn desire for praise and recognition may express itself in brag vanity or expand into heroic endeavor so too there be a physical love which express itself in a mere caress and a higher purer more glorious love which manifest itself in service and self-sacrifice the tremendous hug of the little arm and the kiss of the rosy lip be manifestation of physical love while the child be in this loving mood the wise mother should ask of he some little service slight at first but sufficient to make he put forth some effort to serve she in this way she can transform this mere selfish love into the beginning of that spiritual love which christ commend when he say if ye love I keep my commandment the parent stand to he child for the time be as the one supreme source of every power and blessing the wise parent may establish between himself and the little one almost the same beautiful and solemn relationship as that which exist between the supreme giver of all good and he child not every one that sayeth unto I ` lord lord ' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which be in heaven love be to be test always by its effect upon the will from the begin the will must be make strong and unselfish by repeat act of loving self-sacrifice contrast the selfish all-absorbing love of romeo for juliet who could not live without the physical presence of the one he love with that grandly beautiful love of hector for andromache who out of the very love he bear she could place she to one side and answer the stern call of duty that she might never in the future have cause for painful blush i know a ideal home where husband and wife be fill with the most exalted love i have ever know but the husband die the wife say : ` all that be beautiful or attractive in my life go out with my husband and yet i know that i must for the love i bear he remain and rear we child as he would have he rear ' as i listen to these word quietly utter by the courageous wife i realize what love real love could help the poor stricken heart to endure the child must be train through love to give up he own will to other and from the beginning learn to submit to thing which be unpleasant if this thought be insist on from the first obedience will come easily to the child but woe be to both mother and child if egotism self-will and selfishness secure a fast hold upon the young heart a mother should never refuse the help offer by the child if the work be of such nature that the little one can not share it let the mother suggest as a substitute something else which the child can do help turn away beget idleness and nourish selfishness no dear you can not help dress baby but you may hand mama the clothes a six-year-old boy who have be teach true love through service find he mother one morning too ill to answer he many question ` mama can not talk to you to-day philip she have a severe headache ' he quietly close the door and soon there be a mysterious bumping and move about of the heavy furniture in the next room soon it all be still then the door be gently open and little philip tiptoe to he mother 's bed and whisper ` mama i have straighten the furniture and tidy up the room be you headache better ' a little three-year-old boy run rapidly stumble and bump he head severely against the trunk of a tree loud cry of pain at once arise but he little brother take he by the arm and push he with all he might towards he mother say in the most reassuring tone imaginable ` run to mama ned run to mama she 'll kiss it and make it well please run to she quick ' ` perfect love casteth out all fear ' surely the wise mother can devise a thousand way by which to kindle the flame of love in she child until she fond dream for the little one be transform into live reality but the doubter may remark ` what if i ask my child to do something for I and he refuse or begin to make excuse or ask why he brother can not do it ' you have simply mistake the time for stretch the young soul 's wing begin the training when the child be in the loving mood and you will rarely fail to get the desire response yet if need be command the performance of the deed so that by repeat do the selfish heart may at length learn the pleasure of unselfishness and thus enter into the joy of true living let parent take this motto to heart : _ trust not the physical love of you child but seek to transform it into that higher love which manifest itself in service the real love of you child be measure by the extent to which he will sacrifice he own comfort and pleasure to serve you _ lesson xvi question for discussion 1 why have the delicate sentiment of love such a power in shape the life of man 2 what may be say of selfishness 3 how may the desire for praise be express 4 contrast physical and spiritual love 5 how may love help to develop a strong will 6 how must the child be teach obedience 7 illustrate how loving service may be secure 8 how may the real love of the child for the parent be measure moral training _ there be no escape from wrong-doing mercy can not rob justice _ somehow i 'll escape be the fatal thought which blind the poor fool who for the first time tread the path of self-indulgence or wrong-doing but he ought to know that escape be impossible no cave be dark enough no ocean deep enough to hide the transgressor from the consequence of he misdeed a kind heaven may forgive he and the one he injure may overlook the offence but he own body and mind can not forget they have register the deed once for all and it can never be atone for or forget the do of a bad deed change the individual in some particular slight or great as the case may be and pathetic though it seem he can not go back and try it over again the scar remain as if sear by a hot iron and if the hurt be serious enough heredity may pass it down the age how easily a bad habit be form it will not hurt I be whisper by the siren voice of temptation because the consequence of the transgression be not feel or see immediately a second offence seem less serious than the first soon habit step in and stamp the process on mind and body and before the author be conscious of it a serious appetite or a degrading vice be fasten upon he from which neither time nor effort prayer nor tear may ever shake he free _ vice be a monster of such frightful mien that to be hate need but to be see but see too oft familiar with its face we first endure then pity then embrace _ -- pope the child must be train early to know : the way of the transgressor be hard and he that sow the wind must reap the whirlwind it be a great mistake for the parent to step in and free the child from the consequence of he first wrong act let the consequence fall on he own head and perchance they will teach he wisdom the true purpose of punishment be to teach the necessity of obedience to law everything that be good and desirable will come to he who obey the law upon which the blessing be predicate every evil fall on the head of he who constantly violate law in the final analysis the punishment which nature inflict be kind because they be warning which if heed will prevent serious injury the purpose of all discipline be to produce a self-governing individual not one who need to be govern by someone else until a person learn to govern himself he count for little in this world two serious mistake be make in child government one be the indulgence of a soft vacillate policy by the parent which permit a child to shirk he duty and to escape from the natural result of he misdeed through the parent 's take upon he own shoulder the consequence of the child 's wrong-do the child be lure into the false belief that duty may be shirk responsibility set aside and life be make to yield one sweet round of pleasure how will a child so trained be prepare to endure the disappointment and heartache of a world which compel each of we to drink he portion of the bitter hemlock the other mistake be to employ unnatural or arbitrary punishment even the smallest child have a instinctive idea of justice and resent anything which he regard as unjust on the other hand he learn quickly the inevitableness with which pain follow the violation of law and how certain be the work out of cause and effect mr harrison give this admirable illustration : the little one put he hand upon the hot stove no whirlwind from without rush in and push the hand away from the stove then with loud and vengeful blast scold he for he heedlessness or wrong-doing he simply be burn -- the natural consequence of he own deed and the fire quietly glow on regardless of the pain which he be suffer if again he transgress the law again he be burn as quietly as before with no expostulation threat or warn he quickly learn the lesson and avoid the fire thereafter bear no grudge against it when the child scatter she toy and plaything all over the room the natural penalty be to require that they be gather up and the room make tidy when the boy scamper across the newly-cleaned floor with he muddy boot he should be make to mop up the floor carefully thus in a thousand similar way the parent may train the child to observe care and order in everything do nothing be more beautiful than a large family where each child be teach to care for and to rely upon himself and to give a little willing service to other but the tired mother will remark oh yes that all sound very nice but mother have no time to spare to eternally watch and train they child hold a moment there be a fallacy here she ought to say i have no time to spare because i fail to train the child in the manner mention in no other way can the mother save so much time as by take a little time at first to train the child to be neat tidy and orderly or later to feel the inevitable consequence of violate law instead of save time in this sensible way too often the mother lose both time and the love of she child through become irritable and scold the little one for every offence commit nothing be worse than scold a sound thrashing administer now and then be far less cruel nearly every evil instinct in the child be arouse through fault-finding and scolding how long will it take to teach the parent once for all that scold nagging shut up in the dark closet and every other form of arbitrary punishment arouse in the child a sense of injustice and resentment which if not correct later will result in estrangement and loss of love between parent and child the child have a right to expect justice from he parent only where this be find will the child develop that sense of freedom and independence of thought and action which produce the highest type of individual -- one who be able to govern himself but what shall be do when more serious offence be commit the parent may well ask in all likelihood there will be no serious offence if the slight one be treat properly a mother come to I with she face full of suppress suffering what shall i do she remark i have discover that my boy steal money from he father 's purse give he a purse of he own i answer and give he way of earn money of he own it be assert that more than half the boy send to reform school go there because of theft how many of they might have be save if they have be teach how to earn and to know the value of a honest dollar but so long as human nature be imperfect and frailty so common we must expect in every family some occasion to arise that will tax the patience and the love of the parent to the uttermost no rule can be give that will meet every crisis common sense justice forbearance faith and love may be use in vain and reproof censure and corporal punishment may also fail in some supreme emergency the only recourse that remain after all these be exhaust be to permit the natural consequence of the deed to fall upon the head of the transgressor rule : _ parent should rarely punish the child but should permit the consequence of carelessness and wrong-doing to fall upon he own head wisdom result from suffering pain and taking pain _ lesson xvii question for discussion 1 why do evil consequence follow bad deed 2 in what sense be nature 's punishment kind 3 what two mistake be common in child government 4 illustrate how natural punishment may be employ by parent 5 what may be resort to in serious case for further discussion and study of this subject the follow reference will be find helpful : 1 chapter on moral education from spencer 's education 2 deal with moral crisis by cope from religious education in the family 3 misunderstand child by harrison adolescence _ the adolescent period be a time of storm and stress when the chief crisis of life arise _ most writer on psychology recognize in the life history of the child several more or less distinct period of development the child be almost a different be at different level of he growth each period be mark by peculiar physical mental and moral characteristic which demand specific treatment so great and sudden be some of these change that they be sometimes liken to a metamorphosis indicate a analogy with certain insect as a change from the larva and pupa stage to that of butterfly space will not permit more than a brief account of the most critical of these period namely the adolescent this period begin at about the age of thirteen in girl and fourteen in boy and continue until about eighteen physically this stage start with a very rapid growth which be frequently double in rate within a single year the girl may in a few month change from a tall angular romp tomboy into a bloom dimpled young woman bashful and afraid so much energy be require for physical growth that in the early stage of this period difficult mental task can not be well do in a young man especially this period be mark by awkward uncouth movement that indicate uncertain adjustment frequently at this time the boy 's voice vary unsteadily from a high falsetto to a low pitch which be most mortifying to the youth who be now bashful probably for the first time in he life the girl be suddenly very particular about she appearance and she clothes and the youth for the first time delight in a starched shirt patent leather shoe and bright neck-tie the health of the individual at this time be usually good susceptibility to the disease peculiar to childhood be slight but there be increase danger of acquire adult disease and some writer claim that it be during this time when there be great physical disturbance that the germ of many adult disease such as tuberculosis be apt to be implant during the early part of this period it be unwise and dangerous for girl to take part in such strenuous athletic game as basketball or for boy to indulge in football later when strength and equilibrium have be restore these game may be practice without danger but the greatest of all change the one fundamental to adolescent life be the development of the sex instinct fortunate be the youth or maiden whose parent be sensible and wise enough to instruct they concern the nature and purpose of these function good book such as what a boy should know and what a girl should know be invaluable during this critical time this sudden ripening of the sex instinct be the cause of the metamorphosis from childhood to early manhood and womanhood and be the key which explain the change that characterize adolescence emotionally there be a tremendous awaken the individual begin to feel for the first time that he be actually alive and live heretofore life have be a self-centered matter-of-fact existence now it enlarge and become charge with intense feeling and significance fear anger love pity jealousy emulation and ambition be either new-born or spring into intense life -- jame all of these may be term social instinct and they imply a widening of the youth 's horizon and include a consciousness of kind that have heretofore be lack now the youth or maiden truly fall in love up to this time regard for the opposite sex have be merely a light fancy barely skin deep but now it take hold of the heart string and play upon they with a agony that be truly heart rending who be there with red blood in he vein that do not look back upon he first heart conflict with almost pathetic reverence parent should be more concerned than they usually be over the conquest of the heart of youth such affair may carry with they consequence which be more serious than could be anticipate at this time the youth or maiden be exceedingly resentful of arbitrary restraint or punishment there be a super-sensitiveness and a keen self-consciousness which can not brook harshness and coercion sympathy and reasonableness must take the place of censure and punishment year ago i remember see a father start to whip he boy who be just emerge into the adolescent stage a heavy stick be raise to strike but the boy look he father in the eye without flinch and quietly remark : you may whip one devil out father but i promise you that you 'll whip seven devil in the stick drop from the astonished parent 's hand the boy be never again punish by whipping the runaway curve for boy reach its highest point at this time and the girl be likely to be insolent and unmanageable probably for the first and only time in she life the greatest crisis of life arise at this time because of the almost criminal ignorance of parent respect these revolutionary change and also because child who may never before have cause the parent the least trouble or heartache be now as unruly and unmanageable as a volcano in eruption this be the time when the youth be drive from home by the irate father the time when the rebellious daughter be condemn without mercy the critical period when most vice be begin and most juvenile crime commit the parent be apt to exclaim here : in heaven 's name what can be do not even the wisdom of a solomon could answer completely a few suggestion however may be offer which will help to bridge over this critical period if the child have have positive training up to this time the period of storm and stress will be briefer and less severe than it would be otherwise but if the negative training have prevail there be less hope that the storm will be weather the youth may be catch in the stream of dissipation and whirl to destruction at the very least the parent must expect fitful and obstinate behavior and unreasonable action in boy the beginning of the use of tobacco and liquor usually come at this time this be the time too of sexual temptation if not actual indulgence the temptation to do something startling be almost irresistible robbery will be plan hold-up think of abduction contemplate the life of a desperado entertain the moral character seem to be in a state of eruption on the other hand he sympathy and affection may be appeal to as never before the parent who have make a confident of he boy or girl who have infinite patience and affection and who fully sens what to except may if other factor be favorable help tide over this danger zone without serious result a steady chum a little older than the boy and a companion more stable than the girl be a most fortunate aid to the parent there seem to be a brief time in the career of every youth or maiden when the influence of he chum or companion be more potent for good or evil than be the combined influence of parent and relative the common practice of permit the adolescent to sleep away from home be exceedingly dangerous many a youth may trace the beginning of he degeneracy to the downward push receive when he sleep away from home care must be exercise also as to the kind of group he associate with it be too much to expect a youth to be better than the gang with whom he consort during the most critical part of this critical epoch neither youth nor maiden should attend party picnic or social entertainment without a chaperon this advice may seem radical but if it be carry out perhaps for just one year until equilibrium be restore it may prevent that _ one act _ to which so many unfortunate attribute they downfall fortunate too be the adolescent who be permit to attend a first-class high school teach by sympathetic teacher who understand the need of adolescent nature the imagination be now more vivid than it ever will be again the logical reason be begin to evolve and this period be preeminently the breed ground of idea the school more than any other agency can keep the imagination reason and emotion so fully employ that little time be leave in which to indulge morbid feeling and immoral thought the school afford a moral atmosphere and give a choice of good associate which make it invaluable during this critical epoch it also discipline the feeling and emotion and offer opportunity for emulation industry and the display of both physical and mental power in truth the school so occupy the attention and direct the interest that many a young man and woman pass through this period unscathed without ever sense the danger which be escape finally a profound religious awakening characterize the early adolescent stage it may be doubt that a genuine religious conviction can exist before this time at least most writer hold that religious conversion take place if at all during this period previous to this time however religious observance and ceremony should have become habitual in order that conversion may be most profound nothing else be more powerful than religious conviction and sentiment to reinforce good conduct and to inhibit wrong action religious conviction together with the growth of ideal and the employment by the school of the physical and intellectual capacity all supplement by parental counsel and guidance should insure the safe passage of the adolescent over this critical crisis of he life lesson xviii question for discussion 1 what be the physical change that occur during the adolescent period 2 what danger to health be common at this time what safeguard should be throw about the youth to keep he strong in body 3 discuss the mental moral and emotional characteristic of the adolescent 4 what be the fundamental cause of the change that take place 5 what may be say about religious emotion and conversion during this time 6 what practical suggestion would you give to help the parent guide the adolescent safely over this dangerous period of life _ supplemental study _ : at this point it will be well to take the supplemental lesson in this book page 133 to end of volume these study be base on the lecture give by dr john m tyler they will blend beautifully with professor hall 's discussion and will reinforce strongly the study of this adolescent age training in the home _ certain phase of training and education can be best accomplish by the home _ there be four great agency or factor concern in the training and education of the child : these be the home the school the church and the state or society of these the home ought to be the most helpful since it be the most important the child be a part of the flesh and blood of the parent he belong to they in a vital way that transcend he relationship to everything else in the world the parent then be the natural trainer and educator of the child particularly during the dependent period before the age of accountability be reach the parent ought not to shirk this duty or attempt to transfer it to some other agency but at the present time there be a strong tendency to shift more and more responsibility to other agency especially to the school many habit which the home once develop be now leave largely to the school religious training be turn over more and more to the Sunday school and the church and much more of the time of child be now spend in social amusement away from home than ever before then too it be certain that the old-time home be pass it seem to have higher ideal and more definite purpose in life than home now possess moreover it occupy most of the time of the child and teach he to be industrious and proficient and to regard life with much more seriousness than do the home of to-day the home or the family therefore be not the great superlative factor that it ought to be in the training and education of the child from the first chapter of cope in religious education in the family the follow be quote : the ill of the modern home be symptomatic divorce childless family irreverent child and a decadence of the old type of separate home life be sign of forget ideal lose motive and insufficient purpose when the home be only a opportunity for self-indulgence it easily become a cheap board house a sleep shelf a implement for social advantage while it be true that general economic development have effect marked change in domestic economy the happiness and efficiency of the family do not depend wholly on the parlor the kitchen or the clothes closet rather everything depend on whether the home and family be consider in worthy and adequate term home be wreck because family refuse to take home life in religious term in social term of sacrifice and service in such home organize and conduct to satisfy personal desire rather than to meet social responsibility these desire become aim rather than agency and opportunity what hope be there for useful and happy family life if the newly-wedded youth have both be educate in selfishness habituate to frivolous pleasure and guide by ideal of success in term of garish display it be a costly thing to keep a home where honor the joy of love and high ideal dwell ever it cost time pleasure and so-called social advantage as well as money and labor it must cost think study and investigation it demand and deserve sacrifice it be too sacred to be cheap the building of a home be a work that endure to eternity and that kind of work never be do with ease or without pain and loss and investment of much time patient study of the problem of the family be a part of the price which all may pay no nobler social work no deeper religious work no higher educational work be do anywhere than that of the man and woman high or humble who set themselves to the fitting of they child for life 's business equip they with principle and habit upon which they may fall back in try hour and making of home the sweetest strongest holiest happiest place on earth the home or family be or ought to be the supreme institution not only for propagate the race but also for the preservation and rearing of child there be certain thing which only the home can do which if not accomplish by it will likely remain undo the acquisition of correct physical habit by the child be one of they it be preeminently the duty and privilege of the parent in the early year of the child 's life to impress habit that will make for health and strength the first six year be more important physically to the child than all the remainder of he life during this time the natural tendency to over-indulgence of the appetite should be inhibit and temperance should be reduce to a habit the other desirable physical habit already refer to should also be acquire furthermore it be the sacred duty of the parent to see to it that the child be not handicap through physical defect of eye or ear enlarged tonsil adenoids decay tooth or by any other common imperfection which may be easily and permanently remedy if take in time but which if neglect may cause untold suffering and contribute to failure in life the home be responsible directly for train the child to be neat tidy and clean in person it should also train he in good manners courtesy and regard for the rights of other it also decide whether or not the boy shall be a brave manly little fellow or a timid cry-baby whether or not the girl shall be sweet helpful and trustworthy or shallow idle and vain the give of knowledge and instruction in sex hygiene at the proper time be also a peculiar duty of parent which they must not shirk the chief moral virtue be also the result of home train a obedient honest truthful disposition be characteristic of a good home a sly deceitful quarrelsome nature be the outcome of improper home influence moreover the first lesson in respect for law order and justice be implant by the home improper training in these virtue lead to disorder and license the home too must teach the first lesson in industry and impress the child with the fact that life be make up of work as well as play too often the mother especially make a slave of herself for the child wait on they night and day allow they to sleep late in the morning stay up late at night and keep up a incessant round of pleasure while she herself stay at home and shoulder the entire responsibility of the household how much happier the home where each child be train to do some particular share of work and to take some responsibility upon himself the boy should be permit to help the father whenever possible he should be require to do thing promptly and regularly and to learn through actual experience the amount of toil and sweat require to earn a honest dollar a taste for music and reading must be foster in the home every family should have some kind of musical instrument and at least a few choice book for child the influence of music and good literature on the taste and ideal of the future man and woman be so great that it can scarcely be over-estimate the use of correct and fluent language be largely a product of the home child imitate the speech hear at home if this be incorrect meager or coarse the child be apt to have the same imperfection follow he through life the family constitute a most sacred and important social unit and because of its intrinsic nature it can best develop in the child the highest personal sentiment and social virtue among these be affection sympathy love generosity and good will if these be not awaken and nurture by the home then there be little hope that they will be acquire elsewhere and the child will likely grow into a stony-hearted selfish pessimist certain religious habit and sentiment also can be impressed naturally and well only by the family among these be trust in god the beginning of faith regard for ceremony love of bible story respect for authority and above all prayer the individual who have not be teach at he mother 's knee to pray be likely never to develop into a prayerful man or woman the home be the child 's earliest school he first temple of worship he first social center it be the place where everything in this life begin most fortunate be the child that be guide to take he first step aright through the loving influence of a good home lesson xiv question for discussion 1 what four great agency be concern in training and education 2 which be most important and why 3 what be the indictment of the home 4 what change have take place respect the relative importance of these develop agency 5 the home be responsible for what physical habit 6 what moral habit and virtue 7 what mental habit and virtue 8 what religious habit and sentiment 9 what be the future outlook for the home and family it will be well at this point to review briefly the three begin chapter from religious education in the family by cope the peril and preservation of the home by jacob rii will also be find helpful reading here training by the church _ the influence of the church be essential to aid the home in develop the religious instinct and emotion of the child _ religious emotion and belief be among the most deeply imbedded instinct of the race they be also some of the earliest manifestation of childhood they accompany the individual throughout he entire life exercise a profound influence over he thought and conduct and they become the chief anchor of the soul when sorrow or old age come it would be a great calamity therefore if religious instinct and sentiment should suffer eclipse or disappear rightly cultivate and train these natural feeling of religion grow to spiritual power within we without such power man be of little consequence upon the home naturally fall the duty of foster the first feeling of reverence towards god the child who learn to lisp he prayer at he mother 's knee be start aright the home must give the first lesson in the love of god and goodness if it fail they be likely never to be learn but the home need the influence of the church here it must have it to round out the child 's religious development the church can do many thing for the child that the home can not accomplish it introduce he to religious ceremony and observance that satisfy he soul and it help greatly to train he in religious habit one can not estimate the value of all this upon the character of the child as a restraint from wrong conduct and a encouragement to right action the work of the church be most salutary the solemn ceremony the sacred music the exhortation point heavenward the general spirit of the group at humble worship -- all exercise upon the child a influence for good mysterious yet profound clean beautiful surroundings and orderly behavior be also very impressive the work of we sabbath school be most beneficial they offer to parent a strong reinforcement in cultivate right religious habit and emotion in the child to go into one of we well-conducted Sunday school where order prevail where the spirit of peace and prayer be uppermost to join in the singing to listen to the uplifting instruction or better still to be give opportunity to take active part in this religious service -- all these make a deep and lasting impression upon the youthful soul parent can do nothing better for they child and themselves than to support loyally they Sunday school and other religious organization the habit of attend church should also be impress during the habit-forming period but the supreme opportunity of the church lie in its ability actually to convert the youth or maiden during the adolescent period this be a privilege which neither the church nor the home have adequately comprehend when the emotional nature of the individual be at white heat as it then be impression make be lasting and conversion if make then will be so deeply impressed that it be likely to last forever church in general fail to make the most of they opportunity here they too often stuff the head of child with religious fact and formula feed they with the husk of theology instead of give they the upbuilding food they need child too often be starve for real spiritual food hunger for the bread and thirst for the water of life parent and teacher generally need to correct they method of present the gospel to child especially to the adolescent if they would get the result desire it be they failure to meet the child on he own religious ground not he indifference to religion that make the boy and girl leave sabbath school during the time he most need such a influence let they study and master these problem : be boy and girl be give ample opportunity for spiritual self-expression be the beautiful lesson of the gospel be translate into term that appeal to they life we own church we feel sure be answer these question in positive practical way better and better every day but there be still much leave to do even among we we have in we own church a work system that minister to the daily moral and spiritual need of humanity -- a constructive christianity that come close to we live we church be we opportunity to develop we own spiritual power and to cultivate those of we child the church need we help to carry forward its ministry to mankind but we need even more the help of the church to enspirit and to comfort we life and to give to we and to we child the guidance and the training that will keep we all in the path of safety and peace : lesson xx question for discussion 1 what have you observe in child to prove that religious emotion be instinctive 2 in what way can the home best foster the natural religious instinct of childhood 3 what religious habit should the home cultivate 4 what can the church best develop in child 5 why should the parent support loyally the Sunday school and other organization of the church 6 what be the supreme opportunity of the church during the adolescent age 7 what means have you use successfully to develop the religious instinct of you own child 8 what opportunity for spiritual self-expression and service do we own church offer 9 in what way be we richly reward by we free-will service in behalf of we church the child and he religion by dawson will be a helpful book to study in connection with this lesson training in the school _ certain phase of training and education can be accomplish better by the school than by any other agency a national system of industrial and vocational education should be establish _ the school be a social institution whose function be become daily more widely understand and more clearly define in the history of civilization the school as we know it be a very recent institution nation after nation have arise reach its zenith decline and pass away without dream of such a thing as universal education with the growth of democracy particularly during the reformation the ideal of education as the birthright of every child become well define and during the year that have intervene this ideal have become a living reality at first the universal education be advocate for the sake of the church martin luther believe that every child should have schooling so that he might be able to read the bible and study the catechism for some time the church have charge of and controlled education but gradually as democracy develop the influence of the state begin to overshadow that of the church and education come to be recognize more and more as a function of the state and its control be gradually take over by the latter institution the chief function of education therefore may be see clearly from the foregoing in a democracy it be necessary for every child to be educate because the existence of free institution be base upon the intelligence of the mass jefferson once remark : if anyone believe that free government and a ignorant people can exist at one and the same time he believe that which never be or never can be universal education be therefore a social necessity its chief purpose be to train and instruct the child in the duty and ideal of citizenship he must be instruct in the history of he country and learn what the ideal be for which he country stand he must learn the real meaning of the word : equality justice and freedom he must be teach that obedience to law be the highest form of freedom and that license be destructive both of self and country furthermore he must learn that in a free country every individual must be teach to be self-dependent that no one owe he a living that he ought to produce a little more than he consume for the sake of the unfortunate the school therefore may teach better than any other agency the habit and ideal of duty social service justice and patriotism it also teach frequently better than do the home the habit of obedience punctuality regularity and industry a secondary purpose of the school be to assist the home to develop in the child the physical mental moral and social habit and ideal to which we have refer in previous lesson to the shame of the home it must be say that the school be accomplish its particular function far better than be the home the school rarely fail to exact obedience regularity punctuality and industry from the pupil the home on the other hand frequently fail to train child in these habit because of the softness and vacillation of the parent the school train to proper habit of hygiene and sanitation and be often under the necessity of acquaint parent with physical defect in they child which too often they have overlook moreover the school as a larger social unit than the home have some distinct advantage over the latter : it can teach the obstinate quarrelsome child better than can the home the necessity of adjust he conduct to the requirement of the social group with which he associate in school frequently for the first time a child learn what be mean by the ideal of duty and justice furthermore he be usually train to habit of industry perseverance and self-control which the home too often be not well prepare to teach the home however be far more important than be the school the latter might be abolish and some other form of education adopt by society without calamitous result but if the home be suddenly abolish it be probable that civilization itself would be shake to its center if not destroy the home therefore ought to be better prepared and equip to fulfill its function than be the school but not one parent in a thousand be specially prepare for the duty of parenthood the teacher on the other hand be require to spend year in preparation for he work he be expect moreover to set a worthy example for child to follow as the teacher so the school be a maxim that have stand the test the school be never before so practical in its instruction as it be to-day in most of the junior and senior high school industrial work and agriculture be teach in the best school girl be learn to sew mend darn and cook many of they make they own dress and trim they own hat in a few school uniform dress and shoe be adopt by the girl student for the sake of economy and to prevent the silly mode of dress and the style of some girl much more could be do in this direction if all mother be sensible but now and again word come to the teacher : i can dress my girl well and i do not care to have she wear you cheap uniform and you low-priced low-heeled shoe and again : it be none of you business how my girl dress now it must be concede that the parent have this right to object but we surely question the wisdom of she so do many young girl on graduate from the eighth grade make they own graduation dress and confine the cost of the entire costume include shoe to $ 500 woman graduate from the senior school often make they dress and confine the cost to within $ 1000 most young man be teach manual art of some kind and agriculture it be seldom that any father object to he son take carpenter work but once in a while a farmer smile at the thought of a professor teaching farm the result however of the good work in teaching better farming be already see throughout we country and the time be not far distant when scientific agriculture will return many fold the price of its investment the agricultural department at washington report that the burbank potato be add $ 17000000 yearly to the wealth of the we the people too be well satisfy with this new type of school they be begin to see that education be a very practical and vital matter and be not merely for ornament it be a rare thing now to hear the once common remark that education be too expensive statistics show that the average wages pay to unskilled laborer in the u s be about $ 500 per annum careful report indicate that the average yearly earnings of high school graduate be $ 1000 in a lifetime of 40 year the high school man will earn $ 20000 more than the unlearned laborer from a financial standpoint it be very evident that education pay yet five and one-half year be the average length of time the child of the we attend school the nation ought to enrich itself through put more money into education the natural resource of the country be largely take up and the free land be practically all occupy what then be to be the future of the great mass of laborer unless a thorough-going system of industrial and vocational training be make possible the industrial commission appoint recently by congress find that three-fourth of the male laborer in the we earn less than $ 600 per annum yet the we government have find that the point of adequate subsistence be not reach until the family income be about $ 800 a year less than half the wage-earner ' family in the we have a annual income of that size now the rich can take care of themselves and the very poor and unfortunate can not be permanently help but this great middle class upon whom the nation must depend in every crisis can and must be assist to the extent at least that condition be make possible through which they may raise they efficiency and so increase they earning capacity to a point commensurate with they need a thorough-going national system of industrial and vocational preparedness would solve this problem the marvelous efficiency of germany be due in large part to the fact that she great middle class have be make efficient through a national system of trade school the prosperity and perpetuity of a nation rest largely upon its ability to provide a adequate number of highly trained expert to be leader inventor and executive in a democracy these skilled leader be especially important among the problem to be solve be question of government education finance economics business industry health manufacturing engineering and mine any nation that lack guidance in these particulars be indeed weak and pitiful the university college and higher technical school supply nine-tenth of these expert yet in the we to-day there be only 250000 student enrol in all the college and university of the country this be about one to 500 of the population a number entirely inadequate to perform the tremendous service that will be expect of this nation in the near future lesson xxi question for discussion 1 state the nature of the school 2 how do the ideal of universal education arise 3 state the chief function of the school 4 name the habit and ideal peculiar to the school 5 what be the secondary purpose of the school 6 contrast the efficiency of the home and the school 7 what high compliment may be pay to teacher 8 be the comparison make between the home and the school overdrawn 9 compare the practical school of to-day with the school of the past 10 do you favor uniform dress for high school girl 11 what be you opinion of modern style which so many mother foster 12 have you any boy take industrial work in school 13 prove that high school education pay 14 what be the duty of a nation towards its great middle class 15 do you believe in a national system of industrial and vocational school 16 why be expert need particularly in a democracy the duty of the state _ the social and civic institution of the state -lrb- society -rrb- exert a powerful influence over the life of child the citizen must see to it that this great educative influence of he community be uplift in nature _ the vital relationship exist between parent and child be easy to understand but the close interdependence of the individual and the state be much more difficult to comprehend yet in a very real sense the individual and the state be reciprocally related but just as the body be more than a aggregate of all of its cell so be society -lrb- the state -rrb- something more than the sum total of its individual unit that a group of people or even one individual may exert a influence over the thought and action of other be a reality of profound significance that there be a social conscience as well as a individual conscience be a fact that can not be refute and the part play by custom and tradition in shape the history of the world can hardly be estimate in view of the close relationship between the individual and society it be pass strange that while the individual be expect to possess a high standard of character society itself may indulge in all sort of questionable practice without so much as a challenge many a person wink at the frivolity and immorality of society while at the same time he expect the most circumspect behavior on the part of he neighbor the existence of these two standard which ought to coincide but which in reality be far apart be responsible for many failure in the training of child as soon as the infant begin to observe and imitate the action of member of the household its social training begin play with the neighbor 's child extend the process and the social group or gang with which the child associate impress permanently its thought and action frequently too the chum or companion choose by the child have more real influence over its life than have the combined instruction of parent and teacher as already show the school be a social institution and the same be largely true of the Sunday school the example of adult also make a profound impression upon the conduct of child the home and the school may teach convincingly the injurious effect of tobacco and alcohol but so long as society sanction the sale of these poison and respect adult indulge in they just so long will the effort of home and school be to a large extent counteract the same be true with respect to any other virtue or excellence the home school and church may unite in emphasize the most wholesome discipline but so long as society be a living seething contradiction of this teach the instruction will fall upon deaf ear and be but as sound brass and a tinkle cymbal the fact be that we nation be yet too young to be fully conscious of its opportunity and responsibility a democratic form of government from its very nature must develop slowly towards its ideal it must expect at first to be much less certain and efficient in its action than be a highly centralized government this inability on the part of popular government to attain its ideal be reflect also in its subordinate civic unit neither state nor city government have yet solve the problem of efficient and economical administration although it be a pleasure to note that some city be make real progress in this direction in many community however the weakness of decentralized government be most apparent this be particularly true in many town here be see too frequently a lack of civic pride inefficient officer and failure to enforce the law the humiliating fact obtain that frequently a few lawless individual often not more than from 3 to 5 per cent of the population be permit to set the moral pace while the 95 per cent of law-abiding citizen be either asleep to they duty or else fail to see that the remedy be in they own hand in many instance a few person be allow to undermine the moral of the community in one town of we state a single individual be permit for 25 year to corrupt the moral of many young man of the community through illegal traffic in liquor parent should realize that next to heredity the social factor in a community be likely to be the chief influence at work moulding and shape the life of they child and in the long run they must not expect the average child to be better than the community in which he live but the remedy for inefficient free government be not far to seek universal education will solve the problem provide it include as it should instruction and training in civic and social duty there be no need to argue the superiority of democratic government over that of all other form the freedom which we possess be worth all the suffering and bloodshed of all the patriot that have ever live but nothing will run itself perpetual motion be a myth and even a small town to be well govern must receive conscious expert attention unquestionably a free government be the most complex and difficult of all form of government to administer but the problem can be solve and the secret of success will be find in the individual himself he must become educate to realize he full duty and responsibility as a free citizen in other word he must become socialize he must get over the notion that the school be the only educational agency and must understand that every influence that modify conduct be educative in nature especially must he learn that the community itself be the chief civic and social educator of child and as such it should be consciously organize to perform well this responsibility already community be awaken to the need of perfect sanitary and hygienic condition and clean town contest be the order of the day this be one of the most hopeful sign of better time but there ought to be a moral and mental awakening and contest for civic righteousness should be inaugurate any community that can say : in this town no influence be permit that could in any way corrupt the moral or ideal of child should receive the highest award in the gift of the people and its praise should be commemorate in song and story in ancient greece every citizen regard himself as a parent or guardian of every child and if any youth be see in public to violate any of the custom or ideal of the nation it be the duty of the citizen to chastise the boy and to otherwise instruct he in the duty of citizenship at the same time the citizen be careful himself to set a example worthy of emulation the result be the most perfect and harmonious education that the world have ever see -- at once the inspiration and the despair of all succeed civilization why should we not adopt some of the grecian method suit to we need in greece no citizen would think of do in public or permit to be do anything which be not desirable for the child to do either in public or private why should any man who walk upright with he head point to the star be permit to profane the name of deity to stagger under the influence of liquor to puff at a cigar to gamble to run a disorderly resort or show to enrich himself through the manufacture and sale of poison or to do anything else that corrupt the community and destroy she child surely in we feeble attempt at free government the right hand know not what the left be do but the remedy as i have say be in the hand of the citizen while it be true that certain reform to be most effective must be national rather than local such for example as prohibit the manufacture and sale of poisonous drug tobacco and alcohol it be nevertheless evident that the initiative must be take by the individual he first duty be to convert himself and then he neighbor before any nation-wide reform can be undertake it be one of the chief glory of a democracy that any desire good may be obtain through conversion and co-operation but since in most community 90 per cent or more of the citizen be law-abiding and would not consciously do anything to destroy the child of the commonwealth it ought to be a simple matter to restrain the few that be lawless and unsocial there can be no possible doubt that any community that be fully alive to its need and responsibility can bring about just such civic and social condition as it may desire to help accomplish these purpose it be necessary that efficient officer be elect who will enforce the law and that public sentiment be arouse in support of these official in some community sympathy for law-breaker be so easily awaken that justice can not be enforce and law and order be place in contempt the citizen in a democracy should realize that he training and education be never complete that life itself be the great school-master and that one of the chief pleasure of existence be continue study and investigation he occupation no matter what it be will offer he some opportunity for study and improvement and a portion of he leisure time ought to be devote to book and magazine he may also if he desire take a extension course or correspondence work offer by a higher institution of learn some of which be make earnest effort to take the college to the people every citizen should at least be identify with some civic social or industrial organization in he town such as a debate and literary club a agricultural society or a commercial club if each community would seek out and utilize the talent within its precinct it might develop a intellectual and civic consciousness that would rival the spirit of ancient greece a old-time prophet utter the inspiring thought : the glory of god be intelligence and the great latter-day prophet add the supplement : no man can be save in ignorance it be the duty of the individual therefore to be a eternal seeker after knowledge and perfection in this bless age when the sun of education shine so brilliantly none need to slumber under the cloud of ignorance may the sun shine until under its regenerate influence the home school church and state may each awaken to the full measure of its power and so prepare the way for the come of that mightier son of righteousness who promise to reign for a thousand year over a redeem world lesson xxii question for discussion 1 show

nature will bear we burden for we if we will obey she law and heed she suggestion _ -lrb- footnote 1 : these supplemental study be base on lecture by dr john m tyler give before the utah educational association by whose permission they be use parent will find dr tyler 's book on growth in education of great interest it be list with other book at the close of this volume -rrb- how have all the material progress of the nineteenth century come about i think we shall find that it be due to man 's intelligently and carefully and scrupulously go into partnership with nature by obey she law not so very many year ago message be send across this continent by pony-rider it be a slow process and a very expensive one now i step into a office here and i say i wish to send a message to my wife way out yonder in massachusett the man touch a button and say you message be in massachusett sir it be a miracle the lightning have run with my message electricity not only carry we message it light we house it turn many a wheel of machinery it serve we beneficiently just as long as we obey the law of electricity but when we offend against these law it thwart we or very likely destroy we obey and i will do anything for you in the world say nature disobey and you can not move I one single inch coal hurry we great locomotive and long train of merchandise and carry man and woman across this continent without any great amount of human labor the engineer and the brakeman do not get behind and push those great palace car of ours it be nature which drive the train as if it be sport man guide and direct the water pour down we hillside turn wheel of countless factory a few ounce of gasoline send the automobile down the street pollute the air and endanger we life the power of nature be absolutely irresistible and unlimited and furthermore she be always work towards some great and good end when i be a child i use to hear that nature be bad and we use to have sermon to the natural man they be excellent sermon too but they ought to have be preach to the unnatural man the natural child be consider a child of wrath and have that reputation he quite frequently live up to it but nature be beneficient as long as we let she be so and she be always work toward great and grand end she have be work towards a higher and nobler and a better race of man than you and i be to-day she be work for a race of man and woman who shall tower above we as the sage and prophet in athen and jerusalem tower above they slave can we not trust she just a little do you ever think that it be the most marvelous thing in the world that such a thing as a chicken ever come out of such a thing as a egg if only one chicken be hatch in a century we would go from here to the himalaya mountain to see the miracle of that chicken come out of that egg you put a egg under a very stupid old hen and all the hen do be to keep that egg warm and leave it alone after twenty day there come out a chicken how in the world do that chicken ever frame that body how do it build the skeleton and string the muscle and spin the nerve if every nerve in that body do not make just the right connection that chicken would be paralyze if you could watch the development of that chicken in the egg you hair would stand on end be not it nature that make those chicken you and i can not make they nature put a shell around the egg with the express purpose that we be to keep we finger out and let she alone she say : i be on very important business now and i be go to do some strange thing if you could watch I you would interfere with I and if you interfere with I you will ruin I or ruin the chicken so i want you to stand to one side and leave I entirely alone and while i might do a good many thing that you do not like i shall bring a chicken out of that egg and she do she have be make they for thousand of year in that same old stupid way but she bring the chicken out all right sometimes she seem to blunder still worse she take a egg which we suppose be go to turn into a frog and she bring out of it a tadpole -- neither fish flesh nor fowl nor anything else after a while the tadpole get leg and have a long tail it must lose that tail in order to become a frog a benevolent zoologist one day start in to help the tadpole by snip off the tadpole 's tail he make a frog of he in a hurry but the strange thing be that that frog never be able to leap properly nature have be rely on the material that be in the tail she be go to shift it forward and put it in the hind leg but when the zoologist cut it off she could not build the hind leg right after that a good deal of we education seem to I like try to make frog in a hurry by cut off they tail nature can make chicken she can make frog she can make bug that will eat up everything which human ingenuity ever try to raise she will make weed which you and i can not possibly kill even though we fight against they all summer long we can trust nature to form these thing be not it fair to trust she with the child for a little while at least would not it be well -- i never hear of this experiment be try but i should like to see it try very much indeed -- i do wish that sometime somebody would leave a baby alone for twenty minute and see what it would do if it be leave to itself what be the great characteristic of all live thing it be that they grow we can not make they grow but they grow of themselves the farmer plant he crop of corn he do not get a jackscrew and put under every hill of corn and go around every morning and give the screw a turn and a twist and hoist the hill up in the air he prepare the soil as best he can he put in the seed he keep down the weed he keep out thing and live being which will injure the crop as far as he can then he leave it alone to god and nature to make that corn grow and in time he get a bountiful harvest i believe that education some day will be somewhat like raise a crop of corn we shall learn to keep the child under the best condition possible we shall learn to keep down harmful and injurious surroundings or force so far as they can interfere with he we shall stimulate growth in every possible way that i grant you and when we have do that we shall leave the rest calmly to nature and to the good lord who make that child for some good purpose it be a grand thing to have the child learn to see for himself the glory of this magnificent world i verily believe that when you and i go home while the good lord will be very merciful with we because of we sin i do not see how he can forgive many of we for not have have a great deal better time in this glorious world in which he have put we when you open the child 's eye to the beauty and the glory of nature you have do a great thing for it but after all that be not the grandest thing to my mind the grandest part be that every wave of vibration that go in through the eye as the child look at nature and pour into the brain stimulate that brain to a larger growth than it would otherwise possibly have attain and the child be a larger and a grander child for that nature study we believe in manual training because it give we skilled finger and enable we to do deftly and well a great many thing which we otherwise could not do at all and which most of we man have to go to we wife and ask they to do for we but that be not the grandest part of manual training the grandest part be the reaction from the finger upon the brain stimulate the brain to realize all its ideal and stimulate it so that whenever it see good work of any kind in this world it shall appreciate it heartily and enjoy it with the joy of the artist we speak of physical training and physical training be brain training in the end it be training in growth it be very evident however that the growth and development of a baby be something different from the growth and development of a child and the growth in the child be very different from that in the youth and that of the youth from that of the adult in the baby the vital organ be grow faster in the young child the muscular system be come to the front and he run and play and through the stimulus of that muscular exercise he bring out every organ in the body and gain that magnificent health which he so much need then after a time the brain come to the front and grow and develop more rapidly than any other part of the body we business as teacher be always so to stimulate by proper exercise the grow organ that they shall grow faster and further than they ever could without we aid we be not to always hasten it this be one thing we must bear in mind : precocity be the worst foe of a sound education it be the boy and the girl who mature slowly but mature surely that in the end possess the earth we must not hasten the process but when we find the organ be ready to grow and develop then we must give it adequate stimulus in other word the stimulus must be of the right kind and there must be just enough of it just enough blood to stimulate the muscle just as much study as will best stimulate the grow and very immature intellectual center in the brain then we will increase the stimulus as the power increase and demand the stronger exercise and so stimulate the grow part by adequate exercise we bring one part after another up to such development that we have one harmonious whole of perfect health you remember that when the old deacon in oliver wendell holme ' poem start in to build the one-horse shay he say every shay that have ever be make have break down because there be always a weakest spot in it now i be go to make a shay that never will break down because i be go to make the weakest part just as strong as the rest we can not always do that but if we can make that part somewhere near as strong as the rest we be past master in education if we obey nature 's law all of she power will be on we side and with all she power on we side and the very star in they course fight for we we can not possibly fail there be absolutely nothing which be impossible to we we must be strong and of good courage if we be to guide these little people into the land swear unto they father before they lesson i question for discussion 1 what be mean by the expression man 's partnership with nature illustrate how man make nature serve he 2 in what way can man enter into a partnership with nature regard he own body 3 what can man do best when it come to make thing grow 4 what do you think of the hurry method in education 5 what be the most we can do in provide for the education of the child 6 how do nature help we in the training process 7 what do nature try to make sure of first in the child 8 when do the brain of the child begin to develop rapidly 9 what advice would you give about precocity in child why 10 what should we study in we child to give they a strong and even development conservation of the child _ by dr jm tyler _ when the good lord set out to develop a child the first organ with which he start be the stomach the stomach be the foundation of all greatness it be a matter of daily observation if not of experience that a man can get along very well with very few brain but a man can not get along at all without a good digestive system the digestive system furnish all the material for growth and the fuel which be continually burn or consume in we nerve and muscle now any furnace require besides fuel a good draught when we burn the fuel by unite it with the oxygen thus bring in we get the energy which draw we locomotive and we great ship similarly in we body we lung bring in the oxygen and the heart and blood-vessel carry the fuel and the oxygen to every part of the body but every furnace require a smoke-stack to carry off the waste and similarly we must have in we body a excretory system to remove the waste of the burned-up material and of the used-up tissue of the heart muscle and nerve this constitute the digestive system the lung the excretory system and the circulatory system be absolutely necessary to support the combustion which be go on in nerve and muscle and without which energy be impossible all productive labor manifest itself through the muscle we muscle directly write the book speak the word build the railroad do the deed we muscle be of very different age in the child the trunk muscle be develop first the shoulder muscle next the arm muscle next the finger muscle last of all the heavy muscle of trunk shoulder and thigh require but a small amount of nervous impulse or control and they react strongly on all the vital organ as be show every time that we take a walk the finest and youngest muscle of the finger require a very large amount of nervous control for a very small output of muscular energy and they exercise stimulate the very highest center in the brain and this be the great argument for physical training that through one muscle or another you can stimulate and develop as you choose either any vital organ or the highest center in the brain never forget the maxim of the old german physiologist that health come in through the muscle and flow out through the nerve the nervous system be create for good and wise end but in many people it have become a nuisance its use be to insure that every stimulus from the external world shall call forth a response suit to the emergency a fly light upon my face i wave my hand and drive he away the fly have tickle my face there be the external stimulus a sensory impulse travels to the brain or to some other center and a motor impulse go from there to a certain muscle in my arm which move my hand and drive away the fly the impulse have call out a response suit to that emergency you watch a cat walk across the lawn you will think that fool cat be go to fall down it be go so slowly and it can hardly raise one foot above the other but watch it when it see its prey every muscle seem to turn to steel it be ready for the spring when that spring be make there be no energy waste after that the cat do not move for two hour no wasting energy there waste of energy be a sin i awaken in the morning and the first horrible emergency of the day confront I at once i have to get up how i get up i have no idea professor jame once say that when a man think about it he never do get up and that be right but i find myself in the middle of the floor and that be all i know and then the cold air or the sight of my clothes or something remind I to start dress and the put on of one garment lead to the put on of another the pang of hunger call I to the breakfast table the bell call I to work and so all day long response follow stimulus the day 's work be a success or a failure accord to the response which i make to the stimulus which i receive there be a marvelous picture give in the scripture in the parable of the poor man go down from jerusalem to jericho and get wound and leave by the road-side three man pass that way they all see the same thing the light be reflect from the poor sufferer into the eye of these passer-by a flood of vibration pass on to the brain and then the motor impulse go out to the muscle in the case of the good samaritan the impulse go from the brain or the spinal nerve to the arm and he stoop down and pick the poor fellow up and carry he off while in the priest and the levite the impulse all go down into the leg and the coward hustle off for jericho a healthy nervous system be the rarest thing in this wide world i have one illustration in mind which i always like to think of which i be go to give you of a perfectly healthy and normal nervous system it be possess by a good old negro minister he have be preach to he congregation for a long time on the subject of meekness and it have not produce the desire effect so he say to they one morning : brethren i ` se gwine to give you the illustration of meekness for a week now and show you what it be and the old man do he congregation naturally rise to the occasion : they insult he wife they abuse he child they stone he dog they steal he chicken they do everything under the heaven to break down the meekness of that man but he go on through the week and come into church the next Sunday and begin to preach the congregation recognize that they time be short and they redouble they effort but all in vain finally about five minute before the closing of the service he turn to the congregation and say : brethren i think i ought to denounce to this congregation that my week of meekness be just about up and when the clock in yonder steeple strike twelve i ` se gwine to quit preachin ' close this bless bible go down from this pulpit and then brethren judgment day and hell be gwine to break loose on some of you now that old color minister have a ideal nervous system there have not be one single response all that week long and not one single stimulus which have come in from the outside have be lose either but it be all wait to leap into that good right arm when the emergency be to be meet in the fullness of time and i commend you to go and do likewise it be only a step thank fortune from the ridiculous to the sublime just as it be only a step from the sublime to the ridiculous another illustration of a perfect nervous system : you remember how we lord spend a whole day in preach in healing work deed of kindness in pour out sympathy and comfort the strain of which on a man 's nervous energy be worse than anything else in the world and how at the close of the day he go into the little boat take the hard cushion on which the steersman sit throw it down in the bottom of the boat and lay himself down with he head on that hard cushion and sleep like a child through the rock of the boat and the roaring of the storm until he disciple come to he say lord save we : we perish there be not one man in a thousand who could do that work or could put out one-tenth part of that nervous energy and then sleep like that anybody who think that the prophet of nazareth be a weak or a feeble man have make the mistake of he life he be perfect physically or he never could have do he work all this work of develop a steady nerve of develop the vital organ for the use of the muscle have be go on until the child be nine or ten year old it have be go on very rapidly and in as much as the exercise have be suitable as he digestion have be good he growth have be very rapid during the first three year of its life the child increase its weight more than three-fold during the next three year it add over forty per cent to this amount and between six and nine add over thirty per cent more and when the boy be about eleven year old or the girl be about ten then the growth almost stop that year it drop to a minimum i call you attention to this thought : the minimum growth be more in a girl than in a boy a girl be always more precocious than a boy she be a year older than he at nine or ten and when she be fourteen fifteen sixteen she be two year older than the boy when the girl be ten and the boy eleven growth drop to the minimum why be that nature be economize she material and husband she resource against the try year which be to come you remember the story of the time when pharoah in he dream see the seven fat kine follow and devour by the seven lean kine he be tell that he dream signify seven year of plenty to be follow by seven year of famine and be advise to store up the harvest of the good year against the hard time to follow this be a picture of the child 's life the first seven year of the child 's life be year of plenty when it be store up material for the year of hard trial the year of famine which be close at hand i be go to talk most of the girl because she need more attention than the boy growth be a very expensive process it begin in the bone when the bone lengthen out then every muscle every nerve have to be lengthen out to suit that extra length and that mean a great deal of waste for that rebuilding but it be something worse than that you know perfectly well that out of the butterfly egg there come the caterpillar and that caterpillar go into a cocoon and during the life of the cocoon every organ be change there and it come out a butterfly that be what we call a metamorphosis the girl between ten and sixteen be undergo a metamorphosis just as sure as that caterpillar be undergo a metamorphosis if you leave town for a few year and come back you know all the old man and woman have not change any except to die off the baby have grow some but the boy and the girl seem to be grow all over again that be the girl whom you leave at nine year old and on come back find she sixteen have drop down she skirt have draw up she hair and that be the butterfly cocoon and it be a mighty pretty butterfly cocoon that be waste again it be waste waste on all side and all of that waste be go into the blood no other place to put it it ought to be get out at once but there be another thing about it all the food must be digest and so oxygen must be gain and waste must be eliminate all the organ in the trunk between those age of ten and fourteen be relatively both larger and smaller in girl than at any other period of life it look as though nature be make a bad blunder but she be really make the best of a very bad bargain do the best she can under hard circumstance with these small vital organ and this tremendous draught on the body for new material and the large amount of waste to be eliminate you be sure to have trouble that trouble be go to manifest itself first of all in the blood the blood be go to be poor blood during those year unless you remedy it poor blood first of all depress the nervous system and the girl feel gloomy and good for nothing she hate to go out into the cold air because she chill yet that cold air be what she need more than anything else in the world she hate to make a effort and will not take the exercise she need if she can possibly help it the exercise she must have she appetite have go all wrong she like to live on caramel pickle and all such thing as that now my friend i want to tell you when anything go wrong with the appetite then the whole system go wrong remember that observation be make some year ago in sweden of a number of the bodily disorder that occur between the age of thirteen and nineteen these examiner find that there be one disorder which attack put in general number sixty per cent of the girl in the swedish school between the age of thirteen and nineteen and indeed it never fall below sixty per cent and be usually a great deal more in denmark the examination be make in the field where the child be healthier and then the figure give forty per cent the trouble usually show themselves in the form of pallor the girl be pale they frequently break out in the form of headache loss of appetite resistance to marked effort and sometimes with a cold now if the seat of the cold be in the blood because it be load with waste and ought to be remove there be one thing sure that waste never will be remove until it be thoroughly oxidize that be the first thing to do oxidize it the only way to oxidize the blood be to get the lung full of good pure air the girl want just as much lung capacity as she can possibly get we find that the girl during those year be a little taller and a little heavier than the boy and she need more oxygen to every pound of waste in the body than the boy do because the waste be go on faster the average girl have about three-fourths as much lung capacity for every pound of the waste in the body as have the average boy what the girl need be more lung capacity to get in more oxygen how be she go to get the lung capacity sit in the house how be she go to get it when she be tie down in the grammar school room with a book before she eye the worst of it all be that the girl leave off play game in the open air just about the time when she need they the most and not have the open air play and the open air game she can not get the lung capacity and the oxygen another thing that hinder the girl be this : there be no place for she to play where she can do all she want to and not have people look over the fence and finding fault with she for have a good time every girl ought to have a place where she can play in the open air and not be bother and we ought to get more and more game for girl of that age another thing the exercise should not be too severe do not kill a girl with physical training because you can kill she that way just as you can kill she with book some of we physical training be too severe for a girl of that age she must have plenty of the right kind of game and they should be in the open air and they should be such as she will enjoy and love if they be not of that kind it will not help a great deal if you can build up lung capacity in that way then you be draw in the oxygen then you be get out the waste and you will find the girl will come out all right in nine case out of ten it be a fact prove by physical examination that all during this period the better scholar have the larger lung capacity those of you who have teach in the grammar school year after year will know that a bright girl one that have be very bright will have a year when she will come to you and will be absolutely stupid and can not learn what ail the girl you wonder she will tell you i do not know what ail I i can not learn anything i have become a fool and i be not always one the trouble be with the lung capacity it be not with the brain the brain be all right if you tell that girl to wake up in order to make up that lack of mental ability by study harder you be do the unpardonable sin i be tell it to you straight that be not the remedy the remedy be more play in the open air then you will find that that girl 's brain will clear up many a poor girl have be put in poor condition by be urge to study hard when the fault be that nobody know enough to turn she out into the fresh air which the lord intend she should have we ought to have in every school five minute it would be better to have ten minute between school exercise when the girl can walk up and down chat with one another and get the blood out of the overloaded head and down into the cold foot better still turn they out in the open air and let they run that would be another blessing do not keep the girl sit too long at that period do not let they sit with wet foot or skirt that be just about as bad as get smallpox teach they some of the sense which you ought to have if you have not i have not say a word for the boy for this good reason : you can not kill he if you try thank the lord you can not kill he if you try not because he be so very tough boy be not as tough as girl physically but you can not kill they because they will not let you but i be sorry to say some few woman teacher be kill off the future woman again and again i have hear it say by the girl : we can get along all right with mr so and so we can get on the blind side of he all the time we can fool he but when we try to get around miss so and so she put it to we awfully and in the neatest way to get the work do now why the woman can not have a little mercy on the younger people be something i can not understand at all and yet while i have not say a word for the boy ought we not to regard he a little now and then there be the ambitious boy and then again there be you studious boy there be you bookish boy there be you shy boy who do not get into the game he be the boy you should watch all the time there be the boy who have become delicate and finicky because he have be doddle at home i hope you have not get so many of they here as we have in the east but he be here and you must watch he because he parent be do everything in the world to spoil he you must stand on the lord 's side of he if you can for these boy need you help if you give a little excess of mercy a little bit more physical vigor gain by this regime of open-air exercise and exercise between the school period you simply will be err on the safe side and do good to that girl and such boy because on these year of metamorphosis depend the life and the happiness of the girl and the boy perhaps you be get ready for examination i want to tell you nature have she examination just as well as you do do not she examine the baby and see that baby can not go on and many baby do not go on then the death rate sink at eleven and twelve it be very low very low indeed only perhaps two or three in a thousand in many country nature be give they a chance to see whether they will get ready for the second examination right after or during puberty the death rate rise at eighteen nineteen and twenty it have go up that be nature 's second examination to see whether that boy or girl be fit to send out into the world to take part in the great drama of life and if she be condition at this time then it mean invalidism for two three four five year and if she be badly condition it may mean death when you be prepare those girl for the examination do not forget you own examination because it be come on very fast i have talk very plainly this morning and i hope you will forgive I you may say we do not need that talk now i hope you do not you will need it in a generation or two i do not care how strong that pioneer blood be which have come down to you first generation here we have just as good in massachusett a hundred or a hundred and fifty year ago but we be get rid of it just as fast as we can the lord forgive we and you will do that here if you do not look out if you have strong red blood hold on to it because that be the grandest gift of god to man it be a treasure which must be hand down unimpaired from generation to generation that we boy and girl may be strong and efficient for the work of life which lie before they lesson ii -lrb- general subject : conservation of the child read carefully the foregoing lecture by dr tyler -rrb- _ the body as a instrument of the soul _ question for discussion 1 what be the teaching of the latter-day saint regard the relation of the body to the soul 2 in the light of these teaching what be demand of every latter-day saint as to the treatment of he body how be we live up to these teaching 3 what be the four essential thing we must do to keep the body engine describe by dr tyler in perfect condition 4 what would you think of a engineer who feed he engine dirt with he coal or let he draught and flue clog with soot or fail to remove the

stage of child growth they rapidity the critical period etc 2 growth mean waste by what mean do the body get rid of the waste that come with growth and change 3 what be some of the ill effect of keep this waste in the system give you experience and observation with child 4 when be the child 's blood likely to be most load with the waste cause by growth how can we best help the boy or girl to clear the system of this waste what mistake be we make in this vital matter 5 what practical suggestion would you give to we parent teacher and community to help they safeguard they child during dangerous period and keep they pioneer blood clean and pure the adolescent boy and girl growth during the high school age _ dr john m tyler _ the boy and the girl during adolescence have now attain they full height and practically they full weight although the boy have a little to gain still they be pretty well grow by this time if i have to choose between two question the first might be have you a good appetite but the second question i would ask be what be you lung capacity the lung have increase very rapidly at fourteen to sixteen in the boy in the girl the increase have be smaller and quite irregular it ought to be more regular than it be i be convince the heart have gain greatly in capacity the artery have expand much less than the heart and the result be that there be a much higher blood pressure than there have be at any time before the brain have attain practically full size and weight the addition now will be mainly in the very highest area where the addition of fiber might make all the difference between the possibility of genius and the possibility of mediocrity the sensory and the nervous area be fully mature the higher mental area and the higher mental power be now come on to stay the boy you will notice at this stage begin to argue a great deal more than he ever do before he want to argue nearly every question he like the debate society he idea of heaven it seem to I be a place where debate be indulge in a goodly amount of exercise for those psychological and mental power will do he no harm the mortality or the death rate be low but the morbidity be increase at this time in the boy at least vigorous physical exercise be now need ordinary play be not enough gymnastics also for the development and training of the hand and the wrist training in quickness and precision of movement be all excellent exercise all the finer muscle should be train now and probably less training should be give to the heavy fundamental muscle which be all important in childhood athletics be exceedingly useful they should be however for all and not merely for a few who join the team who need they the very least of all i think we modern college athletics will some day be look upon as one of the most ridiculous habit of the nineteenth and twentieth century that twenty-two man should engage in mortal combat with anywhere from one to twenty thousand on the side line -- if you can get anything more ridiculous than that i should like to know where you can find it athletics should not be too severe however yet the boy ought not to have century run and long half of football especially if the heart be still weak the tissue of the body have not yet gain the toughness that they will gain at a later time every commander in the field dread to have boy of eighteen nineteen or twenty send to he because as napoleon say of he young recruit they die off like fly the hard bed with light cover the cold room the cold bath will now aid in toughen the boy provide he be healthy but under no circumstance begin that until the pubertal period be fully by the danger of over-pressure in the high school especially after the first year be to my mind not very great the boy and the girl now both stand a good deal of work but the greatest danger for the boy and the girl in the high school be that they will take too much social enjoyment a evening theater party follow by a supper a late dance will take more strength out of a boy and girl than three day of study there be nothing that be so wear if you can keep down the social over-pressure i do not believe the over-pressure from study will do any great harm in high school the larger body the large heart and lung well oxygenate blood and fresh vitality of every artery and tissue give a buoyance a strength and a courage a source of power and sense of it too a longing for complete freedom a revolt against all control which the boy will never feel later if he do not feel it now i be describe perhaps rather the college boy than the high school boy but bear this in mind that i be describe what you boy in the high school will be a year or two later if they be not that now and it be for this stage you must prepare they even if they have not already enter upon it a new wide world just as fresh as on the morning of creation a new fire a life of boundless opportunity which be endless in scope and time be open out before the boy and the girl they see the parent and the teacher drag around understanding as they think neither they nor life itself and they be right to a certain extent there be no doubt about that we do not hold on to the vision of glory of this world and of this life which we have in youth as we ought to and as it be we duty to do the boy and the girl criticize we fairly when they think that we do not appreciate this magnificent world in which we live when a man get to be my age while i suppose he probably have more humility he come to know and he come to have a very cheerful optimistic view of the world he have make up he mind that the lord do not intend to change the world a great deal anyhow and on the whole he be very much content to leave it the way it be that be not so with young people at all the boy and the girl must learn and know all about it that be one thing they be determine to do at the outset the boy gird up he loin and he go whither he will he must taste of every experience for himself he will meet joy and sorrow with the same frolicking welcome spirit he have never be sadden by experience nor disillusioned by disappointment and failure he will try all the knowledge of good and evil if it cost he paradise nature be loosen every lead string now and be get he free to complete he own individual development and to forge he own character we can not stop he if we would it be very lucky that we can not it be better that we should not stop he even if we could nevertheless he have very little self-knowledge and still less self-control impulse well up from change go on within he or from stimulus which come to he from without he do not understand they he do not know where they come from he do not know what they mean he be ill-prepared to face they and now he go one way and now the other he have just about as clear a conception of the value of time as a child have he have not outgrow childhood in that respect he can not possibly play a wait game that be the last thing that he can do if the sun shine to-day it be always go to be bright weather if the maiden of he adoration frown to-day the sun will never shine again he be either on the delectable mountain or in the valley of humiliation and he be far more frequently in the latter than we think he be rarely between the two and he be not go to tell we when he be in the valley of humiliation nor when he be on the top of the delectable mountain there be a reticence about he at this time which we should learn to respect and to reverence i tell you at the first meeting that nature put the shell around the egg so we would keep we finger out of it and nature put that shell of reticence around the boy and the girl at that time so we will keep we blunder finger out and leave they to solve they problem with they help and that of the good lord who be watch over they authority have little hold over he at this time tradition none at all the influence of early training which have root themselves in he very life be very powerful and they will hold he and the lord have mercy on the boy whose early tradition do not hold he at that time remember it be not he fault that be a sad thought for we parent we must take the responsibility for these defect in the early training of we child the boy be lead by class and group feeling at this time you take he at eight or ten and he be a admirable little fellow in many respects he want to play fair and if the other fellow do not play fair he will smite he just as samson smite the philistine if he can and that be the occasion of much friction after a time there be danger that he will not play as fair as he do when he be younger for a time at least because he be swallow up in the team or the society or the group or the gang whatever it may be to which he belong and he will give himself body and soul to help that team to win this have its bad side a very bad side i grant you if you would understand the boy every now and then you must study the psychology of the mob but there be a very good side also because he be generous to a fault now be the time in he life when he will go down with the team and in order for the team to win he will make a play when you and i would hesitate to make it we have better respect the boy he be loyal to he leader and to he friend it be the epoch of the heart and out of the heart remember be the issue of life he have a great deal more heart than he have head knowledge at this time and i confess i rather like he for it you remember what paul say to those knowledge-worshiping corinthian as to knowledge : it will vanish away for we know in part those of we who have live more than half a century have see nine-tenth of we knowledge vanish away in just that fashion because we know in part but say paul there be some thing that abide and one of they be faith that be never do away with another be hope and the third and sure abide thing be love which be three-thirds in the heart and out of the heart be the issue of life the heart be often wiser than the head do not under-value and never despise the value of the greatness of heart in the boy for great heart be the only champion who ever kill giant despair the boy at this age be seek for a king he be very likely to be like old st christopher he will serve the strongest if he can find he tide of religious feeling be sweeping in on he now but if you want to convert he you must hold up before he no mediaeval example but the great magnificent athletic life of that divine master who have be so often misrepresent to we he be a very lovable be that boy be at time oh you be reverence he to-day well then bear in mind that probably about the same time tomorrow morning you will be grip for the scruff of he neck and when you grip he grip he hard it be no time for half-way measure never hit a boy at that age with a switch if you do you be lose either do not hit at all or hit hard a great deal of the child still remain in he he instability for instance he might well say of himself my name be legion in the remainder of he young life everything that be trifling and worthless all come to the surface just as it do in the ferment liquor the strong and sweet be all hide below the froth you can not see it you can very easily do he injustice you must sympathize with he remember you own foolish youth when you be he age remember you own blunder and then you will have a great patience with he and great admiration for he because these blunder be not a great deal worse than they be if you can not do this then leave he to nature for you can not help he we find during the year of puberty a physical metamorphosis when the body be all make over and now during those year of adolescence we have a mental metamorphosis that be just as complete as the physical metamorphosis all thing be become new they have not become new yet but they be become new hence it must be a time of instability of self-education of the strange mixture of the very new and the very old the bad and the good of that which be pass away and which have pass away long ago and that which have not yet come look a little deeper into he you will find he have a pretty good primitive system of morality it be a very primitive one consist mainly of loyalty to he friend treat he square as he say and fairly and then you may purr and curb he just as you will remember that tide of religious power and influence have be sweep through he the first one come probably at twelve if we may trust we statistics the second stronger at fourteen and then the third -- perhaps a good many do not feel the first one or second -- the third perhaps at sixteen the one which come over he at sixteen will affect heart and intellect and will and everything and he will stay converted probably if you convert he at twelve he probably will fall from grace before he be fifteen it be rather interesting to notice that those period when he experience be likely to be very deep and very strong be the year when he chest girth be expand the most rapidly a very good bit of physiology or psychology or of anything else you choose to call it to learn be this : if you want to convert a man to religion get plenty of good fresh air into he body you never can do it in a ill-ventilated room it be a period of see vision and of dream dream you know that if you remember you boyhood and girlhood those dream and vision be the most substantial thing there be in he life or in yours or mine for where there be no vision the people perish wendell phillip use to say that the power which overthrow slavery and hurl it to the ground be young man and young woman dream dream by patriot ' grave there be a good deal more than rhetoric in that statement endless possibility be in these dream and vision it be a period of promise of magnificent promise which you and i as teacher be privileged to see afar off before they be even glimpse by he parent and many of he friend the great question now be will the promise and the vision ever be realize or will they fade out and disappear and leave he a philistine and lucky if he be not a brute for the only brute in this world my friend be a degenerate man when you hear a man say that he have cut he eye-tooth and he have get rid of he dream and he vision then may the lord have mercy on the soul of that man because he be dead the all-important question now be can you get that dream and that vision so burn into he memory so blaze before he eye that he will never forget it and never lose sight of it and win it if it cost he he life then you have educate he these vision be far more important than all of the science even the biology that a man can learn in college it be the business of the parent and teacher at this time to bring to birth and to sturdy growth high aim purpose ideal the whole spiritual life you business in early childhood be with the physical because that be the important thing at that time if you can build a very healthy little animal you have do well but during the high school age you must build the spiritual if you do not feel this i can not explain it to you and if you do not feel this within you if it be all meaningless and mere noise do not you dare teach a high school for you be not big enough nor deep enough to do that the great question after all be not how much learning have you be able to put into he but how much of the finer ambition how much power how deeply and strongly they hunger for the very best a ounce of inspiration at this time be worth more than a pound or a ton of learn i be no foe of learn either the high school be and will remain the people 's college it be the only college that a great part of the people ever will know do not neglect that great fraction who be never go to get anything higher and beyond in order to put you time on those who be go on to college and university you must be the people 's support and you may well thank fortune that it do not seem to be nine-tenth of you business out here in the west to fit boy and girl for a college examination if that ever threaten to become you business then you withstand it and face it to the death for there be nothing will ruin education faster than that i know sorrowfully whereof i speak you remember in pilgrim 's progress that when christian have leave the interpreter 's house he stray away and go down into the valley of humiliation where he walk between the snare and be in danger of fall into many a pitfall there he wander through darkness there he could not see the delectable mountain any more and there he fight with giant apollyon for he life but when christian pass that way he do not find it half so bad by any means he have a companion by the name of great heart remember and great heart say to he do you know that the soil of this valley be probably the most fertile that the crow fly over the valley of humiliation my friend stretch sharp and clear athwart the life of every man and woman between the interpreter 's house of he early education and of he dream and vision and the delectable mountain and we all have to depart to it whether we will or no and it be the most fertile soil that the crow fly over for in that valley of humiliation man 's muscle and nerve become steel and man become the shadow of the great rock in the weary land and through heartache the man and the woman be make the soldier and the choice hero of jehovah himself it be into that valley of humiliation that the boy and the girl be go to go from school after they leave you and you must fit they for it many of you know well enough what it be and know what help they need you have read all of you a good many time probably this marvelous passage from isaiah : they that trust in the lord shall renew they strength they shall mount up with wing as eagle they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint i never think what that mean until one morning in college chapel we president turn to we and say : most of you think that be a anti-climax and we would say : why of course for a man can not fly like the eagle he can walk down hill what be the use talk about that walk down hill the old man shake he head and say : no no anybody can fly like a eagle in he imagination when we be begin any new work or any new study or anything new we fly but after a time we can not fly any more we come down to a run and the man who win out be not the man who can run but the man who can ` walk and not faint ' for that man have the endurance that we want there be a time some year ago -- that have go by too thank fortune -- when we use to paraphrase thing that be turn very good english into very bad english you wish to have a boy or girl catch the spirit of the poem do you not to find in it inspiration and power to find a beauty in life that never be on sea nor land a sweet voice be a very excellent thing in a woman and a very unusual thing in a man the eye be not the grandest sense organ we have the ear be the path-way to the heart and that be what you want to understand do you ever try read a beautiful poem or story aloud to you child at you fireside or to the class and put you very life 's blood into it i remember some thing that a little girl teacher in massachusett read to I a great many year ago and there be a dent in my old heart still try it some day they can not understand the poem but they feel it it have go deeper than the intellect it have go into the heart and through the heart it have get hold of the will and it have transfigure the spirit and the whole be in this way you be certainly teach literature nobody can deny that you have awaken a new interest you lead and inspire the adolescent to share you very best and highest enthusiasm after you have do that a few time you pupil will demand the best they will not be content with anything poor the highest human thing in the end be character and character be form very early very shortly before the boy leave the high school just how it be form i do not know but i know one thing that while i can not tell anything about how successful a man will be intellectually in life from what he do in college or sometimes i can not tell very much about how large he will grow mentally i know that boy will not rise very much higher morally than he stand in college when you send he there if then he have secure a moral training and influence i firmly believe he will stay so if he do not come to we in that shape the probability be that he never will change for the good but if he be filthy he will remain filthy still he character be make very largely in the high school how can you reach it i think you can reach it a good deal through literature i do not see how anybody can read mr hawthorne or mr emerson and not long to be a gentleman and feel as if he would like to be worthy to kiss the hem of the garment of those literary gentleman you can read history you can make history a dreary chronicle you can learn of king who never ought to have be bear and when they die when they ought to have be dead fifty year before and all the long list of battle fight which never ought to have be fight you can make it just such a weary chronicle you do not nowadays thank fortune i have see teacher that do or you can make that history the eleventh chapter of hebrew and you can write you own eleventh chapter of hebrew if you will for that chapter never be intend to be finish and if you can not add to it with you pioneer history of those who fight they way across the plain here fifty or more year ago then you be teach history to mighty little effect to this generation here in utah the whole story be just this if you can saturate you pupil
