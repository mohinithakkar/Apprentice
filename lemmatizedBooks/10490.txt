he tread the twilight be like the truce of god with worldly woe and care under he lay the golden moss and above he the bough of hemlock-tree wave and make the sign of the cross and whisper they benedicite and from the ground rise a odor sweet and fragrant of the wild flower and the vagrant vine that wander seek the sunshine round and round these he heed not but ponder on the volume in he hand a volume of saint augustine wherein he read of the unseen splendor of god 's great town in the unknown land and with he eye cast down in humility he say : i believe o god what herein i have read but alas i do not understand and lo he hear the sudden singing of a bird a snow-white bird that from a cloud drop down and among the branch brown sit singing so sweet and clear and loud it seem a thousand harp string ring and the monk felix close he book and long long with rapturous look he listen to the song and hardly breathe or stir until he see as in a vision the land elysian and in the heavenly city hear angelic foot fall on the golden flagging of the street and he would fain have catch the wondrous bird but strove in vain for it fly away away far over hill and dell and instead of its sweet singing he hear the convent bell suddenly in the silence ringing for the service of noonday and he retrace he pathway homeward sadly and in haste in the convent there be a change he look for each well know face but the face be new and strange new figure sit in the oaken stall new voice chaunt in the choir yet the place be the same place the same dusky wall of cold gray stone the same

thy face the heart of the monk felix fall : and he answer with submissive tone this morning after the hour of prime i leave my cell and wander forth alone listen all the time to the melodious singing of a beautiful white bird until i hear the bell of the convent ringing noon from they noisy tower it be as if i dream for what to I have seem moment only have be hour year say a voice close by it be a aged monk who speak from a bench of oak fasten against the wall -- he be the oldest monk of all for a whole century have he be there serve god in prayer the meekest and humblest of he creature he remember well the feature of felix and he say speak distinct and slow : one hundred year ago when i be a novice in this place there be here a monk full of god 's grace who bear the name of felix and this man must be the same and straightway they bring forth to the light of day a volume old and brown a huge tome bind with brass and wild-boar 's hide therein be write down the name of all who have die in the convent since it be edify and there they find just as the old monk say that on a certain day and date one hundred year before have go forth from the convent gate the monk felix and never

I down awhile and rest -lrb- _ seat himself in the confessional _ -rrb- here sit the priest and faint and low like the sighing of a evening breeze come through these paint lattice the ceaseless sound of human woe here while she bosom ache and throb with deep and agonizing sob that half be passion half contrition the luckless daughter of perdition slowly confess she secret shame the time the place the lover 's name here the grim murderer with a groan from he bruised conscience roll the stone think that thus he can atone for ravages of sword and flame indeed i marvel and marvel greatly how a priest can sit here so sedately read the whole year out and in naught but the catalogue of sin and still keep any faith whatever in human virtue never never i can not repeat a thousandth part of the horror and crime and sin and woe that arise when with palpitating throe the graveyard in the human heart give up its dead at the voice of the priest as if he be a archangel at least it make a peculiar atmosphere this odor of earthly passion and crime such as i like to breathe at time and such as often bring I here in the hottest and most pestilential season to-day i come for another reason to foster and ripen a evil thought in a heart that be almost to madness work and to make a murderer out of a prince a sleight of hand i learn long since he come in the twilight he will not see the

impetuous wind strike the great forest white with fear and every branch and bough and spray point all its quiver leave one way and meadow of grass and field of grain and the cloud above and the slanting rain and smoke from chimney of the town yield themselves to it and bow down so do this dreadful purpose press onward with irresistible stress and all my thought and faculty strike level by the strength of this from they true inclination turn and all stream forward to salem _ lucifer _ alas we be but eddy of dust uplift by the blast and whirl along the highway of the world a moment only then to fall back to a common level all at the subsiding of the gust _ prince henry _ o holy father pardon in I the oscillation of a mind unsteadfast and that can not find its center of rest and harmony for evermore before mine eye this ghastly phantom flit and fly and as a madman through a crowd with frantic gesture and wild cry it hurry onward and aloud repeat its awful prophecy weakness be wretchedness to be strong be to be happy i be weak and can not find the good i seek because i feel and fear the wrong _ lucifer _ be not alarm the church be kind -- and in she mercy and she meekness she meet half-way she child 's weakness write they transgression in the dust though in the decalogue we find the mandate write thou shalt not kill yet there be case when we must in war for instance or from scathe to guard and keep the one true faith we must look at the decalogue in the light of a ancient statute that be mean for a mild and general application to be understand with the reservation that in certain instance the right must yield to the expedient thou art a prince if thou shouldst die what heart and hope would prostrate he what noble deed what fair renown into the grave with thee go down what act of valor and courtesy remain undo and die with thee thou art the last of all thy race with thee a noble name expire and vanish from the earth 's face the glorious memory of thy sire

of sorrow serf of the soil a peasant 's child and a peasant 's wife and she soul within she sick and sore with the roughness and barrenness of life i marvel not at the heart 's recoil from a fate like this in one so tender nor at its eagerness to surrender all the wretchedness want and woe that await it in this world below for the unutterable splendor of the world of rest beyond the sky so the church sanction the sacrifice : therefore inhale this healing balm and breathe this fresh life into thine accept the comfort and the calm she offer as a gift divine let she fall down and anoint thy foot with the ointment costly and most sweet of she young blood and thou shall live _ prince henry _ and will the righteous heaven forgive no action whether foul or fair be ever do but it leave somewhere a record write by finger ghostly as a blessing or a curse and mostly in the greater weakness or greater strength of the act which follow it till at length the wrong of age be redress and the justice of god make manifest _ lucifer _ in ancient record it be state that whenever a evil deed be do another devil be create to scourge and torment the offend one but evil be only good perverted and lucifer the bearer of light but a angel fall and desert thrust from he father 's house with a curse into the black and endless night _ prince henry _ if justice rule the universe from the good action

fasting be all very well for those who have to contend with invisible foe but i be quite sure it do not agree with a quiet peaceable man like I who be not of that nervous and meager kind that be always distressed in body and mind and at time it really do I good to come down among this brotherhood dwelling forever under ground silent contemplative round and sound each one old and brown with mould but fill to the lip with the ardor of youth with the latent power and love of truth and with virtue fervent and manifold i have hear it say that at easter-tide when bud be swell on every side and the sap begin to move in the vine then in all the cellar far and wide the oldest as well as the newest wine begin to stir itself and ferment with a kind of revolt and discontent at be so long in

pope of rome and whenever a goblet thereof i drain the old rhyme keep run in my brain : at bacharach on the rhine at hochheim on the main and at wrzburg on the stein grow the three best kind of wine they be all good wine and better far than those of the neckar or those of the ahr in particular wrzburg well may boast of its bless wine of the holy ghost which of all wine i like the most this i

ambition be to man she light she life she very breath with no alternative but death find I a maiden soft and young just from the convent 's cloistered school and seat on my lowly stool attentive while the minstrel sing gallant graceful gentle tall fairest noblest best of all be walter of the vogelweid and whatsoever may betide still i think of he with pride he song be of the summer-time the very bird sing in he rhyme the sunshine the delicious air the fragrance of the flower be there and i grow restless as i hear restless and buoyant as a bird down soft arial current sail o'er blossom orchard and field in bloom and through the momentary gloom of shadow o'er the landscape trail yielding and bear i know not where but feel resistance unavailing and thus unnoticed and apart and more by accident than choice i listen to that single voice until the chamber of my heart be fill with it by night and day one night -- it be a night in may -- within the garden unaware under the blossom in the gloom i hear it utter my own name with protestation and wild prayer and it ring through I and become like the archangel 's trump of doom which the soul hear and must obey and mine arise as from a tomb my former life now seem to I such as hereafter death may be when in the great eternity we shall awake and find it day it be a dream and would not stay a dream that in a single night fade and vanish out of sight my father 's anger follow fast this passion as a freshen blast seek out and fan the fire whose rage it may increase but not assuage and he exclaim : no wander bard shall win thy hand o irmingard for which prince henry of hoheneck by messenger and letter sue gently but firmly i reply : henry of hoheneck i discard never the hand of irmingard shall lie in he as the hand of a bride this say i walter for thy sake : this say i for i could not choose after a pause my father spake in that cold and deliberate tone which turn the hearer into stone and seem itself the act to be that follow with such dread certainty this or the cloister and the veil no other word than these he say but they be like a funeral wail my life be end my heart be dead that night from the castle-gate go down with silent slow and stealthy pace two shadow mount on shadowy steed take the narrow path that lead into the forest dense and brown in the leafy darkness of the place one could not distinguish form nor face only a bulk without a shape a darker shadow in the shade one scarce could say it move or stay thus it be we make we escape a foam brook with many a bind follow we like a playful hound then leap before we and in the hollow pause and wait for we to follow and seem impatient and afraid that we tardy flight should be betray by the sound we horse ' hoof-beat make and when we reach the plain below he pause a moment and draw rein to look back at the castle again and we see the window all aglow with light that be pass to and fro we heart with terror cease to beat the brook creep silent to we foot we know what most we fear to know then suddenly horn begin to blow and we hear a shout and a heavy tramp and we horse snort in the damp night-air of the meadow green and wide and in a moment side by side so close they must have seem but one the shadow across the moonlight run and another come and sweep behind like the shadow of cloud before the wind how i remember that breathless flight across the moor in the summer night how under we foot the long white road backward like a river flow sweeping with it fence and hedge whilst farther away and overhead paler than i with fear and dread the moon flee with we as we flee along the forest 's jagged edge all this i can remember well but of what afterward befall i nothing farther can recall than a blind desperate headlong fall the rest be a blank and darkness all when i awake out of this swoon the sun be shine not the moon make a cross upon the wall with the bar of my window narrow and tall and i prayed to it as i have be wont to pray from early childhood day by day each morning as in bed i lay i be lie again in my own room and i thank god in my fever and pain that those shadow on the midnight plain be go and could not come again i struggle no longer with my doom this happen many year ago i leave my father 's home to come like catherine to she martyrdom for blindly i esteemed it so and when i hear the convent door behind I close to ope no more i feel it smite I like a blow through all my limb a shudder run and on my bruised spirit fall the dampness of my narrow cell as night-air on a wounded man give intolerable pain but now a better life begin i feel the agony decrease by slow degree then wholly cease end in perfect rest and peace it be not apathy nor dulness that weigh and press upon my brain but the same passion i have give to earth before now turn to heaven with all its overflow fulness alas the world be full of peril the path that run through the fairest mead on the sunniest side of the valley lead into a region bleak and sterile alike in the high-born and the lowly the will be feeble and passion strong we can not sever right from wrong some falsehood mingle with all truth nor be it strange the heart of youth should waver and comprehend but slowly the thing that be holy and unholy but in this sacred and calm retreat we be all well and safely shield from wind that blow and wave that beat from the cold and rain and blighting heat to which the strongest heart have yield here we stand as the virgin seven for we celestial bridegroom yearning we heart be lamp forever burn with a steady and unwavering flame point upward forever the same steadily upward toward the heaven the moon be hide behind a cloud a sudden darkness fill the room and thy deep eye amid the gloom shine like jewel in a shroud on the leaf be a sound of fall rain a bird awaken in its nest give a faint twitter of unrest then smoothe its plume and sleep again no other sound than these i hear the hour of midnight must be
