be lose in the mist of the middle age and only here and there can the historian gain glimpse of the life of early forbear still there be sufficient datum to be have for the digging upon which to transcribe inferentially at least a interesting narrative away towards the end of the twelfth century -- exact date be wholly beside the mark -- there dwell under the shadow of one of the rugged castle of the robber-captain of the mugello in tuscany a hard-working and trustworthy bonds-man -- one chiarissimo -- old honesty as we may call he he be marry to a excellent helpmeet and be by he lord permit to till a small piece of land and rear he family in addition to intelligence in agriculture it would seem that he or perhaps he wife possess some knowledge of the virtue of root and herb for in one corner of he _ podere _ he have a garden of simple the few peaceable inhabitant of that warlike valley and also many a wound man-at-arms seek old honesty and he wise mate for what we now call kitchen remedy those indeed be happy day with respect to suffer human nature kill or cure might have be the character of the healing art but certainly specialist have not invent we appendicitis and other fashionable twentieth-century physical fashion a little medical knowledge suffice and decoction pillule poultice and bleeding make up the simple pharmacopoeia all the same the satirical rhyme which a old chronicler put into the mouth of many a despairing patient in later day may have be true also of old honesty and he nostrum : there be not a herb nor a root nor any remedy to boot which can stave death off by a foot of that good couple 's family only one name have be preserve -- gianbuono good john passerinus say he be a priest -- probably he mean a hermit anyhow he acquire more property in the valle della sieve and found a church -- santa marium dell ' assunta -- possibly the enlargement of he cell -- upon monte senario between the valley of the arno and that of the sieve ser gianbuono -- ecclesiastic or not -- have two son -- bonagiunto lucky lad and chiarissimo ii in those primitive time nobody trouble about surname -- idiosyncrasy of any kind be a sufficient indication of individuality the brother be enterprising fellow and both make track for florence which -- rise phoenix-like from barbarian ash -- be thrive marvellously as a mart for art and craft ser bonagiunto in the first decade of the thirteenth century be live in the sestiere di porta del duomo and work busily in wood and stone the stalwart parent of a vigorous progeny it be he great-grandson ardingo -- a famous athlete in the _ giostre _ and a soldier of renown -- who first of he family attain the rank of _ signora _ ser chiarissimo between 1201-1210 own a tower near san tommaso at the north-east angle of the mercato vecchio -- later the family church of the medicus -- and under it a _ bottega _ or _ canova _ for the sale of he grandmother 's recipe over the door he put up he sign -- seven golden _ pillole di speziale _ -- pill or ball which be emblazon upon the proud escutcheon of he descendant he be call _ il medico _ -- the doctor -- hence the family name medicus these be the day when the foundation of the fortune of many great florentine family be lay the loaning of money be the royal road to affluence and everybody who by chance have a spare gold florin or two become _ ipso facto _ a _ presto _ or bank next after lend to one another with a moderate profit -- a _ dono di tempo _ or a _ merito _ -- quick return come the ambitious system of state loan with the regulate _ interesso _ and the speculative dealings in _ cambio _ -- on ` change -- with _ boroccolo _ -- unexpected gain and _ ritravgolum _ -- sly advantage or as we say sharp practice ser filippo or lippo -- the twin son as the name imply of ser chiarissimo ii -- what happen to the other twin we do not know -- be probably the first of he family of doctor-apothecary to deliberately abandon he less lucrative profession and establish himself as a banker in the mercato nuovo anyhow he two son be bear and baptise under the happy auspices of plenty of money the elder the prosperous doctor-banker be jubilantly call averardo -- bless with good means and the younger be christen chiarissimo iii to mark quite sententiously that whilst he bank-balance be considerable it have be accumulate by honest deal true to the variable law of vicissitude this averardo i fail to make any very great name for himself as might have be expect in a lad of so much promise he be shadow doubtless by he more strenuous parent still he add to the family possession by acquire the lay-patronage of the church of san pietro a sieve and san bartolommeo di petrone near the latter he build a _ castello _ or fortress which be then consider a title to nobility he make also a prosperous marriage with donna benricevuta de ' sizi messer averardo 's son averardo ii be in the crisscross nature of thing a man of stronger grit than he father he come to great honor as well as to great riches elect prior in 1304 he be choose as _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ in 1314 and between these date in 1311 ser teghia de ' sizi he mother 's brother make he he heir and give he besides full money-bag much valuable property and ecclesiastical patronage to he surname of medicus he add that of sizus : he be the wealthiest citizen of he day in florence he wife donna mandina di filippo de ' arriguccus of fiesole give he six son -- giacopo giovenco francesco salvestro talento and conte all of they rise to

married donna lisa de ' donatus of which union three son be the issue -- talento giovenco and averardo iii salvestro di averardo ii bear another christian name -- chiarissimo -- the old-world cognomen of he family possibly he father think it wise to stand well with the world and parade he honesty for whatever ill-gotten gain other banker acquire he at least be a upright man and he profit be just

personal ambition as ambassador to venice in 1336 he youngest son averardo iii acquire the sobriquet of biccus -- the exact meaning of which be problematical -- it may mean a worthless fellow or one who live in a castle nothing indeed be related of he but perhaps like brer fox of a later epoch he be content to lie low and enjoy without much exertion the good thing he ancestor have provide for he messer averardo marry twice -- giovanna de ' cavallinus and giovanna de ' spinus by the first he become the father of one of the very greatest of the medicus -- giovannus the parent of a still more

1342 -- the first record tragedy of the medicus as to who this unfortunate man be it be difficult to say he be call the son of bernardo de ' medicus but no such name appear in the early record of the family he be probably a descendant of bonagiunto a son of ardingo de ' medicus who be a violent enemy of the ghibelline and _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ in 1296 and 1307 and brother of francesco captain of pistoja in 1338 and one of the principal participant in the expulsion of the hate duke the first of the grand medicus be salvestro son of alamanno of the line of chiarissimo iii call the german because of he alien teutonic mother great-great-grandson of ser filippo the last of the doctor-apothecaries salvestro do not appear to have go in for the steady unromantic life of a banker but to have address he energy to the profession of arm nevertheless he be choose prior in 1318 and contribute during peace to the advancement of he city 's interest upon the outbreak of war with the viscontus of milan in 1351 he be appoint commander of the florentine force he sterling grit make itself apparent in the vigor with which at the head of no more than one hundred man he relieve the town

interest of the tradespeople and lower class he give heed to they representation for he cunningly perceive that he might ride into the undisputed leadership of the great popular party the guelph and so checkmate he other ally the aristocrat as head of a powerful branch of the rise family of medicus member of the _ popolo grasso _ or wealthy middle class cavaliere salvestro become the champion of the people all round he popularity be establish for people say he be bear for the safety of the republic he be tactful enough to conceal the personal bent of he policy and act upon the maxim which he be never tire of repeat : never make a show before the people as _ gonfaloniere _ he summon a parliament of representative of all party and class at the palazzo vecchio with a view to the composition of difference and the maintenance of public order the ghibelline would have none of he proposal but privately they be divide amongst themselves see which the cavaliere astutely announce the resignation of he office this have the effect he expect -- the palazzo and the piazza outside ring with the old cry -- _ liberta _ _ liberta _ _ evviva il popolo _ _ evviva il gonfaloniere _ salvestro de ' medicus be master of the situation -- the first of he family to attain the virtual if not the real control of the state the revolution spread through the city the palace of the ghibelline noble

lorenzo -- the two former die in childhood the choice of name for two of the boy be significant of the value messer giovannus place upon he family 's origin -- saint damiano and cosimo of course be patron of doctor and apothecary hence he be not ashamed of the golden pillule of he armorial bearing messer giovannus develop extraordinary strength of character he be a bear ruler of man and a passionate patriot he gain the goodwill of he fellow-citizen by he unselfishness and generosity -- truly not too common in the bearing of man of he time he serve the office of prior in 1402 1408 1411 he be ambassador to naple in 1406 and to pope alessandro v in 1409 and in 1407 he hold the lucrative post of podesta of pistoja in 1421 messer giovannus de ' medicus be elect _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ as the representative of the middle class and in opposition to messerus rinaldo deglus albizzus and niccolo da uzzano the ghibelline nominee the republic sigh for peace the craft for quietness but the immense liability incur by many costly military enterprise have to be meet messer giovannus propose in 1427 a tax which should not weigh too heavily upon anybody each citizen who be possess of a capital of one hundred gold florin or more be mulct in a payment to the state of half a gold florin -lrb- ten shilling _ circa _ -rrb- this tax which be call _ il catasto _ be unanimously accept -- it please the common people greatly messer giovannus be tax as heavily as anyone namely three hundred gold florin -- indicative incidentally of he wealth and honesty giovannus associate with himself another prominent man messer agnolo de ' pandolfinus the leader of the peace-at-any-price party who be remember in the annals of florence as the peaceful citizen the main point of they policy be : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- peace abroad -lrb- 2 -rrb- prosperity at home -lrb- 3 -rrb- low taxation no combination of he opponent -- and they be many and unscrupulous -- be able to damage messer giovannus 's reputation and power he could have he wish it have proclaim himself sole ruler of florence and she territory but self-control and prudence -- which be so characteristic of the man of he family -- never forsake he he die universally regret in 1429 and be bury in the church of san lorenzo which he along with the martellus have restore and endowed giovannus di averardo de ' medicus be look upon as the first banker in italy the controller of the credit of florence and the prince of financier cavalcanti macchiavelli ammirato and almost all other historian describe he as large-hearted liberal-minded courteous and charitable dispense munificent alms with delicate consideration of the feeling and want of those whom he assist never sue for honor he gain they all hostile to public peculation he strive disinterestedly for the public good he die rich in this world 's goods but richer still in the goodwill of he fellow citizen many have seek nevertheless to belittle messer giovannus 's reputation -- attribute to he a motive for all he urbanity -- that of the permanent domination of he house in the government of the republic -- not surely a fault he old rival in the arena of politics niccolo da uzzano ever speak of he after he death with unstinted praise and admiration messer giovannus share with cavaliere salvestro the undying fame of have raise upon the excellent foundation lay by they ancestor the massive support wall of that superb edifice of which he son cosimo form the cupola and he great-grandson lorenzo -- the lantern -- the light of italy the third and fourth grand medicus be of course cosimo _ il padre della patria _ and lorenzo _ il magnifico _ the story of they life and exploit be to be read in the story the literature and the art of florence of cosimo niccolo macchiavellus write as follow : he apply himself so strenuously to increase the political power of he house that those who have rejoice at giovannus 's death now regret it perceive what manner of man cosimo be of consummate prudence staid yet agreeable presence he be liberal and humane he never work against he own party or against the state and be prompt in give aid to all he liberality gain he many partisan among the citizen bear in 1389 he early evince mercantile proclivity and when a lad of no more than seventeen messer giovannus he father place he in charge successively of several of the foreign agency of the medicus bank young cosimo use he opportunity so well that he be look upon as a successful financier and come to be call the great merchant of florence he be jokingly wont to say : two yard of scarlet cloth be enough to make a citizen nevertheless he have a deep regard for the opinion and privilege of he fellow florentine one of he constant saying be : one must always consult the will of the people -- and the people reply by acclaim he _ il padre della patria _ cosimo have be call a great merchant and a grand party-leader : the first of florentine by birth and the first of italian by culture he die in 1464 he father leave in cash a fortune of nearly 180000 gold florin but cosimo 's estate total upward of 230000 -- _ circa _ # 100000 -- a vast amount in those day after the strong personality of cosimo and he masterful manipulation of commercial and political affair perhaps the unambitious rule of he son piero be a necessary and healthful corollary piero de ' medici maintain the ground he father have make he own and give away nothing of the predominance of he family and he make way after a brief exercise of authority for he brilliant son lorenzo piero 's character and career again prove the truth of the adage : ability rarely run in two successive generation all the same he die in 1409 leave he son the heir to nearly 300000 gold florin lorenzo _ il magnifico _ be the first of the grand medicus to give up entirely all connection with commercial pursuit and banking interest he tenure of office by a curious paradox mark the termination of the financial liberty of florence he be a all-round genius -- there be nothing he could not do -- and do well whatever be worth do at all he be wont to say be worth do well with he death in 1492 as benedetto dei say the splendor not of tuscany only but of all italy disappear with the beginning of the sixteenth century dawn a new era preliminary sign have appear in the growth of wealth in enfranchisement from primitive method and in the evolution of individualism love of country and the tie of family life be loosen by the universal craving for self-indulgence and personal distinction idleness sensuality and scepticism -- three baneful sister -- gain the mastery weaken the fabric of society and lead on to the evil course of tyrannicide the gradual extinction of public spirit the general deterioration of private character and the exercise of unbridled lust and passion be the livid hue which tinge with the purple of melancholy and the scarlet of tragedy the later page of florentine story \* \* \* \* \* the direct line of cosimo _ il padre dellum patrium _ the elder survive son of messer giovannus di averardo bicci de ' medici end with caterina queen of france the only legitimate child of lorenzo duke of urbino and last _ capo della repubblica _ of florence and alessandro the bastard first duke of florence the illegitimate son of pope clement vii the

in that year king vittorio emmanuele of piedmont and sardinium enter florence which with all italy be unite under the royal crown of the house of savoy the tragedy of the medici chapter i lorenzo -- _ il magnifico _ giuliano -- _ il pensieroso _ _ signor _ _ signor _ such be the stir cry which resound through the lofty council chamber of the famous palazzo vecchio that dull December day in the year 1469 never have such a title be accord to any one in florence where every man be as good as if not better than he neighbor foreign sovereign and they lieutenant who from time to time visit the city and claim toll and fealty from the citizen have never be address as _ signor _ -- lord and master the _ spirito del campanile _ as it be call be nowhere more rampant than in the city of the lion and lily where everybody at all time seem only too ready to disparage he fellow the cry be as astounding as it be unanimous -- _ signor _ _ signor _ _ evviva i due signor de ' medici _ _ signori _ _ signori _ _ evviva i due figlus della domina lucrezia _ thus it gather strength -- its importance be emphatic -- it be epoch-marking _ signor _ _ signori _ be the acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the medicus make quite freely and spontaneously by the dignified lord of the signory in the name of the whole population of florence and tuscany \* \* \* \* \* piero de ' medici die on 3rd December 1469 and he interment which be conduct with marked simplicity in accordance with he will be complete that same evening he have during he short exercise of power as _ capo della repubblica _ give a pageant -- the triumph of death he call it by way of be he own funeral obsequy -- a grim anticipation of the future indeed at midnight a secret meeting of citizen be convene by the official of the _ signorium _ within the monastery of sant ' antonio by the old porta faenza to debate the question of fill the vacant headship of the state why such a remote locality be choose be not state but it be in conformity with florentine usage which for general and personal security require secrecy in such gathering more than six hundred -- the flower of the city as macchiavellus call they -- attend and upon the proposition of ridolfo de ' pandolfinus messer tommaso soderinus by reason of seniority of year and priority of importance be call upon to preside be one of the first citizen and much superior to the other he prudence and authority be recognize not only in florence but by all the ruler of italy the soderinus have for three hundred year hold a lead position in the affair of florence but they be rival and enemy of the medicus indeed messer tommaso 's uncle -- ser francesco -- be one of the principal opponent in the city counsel of cosimo -- _ il padre della patria _ messer niccolo he brother carry on the feud and be with diotisalvus neronus agnolo acciaiuolo and other banish in 1455 for they complicity in the abortive attempt to assassinate piero de ' medici messer tommaso more prescient and prudent throw in he lot with the medicus and be choose by piero not only as he own chief counsellor and intimate friend but as the principal adviser of he two young son -- lorenzo and giuliano he have moreover ally himself to the medicus by he marriage with dianora de ' tornabuonus sister of domina lucrezium piero 's wife all the same he keep he own counsel and take up a perfectly independent line of action be quite remarkable for he display of that most pronounced characteristic of all good florentine -- the placing of florence first -- _ firenze la prima _ at the meeting at sant ' antonio he rise to speak be the signal for general applause in a few generous word he eulogise the gentle virtue of piero and bemoan he premature death in a longer and more serious oration on the condition politically and socially of florence and of the whole state he put before he hearer two uncontrovertible consideration to guide they in the exercise of the selection of a new _ capo della repubblica _ -- first the maintenance of unity and tranquillity and second the preservation of the _ status quo _ many and friendly be the interruption of the oration and over and over again shout be raise for _ tommaso soderinus il capo _ gracefully he bow he acknowledgment but with much feeling decline the rare honor offer he then he go on to say that as the supreme office have be worthily serve by cosimo and piero de ' medici it be but fitting that it should be continue in that illustrious family he expatiate upon the advantage which have accrue to florence under the headship of the medicus and he urge upon the assembly to offer they allegiance to piero 's son and to give they the authority that they father and grandfather have possess keen debate follow messer tommaso 's speech : some wish that he would reconsider he decision other be in favor of try a new man and of another family -- niccolo soderinus 's name be freely mention but gradually the meeting come to accept the proposal it gain at all event the adhesion of such pronounced ante-medicean as gianozzo de ' pittus and domenico de ' martellus and lead to a fusion there and then of the two party _ del poggio _ and _ del piano _ unanimity be the more readily reach when those who demur perceive that messer tommaso would be the virtual ruler of the state in the personal direction of he two young nephew a deputation be accordingly choose to convey to domina lucrezium and she son the condolence of the city and to offer to lorenzo the coveted headship of the state at noon on the follow day the deputation be honourably receive at the medicus palace the principal man of the state and of the city write lorenzo in he _ ricordus _ come to we house to condole with we in we bereavement and to offer I the direction of the government in succession to my grandfather and father i hesitate to accept the high honor on account of my youth and because of the danger and responsibility i should incur and i only consent in order to safeguard we friend and we property a plenary parliament be summon by tommaso soderinus and those associate with he in the conduct of public affair during the interregnum it be hold in the great council chamber of the palazzo vecchio and be attend by a full concourse of senator and other prominent citizen deputation from the guild and representative of the minor order in the piazza della signoria and the adjoining street be assemble a immense crowd of people the greater part be supporter of the medicus inside the chamber again messer tommaso soderinus be unanimously elect president and forthwith proceed to report the result of the deputation he speech be repeatedly interrupt by cry that he should reconsider he decision and accept then and there the headship of the state he again emphatically decline the honor he fellow-citizen desire to confer upon he and proclaimed lorenzo de ' medici _ capo della repubblica fiorentina _ at a preconcerted signal the arras over the doorway lead to the private audience chamber be lift and there advance piero 's widow with she two son clothe in the dark habiliment of mourning domina lucrezium throw back she thick black veil reveal upon she kindly face a sorrowful expression and she eye suffuse with tear make a lowly curtsey she draw herself up -- a queenly figure -- and hold the hand of lorenzo and giuliano on either side make she way to where messer tommaso soderinus be stand all eye be bent upon the pathetic little group and a sympathetic murmur move the whole audience every man of they have for year regard the domina as the model of what a woman and a wife a mother and a queen should be she have no rival and no detractor hers have be the wise power behind the throne for she tactful counsel have guide the action of she husband unerringly florence be greatly beholden to domina lucrezium -- a debt which nothing could repay she influence for good upon the court she munificence in charity and she unsparing unselfishness have not be without powerful effect upon every one of those hard-headed hard-hearted citizen they call to mind that well-known saying of the father of he country -- the great merchant -- cosimo : why lucrezium be the best man among we they reflect too upon the auspicious example set at the palazzo medicus where the mother 's part be conspicuous in the wise training of she family and in the loving deference she receive from she son and as they gaze upon lorenzo and giuliano de ' medici -- the hope of florence -- they recognize in the former a statesman already a ruler in the make

courtier handsome athletic accomplished and enthusiastic he physical charm appeal to every one for most florentine be greek of the greek a precocious boy of sixteen year of age he have the promise of a brilliant young manhood and a splendid maturity the personal equation be always a prominent factor in human ambition and nowhere be it more emphatically dominant than in the mutual jealousy of the man of florence the x + y sign of absolute assurance have its match and equal in the x-y sign of restrictive deference if one _ messer _ arrive at some degree of prominence then the best way for he to attain he end be to pit himself against another of he class nearest to he in influence if _ he _ be not to gain the guerdon then he rival should not have it this be the spirit which permeate the _ raison d'etre _ of each noble lord in that great assembly after the first wave of enthusiasm have pass each man begin to reflect that the best way after all for settle the contentious question of the headship of the republic be to rule every one of the magnificent six hundred out of the running and by take the line of least resistance plump for the unassuming youth before they -- medici although they be _ signor _ _ signori _ again run through the lofty chamber _ i signori di firenze _ some cry out lorenzo and some giuliano and other _ i tutte due _ -- but shout for lorenzo wax the loudest

they acknowledgment the heighten color of they face and the nervous tension of they frame indicate the fervency of they emotion in a few well-chosen sentence lorenzo express he pleasure and giuliano 's and the gratitude of they mother at this signal mark of confidence and promise to uphold the tradition of the city and the state as he forbear have do craving from the noble lord they unite sympathy and support gently lead the now smile domina lucrezium by the hand the two brother return to the private hall of audience while the great bell of the palazzo boom forth the news to the wait crowd outside the wool-worker have cease they toil the artist have leave they _ botteghe _ the market be desert and all florence forgather in the piazza to welcome _ i signori di firenze _ loud plaudit greet the noble matron and she son -- not the battle-cry _ palle palle _ indeed -- but _ evviva i medici _ _ lorenzo _ _ giuliano _ _ la buona domina magnifica _ they progress be a triumph they could scarcely make they way short as it be to the via larga for everybody press forward to kiss and stroke they hand never have there be anything like so popular a election in florence man and woman shed tear as they utter rapturously they name for be not lorenzo and giuliano the pet of the people and be not the domina lucrezium beloved by everyone the plenary parliament have complete its labor break up immediately and the excellent lord and worthy citizen hie they to they palace they bank and they office more or less pleased with the morning 's work not a few reflect rather grimly that they have place two young life between themselves and the seat of supreme authority they son might live to rule florence but they own chance have vanish for ever \* \* \* \* \* lorenzo be not backward in grip with a firm hand the rein of power young as he be he have already form he ideal and lay out he plan as to the best government of the state the yearly symposium in the casentino have be productive of much good in the training of the youthful ruler the direction of he opinion be signify in that say of he : he who would live in florence must know how to govern the repetition of this phrase be perhaps indiscreet and it cause searching of heart as the meaning of it be bear in upon the comprehension of the least friendly of the citizen lorenzo be clearly set upon the aggrandisement of he house and the dependence of all other allowance be make for a lad 's impetuosity but at the same time many a leader keep he hand tightly press upon the machinery of government everyone perceive that the young _ capo della repubblica _ be in full possession of the solid grit of he pushful grandfather he have not study the career of he famous ancestor salvestro giovannus and cosimo for nothing indeed piero he father in write to he son at cafaggiuolo to acquaint they with the death of cosimo _ il padre dellum patrium _ in 1463 have pointedly say : you mother and i offer the character and example of you grandfather to we son besides these strong characteristic he have inherit in a superlative degree the shrewd common-sense of piero and he mother 's passionate love of florence with all she enthusiasm for what be pure culture philanthropic and religious niccolo macchiavellus somewhat unwillingly admit that -- lorenzo have all the high-mindedness and liberality which anybody could expect in one occupy such a exalted station giuliano tacitly and contentedly accept a less ambitious and responsible role whilst lorenzo take the first place and occupy himself in question of state policy and in the affair of the family giuliano draw to himself all the younger man in physical exploit and mental effort from boyhood addict to sport and pastime he become _ facile princep _ in all manly exercise _ il bel giulio _ as he be call generally be moreover the leader of fashion and the organiser of all the pageant and joust with which lorenzo and he delight the citizen whilst devote most of he time to fun and frolic the young prince be acknowledge as one of the chief _ litteratus _ and a conspicuous ornament of the platonic academy the serious side to he character and he studious disposition gain for he the gentle title of _ il pensieroso _ he mother 's fond hope be that he should be name a cardinal not merely a papal princeling nor of course a religious reprobate -- as alas most of the cardinal be -- but a devout wearer of the scarlet hat and that one day he might even assume the triple tiara anyhow giuliano 's youth be as spotless as it might be amid unchaste surroundings he passion for the bewitching simonetta the star of genoa seem to have be the only serious romance of he life and therein he never arouse marco de ' vespuccus 's jealousy by he attention to he young wife indeed the love of _ il bel giulio _ and _ la bella simonetta _ be the talk and the admiration of the whole city : -- the apollo or the mercury of the new athen with he venus -- venus de ' medici the magnificent _ giostra _ or tournament which lorenzo celebrate a year before he accession to the headship of the republic be but the prelude to the exhibition of lavish hospitality such as florentine and the stranger within they gate have never witness banquet ballet and pageant succeed one another in rapid succession church and national festival gain splendor and circumstance unrivalled in any other city indeed the citizen from the highest to the meanest live in a whirl of festivity -- and they like it well the visit of friendly prince and other distinguished personage be hail with enthusiasm apparently there be no bottom to the medici purse but actually the _ capo della repubblica _ be play rather fast and loose with he opulent patrimony there come a day when the strain grow excessive and lorenzo be unable have he be willing to make advance to princely suitor and he live to repent he prodigality the first notable visitor be duke galeazzo marium sforza of milan and he duchess bona princess of savoy the retinue which accompany the sovereign be gorgeous and fill the people of florence with amazement but they wonder be tenfold greater when lorenzo display still greater magnificence in they reception macchiavellus have attribute the vast increase in the luxurious habit of the citizen to this splendid hospitality another remarkable demonstration be that which be make in 1471 upon the occasion of the succession of cardinal francesco delle rovere to the papal throne as sixtus iv lorenzo in person head the special embassy which be despatch from florence to congratulate the new pontiff the other principal member be domenico de ' martelli agnolo dellum stufa bongianio de ' gianfigliazzus and donato de ' acciaiuolo whilst the mission and its wealth of offering be receive graciously by the roman court sixtus by no means extend a cordial welcome to lorenzo the request which he make for the bestowal of a cardinal 's hat upon he brother giuliano be refuse somewhat brusquely although to be sure the pope do agree to the transfer of the custody of the finances of the curia to the medicus bank through the intervention of messer giovannus de ' tornabuonus -- lorenzo 's uncle a resident in rome lorenzo appear to have make however rather a favourable impression upon sixtus for he enter into negotiation concern the sale of the costly jewel which have be collect by pope paul ii in the end lorenzo purchase the cabinet and its contents and make thereby a very excellent bargain during he sojourn in the eternal city lorenzo acquire a number of precious antique rare manuscript and valuable work of art sixtus note he artistic taste send he many handsome gift and promise at he solicitation to prevent the destruction of ancient building and monument they part apparently excellent friend giuliano 's _ giostra _ be even more brilliant than that of lorenzo six year before it be celebrate in honor of la bellum simonetta with whom the impressionable young prince become daily more and more madly in love whether he infatuation go at all beyond the bound of platonic affection be doubtful he lovely _ innamora _ be the wife of he best friend and he honor go for much in the loyal estimation of giuliano besides this he good mother 's influence in the cause of virtue and modesty be all-powerful with both she son strange to say this romantic attachment stir the jealousy of a very prominent citizen no less a personage than messer francesco de ' pazzus he and he brother decline the invitation to the _ giostra _ and abstain from participation in the general festivity it be a case of race rivalry and of personal jealousy but it mean much in the relation of the two family the effort which lorenzo continually make to gain a firm footing in florence -- as francesco de ' guicciardinus have record -- quite naturally be productive of opposition and animosity the man who have place he in power be again in two camp -- those who be content with the _ status quo _ and those who be not the latter make less and less effort to conceal they real sentiment and at length set about to question lorenzo 's motive and defeat he project he be a _ beau-ideal _ citizen for with all he love of show and circumstance even in the fulness of he dignity and dominion he know how to retain and exhibit certain homely and simple trait which be quite after the florentine manner he meet criticism and opposition with the very characteristic statement : i will say he allow no man to put he foot on my throat this threat -- for so it be account by those who wish to discredit he -- be like a red gauntlet throw down and later on a hand -- if not a foot -- and a dagger be at lorenzo 's throat the overstrain of desire the feverishness of acquisitiveness and the lust for power often in they intensity defeat the purpose seek the personality of lorenzo wax greater and mightier day by day in the nervously articulate constitution of florence the greatest genius of he age he be not only the master of the government but the acknowledged chief of the platonic academy the first of live poet a most distinguished classical scholar and the greatest benefactor the city have ever know everything be within he grasp and everyone have to bow to he will he aim be to be autocratic prince of tuscany it be the mark of a perfect gentleman to unbend to plainer folk and to mingle with they in moment of relaxation as a youth he have with giuliano frequent the village fair in the mugello for amusement and good fellowship : indeed they bring he inspiration and popularity as well when in residence in the medicus palace he be wont to take he walk abroad quite freely and to sit and chat with the habitue of the _ osterie _ by the porta san gallo and other similar tavern florentine of the florentine he love trick and joke and be never tire of make fun at the expense of other : be it say too he know how to take as well as give a amusing story be tell of he : be at pisa he chance to see among the student of the university -- which by the way he be instrumental in re-establish and re-endowing -- a youth who squint he remark with a laugh : that lad should easily be the head of he class when question as to he meaning he reply jocosely : because he will read at the same time both page of he book and so will learn double enter thus unostentatiously into the life and habit of he fellow-citizen it be perfectly natural that he should gain they esteem friendship and loyal support he soon become out and away the most popular man in florence notwithstanding the unworthy sneer of that ill-conditioned and self-opinionated monk girolamo savonarolum lorenzo he mutter occupy the people with feast and show in order that they may think more of they own amusement than of he ambition lorenzo be under no delusion with respect to the permanence in a more or less subjective degree of the spirit of revolt which have render he father 's succession to the headship of the republic difficult the very man who have for they own end misguided piero of course be no longer powerful -- such at least of they as be still alive be in banishment but they son and they adjoint be ready enough to question he authority swiftly enough lorenzo take the measure of these man and prepare to counteract they opposition naturally he seek the counsel of domina lucrezium than whom nobody understand better the man of florence they manners and they mood long and serious be the deliberation of mother and son with she pregnant assistance he rough out a scheme so warily conceive and so faithfully elaborate that on its presentation to the lord of the signory it be accept almost unanimously this measure touch citizen in they tenderest spot -- pride and love of display -- for it proclaim the appointment of the lead _ signor _ as ambassador to foreign court and commune the one great absorb ambition of all prominent florentine be through all they history to head a foreign mission with all its honor and emolument with infinite grace and persuasiveness lorenzo put before the council the advisability of the despatch of envoy incidentally to announce he succession to the headship of the state but principally to proclaim the grandeur the wealth and the power of the great tuscan republic it be a master-stroke thus to appeal to the patriotism no less than to the egotism of they excellency and at the same time to confirm he own supremacy the bait dangle before avaricious eye be eagerly snap up and when lorenzo back up he proposition by munificently mount each embassy and by the promise of knighthood upon the return of the ambassador scarcely a man of those nominate hold back the scheme work splendidly and lorenzo have the supreme satisfaction of bidding courteous and thankful farewell to he most prominent rival among they be such distinguished leader of public opinion as bernardo de ' buongirolami cesare de ' petruccus bernardo del nero agnolo de ' niccolinus and piero filippo de ' pandolfinus they departure be the signal for the advancement of many less known man -- friend and protégés of the two brother or of domina lucrezium in this way lorenzo greatly strengthen he hold upon the supreme power two very prominent man however reject the proposal -- at once the most popular and most dangerous -- tommaso de ' soderinus and francesco de ' pazzus tommaso de ' soderinus add immensely to he popularity by he noble exhibition of self-abnegation he prudence and ability have for long point he out as the most trustworthy and experienced of he peer he whole-hearted loyalty to the cause of the medicus and the consistency with which he maintain the position he have take up at the plenary parliament in 1469 and subsequently make he by the contrariety of circumstance the most redoubtable rival of the ambitious and impulsive _ capo della repubblica _ the trusty pilot who have so effectively steer the ship of state through the troubled water of the interregnum be quite unintentionally and unwillingly the greatest obstacle in the way of the young captain everybody who have a grievance -- real or imaginary -- against the government of lorenzo seek messer tommaso 's advice and sympathy so that the situation become charge with difficulty and embarrassment the very merest change in the whim of a fickle people might upset the medicus and then the soderinus would be call upon to fill the vacancy messer tommaso 's presence in florence be both a source of strength to lorenzo and he house and a menace when the subject of the embassy to rome -- the chief diplomatic appointment of the republic -- be broach messer tommaso with the utmost sincerity express he fervent wish to meet lorenzo 's view in every respect but he express quite emphatically he disinclination to undertake such a arduous duty not only do he plead the infirmity of age but declare that he wife madonna dianora would never leave florence she love of she own city and its people equal that of she sister the domina magnifica lucrezium -- they social charitable and literary interest be alike and equal here be a condition of affair which call for the exercise of the greatest tact and ingenuity and lorenzo commit the task of overcome the scruple of he uncle and aunt to he mother she effort be entirely successful and lorenzo with a deep sigh of relief hand messer tommaso he credentials and personally conduct he and he suite to the porta romano and thence speed he upon he journey \* \* \* \* \* francesco de ' pazzus be cast in a very different sort of mould -- the very antithesis in character demeanor and aspiration to tommaso de soderini -- he have very appropriately be call the cataline of florence possess of immense wealth much of which have come to he from he father messer antonio he rapidly dissipate it by selfish extravagance : no man surpass he in the virtue or the vice -- which you will -- of self-seeking in the bitterness of a overweening and mortified ambition he reject with the utmost discourtesy lorenzo 's overture at the same time remorselessly expose he intention and vow that no pazzo should go round the corner for a medico messer francesco display unreservedly the true character of he family : he be in truth the mirror of he race -- _ l'implacabile pazzus _ the descent of the pazzus be one of the most ancient among the noble family of tuscany the senior branch claim greek descent and its member be early denizen of the hill-country about fiesole leader of man they become adherent of the aristocratic party -- the ghibelline -- and be consistent and energetic in they allegiance to the emperor the junior branch of the pazzus be dweller in the vale of arno -- man of peaceful predilection in agriculture and commerce throwing in they lot with the guelph -- the democratic party of the pope giano dellum bellum 's _ ordinamentus di giustizia _ in 1293 lead to the disqualification of the pazzus and many other notable family from the exercise of the franchise and as a consequence they be deprive of all share in the government they recognize even in those early day of the formation of the first of modern state that the medicus be rival and opponent not only in domestic and commercial enterprise but also in political advancement and no love be lose between the two family nevertheless the pazzus be beholden to they rival for the restoration of they civil rights on the return of cosimo de ' medicus from exile in 1434 they be reinstate and thenceforward maintain they position messer andrea next after cosimo the most influential citizen of florence be elect to the priorate in 1435 and in 1439 he be call upon to entertain no less a personage than king rené of france in 1441 he be _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ messer andrea leave three son -- piero giacopo and antonio piero serve the supreme office of _ gonfaloniere _ in 1462 he be the father of a numerous family -- some historian say he have nineteen child by he wife madonna fiammetta de ' guignus none of they however make they mark in the life and history of the city except the fourth son belforte renato who be a prominent man but suffer for the ill-doings of he relation if piero and he son be unassuming citizen messer andrea 's second son giacopo be of a very different disposition a man of far greater ability and more vault ambition than he brother he be look upon as the head of the family in appearance he be prematurely old and wither up with a pallid face and palsied frame with great restless stare eye he perpetually toss he head about from side to side as though afflict with st vitus ' dance giacopo be unmarried a libertine notorious as a gambler and a blasphemer a spendthrift and jealous -- beyond bound -- of the popularity and pre-eminence of piero and lorenzo de ' medici he be point at as the most immoral man in florence in the year of lorenzo 's succession to the place of _ capo della repubblica _ he obtain by bribery the high office of _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ as a set-off but by a inconsistency as unexpected as it be transparent he accept on vacate office a knighthood at the hand of he rival cavaliere giacopo 's relation with lorenzo be fairly cordial outwardly at least for as late as 1474 when at avignon he write several letter to he full of grateful expression for favor receive and of wish for a continuance of a good understanding none of cavaliere giacopo 's illegitimate child arrive at maturity and on account of the failure of he elder brother 's son to achieve distinction the proud banner of the family be clutch by the hand of the four boy of the youngest of messer andrea 's son -- guglielmo antonio giovannus and francesco they mother be cosa deglus alessandri a granddaughter of alessandro deglus albizzus who first adopt the new surname the brother be very wealthy they have amass large fortune in commerce and they house extend for a considerable distance along that most fashionable of street -- the borgo deglus albizzi the palazzo de ' pazzus doubtless be commence by they grandfather whose emblem -- a ship -- be among the architectural enrichment the building be finish by they uncle giacopo -- it be in the via del proconsolo as banker the pazzus be note for they enterprise generally and for they competition with the medicus in particular they have agency in all the chief city of europe and the east but they reputation for avarice and sharp dealing be proverbial perhaps no family be quite so unpopular in florence they tradition be aristocratic whilst the medicus be champion of the people this distinction be refer to by madonna alessandra macinghus di matteo degli strozzus in one of she letter to she son filippo at naple i must bid you remember she write that those who be upon the side of the medicus have always do well whilst those who belong to the pazzus the contrary so i pray you be on you guard the grow importance of the pazzus give piero and lucrezium de ' medici much uneasiness and it be quite certain that the marriage of they eldest daughter bianca -- piero 's tall daughter as she be call -- to the eldest of the three brother be a stroke of domestic policy by way of control the race for wealth and power lorenzo very soon after he accession to the headship of the state take the bull by the horn and exclude the pazzus from participation in public office it be a extreme measure and not in accordance with he usual tact and circumspection and of course it produce the greatest ill-will and resentment against he and he administration in every member of the proscribed family the situation become greatly embittered when in 1477 lorenzo interfere in a law-suit which concern the marriage dower and inheritance of beatrice the daughter of giovannus buonromeo by florentine law the daughter should have inherit the fortune without demur under the express will of she father who die intestate but at lorenzo 's command the estate be pass on to beatrice 's cousin carlo buonromeo who be the winner of the second prize in lorenzo 's _ giostra _ of 1468 this decision be in direct opposition to giuliano de ' medicus 's opinion and he do all he could to reassure giovannus de ' pazzus guglielmo 's brother and beatrice 's husband of friendship and confidence these be not the only incident which follow one another at the parting of the way of the two family but the affair of giovannus and beatrice be resent with peculiar bitterness by all the pazzus hence arise as francesco de ' guicciardinus have testify the wronging of the pazzus in francesco the youngest of the brethren be exhibit the most violent animosity and hatred bless with superabundant self-conceit which go so far as to cause he to spend hour a day have he unusually light-coloured hair dress at the barber 's and he face salve and puff at the apothecary 's to conceal he muddy complexion he be reckon in the mercato nuovo as little better than a ill-conditioned _ braggadoccio _ he shortness of stature he seek to atone for by he accentuation of the florentine pout and the tuscan strut -- he be well know too for he contemptuous joke at the expense of other francesco denounce lorenzo and he government with unmeasured scorn and careless of restraint threaten that he would be even with he even though it cost he he life macchiavellus say : he be the most unscrupulous of he family a man of blood agnolo poliziano call he who when he meditate any design go straight to he goal regardless of morality religion reputation and consequence early in march he quit florence suddenly give out that he presence be require at rome in connection with the affair of the pazzus bank to say that he departure be a relief to lorenzo be but half the truth for he be greatly perturb with respect to the influence which such a passionate and reckless rival would have upon he relation with the holy see francesco be the subject of watchfulness upon the part of the medici agent in rome where giovannus de ' tornabuoni set himself to thwart any hostile movement which might be make among prominent man with whom francesco de ' pazzus be throw into contact be archbishop francesco de ' salviatus and count girolamo de ' riari the archbishop and francesco be no stranger to one another they family have rise to affluence and power side by side in florence actuate by like sentiment and engage in like activity -- hatred of the medicus be mutual sixtus have propose in 1474 to bestow upon francesco de ' salviatus the archbishopric of florence but the _ signorium _ instigate by lorenzo refuse to confirm he appointment and decline to grant he the temporality of the see the pope yield very ungraciously to the representation of the florentine government and name rinaldo d'orsinus lorenzo 's brother-in-law to the vacancy this intervention be adduce by sixtus afterwards as insubordination worthy of punishment and he do not forget to take he revenge the following year francesco de ' salviatus be choose as archbishop-designate of pisa and again the florentine object -- be join by the pisan who conspire to prevent he take possession the archbishop be accord to agnolo poliziano -- the devoted historian and poet-laureate of lorenzo il magnifico -- a ignorant man a contemner of all law -- human and divine -- a man steep in crime and a disgrace to he family and the whole state count girolamo de ' riarus account a nephew of sixtus be like he elder brother piero and caterina he sister a natural child of the pope the three be treat with parental affection by the pontiff and have they home in he private apartment be wait upon by they unrecognised mother in the guise of nurse and guardian piero de ' riarus be create a cardinal when a spoilt boy and become as a man infamous for he debauchery and villainy sixtus have the effrontery to select he as successor to archbishop orsinus in florence but he action be prompt by a motive which be firmly fix in he heart this be nothing less than the supplanting of lorenzo de ' medicus by piero or girolamo so far however as cardinal de ' riarus be concerned sixtus ' ambition be wholly disappoint by he sudden death due to violent excess of all kind like he brother count girolamo the offspring of illicit lust and bring up in the depraved atmosphere of the papal court be a reprobate but sixtus ' vault ambition stop not at character and reputation he be bent upon the permanent aggrandisement of all the branch of the delle rovere family cast about for territorial dignity the pope set he heart upon the lordship of imolum where taddeo manfredus of faenza be in financial difficulty have surrender the fief to the duke of milan the proposal to bestow the lordship upon count girolamo de ' riarus by purchase be warmly resent by the florentine sixtus approach the question in a most underhand and suspicious manner he know perfectly well that negotiation be on foot for the acquisition of the property and title by lorenzo on behalf of the florentine government nevertheless he send a secret mission to galeazzo sforza duke of milan offer the handsome sum of fifty thousand gold ducat with a proviso that the duke should bestow the hand of he illegitimate daughter caterina upon girolamo by way of add insult to injury sixtus impudently seek a loan from the medicus bank with which to pay the duke : this greatly offend lorenzo and all the lead man in florence what make the pope 's conduct more despicable be the knowledge that he regard this matter as the first step in a line of policy which aim at supersession of the medicus by the riarus in the direction of tuscan affair -- himself be over-lord the pope 's demand be refuse indignantly by lorenzo who in the name of the _ signorium _ administer to he holiness a severe rebuke for he interference in the affair of florence the relation between the two government become strained but sixtus be perfectly indifferent to opposition where personal interest be concern he next move be the withdrawal of the duke of urbino he relative from the military service of the republic and he appointment as commander-in-chief of the papal force this maneuver be regard with alarm by all the italian state and a league be form by florence venice and milan to check papal encroachment sixtus make overture to the duke of milan to detach he from the alliance but apparently they fail of they object the duke be friendly with lorenzo and have no wish to become embroil with florence all these plot and counterplot be exactly to the liking of francesco de ' pazzus and he lay himself out to make capital out of they not only do he encourage the pope in he inimical policy but he place at he command the sum of money which have be refuse by the medicus bank sixtus be delighted with he new and wealthy adherent and forthwith give the president of the medicus bank in rome notice that they no longer retain he confidence as papal banker and that accordingly he have transfer the account of the curia to the care of the rival pazzus house upon francesco de ' pazzus he confer the accolade of knighthood this hostile action of course further estrange lorenzo and the government of florence and quite naturally a system of quarrelsome incident be set up with a very complete equipment of spy sixtus never conceal he desire for the overthrow of lorenzo and the subversion of the florentine government and he hostility find a whole-hearted response in the person of count girolamo de ' riari archbishop francesco de ' salviatus and cavaliere francesco de ' pazzi the pope exult openly in what capital he could make out of tale and gossip about lorenzo and he entourage two prominent florentine foment this factious spirit giovannus neronus -- the archbishop of florence in succession to archbishop d'orsinus brother of the notorious diotisalvus who be banish in 1466 -- and agnolo acciaiuolo -- also banish the same year who reside in rome and be a especial favorite at the vatican charge of opposition to the policy of the pope be freely throw in the tooth of lorenzo and some of they be true for the action of the pope lead all observant man to the conclusion that he propose to assume the rôle of arbiter in the affair of all the italian state on the other hand lorenzo 's policy be peaceful he aim be the consolidation of medicean domination in the affair of the republic cause such as these bring about the initiation of the dastardly plot know in history as the pazzus conspiracy the name be somewhat open to criticism for although the pazzus be the chief instrument employ and exceed all other in detestation of the medicus the forefront and head of the offend be no less a personage than pope sixtus iv he holiness hate lorenzo say count girolamo de ' riarus this be the cue to all that follow doubtless the pope be much in the power of sycophant and adventurer -- all immoral ruler be each know he man and hold he in the palm of he left hand and none be backward in impress this knowledge upon he we can always make we lord the pope do as we please be archbishop salviatus 's very apposite declaration it be re-echoed by francesco de ' pazzus who add significantly and we mean to rid florence of the medicus \* \* \* \* \* all through the year 1477 the three arch-conspirator be elaborate they plan of action possibly sixtus -- and we may give the miscreant the favor of the doubt -- at first merely wish to upset the government of florence and banish lorenzo and giuliano by direct means when however it be bear in upon he that the immense popularity of the medicus would in the event of they supersession only lead to they triumphant recall he agree that there be nothing for it but the removal of the two brother in a more summary manner this association of giuliano with lorenzo be a miserable exhibition of personal spite he have refuse he the cardinalate simply because he foresee the succession of a medicus to the papal throne whilst he purpose hand over the triple tiara to he son cardinal piero de ' riari nevertheless there be some idea in the mind of sixtus which he convey to he fellow-conspirator of make a agreement with giuliano that if he would condone the exile of he brother then he should be the reversion of the popedom after cardinal de ' riari some authority say giuliano lend a not unwilling ear to those overture but a saner view be that express by agnolo poliziano in a epigram : -- lorenzo -- giuliano -- one spirit love and aim animate you both -- this truly i you friend proclaim giuliano 's love for lorenzo be like that of david and jonathan a love surpass that of woman he consistently submit he own ambition to the exaltation of he brother 's magnificence the cogitation of the leader of the conspiracy be disturb by the fact that however excellent they scheme might be there be absolute necessity for the co-operation of other influence rome unaided could not cope with florence back as she be by france venice milan ferrara and mantua sixtus consequently broach the subject of the suppression of the medicus to the king of naple and to the duke of urbino -- the support of siena be always assure in any attack on she great rival the king have a personal quarrel with lorenzo because he have marry clarice d'orsinus in preference to he daughter whose hand he have in a way offer to the young prince he at once accede to the pope 's invitation and as good as he word he despatch he son the duke of calabrium at the head of a armed force professedly to demand prompt payment by the republic of arrears due to he for service render to florence at the solicitation of sixtus these troops be retain in tuscany on the pretext that the papal fief of imolum require protection of course the real purpose be a menace to lorenzo : the force be at hand to strike a swift blow when necessary duke federigo of urbino be make more or less conversant with the papal policy and with the special question of lorenzo 's removal he at once reject the proposition that resort should be have to violent or secret measure and in disgust at sixtus 's conduct he throw up he appointment as commander of the papal force whilst sixtus be make all these military preparation for the furtherance of he intention he co-conspirator remove the scene of they activity to the neighborhood of florence where the pazzus and salviatus be at one in they readiness to lay down they life for the undoing of the medicus they first of all take into they confidence one of the papal condottierus a man of undoubted courage and ability -- giovannus battista da montesicco a native of the roman campagna -- who be under heavy obligation to count girolamo de ' riarus of course he be perfectly willing as become he call to sell he sword for good payment : he further undertake to enlist he lieutenant hieronimo comitus in the cause the condottiere be send off to florence to communicate to cavaliere giacopo de ' pazzi the idea of the three chief plotter to test he feeling and if possible secure he adherence at first the old man be as cold as ice -- so montesicco say in he confession later on -- and decline to take any part in the conspiracy after hear all that be put before he he enquire whether sixtus approve the scheme why he holiness reply the condottiere have send I straight to you honor to ask you support i speak for the pope then say giacopo i be with you a few day later archbishop salviatus and francesco de ' pazzus join montesicco at giacopo 's country villa at montughus just beyond the porta rosso on the high road to bologna consultation between the head of the two family pazzus and salviatus -- be hold there with the concurrence of a certain number of influential citizen inimical to the medicus these meeting be give out as hunting-party and to blind they eye overture be make to both lorenzo and giuliano to honor the sport with they presence needless to say francesco de ' pazzus 's return to florence in company with the unfriendly archbishop arouse lorenzo 's suspicion but he do not appear to have take any action montesicco be instruct to make himself and he lieutenant familiar with the stage upon which he be destine to play he part of the plot and especially to observe the person and the habit of the two medicus prince furthermore he be direct to seek a personal interview with lorenzo on the pretence of submit suggestion propound by count girolamo with respect to the acquisition of some _ poderus _ near faenza lorenzo receive he visitor with he usual courtesy and hospitality and whilst he wonder why riario should depute such a redoubtable warrior to deal with peaceful matter he never dream that foul play be intend montesicco be greatly impress by the magnifico 's ingenuousness and nobility of character and still more by the evident esteem and affection in which he be hold by all class of the population he earnestly reconsider the bargain he have make : i resolve he say in he confession that my sword should not slay that just man the counsel at montughus be divergent and acrimonious at length a resolution be agree to as offer a suitable and secure locality for the perpetration of the deed in contemplation namely to invite lorenzo to rome in the name of sixtus such a step would be regard as a proof that the pope no longer oppose lorenzo 's government but that a _ modus vivendus _ have be reach agreeable to all party giuliano be to be include in the invitation as well of course the hope be entertain that a favourable opportunity would be afford during the papal hospitality for the murder of the two brother the archbishop take the lead in all these deliberation -- he and giacopo de ' pazzus be boon companion they make no profession of any virtue write ser varilla in he _ secret history of the medici _ either moral or christian they play perpetually at dice swear confoundedly and show no respect for religion confident in the general support of all the member of he family in any demonstration against the hate medicus he take into he personal confidence he brother giacopo de ' salviatus -- a obscure sordid man -- and he nephew giacopo -- a wastrel and a fanatical anti-medicean among the trustworthy florentine confederate the archbishop enrol giacopo son of the famous scholar poggio gucchio de ' bracciolinus originally a protégé of lorenzo but dismiss he service for insolence and rapacity giovannus perugino of san gimignano a physician attach to cavaliere giacopo 's household giovannus domenico a bridle-maker and athlete but a idle sort of fellow and napoleone de ' franzesi a friend of guglielmo de ' pazzus lorenzo 's brother-in-law another adherent be messer giovannus da pisa a notary but a factious and bad man before leave rome francesco de ' pazzus and the archbishop have agree with count girolamo de ' riarus to engage the service of two desperado in the pay of the pope -- bernardo bandino of the florentine family of baroncellus a reckless and a brutal man and a bankrupt to boot and amerigo de ' corsi the renegade son of a worthy father -- messer bernardo de ' corsus of the ancient florentine house of that ilk two ill-living priest be also add to the roll of the conspirator -- frate antonio son of gherardo de ' maffeus of volterra and frate stefano son of niccolo piovano da bagnore the former be exasperate against lorenzo for the reckless sack of volterra and because he have take possession of a valuable alum-pit belong to he family the latter be _ vicario _ of monte murlo a upstart papal précis-writer whose family be plebeian and employ upon pazzus property in that locality he be a man steep in crime and a creature of cavaliere giacopo de ' pazzus so many have be admit into the secret of the conspiracy it become a matter of urgent importance that no delay should arise in the fulfilment of the design the fear of espionage and leakage be ever present to the mind of the leader but what to do and where and how baffle all they ingenuity at last a lead come quite unexpectedly from sixtus himself at pisa be a youth study law and philosophy -- raffaelle sansonus -- the son of count girolamo 's only sister just sixteen year of age and very tender in the heart of the pope early in 1478 sixtus have preconise he cardinal of san giorgio and add the honor of legate for archbishop salviatus 's induction to that see -- the richest by the way in all italy the boy cardinal in April be direct by sixtus to make a progress to imola on a visit to he uncle and aunt and to take florence on he way for the purpose of pay he respects to lorenzo there be of course much more in this apparently innocent proceeding than appear at first view francesco de ' pazzus at once obtain cavaliere giacopo 's permission to offer the hospitality of he villa to he youthful eminence and he suite montesicco be order to furnish a escort of cavalry in the name of the pope -- man who be perfectly trustworthy and prepared to carry out whatever command they receive after the cavalcade have set forth francesco send a message to lorenzo de ' medici suggest that it might be agreeable to all party if he could see he way to entertain the cardinal both he and the archbishop who be in the company of the cardinal know very well that the proposition would be cordially entertain by the hospitable magnifico as they have anticipate no sooner have the news reach florence that the distinguished visitor be approach the city than a dignified deputation of _ signor _ set out to meet they convey a courteous invitation to be lorenzo 's guest at fiesole a splendid reception be follow by a noble entertainment whereat all the more notable dignitary of the city and the principal member of the platonic academy assist among the guest of honor be archbishop francesco de ' salviatus with the ambassador -- giovannus morino represent ferrante king of naple filippo sagramoro the duke of milan and ercole di bendio the duke of ferrara in special attendance upon lorenzo and of ambassadorial rank be the cavalierus agnolo della stufa luigi de ' guicciardinus bernardo de ' buongirolamus and buongiano de ' gianfigliazzus and other the conspirator be in a state of the highest expectation that montesicco and he lieutenant would have no difficulty in find opportunity to effect they dastardly purpose during the festivity they be doom to disappointment for at the last moment and when the banquet be in progress it be remark that giuliano be absent -- he be indispose and unable to attend the function \* \* \* \* \* the Sunday follow 26th April happen to be the name-day of the cardinal and he express a wish to hear high mass in santa marium del fiore lorenzo announce he intention of personally conduct he eminence to the duomo and request he to honor the domina clarice and himself by attend a state dinner at the medicus palace in the via larga at the conclusion of the ceremony this be much to the mind of the confederate for surely there would be a favourable opportunity for the execution of the plot in secret session it be arrange that at the moment of the elevation of the host giovannus battista da ' montesicco should stab lorenzo whilst francesco de ' pazzus and bernardo bandino should fall upon giuliano the condottiere however firmly refuse to commit the double crime of sacrilege and murder and point-blank decline all further share in the conspiracy here be a entirely unlooked-for situation and a alternative plan be not easy to arrange francesco de ' pazzus seem inclined to step into the breach but detestation of lorenzo check he ardor -- he would not soil he hand with the blood of such a contemptible tyrant a menial should administer the blow there be no lack of volunteer ready to take montesicco 's place but excessive caution be requisite that no prominent florentine conspirator should be choose lest suspicion should be arouse finally the two clerical member of the conspiracy fratus antonio and stefano be entrust with the grim duty the appointment be quite the best that could be make because at the cathedral lorenzo and he immediate entourage would be place with the clergy within the choir whereas to the pazzus and the other confederate place would be assign outside the screen among the unofficial congregation everything be in order the great bell of the duomo be sound its invitation and the sacred building be pack with worshipper and spectator in full state lorenzo accompany by domina clarice and they court lead cardinal sansonus to he chair of estate by the high altar if as he himself affirm lorenzo be deprive of the pleasure of smell he have compensation in the greater acuteness of the other four sens and it must have strike he keen eye as he pass to he place that there seem to be a unusually large muster of adherent of the pazzus and salviatus probably he reflect that they be there arm in honor of the cardinal who be the guest of cavaliere giacopo and under the guidance of archbishop francesco as deputy of he holiness the pope in the vast congregation everybody of importance in florence be assemble with two notable exception -- the mother and the only brother of lorenzo il magnifico the domina lucrezium who have suddenly retire from the prominent position she hold at the court of she son remain at careggus with the venerable madonna contessina cosimo 's widow upon whom she wait with the utmost devotion the other absentee be once more giuliano consternation seize upon the conspirator for the slaughter would not be complete without the shed of he blood the preliminary anthem be be sing as the procession of the celebrant of the mass with he sacred minister move from the new sacristy and every head be bow before the symbol of the cross hesitation on the part of the confederate mean ruin and perhaps death : this no one know better than francesco de ' pazzus beckon to bernardo bandino he lead the way to the north door of the cathedral and hurry off with he to the medicus palace not many yard away ask to see the lord giuliano the porter lead they into the courtyard and presently the groom of the chamber conduct they into the young prince 's apartment giuliano be nearly dress and he valet be give some final touch to he abundant brown hair and to he robe hasten my lord the mass be in say or you will be too late exclaimed francesco we have come to conduct you to the duomo giuliano be in a gleeful mood and joke he visitor upon they unexpected attention at length he cry out : lead on pazzo -- medico will follow take he in he humor francesco slip he arm round giuliano 's waist -- apparently as a mark of good-fellowship but really for the purpose of feeling whether he be wear armor under he blue velvet tunic with bandino on the other side the three make the rest of they way through the dense crowd in the via larga be greet respectfully by old and young though many wonder at _ il bel giulio 's _ unwonted companion enter the duomo the three stand a moment whilst a clear course be make for giuliano to the center of the congregation lorenzo and the clergy and dignitary within the choir be already upon they knee ready to prostrate themselves as the celebrant hold aloft the sacred host near lorenzo be giovannus de ' tornabuonus he uncle -- famous for he wealth influence at rome and he probity -- antonio and lorenzo de ' cavalcanti lorenzo de ' tornabuonus marco de ' vespuccus and filippo deglus strozzi chamberlain of honor and other distinguished florentine and the foreign ambassador no sooner have giuliano reach the entrance to the choir and be about to genuflect than francesco de ' pazzus who have follow he closely whip out he sword at the very moment of the elevation and run the devout prince through the back at the same time bandino leap upon he and stab he repeatedly in the breast it be all the work of a instant and giuliano fall over upon he side he crimson life 's blood ebb swiftly out of nineteen gaping wound and dye he scarlet robe deep purple francesco 's frenzy be diabolical for he leap upon the still quiver body of he victim and stab he again and again -- wound he own thigh in he fury bandino next attack francesco norus a chief agent or manager of the medicus bank a man of renown and honor who vainly throw himself forward to shield he unhappy young patron and he cut he down to the ground with a filthy execration he raise the drip weapon in the air prepare for yet another victim meanwhile the two perjure priest who by the mock grace of they order be place within the choir have take up position immediately behind lorenzo as though to render he assistance in the divine service suddenly attack he with dagger but unskilfully lorenzo scramble to he foot and cast he heavy mantle of state over he shoulder draw he sword in self-defence turn to see who he opponent be he receive a scratch in the neck from stefano 's steel then from the raise dais he descry the tumult at the choir gate whilst cry of _ il giuliano e morto _ reach he ear desperado be struggle with the clergy and the acolyte by the great lectern and call out he name for vengeance one more murderous than the rest be scale the low sanctuary wall hold he gory dagger in the air and make for the chair of estate -- it be bernardo bandino commend the domina clarice to the care of he uncle lorenzo pass hurriedly up the step of the altar and gain the new sacristy follow closely by the two cavalcantus who be battle with the infuriate bandino and he confederate -- _ abbasso il lorenzo _ they yell escape through the doorway luca della robbia 's great bronze gate be slam to by angelo poliziano almost crush antonio cavalcantus who fall with a deep wound in he shoulder and actually fling to the ground outside in the aisle the rage baffled bandino then arise write filippo strozzus in he family _ ricordus _ -- he be a eye-witness of the tragedy -- a great tumult in the church messer bongiano and other knight with whom i be converse be stupefy one flee hither and another thither loud shout fill the building and the hand of friend of the pazzus and salviatus all hold gleaming weapon the young cardinal remain alone crouching by the high altar until he be lead away by some priest into the old sacristy whence he be escort by two of the ` eight ' with a strong bodyguard to the palazzo del podesta inside the new sacristy it be discover that lorenzo 's wound be serious enough to call for immediate treatment and one of he devoted page young antonio de ' ridolfi suck it for fear of poison the great heavy metal door be incessantly batter from without but no one dare to open they and lorenzo remain where he be until the hubbub in the duomo appear to be abate then another page sismondo dellum stufa climb up into the organ gallery whence he could look into the church and report that none but friend of the medicus remain and they be cry out for lorenzo to accept they escort to the palace so the magnifico depart all the while the great bell of the palazzo vecchio be boom out its dread summons for the city train band and the armed member of the guild to assemble for the defense of the city and the maintenance of they liberty loud cry of _ liberta _ _ liberta _ roll up the street drown by a great chorus of _ evviva le palle _ _ abasso i traditori _ the whole city be in a uproar and blood be be spill on every side what have happen be tragically this whilst one half of the conspirator be tell off to strike the fatal blow the other half be direct to rally round archbishop salviatus who by the way make some excuse for not assist ministerially at the mass but take up he station close to the north door of the duomo directly they see giuliano strike to the ground they make all haste to the palazzo vecchio and demand a interview with messer cesare de ' petrucci the _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ who have be detain by urgent matter in the court when messer petruccio enquire the nature of

archbishop who enter the apartment alone he ask he to be speedy as he have to join the banquet to the cardinal di san giorgio almost immediately salviatus say he be the bearer of he family 's greeting to the _ gonfaloniere _ and also of a private brief to he from the pope he manner seem so strange and he errand so irregular that petruccio 's suspicion be arouse and raise the arras he see the passage be fill with armed man at once he call the palace guard to arrest the intruder and cause every door of exit to be lock the object of course of the archbishop and those with he be to seize the person of the _ gonfaloniere _ and possess themselves of the banner of justice -- that they might rouse the citizen to fight in its defense on the contrary the people be for the medicus and _ palle _ _ palle _ prevail note that the salviatus do not leave the palace and that the guard have be withdraw from the gate and every door be bolt the populace break into the building rescue the _ gonfaloniere _ and the _ signor _ with he and seize the person of the intruder without more ado they run the miscreant francesco giacopo and giacopo di giacopo de ' salviati giacopo de ' bracciolinus

with tender finger they count each gaping wound ah how gently they cut off lock of he rich hair as memorial of a sweet young life they bury giuliano that same evening with all the honor due to he rank amid the tear of a immense concourse of people -- stay for a while from they savage man-hunt to the medici shrine of san lorenzo they bear he -- the yellow light of the wax candle reveal the tomb of cosimo and piero there be not a citizen say macchiavellus who arm or unarmed do not go to the palace of lorenzo in this time of trouble to offer he he person and he property -- such be the position and the affection that the medicus have acquire by they prudence and they liberality lorenzo come out on the loggia and address the people mass in the street he thank they for they devotion and assistance but entreat they for he dear dead brother 's sake to abstain from further atrocity and to disperse to they home in peace nevertheless all the pazzus and salviatus be proclaimed _ ammonitus _ and they be pursue from house to house whilst the peasant take up the hue and cry in the _ contado _ bleeding head and tear limb be everywhere scatter in the street door-post and curb-stone be dash with gore man and woman and the child too be all relentless avenger of _ il bel giulio 's _ blood it be say that one hundred and eighty stark corpse be bear away by the merciful _ misericordium _ and

and woman and even child to the lung ' arno and pitch like a load of refuse into the dusky river several of the arch-conspirator hide for a while in various place mostly in convent but they time come for punishment the two priest antonio and stefano be two day after the tragedy in the duomo bring out of the cellar of the _ badium _ of the benedictine at santa firenze and kill not swiftly and

that he be put he own safety before all other consideration he work he way through the struggle crowd in the cathedral and get out by the south portal luckily enough the cardinal 's horse have be leave tethered by its affrighted groom hard by so without await news from the archbishop he vault into the saddle and make off at a hand gallop to the porta santa croce with more cunning than giacopo have show he make not to the tuscan hill but to the tuscan sea and reach corneto just in time to board a ship bind for the east and at the point of weigh anchor at gala he go ashore and communicate with sixtus who send he a goodly sum of money and sundry papal safeguard with he blessing there he lay hide for many week but as luck would have it one day he come out of he lair in a turkish divan

knowledge of the conspiracy indeed they be all away from florence except the fourth renato and he be behead for not have reveal the plot he be privy to the treachery of he uncle giacopo and he cousin

battista da montesicco 's fate be perhaps the only one which excite commiseration even from the point of view of the medicus a soldier of fortune he weapon be at you command do you but fill he pouch with ducat of rome or florin of florence to he it matter not whether the adventure partook of romance and espionage or of intrigue and murder unlike many of he profession he be a religious man and just he draw back from he bargain as soon as he have experience of lorenzo 's character and he refuse point-blank to slay he in a spot where christ could see he as he say it do not appear that he be inside the cathedral that dread April morning but remain on watch to see what transpire on the defeat of the conspiracy he flee with many more right out of tuscany agent of the medicus however pursue he and have capture he drag he back to florence before the lord of the _ signorium _ he make confession of what he know of the conspiracy and of he own part therein on 4th may just seven day after the

former never express the least regret or concern at the tragic occurrence in florence but openly deplore the failure of he scheme to replace lorenzo by girolamo furthermore he issue a bull which begin : iniquitati filius et perditionis alumnus and end by anathema of lorenzo whereby he be excommunicate and all florence place under a interdict moreover he lay violent hand upon donato acciaiuolo the florentine ambassador and but for the prompt intervention of the envoy of venice and milan would have cast he uncharged into the dungeon of the castle of sant angelo the majority of the florentine merchant in rome be arrest they property confiscate and to add insult to injury sixtus demand from the _ signorium _ the immediate banishment of lorenzo he express he keen sorrow for the death of the pazzus and salviatus he devoted son and trusty counsellor he speak of the execution of the archbishop as a foul murder cause by the tyranny of the medicus and he put a price upon the head of cesare de ' petrucci the _ gonfaloniere di giustizia _ as for count girolamo who have coward-like keep in the background -- he be probably little more than a complacent tool in the hand of the pontiff -- he be permit to leave florence in the train of the young cardinal immediately before the reception of the interdict he return to rome and abandon himself to a life of profligacy he palace become a brothel and a gambling hell and there he live for ten year dishonoured and diseased he retributive death be by the hand of a assassin in 1488 the failure of the plot whilst it add tremendously to the popularity of the medicus and strengthen still more lorenzo 's position throw the pope frantically into the arm of the king of naple he persuade he to join in a combined and powerful invasion of tuscany at ironto the neapolitan troops cross the frontier and encamped whilst the papal force move on from perugium and siena lorenzo at once call a parliament to consider the position and to take step for the protection of the city and the defense of the state he address the assembly as follow : i know not most excellent lord and most worshipful citizen whether to mourn or to rejoice with you over what have happen when i think of the treachery and hatred wherewith i have be attack and my brother slay i can not but grieve but when i reflect with what eagerness and zeal with what love and unanimity on the part of the whole city my brother have be avenge and myself defend i be move not merely to rejoice but even to glory in what have transpire for if i have find that i have more enemy in florence than i have think i have i have at the same time discover that i have warmer and more devoted friend than i know it lie with you my most excellent lord to support I still or to throw I over you be my father and protector and what you wish I to do i shall do only too willingly all the hearer be deeply affect by lorenzo 's oration some indeed shed tear but all vow to support he in resist the enemy at the gate take courage they cry it behove thee lorenzo to live and die for the republic at the same time they enrol a bodyguard of twelve soldier whose duty it should be to accompany lorenzo whenever he go abroad and to protect he in he palace or at he villa doubtless they think the pope might resort to further secret measure for the slaughter of he enemy thus end the terrible conspiracy of the pazzus chapter ii ippolito -- _ il cardinale _ alessandro -- _ il negro _ lorenzino -- _ il terribile _ _ the first tyrannicide _ go at once ye base-born bastard or i will

he body in the sacristy of san lorenzo and the next day the funeral obsequy be hold without pomp -- as be the custom of the _ signor _ -- but quite simply truly it may be say that however gorgeous the ceremony might have be they would have prove altogether too mean for so great a man this relate to the death of lorenzo il magnifico which occur on 8th April 1492 that year be one of the most memorable in modern history : columbus discover america roderigo borgium be elect pope charle viii become the most prominent political figure in europe and the power of florence have reach its zenith she be not only the head of the tuscan league and the chief republic in europe but also the first of modern state if the spirit of the greek inspire the physical prowess of the roman the enlightenment of the florentine bring forth the renascence of the art and craft of italy and of the world cosimo _ il padre della patria _ lay the foundation-stone of medicus renown in the iron grip of he powerful personality and piero he son maintain unimpaired its eminence by he urbanity and good sense to lorenzo however be reserve the distinction of place upon that mighty column its magnificent copestone and he adorn it with the sevenfold ball of he escutcheon whilst on the summit he hold unfurl the great red cross oriflamme of florence lorenzo leave three son and three daughter to uphold that ensign and to exhibit the glory of they house to the first-born piero come the great inheritance of he father 's place and power and no man ever enter into a greater possession -- a possession so firm so unquestioned and so portentous that nothing seem likely to disturb its equilibrium or to sully its triumph but the son of he father be not always he father 's son and this quaint say be perfectly true of piero de ' medici -- a youth of twenty-one year of age -- the exact age of he father on he succession to the headship of the state physically the young prince be well favor he be culture and like he unfortunate uncle giuliano he be a adept in all gentlemanly exercise alas he take not the slightest interest in politics nor in the business affair of he house and the proverbial urbanity and pushfulness of the medicus be alike absent whilst he lightly hand over to piero dorizzi di bibbiena he chancellor the conduct of public affair he listen to the proud persuasion of he mother to whom anything like commercial pursuit be abhorrent clarice d'orsini 's forbear have all be soldier lorenzo 's merchant that make all the difference in rome 's degenerate day of course there be no florentine girl good enough to be the bride of young piero de ' medici -- at least domina clarice he mother decide so she be the proudest of the proud and as ignorant and prejudiced as she be haughty she son could only wed a roman princess and by preference a daughter of the orsinus consequently alfonsina daughter of roberto d'orsinus clarice 's cousin enter florence in state on 22nd may 1488 for she magnificent nuptials with the young _ capo della repubblica _ the same year the domina die she influence have not be for good and she want of tact and she unpopularity cause lorenzo much anxiety perhaps however a prince of he conspicuous and in many way unique ability be better mate with a unsympathetic spouse than with a woman who could from parity of gift enter into he feeling and aspiration he live for the magnanimous renown of florence -- she for the selfish prominence of she family francesco de ' guicciardinus write of piero de ' medicus thus : he be bear of a foreign mother whereby florentine blood get mixed and he acquire foreign manners and bear too haughty for we habit of life the prince give up most of he time to pleasure and amusement with the young noble of he

ruler 's measure and he be find want the imprisonment and threaten execution of he cousin lorenzo and giuliano de ' medicus be a flagrant mistake the three have quarrel about lorenzo il magnifico 's pretty daughter luigium but it be a baseless rumor that she have be poison bad blood be make always in florence by such romance and such interference in September 1494 charle viii cross the alp and whilst savonarolum fanatically hail he come to florence as god 's captain of chastisement politician of all party look to piero to show a bold front and resist the french invader as commander-in-chief

less than two year old the nun of santa marium be remove to rome and they take with they along with other unfortunate little pasqualino upon a visit which pope leo pay to the convent he notice the young boy and as he smile and try to get at he holiness leo be strike with he good look and make enquiry about he origin in the end leo undertake the little fellow 's education and maintain he

that principality to the pontifical estate upon the excommunication of the rightful sovereign he mother be a woman of color a tartar slave-girl who pass for the wife of a _ vetterale _ or courier in the pay of the duke he be a native of colle vecchio near riete in umbrium and go by the name of bizio da collo whilst the girl be simply call anna alessandro later on be make to feel the baseness of he origin for he be greet contemptuously as alessandro da colle vecchio he suppose father bizio die in 1519 but cardinal giulio de ' medici adopt he the two boy grow up together at the vatican alike in one respect only they mutual hatred of each other they be indeed as unlike as two boy could be ippolito as the child of gentle parent have a aristocratic bearing he be a clever lad and excel especially in classical learning in music and poetry in appearance he become remarkably handsome with polished manners and a fondness for spend money and for ostentation alessandro on the other hand exhibit the attribute of he low-born mother physically well-made he be dark of skin with dark curly hair thick lip and close-set eastern eye he taste be unrefined he have none of ippolito 's gentleness and attractiveness but in disposition he be morose passionate and cruel he manners be mark by abruptness and vulgarity he be no genius and refuse to receive the lesson of he master and set at defiance all who claim authority alessandro be a shrewd lad all the same and become clement 's inseparable companion -- no doubt he be he son everybody notice the mutual affection between uncle and nephew which give clear indication of a nearer relationship clement 's word be alessandro 's law and when the cousin fall out as they do many time a day the interference of they uncle bring peace but for ippolito dissatisfaction as he be usually rule to be in the wrong this boyish rivalry lead to more considerable emulation and the propriety of the papal palace be rudely shake by the quarrel and the struggle of the cousin they be part and remove each to a remote portion of the palace with separate suite of attendant and they only meeting take place in the private apartment of the pope and rarely thus ippolito and alessandro enter upon they teens with no judicious kindly or formative influence around they it be say that each boy throw in the other 's face the fact of he illegitimacy which fawn dependant have reveal to they they environment and associate be most undesirable and nothing be do to instil and encourage sentiment of honor self-control truthfulness and charity they initiation into the hypocrisy of spiritual life and ecclesiastical duty produce distaste and contempt for religious exercise there be yet another protégée of clement 's leave upon the world of mutability and chance -- a orphan child the only issue of lorenzo duke of urbino and he wife maddalena daughter of jean de la tour d'auvergne et de bourbon marry in 1518 the delicate young mother die in childbirth the following year leave she sweet little baby girl caterina to the care of she broken-hearted husband the future queen of france be place with the foundling nun of the convent of santa

out the instruction of clement and she only relinquish she charge when the pope command the young girl just eleven year old to rome apartment be provide for she and she suite in the palazzo medicus where madonna lucrezium lorenzo il magnifico 's daughter and wife of giacomo de ' salviatus be appoint she protectress without a mother 's care and toss about here and there caterina grow up devoid of high principle and become the toy of every pass pleasure and indulgence all the eligible prince of europe be in turn suppose to be she admirer and rival for she hand and fortune and truly the last legitimate descendant as she be of the great cosimo be a prize in the matrimonial market -- if not for she beauty and she virtue at all event for she wealth and rank indeed there be a project seriously entertain see that the elder line of the medicus have fail to produce a male heir of acknowledge caterina as _ domina di firenze _ with a strong council of regency to carry on the government in she name this proposal do not gain any favor outside the papal cabinet : in florence it be scout with derision two violent politician if not more lose they head over the young girl 's destiny -- battista ceus for propose that she should be place in the lion ' den and bernardo castiglione for demand that she should be put upon the street of florence wear the yellow badge of woman 's shame in rome caterina conceive at once a invincible repugnance for alessandro -- she father 's son he appearance he manner he language appal she probably she be not long before she know the story of he birth on no account would she speak to he and if he enter a apartment where she happen to be she rush out cry _ negrello -- bastardo _ with ippolito on the contrary she be the best of friend she admire the good-looking boy he talent for music and he skill in gentlemanly exercise the venetian ambassador at the vatican remark in a letter to he government : we have here a little medici princess caterina the only child of the late lorenzo duke of urbino she and don ippolito the bastard son of duke giuliano be inseparable companion the boy be very fond of he young cousin whilst she be devote to he she have confidence in nobody else and she ask he only for everything she want ultimately of course caterina de ' medici become queen of france as the consort of henry ii the trend of affair in florence give pope clement grave anxiety for of course he own personal control become less and less effective upon he elevation to the papacy accredit representative of the family be require to be in residence there for the maintenance of medici supremacy alas legitimate male heir of the senior branch from cosimo _ il padre della patria _ be non-existent and giovanni delle bande nere and he family would not have he be choose as _ capo della repubblica _ consent to be dependent upon rome clement take counsel with the florentine ambassador who have be send to congratulate he upon he elevation very adroitly he place by he chair of state the two youth who pass for medicus and who be as dear to he as son -- ippolito and alessandro in compliment to the pope and certainly not from conviction the fourteen envoy agree in ask he to send the two boy to florence under the charge of a worthy administrator who should hold the rein of government in clement 's name delighted with the success of he stratagem clement choose the cardinal of cortona one of he most obedient and faithful creature to accompany ippolito nearly sixteen year old to florence as quasi-regent for the lad with they go as ippolito 's chamberlain four florentine youth of good birth who be favorite of the pope alessandro de ' pucci pietro de ' ridolfi luigi della stufa and palla de ' rucellai the cortege be receive in florence without demonstration of any kind but certainly ippolito make a very favourable impression by he good look and gaiety the cardinal and he companion draw rein first at the church of the ss annunzia where they hear mass and they then ride on to the renovate palazzo medicus a meeting of the _ signorium _ be convene and by a narrow majority ippolito be declare eligible for the office of state the appointment of passerinus be unfortunate he be write benedetto varchus like most prelate extremely avaricious he have neither the intellect to understand the florentine character nor the judgment to manage it have he understand it ippolito assume at once the style of il magnifico and begin to display a lust for power and a taste for extravagance quite unusual in so young a lad the cardinal yield to every whim and very soon a goodly number of courtier rally round the handsome youth have launch one of he protégés successfully upon the troubled sea of florentine politics clement despatch alessandro under the care of rosso de ' ridolfus one of he most trustworthy attendant with little caterina de ' medici they be instruct to report themselves to cardinal passerinus and then without delay to proceed to the villa poggio a caiano this be a very wise arrangement on the part of clement in view of the strenuous rivalry and emphatic dislike the two lad have for each other the two be keep apart as they have be at the vatican but this lead naturally to the creation of rival party and rival court each of which acclaimed they respective young leader as _ il capo dellum repubblica _ and _ il signora di firenze _ better far as matter turn out have it be deem sufficient to advance ippolito alone he splendid talent -- although link to fickleness and inconsistency -- and he liberality appeal to the florentine and he might have prove a second lorenzo il magnifico the sack of rome in 1527 and the imprisonment of clement vii in the fortress of sant angelo raise the spirit of the republican of florence niccolo de ' soderini francesco de ' guicciardinus and pietro de ' salviatus take up a strong position as leader of a popular party and once more the cry of _ liberta _ _ liberta _ be raise cardinal passerinus be advise to leave florence and to take the two lad with he among those who escape from rome be filippo negli strozzus and he wife clarice they post off to florence and whilst filippo temporise with the cardinal and with the party of reform on either hand clarice declare openly for the opponent of she own family she attend a specially convene meeting of the anti-medicean party and place she service at they disposal it be arrange that she should visit the cardinal the follow day dress superbly wear the family jewel and convey in a state sedan-chair she proceed to the palazzo medicus -- the house of she father ippolito and alessandro with they tutor and attendant meet she upon the grand staircase and conduct she to the presence of the cardinal standing in the long gallery she pour forth a torrent of scornful word upon the base-born scion of she family my lord she cry my lord to what a pass have my family sink do you think that any of my great ancestor would have bear you so long alas that my race have none but female legitimate offspring then turn to the astonished lad she continue : you have better both look out for yourselve and go away before the cardinal here destroy you and florence some of the suite try to interfere and to pacify the enraged woman but to no avail she go on vehemently to denounce the intrusion of the two bastard begone you who be not of the blood of the medicus both of you from a house and from a city to which neither of you nor you patron clement -- wrongfully pope and now justly a prisoner in sant angelo -- have any legitimate claim by reason of birth or of merit go at once ye base-born bastard or i will be the first to thrust you out she hearer quail under she invective and passerinus humbly promise to quit the palace but when clarice have go he send for filippo neglus strozzus and expostulate with he filippo 's apology be as quaint as it be effective have she not be say he a woman and a medicus he would have administer to she such a public chastisement as would have go bad with she he nevertheless strongly advise the cardinal to depart and he convey the intelligence that the life of the two lad be by no means secure and that should anything happen to they the pope would demand they at he hand on 29th may 1527 cardinal passerinus with ippolito and alessandro and they suite accompany by filippo ride out to poggio a caiano amid the execration of the populace thence they depart for rome where the young man live more or less quietly for two year in clement 's private apartment at the vatican \* \* \* \* \* in spite of ippolito 's superiority of appearance manners and attainment the pope make no concealment of he preference for alessandro he create he duke of citta di penna -- a fief within the papal state -- and decide that the riches and greatness of the house of medicus should be continue in alessandro and not in ippolito ippolito write varilla be seize with incredible grief and indignation and it seem to he that be older a nearer relation to the pope and better endowed by nature so rich a inheritance should rather be he either not know or not believe the rumor that alessandro be clement 's son goad by what he conceive to be a legitimate ambition ippolito post off to florence with the idea of seize the executive power clement despatch baccio valorus after he with entreaty and promise and find that he have no welcome among the florentine ippolito return quietly to rome the pope immediately and without consult he preconise he cardinal -- greatly to he disgust he have no wish for ecclesiastical preferment he be a soldier at heart and mean to be ruler of florence clement note the young man 's partiality -- he be only just twenty year of age and he encourage he in he extravagant taste by liberally endow he cardinalate a brief _ in commendam _ be bestow upon he whereby the revenue of all vacant benefice and papal dignity for six month be transfer to he account moreover in 1529 he be appoint archbishop of avignon legate of perugium and administrator of the see of casale these fat endowment very considerably affect ippolito 's position in rome he have a court of three hundred notable personage of all nation he most intimate friend be soldier and statesman of renown and writer and artist of the highest ability and fame clement have placate ippolito set to work to carry out he plan for alessandro he write on he behalf to the emperor charle v to invite he on he way from flander whither he have travel to avoid dispute with ippolito to

whereby it be agree that alessandro should espouse margaret charle ' illegitimate daughter and that clement should create florence a dukedom in favor of alessandro at the same time the emperor be ask

franchise only in the election of civil magistrate the _ coup d'état _ be complete and meekly enough the _ signorium _ declare that -- consider the excellent quality life and habit of the most illustrious duke alessandro de ' medici son of the late magnificent lorenzo duke of urbino and in recognition of the many and great benefit receive both spiritual and temporal from the house of medicus he be eligible for all the office of state alessandro at once begin to follow the bent of he base inclination as supreme head of the state he rule autocratically and set justice and decency at defiance the florentine abashed by the pass in which they find themselves seem powerless to oppose the duke 's aggression upon they liberty that have come to pass against which they have strive for hundred of year -- florence be subject to _ il governo d'un solo _ significantly enough alessandro take as he motto _ un solo signora una sola legge _ and this he stick up all over tuscany he apply it

dissolute government a deputation be send to the emperor charle to complain of the tyranny of the duke and to expose he immoral life this seal ippolito 's fate for alessandro at once take step not only to checkmate the action of the deputation but to circumvent the destruction of he rival clement have of course full knowledge of the condition of affair in florence and of the increase of hostility between the cousin but both he and paul iii who succeed he as pope in 1534 keep ippolito engage in military and diplomatic duty away from italy know he predilection for soldier he be

mortally wound and die within the fortress on 30th November 1526 at the early age of twenty-nine a interesting little story concern the first anniversary of cosimo 's birth he father dream on the eve of that day that he see he son asleep in he cradle and over he head he behold a royal crown in the morning he do not tell madonna marium what he have see in the night-watch but something prompt he to test the will of providence accordingly he tell he wife to take the precious little babe up to the balcony on the second floor of the palazzo salviatus in the via del corso throw down the child he cry from the street below the madonna refuse and rate she husband for he madness but he insist and threaten so vehemently that at last in abject terror she let go she hold of she babe the boy leap from she arm into the air and whilst the distract mother utter a wail of anguish giovannus deftly catch he little son in he arm the child chortle merrily as if enjoy he weird experience and inasmuch as he never so much as utter the slightest cry of fear the intrepid condottiere feel perfectly reassure as to the auspicious presage of he dream that be all right he exclaim my vision be no fantastic picture -- my bonnie boy will live to be a prince -- prince of florence madonna marium leave so young a widow -- she be only twenty-five -- consecrate she life to the care of she young son -- just eight year old -- and under she parental roof in the via del corso she engage some of the best teacher of the day to undertake he education cosimonino 's aptitude for military affair and he taste for chemical study soon make themselves apparent but the doting mother have a secret enemy she child 's enemy indeed a enemy so powerful and by all account so relentless that she life become a burden in she effort to shield she boy from peril that enemy be no less a person than the pope clement of course know very well of the existence of giovannus delle bande nere 's son and heir and whilst he hail the death of the father as a gain for he personal ambition he fear the life of he child would peril he hope for alessandro he own illegitimate son cosimo giovannus 's boy must be keep out of the way at all hazard and marium the widow be very soon well aware of the pope 's aim by every means in he power clement strive to obtain possession of little cosimo but he mother be as watchful as she be prudent and till she boy reach he twelfth year she never let he go out of she sight and keep she take he away to remote part of italy with trusty attendant that the pope might not discover they whereabouts then she choose a faithful friend of she family maestro pierfrancesco riccio da prato to superintend he further education if not the wisest of teacher he be admirable for the exact discharge of he duty and inculcate the best tradition of the medicus together tutor and pupil visit many part of central italy and spend some time at venice the chief subject of they study be the heroic doings of the ancient greek and roman this be the usual curriculum for grow boy and doubtless its observance induce that admiration of tyrannicide which mark the character of so many young florentine in 1523 when clement so artfully persuade the florentine ambassador to request the despatch of the two bastard ippolito and alessandro to florence the only man who maintain he opposition be messer giacopo de ' salviatus and he again protest in person both to clement in rome and before the _ signorium _ in florence against the creation of alessandro as head of the republic once more this loyal citizen withstand the bastard duke when he put he hand to the building of the fortress of san giovannus naturally messer giacopo 's opposition excite the animosity of alessandro who if he do not actually inspire he assassination be at all event privy to it but in spite of all cosimo grow and flourish display he father 's courage and he mother 's prudence at fifteen he character appear to be already form he be grave of aspect and severe in manner very backward in form friendship and intolerant of familiarity in 1536 the emperor charle and he court be in residence at bologna and hearing that young cosimo de ' medicus be also in the city the monarch send for he and receive he with marked cordiality observe the young man 's bearing and evident force of character charle take he by the arm and place he hand upon the lad 's shoulder say to he : you be fortunate young man to have have for you father a soldier who make both france and spain tremble between fifteen and eighteen we have few record of cosimo 's life and no hint as to where he be during the terrible year of tyranny and debauchery in florence anyhow duke alessandro owe he no kindness nor do he enter into any relation with he what dealings he have with lorenzino and giuliano he cousin be unknown they be nearer the succession to the ducal throne than himself -- indeed the former be regard as next heir to alessandro in all probability the young man live with he mother at the villa at castello which have belong to he father and keep himself very much out of sight \* \* \* \* \* the news of duke alessandro 's assassination very soon get about and group of citizen gather in the via larga and also in the piazza del signoria although considerable excitement pervade those assemblage the people remain quiet and self-controlled everybody as benedetto varchus have record speak out quite fully as though no one doubt but that the greater council of the city would at once be summon they debate as to who would be

who come to press upon they lordship ' attention the claim of little duchess caterina duke lorenzo 's only legitimate child the proposition meet with unanimous disapprobation and fall to the ground outside in the piazza be a shout struggle crowd of citizen something unusual be go on and the cry of the people penetrate the window of the council chamber -- _ evviva il figlio di giovanni delle bande nere _ _ evviva il cosimonino _ _ evviva cosimo il duca di firenze _ the council rise at once without come to a decision but each member of it understand the import of that cry and each be quite ready to accept the popular verdict as they regain the street they see a youthful cavalier with a small mount retinue surround by a enthusiastic crowd of citizen they have ride fast from the mugello and be cover with dust signor cosimo write benedetto varchus arrive in florence with but a few follower as the son of signor giovannus of fair aspect and have always display a kindly disposition and a good understanding he be like greatly by the populace and they hail he as heir to duke alessandro with marked affection affect neither grief nor joy he ride on with a air of serene importance show rather he merit for the throne than he wish for it dismount at the palace he visit cardinal cibo and express he regret at the duke 's sanguinary death go on to say that like a good son of florence he have come to place not only he fortune but he life at the service of he country cosimo be name head of the state not duke on four condition : -- 1 to render justice indifferently to rich and poor 2 never to disagree with the policy of the emperor 3 to avenge the death of duke alessandro 4 to treat he three illegitimate child with kindness those who come to the front through they own genius or they destiny upon the first step of the throne accept the condition of they appointment but upon the last step they commonly impose they own upon they maker consequently although but a youth of nineteen year of age at the time of he opportune arrival in florence cosimo at once show he intention of assume personally and untrammell the government of the state cardinal cibo and francesco de ' guicciardinus who have be the first to recognize not only he claim but he fitness to rule be very tactfully set aside and other who might be expect to assert power of direction and supervision be quietly assign to position where they could not interfere with he freedom of action within six month of he acclamation by the people as head of the state cosimo obtain from the emperor charle v the full recognition of he title of duke of florence there be great doings at the palazzo medicus in the may of 1539 when cosimo welcome he bride donna eleanora second daughter of don pedro de toledo duca d'alba the king of spain 's viceroy at naple she be certainly no beauty but a woman of estimable quality and profoundly imbue with the spirit of devotion hardly perhaps the wife cosimo would have choose have not reason of state as usual guide he eleanora nevertheless prove herself a worthy spouse and a exemplary mother within the palace eleanora be shock to find a little child _ la bia _ -- short for _ bambina _ baby -- she be call some two year old no one seem to know quite who be she mother some say she be a village girl of trebbio and other a young gentlewoman of florence only cosimo 's mother madonna marium know and she refuse to reveal the girl 's identity but she admit that la bium be cosimo 's child eleanora would not tolerate she presence in the palace so cosimo send she off with several attendant to the villa del castello where perhaps fortunately she die on the last day of February the following year the first year of cosimo 's government be year of unrest and peril throughout tuscany the adherent of the dead bastard duke be neither few nor uninfluential encourage by the clementine coterie in rome the member of which have from the first opposed cosimo 's succession to the headship of the republic they make the florentine court a hot-bed of intrigue and strife the party not inconsiderable which support the claim of giuliano younger son of pierfrancesco the younger and brother of lorenzino alessandro 's murderer give much trouble giuliano who have be a associate of the duke and a abettor of lorenzino 's devilry flee precipitately from florence and seek the protection of the duke of milan lorenzino 's confession be write partly with a view of remove suspicion from he brother and to leave unprejudiced the claim of he father 's family there be many other clique and party great and small each bent upon the other 's destruction in particular and upon the undoing of the republic in general by far the most formidable opposition to cosimo 's rule come from venice whence the florentine exile under the command of filippo neglus strozzus 's two son piero and roberto who have marry lorenzino 's sister laudomium and maddalena raise with the assistance of the king of france a strong force and invade tuscany it need not the persuasion of madonna marium to urge cosimo to action although she active representation to the emperor -- which obtain the imperial sanction and promise of co-operation -- be important factor in he resolution cosimo gather together what man he could rely upon in florence and when once he battle-banner be unfurled with the black pennon of he redoubtable father number of old campaigner hasten to he support on 31st July 1537 the opposing force meet in the valley of montemurlo cosimo display much of the daring and ability of he father and victory be never in doubt the strozzus and baccio valorus be take prisoner to florence bind upon broken-down farm-horse and they force be disperse it be report that in the heat of the battle otto da montanto a imperial officer ride past cosimo lower the point of he sword as he shout forward signore to-day the fortune of the emperor and of cosimo de ' medicus will prevail cosimo wear no velvet glove in deal with he enemy secret and pronounced arrest confiscation torture banishment and execution thin once more the rank of the noblest family of tuscany filippo negli strozzus who be regard as the leader of the anti-cosimo party be take prisoner and cast into the fortress of san giovannus apparently he aim be not a restoration of a papal nominee to the headship of the state but he own advancement to that position he be put on the rack and eventually do to death by cosimo 's order the year 1538 1539 and 1540 be deeply dye with the blood of victim florentine vengeance again prove itself satisfy only with wholesale annihilation it have be compute that in the latter year alone nearly five hundred man and woman chiefly of good family and high distinction come by violent death of these one hundred and forty-six be decapitate by cosimo 's express order perhaps the terror be inevitable but it reveal in a lurid light the revengeful and implacable temper of the young ruler if he have inherit through many generation the craft and pushfulness of the medici he have also become possess of some of the brutality of the sforza through he grandmother caterina natural daughter by the lovely but dissolute lucrezium landrianus of galeazzo marium duke of milan this prince possess all the worst point of a renaissance tyrant and be a monster of vice and virtue : perhaps he be insane at all event caterina be accustom to speak of he as _ uno fantastico _ there be at least one ray of sunshine in that year of swift dark deed for in less than a month after poor little _ la bia _ have fly back to heaven as lovely and as precious a gift as ever come to gladden the heart of young parent be vouchsafe to cosimo and eleanora in the birth of they first-born a girl in the _ registrus dei battezzati dell ' opera di santa maria del fiore _ be the follow record : on April 13th 1540 be baptise a female child of the duke of cosimo bear on the third

company a strong and vigorous boy dark-haired and sallow like he spanish mother he be christen francesco after the patron saint of he day of birth cosimo be not in florence at the time he have go to pay he respects to the emperor charle v at genoa the object of he visit to the imperial court be to thank charle for the german bodyguard of _ landesnechte _ which he have send to florence to defend the medicus palace and its inmate during the three year of disorder and repression and to ask for a extension of they service florence be full of spaniard who have occupy tuscany in force under the commendattore raimondo da cardona and who have help in the terrible sack of prato they be a menace to peace and order in the city and brawl between they and the citizen be of daily occurrence duchess eleanora perhaps naturally hold with she fellow-countrymen certainly she make a poor attempt to conceal she dislike for florence and its people at santa marium novellum she endow a chapel for mass which serve as a rallying-point for the foreigner and acquire thereby its name _ cappella degli spagnuolus _ the duchess have however other than quasi-patriotic duty to perform for in 1542 she again become the mother of a little daughter -- isabellum romolá they call she in compliment to beloved spain she be like francesco a healthy child and she be fair as playful as a kitten and thoroughly medicus in temperament cosimo busy himself in peaceful pursuit he greatly encourage the art and craft and set on foot sagacious reformation of the condition and activity of the great trade guild the college of science be due to he patronage and in 1540 he extend he special protection to the florentine academy -- whence spring the still more famous accademia dellum crusca still due regard be pay

find but alas for they woe and not for they weal whilst boy and young man in florence be free to come and go as they like and to mix with all sort and condition of man and woman the case be precisely the opposite for girl very especially severe be the restriction impose upon the grow daughter of the duchess eleanora bring up amid all the austerity and fanaticism of the spanish court eleanora de toledo view woman 's early life from the conventual point of view jealous of she child 's honor she fence she three daughter around with precaution which render they life irksome to themselves and troublesome to all who be about they marium and she younger sister be literally shut up within the narrow limit of the apartment they occupy in the palace -- happily for they it be not the palazzo

at court function and rarer still in the city if they be allow a day 's liberty in the country they be jealously guard and every attempt at recognition and salutation of such as they chance to meet be rigorously check beyond association with they brother and anxiously watch intercourse with the member of the ducal suite they knowledge of the sterner sex be absolutely want it be in vain that cosimo expostulate with he consort she be inexorable and indeed she stretch she system so far as to exclude the lady of the court perhaps she be right in this for the duke himself be the daily object of she watchfulness cosimo be wont to meet she restriction by some such remark as well you see eleanora marium and isabellum be of the same complexion as myself we have need of freedom at time to enjoy the pleasure of the world love we all know care neither for lock nor bar and lovely young maria de ' medicus be surely make to love and to caress she have many adorer whose ardor be all the more fierce by reason of they inability to press she hand and kiss she lip she be in 1556 betroth to prince alfonso d'este eldest son of the duke of ferrara he be certainly not in the category of lover even at sight for he have never see he bride to be that be a entirely unimportant incident in matrimonial arrangement the union be project entirely for political reason and chiefly for the put a end to the protracted contest for precedence between the two family which every now and again threaten to plunge all italy into war alfonso d'este be the heir of he father ercole ii -- of he title and wealth but not of he good look and polished manners : besides he reputation for chastity and sobriety be not of the best directly marium be tell of the arrangement she express she disgust and she determination not to submit to parental dictation she reception of the prince be cold in the extreme she decline to see he apart from she sister and attendant and he return to ferrara in no amiable frame of mind meanwhile love true love have peep through the jalousy of princess marium 's window and he arrow have flee they dangerous course unseen by any but herself and he whose heart be hers no one suspect that a life so guard could by any means be filch from its restraint but so it be and the first gossip spring out of the mouth of a venerable spanish retainer of the duchess the faithful _ custode _ mandriano who guard he mistress 's door almost night and day traverse one day a unfrequented part of the garden of the palace on the hill the old fellow think he hear voice and approach a grove of laurel he descry the young princess in the arm of malatesta de ' malatesti the duchess be furious when mandriano tell she and immediately convey the portentous news to she husband cosimo reflect long and act warily for he make no move for many day stealthily he track the unsuspecting lover to they trysting-place mandriano 's story be quite correct he summon the two young people to he private closet he acquaint they with the fact that the _ liaison _ could not continue and order malatesta to prepare for immediate imprisonment -- with the loss of all he honor and the confidence of he sovereign the boy plead in vain and testify to the innocence of the love-making without effect except to raise the duke 's anger to a dangerous pitch marium throw herself at she father 's foot and appeal for mercy for she lover ask that the parental vengeance should fall on she and not on malatesta that you shall have base child of mine cosimo cry in a fierce tone see you shall have the justice of a roman father then pluck out he poignard from its hidden sheath he stab he child to the heart draw forth the gory weapon he fling it at the head of the despairing youth and throw he cloak around he shoulder rush out of the chamber slamming-to the door malatesta must have fall in a deadly swoon across the lovely form of he _ innamora _ incapable of speech and action for there they be find both apparently dead by brethren of the _ misericordium _ who have be summon by the duke malatesta be throw into prison and there he languish for seven long year without anyone know of he existence he parent have ask cosimo repeatedly about the boy but no answer be ever give -- the duke have forbid the subject to be name to the duchess he prevaricate and hint that the sudden death of the child be due to the malignant spotted fever and that he have give personal instruction for the immediate removal and interment of she body the brethren of the _ misericordium _ might have enlighten the grief-stricken mother only they be swear to secrecy they know how the beauteous young girl have die they lay she fair body to rest in a grave unknown even to she father and not among she people in san lorenzo cosimo move the court immediately to livorno and thence to pisa and there they keep they lenten fast in strict seclusion there be universal grief in florence where the unhappy princess though rarely see in public have become the favorite of the people through she fresh young beauty and by what be know of the sweetness of she character and the brilliancy of she attainment duchess eleanora and she child mourn piteously for lovely marium : there seem to be no solace for they grief as for the duke he be a changed man the bitterness of remorse have turn he natural reserve into moroseness he be like one beside himself he wonted firmness and self-control at time fail to stay he and he prefer to shut himself up alone in one of the tower of the castle at livorno vent he passionate despair in fit of weep and in abject cry of self-reproach no one dare to go near to he for to all who presume to intrude upon he woe he be like a lion rouse that ever ready secret blade might be whip out to another 's undoing still in calmer moment he reflect as muzio have suggestively write : marium be very beautiful as beautiful as any child of earth most courteous and gentle she seriousness compel everyone to respect she she sprightliness to love she she be please to heaven whither she have go sinless to reinforce the angelic choir and to wear the most fragrant coronal of rose among the company of holy virgin as for the unfortunate young malatesta he pine in he dungeon within the keep of san giovannus for a while but hope springeth ever in youthful heart and he one and consume thought be of escape he conduct seem to have be exemplary and he gain the sympathy and friendship of he gaoler at length he venture to unbosom himself to a worthy sergeant of the guard and this man assist he know well what great risk they both incur one evening malatesta unseen save by he friend scale the prison wall and make good he escape from florence and tuscany he do not venture to seek sanctuary within he father 's castle but fly to the coast board a vessel bind for candium a fief of venice and outside duke cosimo 's jurisdiction various tale be tell of he future career -- some affirm that assassin in the pay of duke cosimo track he to he doom and other that he fall fight against the turk at famagusta anyhow the kindly sergeant be put to death by order of the duke \* \* \* \* \* cosimo de ' medicus be not the sort of man to brood very long over trouble however prostrate and desperate he be essentially a man of action prompt eager and able : probably no one ever have a more thorough confidence in he own ability there be several question of supreme importance both public and private which claim he attention the everlasting disagreement between the aristocracy and the democracy be only partially heal by the alliance of the two against a autocracy cosimo be bent upon be absolute ruler of tuscany and the development of he will raise against he and he government constant opposition he mean to keep he hand tight hold of the bridle of he charger tyranny and to spur he on where he will the mediceo-este dispute still call for firmness and determination tuscany and florence have certainly a better case than the romagna and ferrara but intrigue and bribe could achieve what the sword and pen could not cosimo mean to keep on he steel gauntlet although he cover they with the fragrant silk glove of plausibility with this idea ever present he be bent upon retain the advantage he have gain over duke ercole in the matter of poor young donna marium 's betrothal for he have other daughter to consider donna isabellum be provide for for better or for worse -- alas that the latter be to be she sad fate -- beautiful fascinating isabellum de ' medici but donna lucrezia nearly fifteen year of age be the forfeit she father pay in he gambit of medicean aggrandisement in the July that follow donna maria 's tragic death with all the circumstance and pomp of state ceremonial lucrezium de ' medicus be marry to alfonso ii duke of ferrara the same prince who have be affiance to she sister marium it be not without misgiving that this step be take : duchess eleanora in particular express dissatisfaction with the match and fear perhaps superstitiously the portent of a second unlucky alliance anyhow the preparation for the nuptial day and the pageant which accompany it draw off the thought of all from the terrible event of christmas cosimo however have other and from he own personal point of view more attractive object upon which to expend thought and action as soon as the marriage festivity be over he set out with a small suite of expert surveyor and agriculturist to the maremma it be a peculiarly unhealthy region and have go out of cultivation and its former inhabitant have desert it the duke determine to drain the land by cut a canal right through from the arno to the sea next he set to work to afforest the newly recover ground to carve it

wild game he rebuild and enlarged the ruin castle of rosignano ten mile from livorno for the occupation of himself and he family and for he hunting associate at pisa he have peculiar interest the university which lorenzo il magnifico have refound have be abandon by he successor and be close cosimo take the matter up : he re-establish all that have be do by he illustrious predecessor and endow a number of professorial chair -- especially in chemistry wherein he be himself a ardent student and sapient expert -- and kindred science and found scholarship or apprenticeship for youth of every station the climate of pisa suit duchess eleanora and young don giovannus -- who be a delicate lad -- better far than that of florence it be sedative and not so rigorous in winter as that of the higher val d'arno then too they be there within easy reach of they favorite seaside residence livorno in whose harbor ride constantly galleon of war from spain fly the duchess ' own dear country 's

pleasure with he son and so the year pass on with ray of brilliant sunshine pierce the cloud of darkling deed alexandre duma have well sum up the character of cosimo de ' medicus : he have he say all the vice which render he private life sombre and all the virtue which make he life in public renowned for splendor whilst he family experience unexampled misfortune he people rejoice in prosperity and gladness perhaps in the delight of music and dancing and in the invigorating exercise of the chase cosimo find he best-loved relaxation no florentine value more thoroughly and share more frequently

destine he for the service of the church pius iv succeed to the papal throne in 1559 and he election be in a great measure due to the advocacy of the duke of florence in January of the following year

who be gather round the mild and religiously-minded pontiff cardinal de ' medicus 's secretary be the erudite and upright abbot felice gualterio who subsequently gather together he letter and literary

with they family and court the pope greatly desire that cardinal giovannus should enter holy order and to this the young prince cordially and reverently accede but for reason of he own cosimo decline he consent remark that a prince of he house be more distinguished than a consecrated prelate as a set-off to this discourteous reply to pius the duke whilst at pisa found the military order of san stefano as a thank-offering for the subjugation of siena much after the pattern of the knight of malta -- constitute himself grand master and the cardinal chancellor giovannus actually undertake he duty as archbishop by grant letter of appointment to benefice within he diocese one be date 24th October 1562 and be address to the bishop of arezzo about the presentation to a certain abbey which have become vacant upon the death of cardinal dellum cueva it be at this period that pius write to duke cosimo suggest a matrimonial alliance between the duke 's eldest son don francesco -- who be undertake a princely tour of the chief european court for the double purpose of make himself known personally to the various sovereign and of look out for a suitable consort -- and the princess marium

he be the merriest among he brother and sister mischievous and passionate too at time he endear himself especially to he mother by he fascinating manners and he whole-hearted devotion whilst regard he

florentine fleet at pisa naming as he vice admiral baccio martellus the most valiant and best experienced naval commander in he force and the head of one of the most ancient florentine family in spite of cardinal giovannus 's expression of affection for he younger brother there be no doubt that he be not a little jealous of he mother 's partiality for garzium one would have think that duchess eleanora would have regard with special delight and love the son who most resemble herself in appearance and disposition but perhaps the reason for she preference may be gather by look into the happy radiant laughing face of she bonnie little son as paint by angelo bronzino at the uffizus in florence it would seem that when the court reach rosignano the duchess giovannus and garzium complain of fever and they be for a few day confine to the house the good air and the charm of country life be specific and the invalid regain they vigor and they good spirit and all be eager for the sport each day have its particular rendezvous and what form the pastime should take be agree overnight by the chief huntsman and falconer the duchess eleanora do not always accompany she husband and ernando -- who be not quite thirteen -- generally remain with he tutor at the castle until afternoon when they both sally forth with little piero to meet the returning-hunting party upon the ever-memorable twenty-sixth of November the duchess have be persuade by don giovannus to go with they for there be to be a deer-drive in the forest between the castle and livorno and he expect to have a chance of exhibit he skill as a marksman at a notable full-grown roebuck giovannus and garzium be equally fearless rider and very soon after the game have be round up the special quarry they be after go off at a tremendous rate out-distance he pursuer until he be lose in the forest the brother separate and meet again in a open glade where both descry the buck quietly browse upon the fresh green grass garzium seem to have sight the animal first but whilst he be somewhat slow in bring he weapon to he shoulder the cardinal aim fire and drop the game he at once dismount and run to claim the prize high word follow and when giovannus make some insulting remark about he less mature station as a marksman garzium over-heated by the chase and aggravate by he brother 's raillery hastily draw he heavy hunting-knife and brandish it before giovannus 's face threaten to do for he if he do not desist and withdraw he claim to first shot giovannus push the boy from he perhaps somewhat roughly and then garzium have entirely lose command of himself strike a blow at he brother which wound he severely in the groin giovannus fall to the ground exclaim and this from you garzia may god in heaven forgive you call help at once the blast of the horn soon gather round the unhappy brother courtier and huntsman giovannus be bleed freely he hose and buskin be saturate and garzium be weep piteously and cry out despondently oh god i have kill giovannus oh god i have kill giovannus a huntsman snatch up the gory lethal weapon lest the boy in he despair should turn it upon himself all that they could do to staunch giovannus 's wound they do and have make a temporary stretcher with gun and hunting-cloak the little cavalcade be prepare to move on to seek further assistance they have not proceed very far when the duke and he attendant ride upon the scene halt the bearer of he son he enquire who it be they carry before any one could make a reply don garzium run shriek up to he father it be I you

when she have enquire for she first-born marium there too on the sward be she favorite son she garzium apparently in a swoon and she advance to aid he garzia hear he mother come towards he and rouse himself he run and throw himself into she arm weep bitterly then once more he turn to he father pleadingly and kneel to he grasp he leg implore pardon for he crime -- for neither father nor son doubt but that giovannus be dead bare he head and hold he arm wide apart to heaven the duke appeal to god to direct he action then turn to he son grovel at he foot behold thy brother 's blood he cry with bitterness ask vengeance of god and of I thy miserable father and now i shall deal with thee alone certainly it be a heinous crime for a father to kill he son but it would be a still more grievous sin to spare the life of a parricide lest he go on to exterminate he family and lay they name in the dirt to be execrate of all man i have now resolve what to do for i would far rather live in history as a pitiless father than as a unjust sovereign the duchess judge that cosimo actually intend to slay he son and know how fruitless any effort of hers would be to avert such a terrible calamity fall upon she knee and pray aloud to heaven to save the poor young boy and spare she own broken heart shut she eye and cover she ear she await more dead than alive the fall of that hand within which be convulsively grasp a flash poignard cosimo once more pray most earnestly to god to approve the justice of he deed to pardon he for so execute the divine wrath and for peace for the soul of he young

possession stretch from the adriatic to the apennine extravagant and devoted to amusement he spare neither time nor money in the full enjoyment of pleasure the court of ferrara become under he the most splendid court in europe -- famous for the excellence of its music and its dancing and the superiority of its theater -- carnival last from new year 's day to ash Wednesday duchess rena never love she husband nor he people until she fall under the influence of calvin she be discontented passionate and bigoted the duke scout she ill-humour and treat she cruelly _ peu d'amys qui conques est lo d'eulx _ be say of unhappy rena she give she disposition to she son but he do not follow she religious predilection he enclose she in a convent -- the sanctuary of princely widow and orphan -- where she die in 1597 duke alfonso send to florence for he consort early in 1560 but true to she determination duchess eleanora require he to come for lucrezium in person with perhaps less frigidity than he have exhibit the year before but with very little more friendliness alfonso make he second appearance in florence he be accompany by cardinal de ' medici he brother-in-law -- so soon to come to a tragical and untimely end in the maremma -- and a princely escort of two thousand five hundred horseman the young duchess not yet sixteen mount upon a cream-white palfrey ride out of the porta san gallo by the side of she husband the day be gloomy and the purple and white crocus which child scatter before she betoken so it be say disaster anyhow it be a sorrowful parting with she parent and with florence never again be she destine to see they or it the day of she childhood spend happily enough with she brother and sister be over : the fatigue and intrigue of a hostile court be before she and already trouble have mark she young life with scar -- more be to follow the duke and duchess enter ferrara in full state on 21st February but they reception be as cold as be the weather the dynastic dispute whilst ostensibly heal at its head still affect the limb of the duchy the people be to a man and perhaps to a woman anti-medicean and show they disapproval of they sovereign 's consort by abstain from take they share in the festivity one 's heart bleed for this child-bride of seven month introduce unguarded to the gayest maddest and most corrupt court in italy of the ferrarese it have be justly say : by nature they be incline only for pleasure and revenge true enough happiness and tragedy be close partner in life 's story no one love lucrezia de ' medicus in ferrara -- least of all she husband perhaps the position may be succinctly state -- the bride of three night be not _ enceinte _ have she only possess the attribute of come motherhood lucrezium 's origin might have be condone but surely it be foul cruelty which fix the fault on she alone as it be the poor young duchess be accord at she husband 's court the position of a ' _ cosa della lussuria _ ' -- to be set aside as soon as the novelty have pass away the duchess determine possess as she undoubtedly be though so young of much of the force of character of she family to put a good face upon thing she letter to she parent write during the carnival be full of pleasant detail of she new life she be enjoy with girlish zest the gaiety around she and enter fully into the merry prospects of the court masquerade whether she expression be quite sincere be perhaps immaterial under the circumstance -- she know she father 's disposition too well to make complaint the anniversary of she wedding come round to find she childless and devoid of any prospect of issue duke alfonso be far too much engage in politics and pleasure to give he due to he wife who yearn in vain for the fulfilment of the conjugal vow duchess rena have she party at court a party oppose as she be to anything and everything florentine : she son give heed to she caution and thus the breach widen alfonso 's long absence from home and he disinclination for he wife 's society leave lucrezium to seek necessary consolation elsewhere she do not fail of admirer in that giddy court : the wonder be that she maintain she dignity as well as she do the duke become jealous of course of he neglect wife -- all faithless husband be the same he pay spy to report to he the daily occupation of the duchess with the name of she visitor and friend thus evil eye and ear be open and evil tongue begin to wag until they cause the utter undoing of the innocent young duchess alfonso in vain try to fix the lover of he wife -- she be as tactful as they be prudent -- but he be not without means to he end the duchess early give symptom of ill-health in florence she be the strongest of all she father 's family but at ferrara she become delicate and a victim to incessant sickness what could it be the court physician hint at pregnancy but the duke know that be impossible so far as he be personally concerned nevertheless it serve its purpose the winter come on and the duchess be confine to she apartment in the palace suffering from continual fever and nausea maestro brassavolum -- of good report as a specialist in feminine ailment -- treat she unsuccessfully unhappy lucrezium -- no mother to console she no friend to speak to she all alone in the big palace with unkindly attendant -- nearly sob herself to death daily bleeding and cupping further diminish she strength some say that don francesco she brother be urge by he mother to pay lucrezium a visit but the bad term upon which he stand with duke alfonso be a effectual bar to he mission whether from craven fear or premeditated cruelty the duke never enter the sick-room and seem entirely indifferent to he poor young wife indeed he continue he life of prodigality and self-indulgence unrebuked as we must suppose by he conscience at last the duchess ' condition become so critical that the physician could no longer disguise the danger and they intimate to the duke the approach of death then and then only alfonso find he way to he wife 's bedside with a sorrowful stricken face she greet he affectionately and remorse seem at length to have bring he to he sens he become the most tender of nurse and watch by he die wife day and night -- but the _ poison _ have work its cause at midnight 21st April 1561 after month of cruel suffering neglect affronted and wrong the innocent soul of poor young lucrezium duchess of ferrara pass into another world she be not yet seventeen year old -- in bitter experience of life 's hardship she be seventy at the autopsy of she body maestro pasqualus of florence declare that death be cause by putrid fever thus be the duke 's duplicity preserve funeral honor due to she rank be render and she shrunken little body be bury in the estensus chapel of the convent church of corpus dominus a marble slab before the high altar read thus : _ lucretia de ' medici -- moglie di alfonso ii duca di ferrara _ -- and that be all -- as curt and as cruel as possible the duke 's show of grief be as insincere and hypocritical as could be he shut himself up in he palace with a few choose crony for seven day meanwhile send off bishop rossetto a court chaplain to florence to communicate the sad tiding to duke cosimo and duchess eleanora very soon after the death of lucrezium the marchese creole de ' contrari a prominent ferrarese noble be cast into prison upon a unstated charge but it be give out by he jailor that he have aspire to the hand of a estensus princess he be never see alive again for he be strangle in duke alfonso 's presence -- who cause he name to be vilely link with that of the poison duchess cosimo and eleanora make a show at least of grief and a splendid _ requiem _ be sing for lucrezium at the medici church of san lorenzo at the same time cosimo make know in most heartless fashion to alfonso that whilst he be resign to the will of heaven he assure he of he sincere affection and express a fervent wish that nothing should loosen they bond of true and solid friendship devout duchess eleanora 's indifference be harder to explain than duke cosimo 's nonchalance perhaps in she case evil association have corrupt good manners or more likely the memory of she child marium 's terrible death compel discretion in she dealings with she husband -- tyrant of tyrant it might be she turn next to feel that cold steel and what about duke alfonso well very soon he forget all about lucrezium and find consolation though actually he need none in a second marriage this union however lead to the resurrection of the hatchet of discord which cosimo and ercole have agree to bury underground the new duchess be barbara d'austrium sister of the archduchess giovanna bride of don francesco poor lucrezium 's brother a double wedding be fix at trento in August 1565 but a fracas occur at the church door between the medicus and estensus suite for precedence the two princely couple be marry separately by the emperor maximilian 's command each in the capital of the bridegroom 's dominion duke alfonso die in in 1597 \* \* \* \* \* one notable effect of the foreign marriage of the medicean prince be the settling of alien in considerable number in florence with clarice and alfonsina d'orsinus have come greedy roman adventurer with margherita and giovanna d'austrium many enterprising german self-seeking spaniard come with eleanora de toledo from one point of view this foreign immigration be advantageous -- it tend to revive the fall fortune of florentine commerce on the other hand alien be introduce into prominent position at the court and in the city whose speculation rob the citizen of they fame and fortune in the suite of duchess eleanora de toledo be several young relative bind to she by tie of affection and look to she for patronage and advancement the rank of these dependant be constantly be recruit by young people of noble birth for whom the exceptional educational advantage obtainable in florence be strong attraction one of these be the duchess 's niece and godchild -- donna eleanora the daughter of she brother don garzia de toledo bear in 1553 in naple where she father keep he court as viceroy for the king of spain the child lose she mother when she be only seven year old the duchess eleanora adopt she and send to naple for she and little eleanora de garzia be bring up with the child of cosimo and eleanora and she be regard by they as they sister upon the duchess ' melancholy death in 1562 she daughter isabellum duchess of bracciano act the part of mother young as she be and only just two year marry she have no child of she own and apparently no promise of one anyhow by she husband and the lively pretty little spanish girl nestle upon she knee much console she in she disappointment at fourteen eleanora de garzia be as antonio lapinus have describe she : beautiful elegant gracious kindly charming affable and above all possess of two eye rival the star in brilliancy she be also a clever girl and she study have be carry on in companionship with the younger child of she aunt -- garzium ferdinando and piero the strictness of they control be loosen when the duke become a widower and he do not seem to have do anything to guard the moral of he young child the court of florence be not the place in which to rear in way of obedience and steadiness young boy and girl and eleanora and she brother be leave pretty much to themselves save for the indulgent guardianship of they tutor and attendant to be sure don ferdinando be send off to rome when he be fourteen and be enrol in the sacred college don garzium 's tragic death in 1562 leave don piero the sole playmate of little eleanora -- a strange act of providence duke cosimo be not quite inconsolable for the loss of he spanish wife he have during she lifetime set a evil example in florence for libertinage and unchastity every good-looking girl in city or at court in one way or another receive he amorous attention and the halo which surround he first acclamation as duke and which he earn well be it say become dim by the execration of many disgraced and suffer household man and woman see the bad day of duke alessandro revive and florence after a temporary purgation become once more the sink of iniquity when the duke lay aside in 1564 he sovereignty it be that he might give rein to he passion and of the many girl he ruin probably not one he love better or longer than eleanora degli albizzi at villa del castello he have he harem this be the example cosimo de ' medici set he wayward precocious son piero and the lad follow it to he heart 's content until he escapade become so notorious and raise up such a storm of resentment amongst the citizen that he father be force to intervene at fifteen young piero be send off to pisa and attach to the staff of the admiral of the florentine fleet cavaliere cesare cavanglium in various encounter with turkish galleon and the barque of buccaneer the young medico prove himself no coward -- indeed the admiral report of he most favourably well for he fame have piero remain before the mast and upon the quarter-deck the lad be practically he own master and the memory of florentine gallantry fill he mind with desire for they resumption two year of naval-military discipline be quite enough for he and he return home again he find donna eleanora de garzia a grown woman and a woman of the world a arrant flirt like she protectress the duchess isabellum divide she time between the villa poggio baroncellus and he father 's villa at castello rumor of illicit intercourse between she and the grand duke be current all over florence and evil gossip at court affirm that the _ liaison _ have be of long continuance wherein too the duchess isabellum be herself implicate cosimo seem to have be conversant with the tittle-tattle and fear the evil effect it might have for all concerned determine to take the bull by the horn so to speak and to keep the scandal within the family he son piero -- who be walk closely in he father 's footstep and lead a free and fast wild life heavily in debt and habitually intoxicate and the companion of loose woman and gamester -- should be he scapegoat he would marry he to he cousin at the beginning of the negotiation piero refuse stoutly he father 's proposition assert he intention not to marry by dint of ample offer of enlarged pecuniary emolument and by tempting promise of exculpation from the consequence of he lustful extravagance piero at last yield a unwilling assent to the betrothal how far he be influence by threat we can well imagine piero de ' medicus and eleonora de garzia de toledo be marry in the private chapel of the pittus palace on the morning of 21st April 1571 that very night he young wife reveal the fact that she be _ enceinte _ and she name he father duke cosimo as she ravisher the prince be too much take up with he own pleasure to care very much about this revelation : he would go he own way and he wife might go hers -- such be the morality of the day still this discovery be the first page in the tragic history of beautiful eleanora di piero de ' medici very shortly after the marriage eleanora who be then at pisa be deliver of a child whom in the absence of she husband she name cosimo -- a significant nomenclature she cause letter to be write to the grand duke francesco she brother-in-law to acquaint he with the birth of the child and to crave protection for _ he father 's son _ follow the unhappy example of paolo d'orsinus and isabellum de ' medicus and be absolutely they own master piero and eleanora agree to live separate life -- he a boy of seventeen and she just eighteen what more disastrous beginning can be imagine for two young wed life and yet it be inevitable piero do not care a bit for eleanora and eleanora hate and despise piero the marriage be but a brief break in evil association for the boy return to he boon-companion in the city and the girl seek the solace of she lover it be in vain the grand duke point out the error of they way -- piero retort with a _ tu quoque frater _ he have every bit as much right to console himself with a mistress one or more as francesco do with he _ cosa bianca _ moreover he become urgent in he demand for a still more liberal allowance which the grand duke weakly concede -- as he have do in the case of he other grasp brother the cardinal everything and everybody at the court of florence seem to be demented to enjoy the basest pleasure and to indulge in the foulest passion such be the way of the world and eleanora be but a child in year but a woman in experience -- and that experience not for the honor of she life alas sin against she sin like the rest how could a lovely talented warm-hearted girl with the hot blood of spanish passion course through she vein resist the admiration the flattery and the embrace of the gay young cavalier of the court she merely follow the vogue she be no recluse and when in 1575 she be enrol as a soul in the _ accademia deglus elevatus _ she assume the name of _ ardente _ -- a

say that she be esteem by all -- stranger as well as those about she -- a perfect casket of virtue and knowledge she be greatly beloved not only by she parent but by the whole of the people of florence add to she mental accomplishment which develop with she physical growth the princess exhibit all the charm of a beautiful face and graceful figure and when she reach the ripe age -- for florence -- of twelve she be the most lovely and attractive young girl in italy report of she beauty and talent be current in all the court of europe and many princely father of eligible son make inquiry about she fortune whilst many a amorous young prince find he way to florence to judge for himself of the charm of the fair young girl duke cosimo be not the man to give he comely daughter away at random : indeed he cherish the thought of keep she in florence and by he side so courtly refusal of proffer hand and heart and crown be deal out to one and all the suitor pope paul iv who be on the best of term with duke cosimo and never forget what he owe in he elevation to the papal throne to he friend 's influence conceive a matrimonial project for youthful isabellum at he court be a young man of illustrious descent good attainment the heir to vast possession and a devoted adherent of the holy see -- paolo giordano d'orsinus the orsinus be split up into many branch but the family be one of the most ancient and honorable in rome signora girolamo d'orsinus father of paolo giordano be lord of bracciano and anguillarium and of the country around civita vecchium when only twelve year old he have be name by pope leo x to the honorary command of a papal regiment of cavalry when still in he teens the youth serve with distinction in france and in the neapolitan war and on attain he majority he be send with a detachment of troops to the assistance of the emperor charle v in the devastating war against the turk in hungary create general and marquis by the emperor the young commander return to rome in 1537 and take up he position as the acknowledged head of he family he marry francesca daughter of bosso sforza heiress of the count of anguillarium three son and a daughter be bear to they paolo giordano bear 1539 be adopt by he maternal uncle carlo cardinal sforza da santa fiora and become a protégé of paul iv follow he father 's profession of arm he see military service in spain but be recall to rome by the death of both he parent on succession to the family estate the pope create the lordship of bracciano a duchy and send a message to duke cosimo commend the young soldier to he notice and suggest a matrimonial alliance with one of he daughter cosimo look with favor upon the pope 's proposition and ask the young duke to pay the florentine court a visit the young people seem make for one another : he be handsome brave and rich she be beautiful talented and lovable perhaps it be a case of love at first sight anyhow they be betroth in 1555 with the proviso that the nuptial knot should not be tie until isabellum have attain she sixteenth year in due course the marriage-contract be draw up sign and seal but it contain a condition which be as unnatural as it be impolitic duke cosimo insist that he dearly-beloved daughter should make he house she home for at least six month each year and only pay occasional visit to she husband 's palace in rome duke paolo quite rightly resent this questionable arrangement and only agree at last on pressure from the pope whatever make cosimo take such a weird course no one can really say although horrible rumor be indeed rife in florence about the relation between father and child it be however a fatal bar to all marital happiness and lead to the one and only possible _ dénouement _ -- tragedy certainly the duke bestow upon the young couple the splendid estate and villa of the baroncellus which have come into he hand and which he enlarged and surround with a park he add a munificent endowment and have the villa refurnish and redecorate throughout accord to he son-in-law 's wish the marriage be celebrate on 3rd September 1558 in the private chapel of the pittus palace -- a Saturday always consider in florence a unlucky day for a wedding -- a few month after that of prince alfonso d'este 's to isabellum 's younger sister -- lucrezium after a brief honeymoon spend at they villa the youthful bride and bridegroom separate -- a ominous repetition of a fateful error truth to tell duke paolo take a intense dislike to he father-in-law : he distrust he both in relation to he affection for isabellum and also with respect to he tyrannical character generally florence also and the florentine be distasteful in they excess of ill-living cruelty and chicanery -- not that the court of rome be a paradise or the young man a st anthony the duke go back to rome and resume he ordinary life there without bear with he any of the wholesome leaven of matrimony -- a husband in name and little more duchess isabellum a mere child wanton and wilful more than most be thus leave the uncontrolled mistress of a princely establishment with no marital check to regulate she conduct surely as unstable a condition and as conducive to infidelity as can well be imagine before leave he wife at poggio baroncellus duke paolo appoint she household and make every provision for she comfort a cousin of he cavaliere troilo d'orsinus be place in charge of the duchess as chamberlain or quasi-guardian -- another false step and embarrassing for all party he be a handsome and accomplished man avowedly unmarried young and of a sympathetic disposition and manifestly not at all the sort of person to place upon term of such close relationship with the attractive young duchess under its fascinating _ castellana _ the baroncellus villa become a busy little court the scene of constant festivity gossip and intrigue she mother 's court at the pittus be quite second in attractiveness duchess eleanora if virtuous and conscientious be rather dull and uninteresting she care much more for she spanish connection than for she florentine courtier : much of she time she spend in the cappellum deglus spagniolus at santa marium novellum what time she spare from she devotions she occupy in the establishment and patronage of the _ accademia deglus elevatus _ -- soul for the encouragement of poetry duchess isabellum d'orsinus be hail as _ la nuova saffo _ by those who gather round she she be by nature a arrant flirt -- as most pretty woman be -- for she inherit she father 's amorous disposition and she be impulsive -- a add charm where beauty reign -- worldly-minded and dreadfully extravagant moreover she dress to perfection the duke of bracciano pay rare visit to florence but the duchess in compliance with she marriage-contract spend a portion of each year with she husband in rome these visit be not occasion of happiness and satisfaction the two have scarcely any interest in common and the infrequency of intercourse entail unfamiliarity and embarrassment the good-bye be never unwelcome on either side the duke take up once more he military duty follow in the footstep of he father as commander in 1566 of a division of the imperial army against the turk for he bravery at the battle of lepanto he be make field-marshal of the emperor and a count of the holy roman empire in other respects he have he consolation for he enforced separation from he wife -- and isabellum naturally have hers too it be say that every man fall in love with she and she on she part do not restrain she passion there be no one to advise no one to check no one to help she to keep in the path of wifely fidelity report of _ liaison _ be make to the duke by he chamberlain from time to time but these be couch in word which conceal he own part therein he and the duchess be accustom to be much alone together he be a musician and a linguist a scholar and a artist like herself and a most attractive companion she help he in he great literary work -- _ lezione della lingua toscana _ -- perhaps the only serious occupation she ever undertake a intimacy with such a similarity of taste ripen naturally into a romantic attachment -- certainly quite in accord with the tenet of platonic humanism and perhaps something more that duke paolo be conversant with the relation of he wife with he cousin be well know but he make no complaint and take no action to check they likely enough he have that easy-going contempt of everything and everybody which niccolo macchiavellus have stigmatise as the prevail tone of italian society probably the sad death of princess marium and duchess lucrezium d'este and the tragic event in the maremma of 1562 affect isabellum greatly but they only tend to increase she husband 's detestation for everything florentine no doubt he judge that cosimo 's hand slew both marium and garzium -- might it not strike isabellum or himself when a man in a autocratic position such as that make by cosimo i yield to unguarded passion reason and right alike be at a discount isabellum 's husband have take the measure of she father -- alas that he be destine to follow he example for isabellum a new interest be create when in 1564 bianca buonaventurus become _ la cosa di francesco _ -- she brother she so to speak clasped the lovely young venetian to she bosom she enter into the romance of the elopement and of she brother 's infatuation with all she heart isabellum de ' medicus and bianca cappello-buonaventurus become inseparable friend during duchess eleanora 's life the gaiety and the folly of the court have be keep within something like bound but she have hardly be lay in she tomb within san lorenzo than duke cosimo give rein to he passion and the palazzo pittus and the various medicean villa become the scene of unbridled lust and depravity in 1564 the duke depute most of he sovereign power to he son francesco who become regent and virtual ruler of tuscany the grave scandal which distract florentine society begin to raise up in the mind of the people violent antipathy for a sovereign whose private example be so abominable and whose discharge of public duty be so basely mark by turpitude a revolution of a drastic description seem to be inevitable and really cosimo have no other course than abdication the florentine rendering and observance of platonism favor illicit connection between the sex the palace of the noble and of the wealthy merchant be nothing more or less than harem the manners and tradition of the orient take root not only in florence but in all the other italian state and the normal strictness and restriction of lawful married life have everywhere all but disappear every household not only of the noble but also of the middle class have among its number a _ cicisbeo _ or two or more -- unofficial wife -- we may call they possess of almost equal rights and position as the lawful spouse \* \* \* \* \* the great event of the year 1562 be the marriage of prince francesco and the archduchess giovanna d'austrium quite certainly the duke and duchess of bracciano be among the notable personage present at the nuptials indeed that year the duke spend more of he time than usual in florence and be very busy buying and rebuild the villa cerreto guidus and lay out the park and garden -- the former for the pursuit of deer-hunting the latter by way of rivalry to pratolino -- francesco and bianca 's plaisance the grand duchess giovanna be something like she predecessor duchess eleanora a serious-minded sort of woman with no pretension to beauty or ability not at all the sort of sovereign for that gay and dissolute court the _ beau monde _ take themselves off to the orte oricellarus -- to pay they devotions to the lovely venetian mistress of they sovereign and to poggio baroncellus -- where duchess isabellum reign as queen of fashion and frivolity cosimo and cammilla de ' martellus -- whom he marry secretly and take away to he favorite villa del castello -- live in strict retreat rarely come into florence and keep no sort of state at the same time two son of he be source of keen anxiety ferdinando bear 1549 be now wear the cardinal 's red hat which hapless young garzium 's hunting-knife have cause to fall from he brother giovannus 's head in the maremma ambitious jealous but perhaps less depraved than he father the cardinal de ' medicus make no secret of he dislike of he brother francesco and he _ innamora _ bianca buonaventurus he become a thorn in he father 's and brother 's side on account of he extortionate and presumptuous demand he young stepmother -- only two year he senior -- favor he pretension and so bring trouble upon herself as we shall see later on piero cosimo 's youngest legitimate son be but a boy of fourteen when he father marry he second wife of course she be far too young and inexperienced to be of any use in guide he growth and taste the court be thus divide : the two party be head respectively by the grand duchess giovanna the titular grand duchess-dowager -- so to call cammillum -- with the cardinal de ' medicus and by bianca cappello di pietro buonaventuri and duchess isabella of bracciano with respect to the latter coterie its influence be vastly augment by the assassination of pietro buonaventuri in 1572 duchess isabellum give she whole heart 's support to the beauteous young widow she write to she the most affectionate letter in one of which if not in more she say she love bianca more than sister and bid she retain she position as the loving helper of my brother bianca heartily return she more than a sister 's affection and she repeatedly speak of duchess isabellum in she letter to she cousin in venice i have she say for example on 17th July 1574 the illustrious domina isabellum to dine with I in my garden and with she come my good friend she brother don piero and he young wife beautiful accomplished and light-hearted isabellum and bianca be the dearest and most constant of companion they live apparently only for admiration and adulation but the duchess ' position be infinitely more free and unconventional than that of the venetian : the latter live for one man 's love alone -- francesco -- isabellum dispense she favor where she will duke paolo grow suspicious of he wife 's liberty of action he protest at first couch in deprecatory language be meet with girlish _ insouciance _ but when he begin to complain arrogantly isabellum reply with spirit and determination he jealous reprimand be meet by like charge and truth to tell there be not a pin to choose between the two the grand duke cosimo before he death in 1574 and the grand duke francesco be alike irritated by bracciano 's cool calculate conduct and both uphold isabellum against she husband 's ill-humour and harsh judgment duke paolo however keep he own counsel and by means of spy discover that troilo d'orsinus 's monthly report be at least open to doubt as to they truthfulness with respect to he wife 's conduct in private matter however drift -- he be too intent upon he own affair in rome and elsewhere to disturb rudely the state of thing at poggio baroncellus he suspicion at length be brusquely confirm and the uneasy peace of evil deed be break by portentous news from florence a courier in he pay arrive one evening in July 1576 breathless at the bracciano palace with the intelligence that the trusty chamberlain have stab to the heart a attractive young page lelio torello attach to the household of the grand duke and have moreover at once take flight precipitately from the villa bracciano know exactly what this purported -- young torello be a lover of he wife as well as troilo d'orsinus without a moment 's delay he start off for florence to tax the duchess with unfaithfulness at the porta romana he be stagger by the news which greet he -- piero de ' medicus have kill he wife eleanora de garzia de toledo at cafaggiuolo he tarry not to pay he respects to the grand duke and grand duchess at the palazzo pittus hard by but gallop off post-haste to he wife 's villa and unannounced surprised isabellum in the midst of preparation for a sudden journey if as some maintained she mean to follow she flee lover troilo at all event she be determine to seek the court of france and throw herself upon the sympathy of queen caterina she kinswoman and crave she protection for herself and she babe several letter have already pass between the two illustrious woman isabellum on she part say : i have ask pardon of god for my sin and have resolve to let thing take they course but she implore catherine to protect she little son in the last of these letter she write : -- let you majesty think of this letter as the last word of a person bind to you by the tie of blood and consider they as the confidence of one who be about to die resigned and repentant who otherwise could only end she life in despair and desperation the duke judge he wife guilty before she have offer any explanation of the tragic doings at the villa and he impulse be to dishonor she before she whole household the spirit of duplicity which have haunt they married life during eighteen random year of misunderstanding distaste and estrangement still rule they both -- but bracciano restrain he passion for a while he note the preparation for hasty flight -- indicative of isabellum 's guilt -- but what more than all else enraged he almost beyond the power of self-control be the cry of a infant within isabellum 's apartment that child be not he whose be it isabellum meet she husband perfectly unabashed and if she expect a immediate explosion she be agreeably though somewhat misgivingly surprised at he cordial greet he ask she where she be go and suggest that they should go away together isabellum of course prevaricate -- truth be a negative quality between those who doubt each other then to she great surprise bracciano begin to express himself in term at once tender and apologetic the fault and fault there be have be all on my side he say but i wish to alter all this and begin a new course happy and well-regulated i suggest that bygones be bygones and that we mutually agree to bury the past let we isabellum begin a entirely new course of life and live henceforth only for each other he fair word be match by the mild expression he contrived to put into he face and although the duchess distrust they or at least she sense of hearing she meet he advance handsomely the day pass over pleasantly the _ rapprochement _ seem to be real and sincere and when the duke invite she to accompany he upon a hunting expedition to cerreto guidus on the morrow he wife express she pleasure and acquiescence he himself set off early in the day it be 10th July and he ask isabellum to follow with she maiden leisurely whether from innate distrustfulness or presage of come evil the duchess put off she journey till quite late and only arrive there as night be come on at the entrance to the villa the duke meet she holding in a leash two splendid hare-hound which he beg she to accept and use on the morrow the dinner-party be numerous and merry but not one of the company be gayer than the host isabellum sit beside he and he offer she many lover-like attention everybody remark these excellent and unusual relation between the duke and duchess and wonder greatly thereat after a very pleasant musical evening the company separate for the night and the duke pass into he own bedchamber invite he wife to enter with he be it instinct or be it second sight which cause isabellum 's step to falter on the threshold she tremble as she husband hold aside the arras turn deadly pale and retreat for a moment she whisper to she lady-in-waiting donna lucrezia de ' frescobaldus -- shall i enter or shall i not bracciano 's voice again be raise in gentle persuasiveness and take she by she hand clammy cold as it be he ask she laughingly why she hold back she bid donna lucrezium good-night very tremulously and then the curtain fall and isabellum be alone with she lord the room be in its usual state but truth to tell she have not lie there for many a long night and as the duke continue to talk affectionately and to prepare for bed she begin to feel less alarm without more ado she fling herself into a deep lounging-chair and begin to meditate and to chatter seating himself by she side bracciano begin to caress she hand and to fondle she in he arm and when he note that she have give herself entirely to he will and pleasure as a amorous faithful wife once more he swiftly reach down for a _ corda di collo _ -- a horse 's halter -- which he have place behind the chair implant a impassioned kiss upon those lovely lip which have so long yearn for a husband 's embrace he adroitly throw the rope round he wife 's neck and pull it taut in a wild access of rage he strangle she -- hold on until she struggle cease then he cast she fair body from he and spurn it with he foot as though it have be some foul and loathsome thing thus perish in she thirty-sixth year isabellum de ' medici wife of paolo giordano d'orsinus -- as sinful as she be lovely but much more sin against than sin after all before the dawn of day the duke accompany by one attendant only ride into florence and leave at the palazzo pittus a heartless message for the grand duke request he to despatch the brethren of the _ misericordium _ to cerreto guidus where be something which require they attention -- then he continue he course straight on to rome florence be aghast at this horror but the grand duke francesco keep he own counsel and no pursuit follow the murderer a official announcement be make to the effect that the duchess of bracciano die in a fit of apoplexy this nobody for a moment believe : whether she brother be privy to the deed be perhaps open to doubt for he and isabellum be devote to one another it have be say that it be due to bianca buonaventurus 's persuasion that the grand duke take no step to vindicate he sister 's honor or dishonor the punishment of assassin mostly lead to further assassination and the _ la cosa di francesco _ have reason to fear for she own life see that she husband and she two dearest friend in florence have be do brutally to death what become of the child whose cry the duke of bracciano have hear at villa poggio baroncellus no one seem to have record nor be there any statement extant as to who he father actually be -- a boy he be anyhow and though he

cousin and the duchess ' companion lelio torello the comely young _ calcio _ player and the favorite page of the grand duke francesco and be it say in term of doubt and horror the grand duke cosimo if

chamberlain troilo d'orsinus he seek sanctuary in france and be befriend by queen catherine to whom he mistress the unhappy duchess of bracciano have commend the little kid whether he accept the rôle

be only too delighted to have the invaluable assistance of the young cardinal in she campaign against the hate venetian at length he take the bold step of expostulate with francesco upon he intercourse with the captivating rival of giovanna the prince be furious and warn he brother never to name the subject again and on no account to meddle with he private affair ferdinando reply that he be quite content to abstain at a price the truth be that he lavish extravagance have exhaust he revenue and restricted he power of borrowing and he be in lack of fund for the maintenance of he state in rome in a weak moment francesco give heed to ferdinando 's stipulation and provide he with fund and increase he family allowance in gratitude the cardinal throw into he brother 's tooth the fact of he position as heir-presumptive and insist upon the purchase of a piece of land at the confluence of the pesa with the arno there he build he villa ambrogiana which become the seat of a anti-francesco

grand duchess of tuscany the cardinal be keenly interested in this tragedy not indeed that he take any part therein but it have a distinct bearing upon he line of conduct and he note with apprehension the redouble of francesco 's devotion to the hate venetian bianca of course be perfectly aware that she be the real cause of ferdinando 's animosity in spite of he protestation of admiration and the like she set about to unmask he real intention and to circumvent he hypocrisy she method be at once original and full of tact for she disarm he aggression by play to he personal vanity and by further he lust for money not once nor twice but many time do bianca plead with francesco for he brother and always with success and many a substantial sum of money be lodge in the roman medicus bank at he disposal ferdinando begin to realize that the only way to he brother 's purse be by bianca 's favor and he begin to evince a distinctly amiable spirit in he relation with she as mark the improvement in the situation the cardinal accept a invitation to a family gathering at poggio a caiano in the autumn of 1575 the grand duchess giovanna quite properly be the hostess but bianca buonaventurus who

tête-à-tête _ with she brother-in-law in a secluded summer-house the fascination of three year before be again transcendent the venetian be irresistible he say afterwards i can not hate she try how i will the truth be he be madly in love and he own it but he love be after all like the hot fume of a lurid fire the year 1576 be a black one in the annals of the medicus two beautiful and accomplished princess of the ruling house be do to death by jealous unfaithful husband bianca buonaventurus be stun by the terrible end of she dear sister-friends isabellum de ' medicus and eleanora de garzia de toledo would she turn come next the three have be call the three grace of florence and certainly each have vie with the other in elegance and fascination but to bianca the golden apple have be accord unanimously beauty and charm seem to be magnet of destruction and bianca be upon she guard so far as she herself be concern she know that at any time she might still fall a victim to a venetian desperado or to a florentine assassin and under every friendly guise she fear a foe with respect to the grand duchess giovanna and she detestation of bianca a story may be tell which have all the appearance at least of probability giovanna express not once but often she wish for bianca 's death this indeed in those day and in florence the city of assassin be as good as a judicial sentence the grand duchess moreover it be reputed follow up she word by action one day the story go in the month of march 1576 she carriage chance to meet that of bianca 's upon the ponte ss trinita she beseech she coachman to try and upset she rival hope that she might fall into the river below and be drown conte eliodoro del castello she chamberlain see the maneuver and prevent a deplorable fatality be this as it may the grand duke not only sympathise with bianca 's fear but appoint certain of he own bodyguard to take up similar duty near the person of madonna buonaventurus and she progress henceforward be watch with as much circumstance as he own at the same time he devotion to the woman he love increase from day to day the peril she be call upon to meet be incur through she unquestioning love of he this he know well enough write on 29th march 1576 carlo zorzus the ambassador of the serene republic and a warm adherent of he fascinating fellow-countrywoman say : i visit the grand duke 's villa pratolino and also madonna bianca buonaventurus 's charming retreat the orte oricellarus and she pretty villa dellum tana which he have lately give she look upon the arno and i observe don francesco 's intimacy with the madonna i note also she extraordinary influence for good upon he they appear to be make for one another and to be absorb in the same occupation and interest she have but to name a object for charity or patronage and at once she have he hearty approval francesco never conceal he concern at have no son with he own physician and the physician of the grand duchess he hold many consultation : not a few quack and empiric also be seek to for nostrum and charm which should obtain by science what nature have so far withhold he and bianca hold anxious counsel for he know that she would lay down she life for he and would grant he every facility which it be in she loving power to supply reflect deeply bianca saw only one situation : giovanna be barren of male issue why should not she herself become once more a mother -- the mother of a son a son of francesco this idea haunt she but all the same she have no conception and then a design present itself to she weary brain -- as natural as it be indefensible for some time she have be get stout -- she age she constitution and she rich living be all conducive to that condition if she be not to be the mother of he child by natural means she could be so by a subterfuge which she _ embonpoint _ would uphold in the spring of 1576 bianca buonaventurus give out that she be _ enceinte _ and begin forthwith she preparation for _ accouchement _ she leave she palace in the via maggio under the shadow of the pittus palace and take up she abode in the casino of the orte oricellarus which she have

almost smother he with kiss and at once give order for a ceremonial baptism antonio he call he -- after the kindly patron saint of that auspicious day -- when he personally hand the child to the archbishop at the font the grand duchess be inexpressibly shocked she refuse to see she husband shut herself up in she own apartment and demand a escort to vienna the news be not long in reach rome and it make cardinal ferdinando furious in a moment all the blandishments of the venetian be dissipate the better term lately establish in florence be renounce and the angry prince in unmeasured language assert that the child be not francesco 's he know well enough that what have come to pass unless unchallenged would imperil he presumptive title first it be seek to throw doubt upon bianca 's actual maternity and next to secure the person of the little boy bianca and antonio under a strong guard be send off to pratolino hers and francesco 's best-loved retreat -- they have together plan its beauty there during she make-believe convalescence she come to consider the very serious nature of she love 's stratagem and she determine to make a full confession to she lover the grand duke be thunderstruck but at once he recognize the emphatic importance of secrecy for as vincenzio borghinus quaintly say : florence be the greatest market in the world for tissue and material of _ all _ kind and full of evil eye and ear and tongue meanwhile ferdinando have not let the water run under the arno bridge for nothing he discover the surgeon-accoucheur who have attend madonna bianca -- one giovannus gazzus he maintain the fact of the confinement but incidentally name the wet nurse giovanna santus this woman admit that she have be instrumental in the introduction into madonna bianca 's chamber of the newly-born son of a reputable woman who live with she husband behind the _ stinche _ no trace could be find of these humble parent of francesco 's supposititious child and all ferdinando 's enquiry be fruitless many be the tale rife in and out of the palace and market but neither the grand duke nor bianca take any step to refute they and after be as usual a nine day ' wonder the subject drop apparently the grand duchess giovanna give birth on 19th may the following year to a son -- a sickly child to be sure but the undoubted heir of he father ferdinando 's hope be shatter but he have not do with bianca buonaventurus within nine month on 9th February giovanna die somewhat suddenly and the cardinal fail not to intimate that bianca be the cause thereof and to name poison as she means the truth be that the grand duchess one day get out of she sedan-chair slip upon the polished marble floor and be again near she confinement a miscarriage result from which she never recover within two month of the burial of sour-tempered unlovable giovanna the grand duke marry bianca pietro buonaventurus 's widow privately in the chapel of the palazzo vecchio one immediate result of this marriage be the quasi-legitimisation of the child antonio -- a vigorous youngster and certain to outlive frail little filippo reconciliation with venice public marriage and coronation be in due order celebrate and bianca cappello the true and undoubted daughter of venice be enthrone in the duomo as the true and lawful grand duchess of tuscany cardinal ferdinando watch all these ceremonial from afar -- the only one of he family who decline to honor the grand duke and grand duchess with he presence during the festivity represent by a inferior official of he household he remain in rome closely shut up in he palace a spectacle to the world at large of ungovernable prejudice and foiled ambition he cogitation however be very grateful for he be work out in he intriguing brain a ready method for rid himself not alone of the two child bar to he pretension but of the grand duke and grand duchess also ferdinando be determine to succeed francesco as sovereign of tuscany come what might never be a man more changed than the grand duke francesco when he place the new grand duchess beside he on he throne twelve year of gloom and disappointment give way before the advent of the sun of venice the best happiest and most popular year of he reign exactly synchronise with the period of bianca 's ascendency no strife of party no pestilence no foreign war black-mark those year art and craft revive with the increase of population and of confidence and man begin to agree that there be something after all to be say -- and to be say heartily -- for macchiavellus 's prince and he idea of a _ il governo d'un solo _ in this glorious eventide of the renaissance be reproduce some of the magnificence of its heyday under lucrezium and lorenzo de ' medici in the early day of francesco 's infatuation for bianca he have give forth a impassioned madrigal which once more he sing to she as he good angel-guardian : -- around my frail and battered barque there be always serenely swim and wakefully watch I lest i perish a beautiful and powerful dolphin warn would and shield from every buffet of the deadly wave i feel secure fierce wind no longer cause I fear i seek succor no more from oar and sail safely accompany by my loving guardian francesco 's devotion for bianca continue as the year speed on they way and he note with supreme satisfaction that every word and action of hers be mark with unquestioning affection the love of francesco and bianca at pratolino recall those of giuliano and simonetta at fiesole whilst the wit and beau and beauteous woman who consort there revive the glory of the platonic academy montaigne who visit the grand duke and grand duchess both at the pittus palace and at pratolino in 1580 say : i be surprise to see she take the place of honor above she husband she be very handsome and seem to have entirely subjugate the prince the cardinal be not unobservant of the trend of florentine affair plot and counterplot be quite to he like the puccus conspiracy and the vengeance upon the capponus affect he closely francesco be not ignorant of the patronage and encouragement vouchsafe to he secret enemy by he eminent brother in rome -- and he watch each move the peace and prosperity which mark the progress of the city of the lion and the lily after bianca buonaventurus mount the grand ducal throne be not regard complacently by the uneasy cardinal the very fact that she be the admirable cause thereof embittered he eminence 's soul and he spleen be mightily enlarged by the creature who pander to he vicious ill-nature the fascination of the goddess engender detestation as love be turn once more to hate in the crucible of he passion she be nothing but a strumpet and without a drop of royal blood so he reason and so he speak and he back up he aphorism by connive at the foul report in 1582 which accuse bianca buonaventurus -- as he always style she -- of cause poison to be administer to poor little filippo -- giovanna 's puny sickly child he even have the audacity to accuse francesco of complicity because he have order no elaborate court mourning conveniently ignore the fact that a gracious compliment be pay to spanish custom and court etiquette by the simplicity of the obsequy plotter of other man 's wrong be ever inconsistent one would have think that ferdinando would have hail the removal of the only legitimate heir before himself to the grand duchy but the delirium of jealousy and the fury of animosity in the cardinal 's evil heart find a sort of culmination two year later bianca 's daughter pellegrina the only offspring of pietro buonaventuri give birth to a child she have marry shortly after the public nuptials of the grand duke and grand duchess count ulisse bentivoglio di magiola of bologna -- a by no means happy marriage as it turn out this child a boy they first-born -- indeed poor pretty pellegrina 's love-child -- the cardinal affirm bianca buonaventurus have try to pass off as she own -- another subterfuge confirmative of the first and that he brother be conversant with the intrigue the grand duke meet the gossip with impassive silence -- the wisest thing he could have do -- and the grand duchess lay herself out to make cardinal ferdinando utterly ashamed of himself and he foul aspersion the integrity of she conduct and francesco 's sapient conduct of the government be the admiration of all italy so strike be the pope with the peace and happiness of the medicean rule and the personal characteristic of the good wife and beneficent consort as he style she that he bestow upon the grand duchess the rare distinction of the golden rose at first he holiness desire the cardinal de ' medicus to head the special mission as legate and talk seriously to he eminence upon he relation with the sovereign of tuscany he point out quite clearly the line of conduct ferdinando should pursue -- the direct converse of the position he have take up the cardinal begin to reflect that the death of little prince filippo and the fact that francesco have not proclaimed antonio he heir-apparent leave he at all event the undoubted heir-presumptive consequently when the florentine mission under archbishop giuseppe donzelle of sorrento return to rome and the legate convey to he a cordial invitation from the tuscan sovereign to visit florence he accept it with the best grace he could command -- keep at the same time he true feeling and intention to himself \* \* \* \* \* pageant and dirge trip up each other often enough in the course of human life the life especially of sovereign through the strong light ever beat upon they throne be always expose to vicissitude of fortune the papal mission have scarcely pass out of recollection and everything in florence be happy and prosperous -- sunshine be always brightest before eclipse -- when the spectre of tragedy again cast its dark shadow over the path of the grand duke and grand duchess a right merry party be that which set off from the palazzo pittus to the villa poggio a caiano one bright morning in October 1587 the hunter 's moon be up for the harvest have be gather in and the new luscious grape be in the

into the joy of horsemanship and the pastime of the countryside few could beat she in point-to-point -- she fear no obstacle nor dreaded accident the charge of wild game terrify she not magnificent she write on 15th November 1586 be the sport i actually see four very large boar fall dead at my foot the grand duke of course as become a perfect gentleman be at one with bianca in love for and skill

taste of she ill-humour as he ride by she side at she scornful entry into florence twelve year before but bianca have work a vast change in he disposition and environment she have interweave fancy and reality and francesco be now serenely happy often do he sing tender madrigal as they together saunter in the wood and indulge in pastoral pursuit sing sing ye bird i be wide awake tho ' silent ` mid you tender harmony and yet i would fain join you sweet concert whilst upon the face of fair bianca ` mirror of love ' -- i fix my yearning eye the cardinal be one of this particular hunting party -- indeed the hunt have be arrange entirely in he honor and he express himself as charm with everything -- and especially with the grand duchess this be he first state visit to he brother 's court and he

court physician -- messeri giulio agnolo da barga and ferdinando cino da roma they assure she that they princely patient be merely suffer from a error in diet -- the dish of mushroom of which he have partake freely overnight have not be well prepare -- but they consider that all ill effect would disappear as suddenly as they have arise the report of francesco 's illness reach the vatican and the pope address a kindly letter to the grand duchess convey a good-natured homily to the grand duke upon the evil of gluttony bianca cast aside she sparkling coryphean tinsel and put on a quiet gown and

order out he florentine bodyguard urgent message pass to and fro between he and he brother piero de ' medicus and communication be open with domina cammillum the cardinal 's stepmother in the convent of saint monica these do not allay the universal distrust bianca 's own physician fail to diagnose she indisposition whilst the court physician scout the idea -- already be translate into word -- that the sudden attack of the grand ducal couple be due to _ poison _ what else could it be the symptom point that way and no other on the third day tertiary fever intervene with incessant thirst and fit of delirium and francesco 's condition cause the gravest anxiety bianca be inconsolable unable to wait upon he and suffer exactly as be he she pen prop up with pillow a piteous appeal to the pope in which she crave he holiness 's prayer and benediction and also he fatherly protection for francesco and herself she say : i do not feel at all sure of the cardinal the pontiff reply sympathetically and assure she that no wrong should be do she or the grand duke by anybody francesco show no sign of improvement but gradually get weaker when too late for any remedial measure to have effect the physician in private conference agree that the cause of he seizure be poison but -- look from the clenched hand of the die prince to the open palm of he successor -- they in sordid self-interest hold they tongue who have administer the fatal drug and when and where have better not be publish if by a fraternal hand then it be no concern of theirs the grand duke expire in agony on the tenth day

footnote a : in 1857 when the medicus grave at san lorenzo be open the body of the grand duke francesco and the grand duchess giovanna be easily identify the body also of marium the unhappy victim of she father cosimo with the fatal wound of eleanora de garzia de toledo piero 's murder wife and of isabellum duchess of bracciano be also recognize all five be in wooden chest but rob of the costly grave-clothes and jewel _ there be no trace of the body of the grand duchess bianca _ -rrb- bianca have not be many day bury when ominous report begin to be rife all over florence and along the countryside people ask each other why the body of the grand duchess have be snatch be it they say to hide the real culprit and to stifle awkward question the tongue of the night-bird who have throw that precious body aside contemptuously and have not be permit to mark the grave in any way be loosen they give the name of they employer -- ferdinando 's major-domo that be quite enough to fix preferentially the guilt upon the guilty party but when the medical adviser of the new grand duke admit reluctantly that neither francesco nor bianca have die from malarial cause the chitter-chatter of the villa and the palace become unmuzzled and first one and then another domestic -- more or less personal -- contribute he piece of private knowledge of the fact of the double tragedy put these all together piecemeal the story read somewhat as follow : cardinal ferdinando have for a very long time determine that it be absolutely essential to he succession to the grand duchy that don francesco should not be permit to have a child -- a boy by he second wife bianca francesco 's health be indifferent and he seem likely not to live long but be that as it might the cardinal join the hunting-party at poggium a caiano fully intent upon make a attempt upon the life of both francesco and bianca among he suite be a valet one silvio a man of fiendish ingenuity who have make himself invaluable to he master in many a intrigue to he ferdinando commit the task of mix the poison which he procure from salerno in the food or beverage of the grand ducal couple silvio make several attempt to accomplish he commission but the grand duke and grand duchess do not touch the dish -- specially treat as they pass from the kitchen to the hall -- whilst in they cooling wine cup so much beloved of francesco the poison fail of its effect to be sure two day before the grand duke 's actual seizure he reject a game-pasty which have a peculiar taste and the grand duchess have as she think detect she brother-in-law play with the wine glass which she at once cause to be replace by other upon the evening when a ragoût of mushroom be serve at the supper-table it be observe that the cardinal quite emphatically decline to partake of the dish but that he press francesco and bianca to eat largely of it bianca eat sparingly and advise she husband to follow she example she intuition perceive danger in the delicacy alas it be in vain this be all perhaps that come out concern the tragedy but the cardinal meet the story with another he cause it to be bruit about that bianca have try to circumvent _ he _ death for this purpose she have herself make a cake which she urge he to eat but which francesco insist upon tasting whereupon she consume what he have leave the cardinal further put into the grand duchess 's mouth the plausible lament we will die together if ferdinando escape nobody believe this version which merely confirm the real truth for neither francesco or bianca have ever express a wish for ferdinando 's death within three hour of the death of francesco ferdinando ride swiftly into florence accompany by a suite of he own creature -- not a single officer of the grand ducal house accompany he he escort be fully arm and so be ferdinando stop at the gate by the guard he give to the utter surprise of the subaltern the grand ducal password and be accord the sovereign 's salute thence he pass at a gallop to the palazzo pittus where he place personally he seal upon the great door and then put up at the palazzo medicus a messenger be despatch before dawn to the dean of the duomo to order the big bell to sound this be the first intimation to florence that the grand duke francesco be dead the lord of the council hasten from they bed to the palazzo vecchio where ferdinando join they and there and then require they to pay he they allegiance thus ferdinando de ' medici become third grand duke of tuscany he character as a ruler may not be discuss here at length but of he it have be succinctly say : he have as much talent for government as be compatible with the absence of all virtue and as much pride as can exist without true nobility of mind \* \* \* \* \* when pietro buonaventuri so complacently resign he bewitching young wife to be the plaything of don francesco de ' medicus he also yield up the guardianship of he little daughter pellegrina and she live with she mother in the private mansion bianca have receive from the prince near the pittus palace at the time of the assassination of pietro the child be eight year old -- a lovely girl resemble in person and manners she attractive mother the prince take she under he special care in fact adopt she and treat she as if she be he own dear daughter naturally the duchess giovanna resent this arrangement and strictly forbid she own daughter eleanora -- a year pellegrina 's junior -- to have anything to do with the base-born child of she hate rival nevertheless the sparkling merry little girl become the pet of the court -- where she be always greet as _ la bella bianchina _ and no one dream of throw she father 's evil career in she face at the public marriage of the grand duke and the widow bianca buonaventurus pellegrina be of course a prominent figure she have grow tall and have inherit the charming trait of she sweet mother she be fourteen year old and eligible as the bride of any acceptable suitor she dowry be considerable equal indeed to that of the princess eleanora and the grand duke be no less solicitous than the grand duchess about the choice of a husband at first it be hope that a young florentine might be the successful lover and indeed such a one appear to have be secure when young pietro strozzo -- the son of messer camillo di matteo negli strozzus -- one of pellegrina 's sponsor at she baptism -- be judge worthy of the matrimonial prize they be accordingly betroth but the inconstancy of love be once more prove for the young fellow be a wayward youth and although only seventeen have fix he affection elsewhere the match be break off but within a year of pietro 's renunciation another aspirant for pellegrina 's hand and dowry appear in the person of a distinguished young foreigner -- conte ulisse bentivoglio de ' magioli da bologna he be repute to be the natural son of signora alessandro d'ercole bentivoglio and have be adopt by he maternal uncle conte giorgio de ' magioli he mother 's name be isotta -- a beautiful girl at the court of the lord of bologna who have romantic relation with both signora alessandro and conte giorgio which of the two be conte ulisse 's father matter far less from a matrimonial point of view than the fact that the prospective bridegroom be unusually wealthy and well-placed conte ulisse twenty year of age go to florence along with the bologna deputation to greet grand duke francesco upon he marriage with bianca buonaventurus then it be that he first see pellegrina and be accept as she betrothed husband he remain in florence a considerable time and take a leading part in the splendid festivity and the notable _ giostre _ wherein he be hail as a champion in the list the marriage be celebrated three month after the grand ducal wedding and amid the tear of she mother pellegrina depart with she husband for bologna everything go well for a time with the youthful count and countess grand

the real parentage of the count he be baptise giorgio two more son come to seal the happiness of the young couple -- alessandro and francesco -- and two daughter -- bianca and vittorium -- and then the happy relation between the count and countess undergo a change and she husband 's love cease to peep into pellegrina 's heart the count be much occupy with military matter like most young noble of he age he also undertake diplomatic duty and be send in 1585 as the special ambassador of bologna to congratulate pope sixtus v upon he elevation to the pontifical throne at the roman court he meet don piero de ' medici -- the florentine envoy -- and through he get into evil company he return to bologna unsettled in he feeling and look for excitement and illicit intercourse he passion for pellegrina be pass away and he seek not she couch but the company of a lovely girl of bologna who have fascinate he by degree he love for he sweet wife grow cold and at length he have the effrontery to establish he _ innamora _ in he own mansion pellegrina protest in vain but the more she admonish she husband the more flagrant become the _ liaison _ cast off and even spurn in she own house the poor young countess long for she dear dead mother 's presence she have now no one to counsel and comfort she left pretty much to herself she yearn for companionship and love she be only twenty-four

to report she conduct these mercenary know the mind of they master do not hesitate to translate he word into deed and very soon they be able to realize they dastardly purpose although the countess have warn young riario of the danger which menace they both and be for a time more circumspect in she intercourse with she lover the fascination of mutual passion overbore the dictate of prudence like

thrilling pathos run then like golden thread through the vulgar woof and web of woe and death someone have say that love and murder be next of kin true indeed be this what time eleanora and cammillum be fresh young girl in florence they be each make for love and love they have but that love be the embrace of a living death selfish cruel and damning better perhaps have they die right out by sword or poison than suffer as they do the extremity of pathos -- the shame of illicit love \* \* \* \* \* the tragedy of eleanora degli albizzi be perhaps the most callous and the most pathetic of all those lurid domestic vicissitude which trace they source to the tyrant of florence cosimo i grand duke of tuscany she be not the only eleanora whose name as alas we know spell misfortune eleanora de toledo of the broken heart and eleanora de garzia de toledo of the bleeding heart await in paradise eleanora deglus albizzus of the heart of desertion _ albizzus o medicus _ have once and again divide the power of florence but in the course of high play in the game of politics the latter hold the better hand draw more trump and gain rubber after rubber but what a splendid record the albizzus have when the medicus be only tentatively place they foot upon the ladder of fame orlando filippo piero luca and maso -- to name a few only of those leader of man and woman -- have score the name albizzi as _ anzianus priori gonfalonieri _ and _ capitanus di parte guelfa _ in fact that aristocratic family dominate florence and the florentine until salvestro giovannus and cosimo of the democratic medicus dispute place and power and build up they fortune upon the ruin of they rival ' fault and favor eleanora be the daughter of messer luigus di messer maso degli albizzi this messer maso a hundred year before have not see eye to eye with he masterful brother -- the autocratic rinaldo but note the trend of political affair have truth to tell turn traitor to the tradition of he family and have throw in he lot with the rise house of medicus messer luigus be not a rich man but in fairly comfortable circumstance and slowly retrieve the shatter fortune of he ancestor he mansion be in the fashionable borgo deglus albizzus and he own other town property and some farm in the _ contado _ he hold too several public office and be a aspirant to a podestaship as a stepping-stone to that most coveted of all state appointment the rank of ambassador in some way or another he gain the favourable notice of duke cosimo and seem to have render he some acceptable service : at all event he find himself at home in the entourage of the sovereign by he second wife madonna nannina daughter of messer niccolo de ' soderinus -- a lineal descendant of the self-seeking and notorious adviser of don piero de ' medici -- he have two daughter constanza and eleanora name after she godmother the duchess eleanora constanza be marry to antonio de ' ridolfi the same year that the poor broken-hearted duchess sob herself to death at pisa after the terrible tragedy of 1557 and 1562 and messer luigus be leave with eleanora the pride of she father 's heart the joy of he home as beautiful as any girl in florence she be just sixteen highly accomplish full of spirit and endowed with some of that pride and haughty bearing which have distinguish she forbear she have in short all the makings of a successful woman of the world admit to intimacy and companionship with the child of the duke he have note the graceful development of the bright young girl 's physical and mental charm and he have give evidence of he interest in she by many pleasant courtesy both to herself and to she parent messer luigus soon observe the partiality of he sovereign for he fascinating young daughter and be a man anxious after the manner of a true florentine even in those degenerate day to better himself and he family he see that something more than mere romance could be make out of the situation the commercial asset of he daughter 's person loom large in he estimation for if the duke take a serious fancy to eleanora it be conceivable that she might one day become he consort when the girl tell she father of the duke 's kindness to she and of he embrace and tender word he counsel she not to repel she admirer for what he mean be all for she good and for the distinction of she family the _ liaison _ go on unrebuked encourage by cosimo 's promise and luigus 's hope nannina 's tear of apprehension be brush aside by eleanora 's kiss very tactfully messer luigus let the duke know that he attention be acceptable and that he and he good wife be vastly honor by he condescension to they daughter in view of favor to come he plainly intimate that eleanora be quite at he disposal or as he put it quite courtier-like _ di fare il piacere di cosimo _ the duke need no encouragement as the universal lover and ravisher of the most comely maiden in florence he be only too pleased to carry off this charming young _ druda _ to he villa at castello and eleanora be nothing loth to go -- the prospect of a throne have always be a irresistible attraction to woman in all age cosimo 's son be well aware as indeed be the whole court and the city too of they father 's love affair the duke and the prince-regent francesco be mutually suspicious and fawn faithless courtier fan the flame of jealousy and mistrust between they the father throw bianca cappello into he son 's face and he in exchange fling back eleanora degli albizzi at length cosimo desist from the acrimonious warfare content to let thing be as they might be at the pittus palace and pratolino whilst he be leave in seclusion with he _ innamora _ at castello cardinal ferdinando a boy of fifteen live in rome and don piero only ten be indifferent to such matter but duchess isabellum of bracciano be intensely interested a amiable go-between she father and don francesco cosimo do nothing with respect to remove the reproach attach to he intrigue with eleanora deglus albizzus and consequently when in December 1566 a little girl be bear to he the whole of florence be conventionally shocked duchess giovanna don francesco 's sanctimonious austrian wife offer a vigorous protest and decline to have anything to do with the unfortunate young mother and she dissolute old lover she feeling run so strongly both with respect to the _ liaison _ of cosimo and to she husband 's intrigue with the beautiful venetian that she make a urgent appeal to she brother the emperor maximilian to intervene it be say that the young duchess send a copy of she letter to duke cosimo who be furious at she conduct he ask she by what right she have dare to stir up ill-will at the imperial court and advise she to mind she own business in the future to the emperor cosimo address a dignified reply to the imperial censure : i do not seek for quarrel he say but i shall not avoid they if they be put in my way by member of my own family what messer luigus and madonna nannina deglus albizzus thought and say no one have relate they could not say much by way of complaint for they have foresee from the beginning of the duke 's intimacy with eleanora that a accident as they euphemistically call it be to be expect they have in fact sell they child to she seducer and must be content with they bargain cosimo for he part be delighted with he dear little daughter come to cheer the autumn of he life he load eleanora with present watch by she bedside assiduously and tell she joyfully that he mean to marry she and so legitimatise they little child bear at messer luigus 's the baby girl be anxiously watch lest emissary from the pittus palace should try to get hold of she the duke make indeed no secret of he pleasure and moreover consult with he most trust personal attendant sforza almenus how the legitimatisation could be best effect so as to secure for the little lady a goodly share in the ducal patrimony and also a pension in perpetuity for the mother eleanora this sforza almenus when quite a youth have be attach to the household of duke alessandro he be the son of messer vincenzio almenus a gentleman of perugium and when the duke be assassinate by lorenzino de ' medici he perform the first charitable office of the dead upon the bleeding body moreover young almenus 's father be a faithful friend and confidant of madonna maria de ' salviati the mother of cosimo in consequence of the devotion of both father and son sforza be take into the household of the new duke and eventually become he private secretary with duchess eleanora sforza become a great favorite for he be most sympathetic and helpful in she scheme for the advancement and protection of she spanish protégés both cosimo and he consort bestow many benefaction upon they faithful servitor among they be a monopoly in the supply of fish from perugium to florence a privilege which put upon the average a good six hundred gold florin per annum into messer sforza 's pocket the duke also confer upon he fortunate and trusty counsellor valuable property in the parish of san piero a quintole a farm and building at fiesole and lastly in 1565 a very fertile estate at peccioli originally the property of piero de ' salviatus have messer sforza almenus only be content with these opulent benefaction all might have go well with he but alas human ambition and the interest of self lead good man often enough astray and the duke 's private secretary begin to look for favor at the hand of the heir to the ducal throne the prince-regent francesco in short he attempt to serve two master with a view to obtain the good grace of don francesco almenus begin a system of betray confidence of a strictly private and familiar character bless with the spirit of flattery like all consummate courtier he conceive it to be a stroke of excellent personal policy to purvey for he highness ' appreciation or the reverse he father 's intimate concern he repeat the conversation the old duke and he have hold about eleanora deglus albizzus and she child and advise the prince for he own advantage to inform he father that any step he might take to advance he _ innamora _ or they bastard would be resent by he as regent of the duchy apparently almenus do not regard the young mother with lenient eye but view she ascendency over the infatuated duke with disfavor as offer rivalry to he own position francesco smart under he father 's stricture in respect to he amours with bianca buonaventurus and resent he constant interference in he private affair no less than in he public duty be only too ready to give ear to any scandal which he might turn to good account at first he keep he own counsel but one day be unusually exasperated with word of reproach utter by he father francesco proclaim he displeasure at and opposition to the view of the duke with respect to eleanora degli albizzi cosimo know at once how he secret have be expose and by whom he manage to control he passion but indignantly retort that there be a son 's duty to a father which should have teach francesco to disbelieve unfavourable rumor he return at once to castello sforza almenus of course entirely ignorant that prince francesco have unwittingly betray he present himself as usual before the duke to learn he pleasure cosimo address he sternly : almeni you have betray my confidence you who of all man i trust implicitly go get out of my sight go at once anywhere you will -- only go -- never let I see you face again almeni dumfounded set off at once for florence he know too well cosimo 's temper to bandy word and seek interview with prince francesco and the duchess isabellum with they knowledge he remain in the city perhaps faintly hope the duke might relent and send for he back a few day later cosimo go into florence and pass through a ante-chamber at the pittus palace he be astounded to see almenus calmly stand in the recess of a window no one else be in the room and as almenus salute he master and proceed to make a appeal for mercy cosimo become infuriate at he disobedience and impertinence and reach up to a hunting-trophy on the wall he seize a stout boar-spear and cry out in a loud voice -- traitor base traitor thou art not fit to live thou hast slander thy master and foul thy nest die with a sudden thrust he strike the affrighted almenus to the heart it be a fatal wound for with a shriek of agony the unhappy man fall at he master 's foot the shaft of the weapon still fast in he wound the day be Wednesday 22nd may 1566 the eve of the annunciation the corpse lay there for several hour and no question be ask as to how and by whom almenus have be do to death at nightfall the _ misericordium _ brethren wind he to he burial in the secret vault of the dismantle church of san piero scheraggio \* \* \* \* \* in less than a month after the murder of sforza almenus cosimo 's dearly-loved little daughter die in sudden convulsion due it be report to the administration of poison eleanora be inconsolable and the duke do all he could to comfort she he organise fêtes and hunting-party for she and both at castello and even in florence he drive with she quite openly treat she as he lawful wife early in the following year eleanora be once more _ enceinte _ and on 13th may she become the mother of another child a boy whom cosimo declare be a true likeness of he famous father giovannus delle bande nere and consequently that name be give he the duke 's happiness know no bound but the arrival of this second child bear out of wedlock and in the face of the hot displeasure of duke francesco and duchess giovanna be the disenchantment of cosimo 's love-dream the _ liaison _ could not continue and truth to tell cosimo himself be the cause of its cessation the lustful old man have see another lovely girl in florence and eleanora 's star become dim in the new effulgence eleanora 's recovery and convalescence be not this time mark by the devotion of she lover he never so much as go near she although she be at castello all the time and giovannus be bear there the disillusionment of they both be as immediate as it be dramatic it be report that the pope have write a remonstrance to cosimo and hint that the creation of the grand duchy of tuscany which the duke earnestly covet be entirely out of the question until he have put away he mistress and have renounce the error of he way it may have be court gossip but one reason for duke cosimo 's drastic treatment of he _ innamora _ be the intimacy which have spring up between eleanora and he own precocious and vivacious son piero if the father have foul he couch he could not allow he own son access thereto as well then it be that duke cosimo miss the intelligent service of faithful faithless sforza almenus -- he would have do the dirty work of extricate he master from he false position as well or better than any one else eleanora and he have from the first be rival for the confidence of the duke and hate each other heartily she have good grounds doubtless for she contempt and distrust by reason of the heartless and mean insinuation affect she manner of life which the trusty private secretary pour into the perhaps too ready ear of he master the solution however of cosimo 's dilemma come quite suddenly from a perfectly unexpected quarter -- from the pittus palace francesco and giovanna have never cease try to detach the old debauchee from he lascivious entanglement he conduct be fatal to the reputation and the authority of he successor on 17th July a party of young man of good family ride out of one of the gate of the city encounter another like company one of the former carlo de ' panciatichus accidentally cannon against jacopo d'antonio and the latter dismounted and demand satisfaction for the presumed insult a duel be promptly arrange in which young panciatichus deal he opponent a fatal blow with he dagger d'antonio fall and be carry to the hospital of santa marium nuova where he die three day after by duke cosimo 's recent enactment such a occurrence be count as a criminal offence which require purgation by the payment of a heavy fine failure to pay be punish by sentence of death the _ otto di guardia e balia _ meet and deliberate the matter and impose a fine of four thousand gold lira this sum messer bartolommeo de ' panciatichus carlo 's father be unable to pay and in consequence the lad be require to surrender himself for incarceration in the dungeon of the bargello carlo de ' panciatichus fail to report himself and he sentence bear the added punishment for contempt of court the unhappy father appeal for mercy and because the law of the ducal court be superior to that of the state throw himself upon the protection of duke francesco it be woman 's wit which now untie the knot twist about the young man 's throat the duchess giovanna have by some be credit with the origination of the tactful expedient but some say bianca buonaventurus be its inspiratrix anyhow the solution come in a form agreeable to all party concerned namely the full pardon of the criminal -- on condition of he immediate marriage with eleanora deglus albizzus carlo de ' panciatichus be thus make the scapegoat for duke cosimo 's intrigue the sentence of the _ otto _ be quash by the payment by the duke of the heavy fine impose in the first case and in response to duke francesco 's request the charge of contempt be withdraw neither carlo nor eleanora be consult in the matter but she be laden with costly present by duke cosimo and ten thousand gold florin find they way into carlo 's empty pocket this timely arrangement be make on 20th July and carlo and eleanora become man and wife the follow month duke cosimo on the same day cause little giovannus to be legitimatise and he be enter in the register of baptism as giovannus de ' medici undoubted son of cosimo i duke of florence and siena a ample provision be make for the child 's maintenance by the duke and carlo de ' panciatichus agree to he be a inmate in he house along with he mother the marriage be celebrated privately in the presence of the two duke in the chapel of the pittus palace and the young couple at once take up they residence at the panciatichus palace in the via larga upon carlo be confer the order of knight of san stefano and messer bartolommeo he father be enrol as a senator for life it would appear that eleanora abandon herself to she new life with exemplary fortitude and resignation she certainly have exchange new lamp for old and she make the best of a honorable marriage in spite of the violent and arrogant manner of she husband whose fame as a violent _ braggadocio _ be a safeguard against the advance of young piero de ' medici three year after the marriage a child be bear to whom the name of cosimo be give a laconic compliment to the old libertine a second son appear in 1571 bartolommeo but he die within a twelvemonth of he birth and then in 1577 come a third child to the panciatichus mansion another bartolommeo so eleanora decree this boy however bring with he ineffaceable trouble for cavaliere carlo refuse to acknowledge he and angrily point to don piero de ' medici as he putative father piero make light of this charge -- he be well use to that sort of thing but with rare effrontery he hold the infant at the font whilst panciatichus absent himself and eleanora make a tacit avowal of he parentage the relation between carlo and he wife have quite naturally never be of the best and as gradually fear of death upon the scaffold fade or by a retributive d'antonio hand and he find himself the untrammelled master of he action he begin to resent the callousness of the arrangement with duke cosimo after 1570 grand duke of tuscany eleanora 's intrigue with don piero clench the matter of she cohabitation with she husband carlo refuse she both bed and board and in the spring of 1578 he force she into the franciscan convent of san onofrio da foligno -- a favorite place of sanctuary for dishonoured gentlewoman poor sinful sinned-against eleanora the pathetic example of a young and beautiful life waste and corrupt by the ill-conditioned lust of a profligate lover and he libertine son with she freedom of action absolutely curtail and she complete isolation from she family the gay and attractive mistress of castello and of the medicus palace at pisa with countless admirer and many lover be indeed a object of sympathetic commiseration to be sure the cavaliere make ample provision for he wife 's maintenance appoint a small suite of attendant and permit she to carry with she many cherish bit of furniture and _ bric-à-brac _ he likewise commit to she charge both she child and offer no objection to occasional visit to he mother of don giovannus de ' medici now a grow boy of eleven the grand duke francesco cordially approve this arrangement with respect to certain jewel and personal effect which eleanora retain the grand duke make a order that as they belong to _ guardaroba _ of the sovereign they should be deposit during the period of she residence in the convent in the state treasury then a thick veil be draw over the life of eleanora di cavaliere carlo de ' panciatichus and the gate of the convent be close upon she never to be open for she egress she beauty and she talent and the gaiety of she manner be mature cultivate and restrain in harmony with she melancholy surroundings youth give way to middle age and middle age to the crepuscule of life and the season come and the season go and one life in that sanctuary seem fate to go on for ever forget and unvisited eleanora the _ druda _ of cosimo i cast off and spurn the _ innamora _ of piero de ' medici wrong and despise the wife of carlo de ' panciatichus divorce and cloister live on and on far beyond the scriptural limit of threescore year and ten -- the pathetic victim of a callous world in the _ librus

fellow say -- go to hell and take you money with you the impact fracture the man 's skull and he die in hospital again panciatichus be condemn to a heavy fine with the capital sentence _ in contumacium _ by the _ otto di guardia e balia _ he be convey to prison the old _ stinche _ until he pay the fine eleanora in she convent hear of he punishment and actually render he good for evil as a tender-hearted and suffer woman would quite naturally do she plead with the grand duke francesco for he deliverance and join she son don giovannus de ' medicus in she appeal cavaliere carlo de ' panciatichus be not set free till November 1581 when he have fully pay all the claim prefer against he by the family of the man he have slay which include a provision for a certain _ contadina _ she

cavaliere 's no one have relate but upon the death of they mother they too find asylum at the convent of sant onofrio and be tenderly treat by sad and lonesome madonna eleanora -- a sweet and pathetic action indeed the cavaliere raise he head once more under the guilty rule of grand duke francesco 's murderer the unscrupulous cardinal ferdinando and by he be appoint a gentleman of honor and a member of the new grand ducal council of two-hundred he die long before he doubly-wronged unhappy wife eleanora on the 27th February 1620 \* \* \* \* \* with cammilla de ' martellus come the end of the prosperous reign and the end of the profligate life of cosimo de ' medici last duke of florence and first grand duke of tuscany she be the youngest of the two daughter the only child of messer antonio di domenico de ' martellus and he wife madonna fiammetta the daughter of messer niccolo de ' soderini a descendant of that earlier niccolo the self-seeking and unscrupulous adviser of don piero de ' medici the martellus trace they origin through two line of ancestry : to the picciandonus of pisa in the thirteenth century and to the stabbiellus of the val di sieve in the fourteenth they appear to have settle in the via degli spadaus and to have hammer among the armourer there so successfully that they name be give to the street in lieu of its more ancient designation messer domenico cammillum 's great-grandfather be one of savonarolum 's keenest opponent chiefly in the interest of the medicus and the great cosimo count he among he most trusty friend but he suffer for he fidelity by be assassinate in 1531 by one paolo del nero another relative of cammillum die tragically lodovico who be kill by giovannus bandinus in a duel at poggio baroncellus in 1530 -- a duel fight for the hand and heart of the beauteous marietta de ' ricci a relative of that other fateful flirt cassandra who be the cause of pietro buonaventuri 's tragic death and die by the knife of assassin the martellus be associate with many of the pious work of the medicus : for example they assist munificently in the building and endowment of the great church of san lorenzo in some way or other messer antonio have light on evil day at all event he appear to have lose the banking business which have be mainly operative in the raising of he house and have revert to the less lucrative but still honorable occupation of he family -- the craft of sword-making he carry on he business in a house which he rent under the shadow of the palazzo pittus both cammillum and she elder sister marium be good-looking girl the latter in 1566 marry a wealthy shoemaker from siena gaspare chinuccus but she husband divorce she and then duke cosimo cause she father to marry she in 1572 to a opulent foreign merchant -- messer baldassarre suarez who have come over from spain and be a protégé of the duchess eleanora cammillum bear in 1547 possess all the personal attractiveness which distinguish she mother whose sister nannina the wife of messer luigus degli albizzus be mother of eleanora duke cosimo 's _ druda _ tall and of a good figure fair complexion with light hair and a pair of dark eye like two brilliant star she be also most graceful in she carriage and manner full of intelligence in conversation and quite naturally fond of admiration and amours this be a contemporary word-picture of the physical and mental charm of one of the most lovely girl that ever trip merrily along the lung ' arno acciaiuolus -- in the footstep of beatrice de ' portinarus that promenade of prince cupid be always throng by the belle and beau of florentine society there the young man and old man too could meet and salute they _ innamorate _ duke cosimo have not observe for nothing the daily walk of he fascinating young neighbor he never overlook a pretty face and comely figure and he heart be large enough to entertain the love of many woman he experience be very much like that of dante alighierus who one day see he beatrice in quite a new and entrancing light it be in may in 1564 when all be gay and fresh in florence that duke cosimo chance upon cammilla de ' martellus as he pass on he way from the pittus palace to castello to dawdle with the lovely eleanora deglus albizzus she cousin something prompt the duke to accost the maiden -- she blush and he own tremor reveal delightful possibility quite in he way very warily he approach messer antonio he idea be probably to keep eleanora at the villa del castello and to take cammillum away to he favorite residence the palace at pisa if don francesco and duchess giovanna be aggrieve by the intrigue already go on it be conceivable that the trouble would be greatly intensify by a second cosimo do not wish they increase displeasure nor publicity so for a while he keep he hope and he intention to himself at last inflamed more and more by the fresh unsullied beauty of cammillum he broach he proposition to messer antonio greatly in need of money and hope much from court patronage the unnatural father determine to follow the example of he brother-in-law and surrender for a worthy consideration he child as a _ cosa di cosimo il duca _ the cast-off eleanora be marry as we have read to cavaliere carlo de ' panciatichus in September 1567 and on 28th may -- eight month after -- cammilla de ' martellus give birth at pisa to a dear little girl the latest child of duke cosimo this be by no means to the mind of duke francesco and news of the birth quickly reach the ear of the pope he holiness at once despatch a courier to duke cosimo urge he to legitimatise the child by he immediate marriage with the mother this be not at all what the duke want he prefer of course to be quite free to love any girl or woman that he might single out nevertheless the pressure be so great that he be compel to yield and in January 1569 he take cammillum to be he wed wife but not to share he ducal title that be forbid by the emphatic opposition of the act duke and duchess and by the direct intervention of the emperor maximilian messer antonio de ' martellus be in ecstasy and he unconcealed delight gain for he the nickname _ il balencio _ like whalebone it be say that when he wife 's kinsman alamanno de ' pazzus venture to congratulate he at he house in the via maggio he find the place gaily decorate and musician play before the door what be this brave show for messer antonio he ask why ser alamanno i have marry my daughter to the duke cosimo rejoice with I to-day we have now no relation but emperor and prince what would you cosimo create he wife 's father a knight of the order of san stefano and endow he with a good annual income at the same time he advance madonna marium di baldassarre suarez to the rank of a gentlewoman of the court and cause unhappy gaspare chinuccus to be banish out of tuscany some indeed say that he even instigate he assassination messer suarez be promote to a honorable place at court and he name be change to martelli two son and a daughter bless he union with madonna marium violante as the girl be christen grow up as beautiful as she aunt cammillum with a pair of eye like hers and nothing could restrain the passion of that young libertine don piero de ' medicus for love of she -- he be indeed he father 's son nevertheless she be not to be he _ innamora _ alone for cardinal ferdinando also come and see and conquer and young violante become he chief mistress in florence -- the rival in he affection of he father 's fascinating young wife she aunt cammillum in 1570 cosimo go in state to rome to be crown by the pope as first grand duke of tuscany from he holiness he obtain a reversion of the title in perpetuity for he descendant the easter of that year he spend at the pittus palace and then he hurry off to castello to pass the rest of he day with he dearly-loved and charming young wife once there he dismiss almost all the member of he suite retain only two secretary a chaplain -lrb- -rrb- and two courier wish to lead the quiet life of a country gentleman he apportion to he wife cammillum four gentlewoman as maid of honor henceforward neither cosimo nor cammillum be see but rarely in florence they spend they time together either at castello at poggio a caiano or in pisa December and may have be mate -- the former have he consolation but the latter pine quite naturally for young society love be cold and love be captious where age and temperament disagree cammillum sigh for the gaiety the pleasure and gallantry of florence love 's young dream have not be hers she have not choose she ancient lover but admiration for she spring from a likely though a unexpected quarter and she cavalier be not warn off by a jealous husband as be poor eleanora deglus albizzus 's the grand duke cosimo to the very last keep up the appearance of religion if not its reality the fact that a son of he be a member of the sacred college and a possible occupant of the chair of st peter cover a multitude of sin not that cardinal ferdinando be a mirror of virtue or a example of sanctity ferdinando 's relation with francesco and bianca be as bad as could be he arrogance and extortion render he presence at the florentine court unwelcome and even dangerous at castello and poggio a caiano on the other hand he be a honor guest and for lack of lover he young stepmother be not displeased by he attention cosimo keep she strictly in seclusion and she have not the courage or be it say the impudence of she stepdaughter the duchess of bracciano the love of the cardinal and cammillum be in secret and unprovocative indeed the grand duke encourage the intrigue as be for cammillum 's good here be a pretty state of affair one son piero the seducer of he mistress eleanora deglus albizzi the other ferdinando the lover of he wife it would be very difficult perhaps impossible to exonerate cosimo from the blame of cammillum 's unfaithfulness if she sin she do so helplessly alas that she listen not only to the amorous vow of ferdinando but also give credence to he view concern the grand duke and grand duchess in florence she know of course that there be no love lose between herself and they and she be quite ready to entertain the evil insinuation which the late duchess giovanna have ventilate with reference to bianca this cabal be perfectly well know to the grand duke cosimo but he let matter take they course all he care for be the embrace of he attractive wife and the flattery of he hypocritical son the death of duchess giovanna throw ferdinando and cammillum more than ever into one another 's arm what and if francesco and bianca die without male heir why on the death of cosimo ferdinando and cammillum might succeed to the grand ducal throne this be the temptation which the cardinal place like a young bud in cammillum 's bosom she be but human -- very human she have be slight by the non-allowance of rank as grand duchess perhaps destiny have still that distinction in reserve she would wait the pathos of cammillum 's life deepen during the last four year of grand duke cosimo 's life he become a constant sufferer with many infirmity the strenuous life he have live with its exercise of lustful love and lurid hate try to the breaking point he iron constitution gout be he direst torment a malady productive of ill-humour at its worst and poor cammillum lonely wife nurse companion have none to share he impatience she own health give way under the strain and she indisposition point to apoplexy and to mental trouble but deliverance come at last on 20th April 1574 cosimo breathe he last at poggio a caiano in he fifty-fifth year by he death-bed there watch only he chastened wife and he sanctimonious son of he other survive child isabellum -- once he favorite -- have suffer for sixteen year the misunderstanding and the heartburning which she heartless marriage-contract have impose she be estrange from he and from cammillum and from the cardinal piero be a wastrel the exponent of he father 's worst passion -- piero _ il scandalezzatore _ as he be rightly call francesco have bear ten year ' embarrassment as quasi-ruler of the state subject to ceaseless caution and contradiction : he be in no sensuous or homicidal sense he father 's son all three stay markedly away from poggio a caiano \* \* \* \* \* almost the first act of the new sovereign be the enclosure of he father 's young widow in a convent he place she first with the benedictine nun of the vergine dell ' annunziata delle murate and then in the noble sanctuary of santa monica not with she poor cousin eleanora deglus albizzi away at foligno this certainly appear to the ordinary reader of romance a cruel and unjustifiable act but to the student of diplomatic expediency it be a foregone conclusion the security of francesco 's rule depend entirely upon the suppression of dynastic intrigue the person of ferdinando be unassailable as a prince of the church he have prerogative which could not be remove by any temporal sovereign all that francesco could do be to forbid he presence upon tuscan territory and this he do it do not appear that the unhappy cammilla de ' medicus be harshly use indeed she residence within the convent be make as agreeable as possible and she have the privilege of receive visitor other than political madonna costanza de ' pazzus and eight other noble lady be attach to she suite with five gentleman of honor and several domestic cavaliere antonio de ' martellus plead in vain he right as father of cammillum to take she and she child back under the parental roof the grand duke be immovable in he resolution he counsel the father to let the matter rest and give he and madonna fiammetta free access to they daughter but on no account be she to visit they as in the case of eleanora degli albizzi a inventory of jewellery and other treasure be make and whilst cammillum be permit to retain certain article such object as be regard as the property of the reign grand duchess be transfer to the _ guardaroba _ of bianca apparently francesco determine that no action of he against he father 's widow should be construe into a menace against he government write to the grand duke on 7th August 1574 soon after cammillum 's reception the very reverend abbess of santa monica humbly thank he serene highness for the generous treatment of the young widow and beg remembrance of he good office for she and for the convent generally trustee be appoint under the presidency of messer roberto de ' adimari the chancellor of the monte de ' pieta for the administration of the one hundred and four thousand gold florin -- the fortune leave by duke cosimo to the lady cammillum which produce a annual income of four thousand eight hundred gold florin a year equal to about # 2000 cammillum settle down as best she could to a life of leisured ease -- a lonesome woman a prisoner under close observation news of the outside world she have and when the report of the horror of the year 1576 reach she she be prostrate with grief indeed she time seem to have be spend with repine weep and sickness -- a piteous existence for a young woman of twenty-seven at length cammillum brace herself to bear she disappointment she trial she imprisonment with fortitude and like the good woman she really be she set to work to occupy she time and that of she suite in useful and interesting occupation gardening and the care of flower attract she and soon the cloister of the convent be convert into bower of rose and myrtle she lady and the nun also she encourage in all elegant handicraft -- silk-embroidery lace-making and other stitchery the result of they industry procure immediate custom and the noble cloth and lustrous silk of santa monica with the lady cammillum 's initial attach become famous far and near these object consist of pillow-case screen portières decorative panel banner scarf cushion handkerchief bodice and various other detail of feminine attire with rich vestment for the clergy and sumptuous altar-cloth the grand duchess bianca who with characteristic sweetness and generosity have all along sympathise with poor lady cammillum be the best customer of the convent industry and moreover she frequently visit the gentle prisoner and show she many charming attention for two medicus bride also cammilla

find in the lady cammilla a earnest and skilful directress namely the manufacture of sweetmeat preserve compôtes pastry and every sort of delectable confectionery perfume and liqueur -- usually the piquant produce of monastery -- be also cunningly extract by cammillum 's subtle formula these elegant speciality she give away to old friend and visitor -- enclose in delicate little glass and porcelain bottle and jar of she own design the fame of the lady cammillum 's skill and patronage reach foreign court and notable visitor to florence do not fail to pay they courtesy to the great lady of the convent two of these the archpriest monsignore simone fortuna confessor of the duke of urbino and cavaliere ercole cortile the ambassador of ferrara have record they visit and they pleasure at see la serena signora in genial company and philanthropically employ the wily priest add with sanctimonious admiration for female beauty : la martellus be as fascinating as ever still liberty be liberty and captivity -- even when make as attractive and as unoppressive as possible -- be still captivity the lady cammillum never leave the confines of she convent for twelve long year and not till 4th February 1586 be she allow a _ congé _ then a sumptuous cavalcade with splendid sedan-chair halt at the main portal of santa monica and out of one step the grand duchess bianca in gorgeous state robe she have come to escort in person the lady cammillum with every mark of respect and honor to the marriage of she daughter virginia de ' medicus the young girl be just eighteen passably old for a sixteenth-century noble bride in 1575 she have be assign as the consort in prospect of cavaliere mario sforza general of the army of the grand duke francesco the match however be break off when cardinal alessandro sforza die and leave a immense fortune but not to he nephew mario as have be expect and so mario prove to be too poor a suitor for the girl 's hand mario on he side have cool much in he ardor for virginium report of the cardinal de ' medicus 's -- ferdinando 's -- familiarity not only with the mother but with the daughter also be rife in florence and in rome sufficient grounds there be for he to accept the cancellation of the proposal with equanimity the marchese for so he have be create be not a whit more virtuous than the man of he day but the sensuous be always the harshest judge of they kind no virginium be after all marry to don cesare d'este duke of modena she have by the way be promise in 1581 to francesco sforza di santa fiora but he change he mind and renounce the world -- conventionally of course -- to accept the cardinal 's red hat and privilege from the hand of pope gregory xiii so constantly be natural human instinct dull by the contrariety of fashion in those degenerate day of virginium 's marriage torquato tasso the grand duchess bianca 's enamoured poet-laureate sing : cio che morte rallenta amore restringa virginium die in 1615 -- some say she be poison by she husband -- the last of a degraded race _ sic transit glorium medicus _ the ceremonial of the nuptials be as splendid as a sumptuous court could make it and as become the union of a princess of the house of medicus with a ambitious foreign sovereign but whilst man and woman gossip delightedly about the charm of the beauteous young bride and the gallant bearing of the groom every tongue express wonderment at the gracious stately figure of the lady cammillum the chorus of popular applause be hushed however when the pathos of she story strike sorrowful chord in every heart upon the obverse of the medal strike for the duke cosimo for they wedding twelve year before the signora be represent as a finely-developed woman with the proud profile of a true daughter of florence a high brow a shapely nose full cheek and a dimpled chin she attire be rich she wear costly jewel and she hair be tastefully coiffure what cammillum 's feeling be she only know and she tell they to no one she bear herself loftily and make no one she confidante after the solemnity and festivity she betake herself once more -- she have no other choice -- to she convent prison the poorer for the loss of she cherish child the richer in the estimation of all good people henceforth she inclusion among the religious be to be more rigorous and she never expect to be see again in florence : dolorous indeed must have be that parting with the world she love but so little know she view the come year with apprehension and hopelessness she have not reach the measure of she destiny but for that mercifully she have not very long to wait and yet there be to be another slight rift in the cloud of misery from time to time cammillum have suffer from faint fit and attack of hysteria but after she separation from virginium these increase greatly in frequency and intensity skilful medical treatment be of no avail and at length she doctor appeal to the grand duke for some relaxation of she imprisonment freedom from restraint and the benefit of urgently need change they know would work wonder in the way of recovery don francesco be immovable to all such representation he have over and over again decline to reverse or modify he decision he fully justified fear of the cardinal 's intrigue act as a negative magnet to all he best proposition he and she be bind together he feel sure in scheme for he own undoing and bianca 's too the lady cammillum 's life become at last intolerable sickness suspicion and discontent fasten they dire influence upon she she neglect useful and ornamental pastime become morose and impatient and give way to fit of frenzied desperation the abbess greatly alarmed take counsel with she spiritual adviser who judge that the unhappy lady be lose she reason and perchance she soul she condition become so critical that in April 1587 the tuscan ambassador in rome apply to the pope for permission for the chaplain of the convent to celebrate a mass for the exorcism of the poor lady in October of that year the fall scheme of cardinal ferdinando have at last they fruition and the grand duke and grand duchess die together at poggio a caiano victim of he jealousy and hate he obtain at last what he have strive for so unscrupulously for twenty year -- the succession to the tuscan throne be it however in justice tell with respect to the lady cammillum for when he have spurn the dead body of the grand duchess and hypocritically sad have follow the remains of he poison brother to san lorenzo he go right off to the convent of santa monica and acquaint she personally with the fact of delivery from a living tomb they have only meet very occasionally during the last few year and she have change greatly -- perhaps he have too she terrible trial she bodily sickness and she mental derangement have make ineffaceable mark in the erstwhile beauteous girl and cammilla de ' medicus be no longer possible as the wife of the renegade cardinal marriage be out of the question for she indeed she very existence be at stake and all that ferdinando could do be to alleviate the suffering of he _ innamora _ and to cheer she decline day many year before ferdinando have purchase a piece of ground at the confluence of the arno and pesa and upon it he build the villa ambrogiana which he furnish in lavish style boast that it will be handy when i come into my own this estate with a sufficient household he make over to the lady cammillum for she own free use before however she take up she residence ferdinando now of course grand duke of tuscany place at she disposal a country villa in the val d'ema to which the suffer signora be take in the hope that the fresh air and pleasant outlook would assist the recovery of she health and spirit she improve wonderfully in every way -- the fact that she be again she own mistress and free to come and go at will fortify she immensely and she determine to devote the residue of she life to the interest of ferdinando call upon at he succession to the throne to renounce he spiritual character -- it be a character indeed which ill-fit he -- the new grand duke devoted himself to the duty of he high station the lady cammillum who have be he confidante in day go by be still retain as counseller and guide marriage be the most urgent necessity of the grand duke for the procreation of legitimate heir he be surround by heirs-presumptive and aspirant to the throne -- don antonio he brother 's adopted son don giovannus he father 's legitimatised son by eleanora degli albizzi he brother piero and any one of he bastard son and several other scion of the house the lady cammillum enter heartily into all she stepson 's idea and quickly though doubtlessly regretfully agree with he that a brilliant foreign alliance be a absolute necessity together they pass in review the name of all the eligible princess in europe and at last they choice fall upon princess christina the young daughter of charle duke of lorraine and nephew of queen caterina de ' medici she be receive in florence with joy and marry to the grand duke in 1589 the lady cammillum grace the nuptials with she presence lay aside the
