township in the state of new jersey on the shore of nantuxet creek not far from delaware bay into which that creek flow my father be a farmer -- not a very profitable occupation in that barren part of the country my mother be a widow at the time of she marriage with my father have three child by a former husband by my father she have six more of whom i be the youngest but one she be a woman of strong mind and marked character a zealous member of the methodist church and although i have the misfortune to lose she at a early age she instruction -- though the effect be not apparent at the moment -- make a deep impression on my youthful mind and no doubt have a very sensible influence over my future life just previous to or during the war with great britain my father remove still nearer to the shore of the bay and the sight of the vessel pass up and down inspire I with a desire to follow the life of a waterman but it be some year before i be able to gratify this wish i well remember the alarm create in we neighborhood by the incursion of the british vessel up the bay during the war and that at these time the woman of the neighborhood use to collect at we house as if look up to my mother for counsel and guidance i be only twelve year old when this good mother die but so strong be the impression which she leave upon my memory that amid the struggle and danger and care of my subsequent life i have seldom close my eye to sleep without some thought or image of she as my father soon after married another widow with four small child it become necessary to make room in the house for they accommodation and with a younger brother of mine i be bind out a apprentice in a cotton and woollen factory at a place call cedarville manufacture be just then begin to be introduce into the country and great hope be entertain of they as a profitable business my employer -- or bo as we call he -- have formerly be a schoolmaster and he do not wholly neglect we instruction in other thing besides cotton-spinning of this i stand greatly in need for there be no public school in the neighborhood in which i be bear and my parent have too many child to feed and clothe to be able to pay much for schooling we be require on sunday by we employer to learn two lesson one in the forenoon the other in the afternoon after recite which we be leave at liberty to roam at we pleasure winter evening we work in the factory till nine o'clock after which and before go to bed we be require to recite over one of we lesson these advantage of education be not great but even these i soon lose within five month from the time i be bind to he my employer die the factory be then sell out to three partner the one who carry on the cotton-spinning take I but he soon give up the business and go back to farm which have be he original occupation i remain with he for a year and a half or thereabout when my father bind I out apprentice to a shoe-maker my new bo be in some respects a remarkable man but not a very good sort of one for a boy to be bind apprentice to he pay very little attention to he business which he seem to think unworthy of he genius he be a kind-hearted man fond of company and frolic in which he indulge himself freely and much give to speech and harangue in which he have a good deal of fluency in religion he profess to be a universalist hold to doctrine and opinion very different from those which my mother have instil into I he ridicule those opinion and argue against they but without convert I to he way of think though as far as practice go i be ready enough to imitate he example my sunday be spend principally in tavern play at domino which then be and still be a favorite game in that part of the country and as the unsuccessful party be expect to treat i at time run up a bill at the bar as high as four or six dollar -- no small indebtedness for a young apprentice with no more means than i have as i grow older this method of live grow less and less satisfactory to I and as i see that no good of any kind not even a knowledge of the trade he have undertake to teach I be to be get of my present bo i buy my time of he and go to work with another man to pay for it before i have succeed in do that and while i be not yet nineteen i take upon myself the still further responsibility of marriage this be a step into which i be lead rather by the impulse of youthful passion than by any thoughtful foresight yet it have at least this advantage that it oblige I to set diligently to work to provide for the increase family which i soon find grow up around I i have never like the shoe-making business to which my father have bind I a apprentice i have always desire to follow the water the vessel which i have see sail up and down the delaware bay still haunt my fancy and i engage myself as cook on board a sloop employ in carry wood from maurice river to philadelphium promotion in this line be sufficiently rapid for in four month after commence as cook i rise to be captain this wood business in which i remain for two year be carry on by vessel of from thirty to sixty ton know as _ bay-craft _ they be build so as to draw but little water which be they chief distinction from the _ coaster _ which be fit for the open sea they will carry from twenty-five to fifty cord of wood on which a profit be expect of a dollar and upward they have usually about three hand the captain or skipper include the man use to be hire when i enter the business for eight or ten dollar the month but they now get nearly or quite twice as much the captain usually sail the vessel on share -lrb- unless he be himself owner in whole or in part -rrb- victual the vessel and hire the man and pay over to the owner forty dollar out of every hundred during the winter from December to march the navigation be impede by ice and the bay-craft seldom run the man commonly spend this long vacation in visit husking-frolics rabbiting and too often in tavern to the exhaustion of they purse the impoverishment of they family and the sacrifice of they sobriety yet the waterman if many of they be not able always to resist the temptation hold out to they be in general a honest and simple-hearted set though with little education and sometimes rather rough in they manners the extent of my education when i take to the water -- and in this respect i be not perhaps much inferior to the generality of my brother waterman -- be to read with no great fluency and to sign my name nor do i ever learn much more than this till my residence in washington jail to be related hereafter have follow the wood business for two year i aspire to something a little higher and obtain the command of a sloop engage in the coast business from philadelphium southward and eastward at this time a sloop of sixty ton be consider a very respectable coaster the business be now mostly carry on by vessel of a larger class some of they especially the regular line of packet be very handsome and expensive the term on which these coaster be sail be very similar to those already state in the case of the bay-craft the captain victual the vessel and pay the hand and receive for he share half the net profit after deduct the extra expense of load and unload it be in this coast business that the best year of my life be spend during which time i visit most of the port and river between savannah southward and st john in the british province of new brunswick eastward -- those two place form the extreme limit of my voyaging as philadelphium be the port from and to which i sail i presently find it convenient to remove my family thither and there they continue to live till after my release from the washington prison i be so successful in my new business that besides support my family i be able to become half owner of the sloop superior at a expense of over a thousand dollar most of which i pay down but this prove a very unfortunate investment on she second trip after i have buy into she return from baltimore to philadelphium by the way of the delaware and chesapeake canal while off the mouth of the susquehannah she strike as i suppose a sunken tree bring down by a heavy freshet in that river the water flow fast into the cabin it be in vain that i attempt to run she ashore she sink in five minute the man save themselves in the boat which be on deck and which float as she go down i stand by the rudder till the last and step off it into the boat loath enough to leave my vessel on which there be no insurance by this unfortunate accident i lose everything except the clothes i have on and be oblige to commence anew i accordingly obtain the command of the new sloop sarah henry of seventy ton burden and continue to sail she for several year on share while in she i make a voyage to savannah and while under sail from that city for charleston i be take with the yellow fever i lay for a week quite unconscious of anything that be go on about I and come as near die as a man could do and escape the religious instruction of my mother have from time to time recur to my mind and have occasion I some anxiety i be now greatly alarm at the idea of die in my sin from which i seem to have escape so narrowly my mind be possess with this fear and to relieve myself from it i determine if it be a possible thing to get religion at any rate the idea of religion in which i have be educate be that of a sudden miraculous change in which a man feel himself relieve from the burden of he sin unite to god and make a new creature for this experience i diligently seek and try every way to get it i set up family prayer in my house go to meeting and converse with experienced member of the church but for nine month or more all to no purpose at length i get into a awful state begin to think that i have be so desperate a sinner that there be no forgiveness for I while i be in this miserable condition i hear of a camp-meeting about to be hold on cape may and i immediately resolve to attend it and to leave no stone unturn to accomplish the object which i have so much at heart i go accordingly and yield myself entirely up to the dictation of those who have the control of the meeting i do in everything as i be tell go into the altar pray and let they pray over I this go on for several day without any result one evening as i approach the altar and be look into it i meet a captain of my acquaintance and ask he what he think of these proceedings and as he seem to approve they i invite he to go into the altar with I we both go in accordingly and kneel down pretty soon my friend get up and walk away say he have get religion i do not find it so easily i remain at the altar pray till after the meeting break up and even till one o'clock -- a few acquaintance and other remain with I and pray round I and over I and for I -- till at last thinking that i have do everything i could i tell they pray no more as evidently there be no forgiveness for I so i withdraw to a distance and sit down upon a old tree lament my hard case very seriously i be sure i have commit the unpardonable sin a friend who sit down beside I and of whom i inquire what he suppose the unpardonable sin be endeavored comfort I by suggest that whatever it might be it would take more sense and learning than ever i have to commit it but i would not enter into he merriment all the next day which be Sunday i pass in a most miserable state i go into the wood alone i do not think myself worthy or fit to associate with those who have religion while i be anxious to avoid the company of those who make light of it sometimes i would sit down sometimes i would stand up sometimes i would walk about frequently i prayed but find no comfort in it about sun-set i meet a friend who say to I well we camp-meeting be about end what a misery those few word strike to my heart about end i say to myself about end and i not convert a little later as i be pass along the camp-ground i see a woman before I kneel and pray a acquaintance of mine who be approach she in a opposite direction call out to I daniel help I pray for this woman i have make up my mind to make one more effort and i knelt down and commence pray but quite as much for myself as for she other gather about we and join in and the interest and excitement become so great that after a vain effort to call we off the regular service of the evening be dispense with and the ground be leave to we thing go on in this way till about nine o'clock when as suddenly as if i have be strike a heavy blow i feel a remarkable change come over I all my fear and terror seem to be instantaneously remove and my whole soul to be fill with joy and peace this be the sort of change which i have be teach to look for as the consequence of get that religion for which i have be struggle so hard i instantly rise up and tell those about I that i be a convert man and from that moment i be able to sing and shout and pray with the best of they in the midst of my exultation who should come up but my old master in the shoe-making trade of whom i have already give some account he have hear that i be on the camp-ground in pursuit of religion and have come to find I out daniel he say address I by my christian name what be you do here do not make a fool of yourself to which i answer that i have get to be just such a fool as i have long want to be and i take he by the arm and endeavor to prevail upon he to kneel down and allow we to pray over he assure he that i know he conviction to be much better than he conduct that he must get religion and now be the time but he draw back and escape from I with promise to do better which however he do not keep as for myself consider and as i think feeling that i be a convert man i now enjoy for some time a extraordinary satisfaction a sort of offset to the month of agony and misery which i have previously endure but though regard myself as now truly convert i delay some time before unite myself with any particular church i do not know which to join this division into so many hostile sect seem to I unaccountable i think that all good christian should love each other and be as one family yet it seem necessary to unite myself with some body of christian and as i have be educate a methodist i conclude to join they i have give the account of my religious experience exactly as it seem to I at the time and as i now remember it it correspond with the common course of religious experience in the methodist church except that with I the struggle be harder than commonly happen i do not doubt at the time that it be truly a supernatural change as much the work of the spirit as the sudden conversion record in the act of the apostle other can form they own opinion about it i will only add that subsequent experience have lead I to the belief that the reality of a man 's religion be more to be judge of by what he do than by how he feel or what he say the change which have take place in I however it be to be regard be not without a decide influence on my whole future life i no longer consider myself as live for myself alone i regard myself as bind to do unto other as i would that they should do unto I and it be in attempt to act up to this principle that i become involve in the difficulty to be hereafter related meanwhile i resume my voyage in the sarah henry in which i continue to sail on share for several year with tolerable success afterwards i follow the same business in the schooner protection in which i suffer another shipwreck we sail from philadelphium to washington in the district of columbium laden with coal proceed down the delaware and by the open sea but when off the entrance of the chesapeake we encounter a heavy gale which split the sail sweep the deck and drive we off we course as far south as ocracoke inlet on the coast of north carolina i take a pilot intend to go in to repair damages but owe to the strength of the current which defeat he calculation the pilot run we on the bar as soon as the schooner 's bow touch the ground she swing round broadside to the sea which immediately begin to break over she in a fearful manner she fill immediately -- everything on deck be sweep away and as we only chance of safety we take to the main-rigging this be about seven o'clock in the evening towards morning by reason of the continual thump the mainmast begin to work through the vessel and to settle in the sand so that it become necessary for we to make we way to the fore-rigging which we do not without danger as one of the man be twice wash off about a quarter of a mile inside be a small low island on which lay five boat each man by five man who have come down to we assistance but the surf be so high that they do not venture to approach we so we remain cling with difficulty to the rig till about half-past one when the schooner go to piece the mast to which we be cling fall and we be precipitate into the rage surf which sweep we onward towards the island already mention the man there anticipate what have happen have prepare for its occurrence and the best swimmer with rope tie round they waist the other end of which be hold by those on shore plunge in to we assistance one of we unfortunate company be drown -- the rest of we come safely to the shore but we lose everything except the clothes we stand in the fragment save from the wreck be sell at auction for two hundred dollar the people of that neighborhood treat we with great kindness and we presently take the packet for elizabeth city whence i proceed to norfolk baltimore and so home i have make up my mind to go to sea no more but after remain on shore for three week and not find anything else to do as it be necessary for I to have the means of support my increase family i take the command of another vessel belong to the same owner the sloop joseph b while in this vessel my voyage be to the eastward i be engage in the flour-trade in conjunction with the owner of the vessel we buy flour and grain on a sixty day ' credit which i carry to the kennebec portsmouth boston new bedford and other eastern port calculate upon the return of the voyage to take up we note i be so successful in this business as finally to become the owner of the joseph b which vessel i exchange away at portsmouth for the sophronium a top-sail schooner of one hundred and sixty ton worth about fourteen hundred dollar in this vessel i make two trip to boston -- one with coal and the other with timber have unloaded my timber i take in a hundred ton of plaster purchase on my own account intend to dispose of it in the susquehanna but on the passage i encounter a heavy storm which blow the mast out of the vessel and drive she ashore on the south side of long island we save we life but i lose everything except one hundred and sixty dollar for which i sell what be leave of the vessel and cargo have return to my family with but little disposition to try my fortune again in the coasting-trade one day be in the horse-market i purchase a horse and wagon and take in my wife and some of the younger child i go to pay a visit to the neighborhood in which i be bear here i trade for half of a bay-craft of about sixty ton burden in which i engage in the oyster-trade and other small bay-traffic have meet at baltimore the owner of the other half i buy he out also the whole craft stand I in about seven hundred dollar i then purchase three hundred bushel of potato with which i sail for fredericksburg in virginium but this prove a lose trip the potato not sell for what they cost I at fredericksburg i take in flour on freight for norfolk but my ill-luck still pursue I in unload the vessel the cargo forward be first take out she settle by the stern and spring a leak damaging fifteen barrel of flour which be throw upon my hand i then sail for the eastern shore of virginium and at a place call cherrystone trade off my damaged flour for a cargo of pear with which i sail for new york i proceed safely as far as barnegat when i encounter a north-east storm which drive I back into the delaware oblige I to seek refuge in the same maurice river from which i have commence my sea-faring life in the wood business but by this time the pear be spoil and i be oblige to throw they overboard at cherrystone i have meet the owner of a pilot-boat who have seem disposed to trade with I for my vessel and i now return to that place and complete the trade after which i load the pilot-boat with oyster and terrapin and sail for philadelphium this boat be a excellent sailer but too sharp and not of burden enough for my business and i soon exchange she for half a little sloop in which i carry a load of water-melon to baltimore by this time i be pretty well sick of the water and have hire out the sloop i set up a shop at philadelphium for the purchase and sale of junk old iron & c & c but after continue in this business for about two year -- my health be bad and the doctor have advise I to try the water again -- i buy half of another sloop and engage in trade up and down chesapeake bay return home towards the close of the season with the proceeds of the summer 's business i encounter in the upper part of chesapeake bay a terrible snow-storm which prove fatal to many vessel then in the bay in attempt to make a harbor the vessel strike the ground and knock off she rudder and in order to get she off we be oblige to throw over the deck-load we drift about all day it still blow and snow and at night let go both anchor so we lay for a night and a day but have neither boat rudder nor provision i be finally oblige to slip the anchor and run ashore i sell my half of she as she lay for ninety dollar which be all that remain to I of my investment and my summer 's work not have the means to purchase a boat my health also continue quite infirm the next summer i hire one and continue the same trade up and down the bay which i have follow the previous summer my trading up and down the bay in the way which i have describe of course bring I a good deal into contact with the slave population no sooner indeed do a vessel know to be from the north anchor in any of these water -- and the slave be pretty adroit in ascertain from what state a vessel come -- than she be board if she remain any length of time and especially over night by more or less of they in hope of obtain a passage in she to a land of freedom during my earlier voyaging several year before in chesapeake bay i have turn a deaf ear to all these request at that time accord to a idea still common enough i have regard the negro as only fit to be slave and have not be incline to pay much attention to the pitiful tale which they tell I of ill-treatment by they master and mistress but my view upon this subject have undergo a gradual change i know it be assert in the declaration of independence that all man be bear free and equal and i have read in the bible that god have make of one flesh all the nation of the earth i have find out by intercourse with the negro that they have the same desire wish and hope as myself i know very well that i should not like to be a slave even to the best of master and still less to such sort of master as the greater part of the slave seem to have the idea of have first one child and then another take from I as fast as they grow large enough and hand over to the slave-trader to be carry i know not where and sell if they be girl i know not for what purpose would have be horrible enough and from instance which come to my notice i perceive that it be not less horrible and distressing to the party concern in the case of black people than of white one i have never read any abolition book nor hear any abolition lecture i have frequent only methodist meeting and nothing be hear there about slavery but for the life of I i could not perceive why the golden rule of do to other as you would wish they to do to you do not apply to this case have i be a slave myself -- and it be not a great while since the algerine use to make slave of we sailor white as well as black -- i should have think it very right and proper in anybody who would have venture to assist I in escape out of bondage and the more dangerous it might have be to render such assistance the more meritorious i should have think the act to be why have not these black people so anxious to escape from they master as good a light to they liberty as i have to mine i know it be sometimes say by those who defend slavery or apologize for it that the slave at the south be very happy and contented if leave to themselves and that this idea of run away be only put into they head by mischievous white people from the north this will do very well for those who know nothing of the matter personally and who be anxious to listen to any excuse but there be not a waterman who ever sail in chesapeake bay who will not tell you that so far from the slave need any prompt to run away the difficulty be when they ask you to assist they to make they take no for a answer i have know instance where man have lie in the wood for a year or two wait for a opportunity to escape on board some vessel on one of my voyage up the potomac a application be make to I on behalf of such a runaway and i be so much move by he story that have it be practicable for I at that time i should certainly have help he off one or two attempt i do make to assist the flight of some of those who seek my assistance but none with success till the summer of 1847 which be the period to which i have bring down my narrative i be employ during that summer as i have mention already in trade up and down the chesapeake in a hire boat a small black boy be my only assistant among other trip i go to washington with a cargo of oyster while i be lie there at the same wharf as it happen from which the pearl afterwards take she departure a color man come on board and observe that i seem to be from the north he say he suppose we be pretty much all abolitionist there i do not know where he get this piece of information but i think it likely from some southern member of congress as i do not check he but rather encourage he to go on he finally tell I that he want to get passage to the north for a woman and five child the husband of the woman and father of the child be a free color man and the woman under a agreement with she master have already more than pay for she liberty but when she have ask he for a settlement he have only answer by threaten to sell she he beg I to see the woman which i do and finally i make a arrangement to take they away they bedding and other thing be send down on board the vessel in open day and at night the woman come on board with she five child and a niece we be ten day in reach frenchtown where the husband be in wait for they he take they under he charge and i see they no more but since my release from imprisonment in washington i have hear that the whole family be comfortably establish in a free country and do well have accomplish this exploit -- and be it not something of a exploit to bestow the invaluable gift of liberty upon seven of one 's fellow-creature -- the season be now far advanced i give up the boat to the owner and return to my family at philadelphium in the course of the follow month of February i receive a note from a person whom i have never know or hear of before desire I to call at a certain place name in it i do so when it appear that i have be hear of through the color family which i have bring off from washington a letter from that city be read to I relate the case of a family or two who expect daily and hourly to be sell and desire assistance to get they away it be propose to I to undertake this enterprise but i decline it at this time as i have no vessel and because the season be too early for navigation through the canal i see the same person again about a fortnight later and finally arrange to go on to washington to see what could be do there i agree to return again so soon as i could find a vessel fit for the enterprise i speak with several person of my acquaintance who have vessel under they control but they decline on account of the danger they do not appear to have any other objection and seem to wish I success pass along the street i meet captain sayre and know that he be sail a small bay-craft call the pearl and learning from he that business be dull with he i propose the enterprise to he offer he one hundred dollar for the charter of he vessel to washington and back to frenchtown where accord to the arrangement with the friend of the passenger they be to be meet and carry to philadelphium this be considerably more than the vessel could earn in any ordinary trip of the like duration and sayre close with the offer he fully understand the nature of the enterprise by we bargain i be to have as supercargo the control of the vessel so far as related to she freight and be to bring away from washington such passenger as i choose to receive on board but the control of the vessel in other respects remain with he captain sayre engage in this enterprise merely as a matter of business i too be to be pay for my time and trouble -- a offer which the low state of my pecuniary affair and the necessity of support my family do not allow I to decline but this be not by any means my sole or principal motive i undertake it out of sympathy for the enslaved and from my desire to do something to further the cause of universal liberty such be the different ground upon which sayre and myself stand i do not think it necessary or expedient to communicate to he the name of the person with whom the expedition have originate and at my suggestion those person abstain from any direct communication with he either at philadelphium or washington sayre have as cook and sailor on board the pearl a young man name chester english he be marry and have a child or two but be himself as inexperienced as a child have never be more than thirty mile from the place where he be bear i remonstrate with sayre against take this young man with we but english pleased with the idea of see washington desire to go and sayre who have engage he for the season do not like to part with he he go with we but be keep in total ignorance of the real object of the voyage he have the idea that we be go to washington for a load of ship-timber we proceed down the delaware and by the canal into the chesapeake make for the mouth of the potomac as we ascend that river we stop at a place call machudock where i purchase by way of cargo and cover to the voyage twenty cord of wood and with that freight on board we proceed to washington where we arrive on the evening of Thursday the 13th of April 1848 as it happen we find that city in a great state of excitement on the subject of emancipation liberty and the rights of man a grand torch-light procession be on foot in honor of the new french revolution the expulsion of louis-philippe and the establishment of a republic in france bonfire be blaze in the public square and a great out-door meeting be be hold in front of the _ union _ newspaper office at which very enthusiastic and exciting speech be deliver principally by southern democratic member of congress which body be at that time in session a full account of these proceedings with report of the speech be give in the _ union _ of the next day accord to this report mr foote the senator from mississippus extol the french revolution as hold out to the whole family of man a bright promise of the universal establishment of civil and religious liberty he declare in the same speech that the age of tyrant and of slavery be rapidly draw to a close and that the happy period to be signalize by the _ universal emancipation _ of man from the fetter of civic oppression and the recognition in all country of the great principle of popular sovereignty equality and brotherhood be at this moment visibly commence mr stanton of tennessee and other speak in a strain equally fervid and philanthropic i be oblige to refer to the _ union _ newspaper for a account of these speech as i do not hear they myself i come to washington not to preach nor to hear preached emancipation equality and brotherhood but to put they into practice sayre and english go up to see the procession and hear the speech i have other thing to attend to the news of my arrival soon spread among those who have be expect it though i neither see nor have any direct communication with any of those who be to be my passenger i have some difficulty in dispose of my wood which be not a very first-rate article but finally sell it take in payment the purchaser 's note on sixty day which i change off for half cash and half provision as the trader to whom i pass the note have no hard bread sayre and myself go in the steamer to alexandrium to purchase a barrel -- a circumstance of which it be afterwards attempt to take advantage against we it be arrange that the passenger should come on board after dark on Saturday evening and that we should sail about midnight i have understand that the expedition have principally originate in the desire to help off a certain family consist of a woman nine child and two grand-child who be believe to be legally entitle to they liberty they case have be in litigation for some time but although they have a very good case -- the lawyer whom they employ -lrb- mr bradley one of the most distinguished member of the bar of the district -rrb- testify in the course of one of my trial that he believe they to be legally free -- yet as they money be nearly exhaust and as there seem to be no end to the law 's delay and the pertinacity of the woman who claim they it be deem best by they friend that they should get away if they could lest she might seize they unawares and sell they to some trader in speaking of this case the person with whom i communicate at washington inform I that there be also quite a number of other who wish to avail themselves of this opportunity of escape and that the number of passenger be likely to be larger than have at first be calculate upon to which i reply that i do not stand about the number that all who be on board before eleven o'clock i should take -- the other would have to remain behind Saturday evening at supper i let english a little into the secret of what i intend i tell he that the sort of ship-timber we be go to take would prove very easy to load and unload that a number of color people wish to take passage with we down the bay and that as sayre and myself would be away the greater part of the evening all he have to do be as fast as they come on board to lift up the hatch and let they pass into the hold shut the hatch down upon they the vessel which we have move down the river since unload the wood lay at a rather lonely place call white-house wharf from a whitish-colored building which stand upon it the high bank of the river under which a road pass afford a cover to the wharf and there be only a few scattered building in the vicinity towards the town there stretch a wide extent of open field anxious as might naturally be expect as to the result i keep in the vicinity to watch the progress of event there be another small vessel that lay across the head of the same wharf but she crew be all black and go on board she just at dusk i inform the skipper of my business intimate to he at the same time that it would be a dangerous thing for he to betray I he assure I that i need have no fear of he -- that the other man would soon leave the vessel not to return again till Monday and that for himself he should go below and to sleep so as neither to hear nor to see anything shortly after dark the expect passenger begin to arrive come stealthily across the field and glide silently on board the vessel i observe a man near a neighbor brick-kiln who seem to be watch they i go towards he and find he to be black he tell I that he understand what be go on but that i need have no apprehension of he two white man who walk along the road past the vessel and who presently return back the same way occasion I some alarm but they seem to have no suspicion of what be on foot as i see no more of they i go on board the vessel several time in the course of the evening and learn from english that the hold be fast fill up i have promise he in consideration of the unusual nature of the business we be engage in ten dollar as a gratuity in addition to he wages something past ten o'clock i go on board and direct english to cast off the fastening and to get ready to make sail pretty soon sayre come on board it be a dead calm and we be oblige to get the boat out to get the vessel 's head round after drop down a half a mile or so we encounter the tide make up the river and as there be still no wind we be oblige to anchor here we lay in a dead calm till about daylight the wind then begin to breeze up lightly from the northward when we get up the anchor and make sail as the sun rise we pass alexandrium i then go into the hold for the first time and there find my passenger pretty thickly stow i distribute bread among they and knock down the bulkhead between the hold and the cabin in order that they might get into the cabin to cook they consist of man and woman in pretty equal proportion with a number of boy and girl and two small child the wind keep increase and haul to the westward off fort washington we have to make two stretch but the rest of the way we run before the wind shortly after dinner we pass the steamer from baltimore for washington bind up i think the passenger on board take particular notice of we but the number of vessel meet with in a passage up the potomac at that season be so few as to make one at least for the idle passenger of a steamboat a object of some curiosity just before sunset we pass a schooner load with plaster bind up as we approach the mouth of the potomac the wind haul to the north and blow with such stiffness as would make it impossible for we to go up the bay accord to we original plan under these circumstance apprehend a pursuit from washington i urge sayre to go to sea with the intention of reach the delaware by the outside passage but he object that the vessel be not fit to go outside -lrb- which be true enough -rrb- and that the bargain be to go to frenchtown have reach point lookout at the mouth of the river and not be able to persuade sayre to go to sea and the wind be dead in we tooth and too strong to allow any attempt to ascend the bay we come to anchor in cornfield harbor just under point lookout a shelter usually seek by bay-craft encounter contrary wind when in that neighborhood we be all sleepy with be up all the night before and soon after drop anchor we all turn in i know nothing more till wake suddenly i hear the noise of a steamer blow off steam alongside of we i know at once that we be take the black man come to the cabin and ask if they should fight i tell they no we have no arm nor be there the least possibility of a successful resistance the loud shout and trampling of many foot overhead prove that we assailant be numerous one of they lift the hatch a little and cry out nigger by g -- d a exclamation to which the other respond with three cheer and by bang the but of they musket against the deck a lantern be call for to read the name of the vessel and it be ascertain to be the pearl a number of man come to the cabin-door and call for captain drayton i be in no great hurry to stir but at length rise from my berth say that i consider myself they prisoner and that i expect to be treat as such while i be dress rather too slowly for the impatience of those outside a sentinel who have be station at the cabin-door follow every motion of mine with he gun which he keep pointed at I in great apprehension apparently lest i should suddenly seize some dangerous weapon and make at he as i come out of the cabin-door two of they seize I take I on board the steamer and tie I and they do the same with sayre and english who be bring on board one after the other the black people be leave on board the pearl which the steamer take in tow and then proceed up the river to explain this sudden change in we situation it be necessary to go back to washington great be the consternation in several family of that city on Sunday morning to find no breakfast and what be worse they servant miss nor be this disaster confine to washington only georgetown come in for a considerable share of it and even alexandrium on the opposite side of the river have not entirely escape the person who have take passage on board the pearl have be hold in bondage by no less than forty-one different person great be the wonder at the sudden and simultaneous disappearance of so many prime hand roughly estimate though probably with considerable exaggeration as worth in the market not less than a hundred thousand dollar -- and all at one fall swoop too as the district attorney afterwards in argue the case against I pathetically express it there be a great many guess and conjecture as to where these people have go and how they have go but it be very doubtful whether the loser would have get upon the right track have it not be for the treachery of a color hackman who have be employ to carry down to the vessel two passenger who have be in hide for some week previous and who could not safely walk down lest they might be meet and recognize emulate the example of that large and in they own opinion at least highly moral religious and respectable class of white people know as dough-face this hackman think it a fine opportunity to feather he nest by play cat 's - paw to the slave-holder see how much the information be in demand and anticipate no doubt a large reward he turn informer and describe the pearl as the conveyance which the fugitive have take and it be ascertain that the pearl have actually sail between Saturday night and Sunday morning preparation be soon make to pursue she a mr dodge of georgetown a wealthy old gentleman originally from new england miss three or four slave from he family and a small steamboat of which he be the proprietor be readily obtain thirty-five man include a son or two of old dodge and several of those whose slave be miss volunteer to man she and they set out about Sunday noon arm to the tooth with gun pistol bowie-knife & c and well provide with brandy and other liquor they hear of we on the passage down from the baltimore steamer and the vessel load with plaster they reach the mouth of the river and not have find the pearl be about to return as the steamer could not proceed into the bay without forfeit she insurance as a last chance they look into cornfield harbor where they find we as i have relate this be about two o'clock in the morning the pearl have come to anchor about nine o'clock the previous evening it be a hundred and forty mile from washington to cornfield harbor the steamer with the pearl in tow cross over from point lookout to piney point on the south shore of the potomac and here the pearl be leave at anchor a part of the steamer 's company remain to guard she while the steamer have myself and the other white prisoner on board proceed up coan river for a supply of wood have obtain which she again about noon of Monday take the pearl in tow and start for washington the bearing manner and aspect of the thirty-five armed person by whom we have be thus seize and bind without the slightest shadow of lawful authority be sufficient to inspire a good deal of alarm we have be lie quietly at anchor in a harbor of maryland and although the owner of the slave might have have a legal right to pursue and take they back what warrant or authority have they for seize we and we vessel they could have bring none from the district of columbium whose officer have no jurisdiction or authority in cornfield harbor nor do they pretend to have any from the state of maryland some of they show a good deal of excitement and evince a disposition to proceed to lynch we at once a man name houver who claim as he property two of the boy passenger on board the pearl put I some question in a very insolent tone to which i reply that i consider myself a prisoner and do not wish to answer any question whereupon one of the bystander flourish a dirk in my face exclaim if i be in he place i would put this through you at piney point one of the company propose to hang I up to the yard-arm and make I confess but the more influential of those on board be not ready for any such violence though all be exceedingly anxious to get out of I the history of the expedition and who my employer be that i have employer and person of note too be take for grant on all hand nor do i think it worth my while to contradict it though i decline steadily to give any information on that point sayre and english very readily tell all that they know english especially be in a great state of alarm and cry most bitterly i pity he much besides feel some compunction at get he thus into difficulty and upon the representation which i make that he come to washington in perfect ignorance of the object of the expedition he be finally untied as sayre be oblige to admit that he come to washington to take away color passenger he be not regard with so much favor but it be evidently I whom they look upon as the chief culprit alone possess a knowledge of the history and origin of the expedition which they be so anxious to unravel they accordingly go to work very artfully to worm this secret out of I i be place in charge of one orme a police-officer of georgetown whose manner towards I be such as to inspire I with a certain confidence in he who as it afterwards appear from he testimony on the trial carefully take minute -- but as it prove very confused and incorrect one -- of all that i say hope thus to secure something that might turn out to my disadvantage another person with whom i have a good deal of conversation and who be afterwards produce as a witness against I be william h craig in my opinion a much more conscientious person than orme who seem to think that it be part of he duty as a police-officer to testify to something at all hazard to help on a conviction but this be a subject to which i shall have occasion to return presently in one particular at least the testimony of both these witness be correct enough they both testify to my express pretty serious apprehension of what the result to myself be likely to be what the particular provision be in the district of columbium as to help slave to escape i do not know but i have hear that in some of the slave-state they be very severe in fact i be assure by craig that i have commit the highest crime next to murder know in they law under these circumstance i make up my mind that the least penalty i should be apt to escape with be confinement in the penitentiary for life and it be quite probable that i endeavored to console myself as these witness testify with the idea that after all it might in a religious point of view be all for the best as i should thus be remove from temptation and have ample time for reflection and repentance but my apprehension be by no means limit to what i might suffer under the form of law from the temper exhibit by some of my captor and from the vindictive fury with which the idea of enable the enslave to regain they liberty be i know generally regard at the south i apprehended more sudden and summary proceedings and what happen afterwards at washington prove that these apprehension be not wholly unfounded the idea of be tear in piece by a furious mob be exceedingly disagreeable many man who might not fear death might yet not choose to meet it in that shape i call to mind the apology of the methodist minister who just after a declaration of he that he be not afraid to die run away from a furious bull that attack he -- that though not fear death he do not like to be tear in piece by a mad bull i related this anecdote to craig and as he testify on the trial express my preference to be take on the deck of the steamer and shot at once rather than to be give up to a washington mob to be bait and murder i talk pretty freely with orme and craig about myself the circumstance under which i have undertake this enterprise my motive to it my family my past misfortune and the fate that probably await I but they fail to extract from I what they seem chiefly to desire any information which would implicate other orme tell I as he afterwards testify that what the people in the district want be the principal and that if i would give information that would lead to they the owner of the slave would let I go or sign a petition for my pardon craig also make various inquiry tend to the same point though i be firmly resolve not to yield in this particular yet i be desirous to do all i could to soften the feeling against I and it be doubtless this desire which lead I to make the statement swear to by orme and craig that i have no connection with the person call abolitionist -- which be true enough that i have formerly refuse large offer make I by slave to carry they away and that in the present instance i be employ by other and be to be pay for my service on arrive off fort washington the steamer anchor for the night as the captor prefer to make they triumphant entry into the city by daylight sayre and myself be watch during the night by a regular guard of two man arm with musket who be relieve from time to time before get under weigh again -- which they do about seven o'clock in the morning of Tuesday feb 18 -- sayre and myself be tie together arm-and-arm and the black people also two-and-two with the other arm bind behind they back as we pass alexandrium we be all order on deck and exhibit to the mob collect on the wharf to get a sight of we who signify they satisfaction by three cheer when we land at the steamboat-wharf in washington which be a mile and more from pennsylvanium avenue and in a remote part of the city but few people have yet assemble we be march up in a long procession sayre and myself be place at the head of it guard by a man on each side english follow next and then the negro as we go along the mob begin to increase and as we pass gannon 's slave-pen that slave-trader arm with a knife rush out and with horrid imprecation make a pass at I which be very near finding its way through my body instead of be arrest as he ought to have be this slave-dealer be politely inform that i be in the hand of the law to which he reply d -- n the law -- i have three negro and i will give they all for one thrust at this d -- d scoundrel and he follow along wait he opportunity to repeat the blow the crowd by this time be greatly increase we meet a immense mob of several thousand person come down four-and-a-half street with the avowed intention of carry we up before the capitol and make a exhibition of we there the noise and confusion be very great it seem as if the time for the lynching have come when almost up to pennsylvanium avenue a rush be make upon we -- lynch they lynch they the d -- n villain and other such cry resound on all side those who have we in charge be greatly alarmed and see no other way to keep we from the hand of the mob they procure a hack and put sayre and myself into it the hack drive to the jail the mob continue to follow repeat they shout and threat several thousand people surround the jail fill up the enclosure about it we captor have become satisfied from the statement make by sayre and myself and from he own statement and conduct that the participation of english in the affair be not of a sort that require any punishment and when the mob make the rush upon we the person have he in charge have let he go with the intention that he should escape after a while he have find he way back to the steamboat wharf but the steamer be go alone in a strange place and not know what to do he tell he story to somebody whom he meet who put he in a hack and send he up to the jail it be a pity he lack the enterprise to take care of himself when set at liberty as it cost he four month ' imprisonment and he friend some money i ought to have mention before that on arrive within the water of the district sayre and myself have be examine before a justice of the peace who be one of the captor and who have act as they leader he have make out a commitment against we but none against english so that the person who have he in charge be right enough in let he go sayre and myself be at first put into the same cell but towards night we be separate a person name goddard connect with the police come to examine we he go to sayre first he then come to I when i tell he that as i suppose he have get the whole story out of sayre and as it be not best that two story should be tell i would say nothing goddard then take from I my money one of the keeper throw I in two thin blanket and i be leave to sleep as i could the accommodation be not of the most luxurious kind the cell have a stone floor which with the help of a blanket be to serve also for a bed there be neither chair table stool nor any individual piece of furniture of any kind except a night-bucket and a water-can i be refuse my overcoat and valise and have nothing but my water-can to make a pillow of with such a pillow and the bare stone floor for my bed look upon by all whom i see with apparent abhorrence and terror -- as much so to all appearance as if i have be a murderer or take in some other desperate crime -- remember the execration which the mob have belch forth against I and uncertain whether a person would be find to express the least sympathy for I -lrb- which might not in the exist state of the public feeling be safe -rrb- it may be imagine that my slumber be not very sound meanwhile the rage of the mob have take for the moment another direction i have hear it say while we be come up in the steamboat that the abolition press must be stop and the mob accordingly as the night come on gather about the office of the _ national era _ with threat to destroy it some little mischief be do but the property-holder in the city well aware how dependent washington be upon the liberality of congress be unwilling that anything should occur to place the district in bad odor at the north some of they also it be but justice to believe could not entirely give in to the slave-holding doctrine and practice of suppress free discussion by force and by they effort second by a drenching storm of rain that come on between nine and ten o'clock the mob be persuade to disperse for the present the jail be guard that night by a strong body of police serious apprehension be entertain lest the mob instigate by the violence of many southern member of congress should break in and lynch we great apprehension also seem to be feel at the jail lest we might be rescue and we be subject during the night to frequent examination to see that all be safe great be the terror as well as the rage which the abolitionist appear to inspire they seem to be think capable if not very narrowly watch of take we off through the roof or the stone floor or out of the iron-barred door and from the half-frightened look which the keeper give I from time to time i could plainly enough read they thought -- that a fellow who have venture on such a enterprise as that of the pearl be desperate and daring enough to attempt anything for a poor prisoner like I so much in the power of he captor and without the slightest mean hope or even thought of escape it be some little satisfaction to observe the awe and terror which he inspire of the prison fare i shall have more to say by and by it be sufficient to state here that it be about on a par with the sleep accommodation and hardly of a sort to give a man in my situation the necessary physical vigor however i think little of this at that moment as i be too sick and excited to feel much disposition to eat the washington prison be a large three-story stone build the front part of the lower story of which be occupy by the guard-room or jail-office and by the kitchen and sleep apartment for the keeper the back part shut off from the front by strong grated door have a wind stone stair-case ascend in the middle on each side of which on each of the three story be passage-way also shut off from the stair-case by grate iron door the back wall of the jail form one side of these passage which be light by grated window on the other side be the cell also with grate iron door and receive they light and air entirely from the passage the passage themselves have no ventilation except through the door and window which answer that purpose very imperfectly the front second story over the guard-room contain the cell for the female prisoner the front third story be the debtor ' apartment the usage of the jail always have be -- except in case of insubordination or attempt escape when lock up in the cell by day as well as by night have be resort to as a punishment -- to allow the prisoner during the day-time the use of the passage for the benefit of light air and exercise indeed it be hard to conceive a more cruel punishment than to keep a man lock up all the time in one of these half-lighted unventilated cell on the morning of the second day of we confinement we too be let out into the passage but we be soon put back again and not only into separate cell but into separate passage so as to be entirely cut off from any communication with each other it be a long time before we be able to regain the privilege of the passage but for the present i shall pass over the internal economy and administration of the prison and my treatment in it intend further on to give a general sketch of that subject about nine or ten o'clock mr gidding the member of congress from ohio come to see we there be some disposition i understand not to allow he to enter the jail but mr gidding be a man not easily repulse and there be nobody of whom the good people at washington especially the office-holder who make up so large a part of the population stand so much in awe as a member of congress especially a member of mr gidding ' well-known fearless determination he be allow to come in bring another person with he but be follow into the jail by a crowd of ruffian who compel the turnkey to admit they into the passage and who vent they rage in execration and threat mr gidding say that he have understand we be here in jail without counsel or friend and that he have come to let we know that we should not want for either and he introduce the person he have bring with he as one who be willing to act temporarily as we counsel not long after mr david a hall a lawyer of the district come to offer he service to we in the same way key the united state attorney for the district and who as such have charge of the proceedings against we be there at the same time he advise mr hall to leave the jail and go home immediately as the people outside be furious and he run the risk of he life to which mr hall reply that thing have come to a pretty pass if a man 's counsel be not to have the privilege of talk with he poor devil say the district attorney as he go out i pity they -- they be to be make scape-goat for other yet the rancor and virulence and fierce pertinacity with which this key afterwards pursue I do not look much like pity no doubt he be a good deal irritated at he ill success in get any information out of I the seventy-six passenger find on board the pearl have be commit to the jail as runaway and mr gidding on go up to the house by way of warn i suppose to the slave-holder that they be not to be allow to have everything they own way move a inquiry into the circumstance under which seventy-six person be hold prisoner in the district jail merely for attempt to vindicate they inalienable rights mr hale also in the senate in consequence of the threat hold out to destroy the _ era _ office and to put a stop to the publication of that paper move a resolution of inquiry into the necessity of additional law for the protection of property in the district the fury which these movement excite in the mind of the slave-holder find expression in the editorial column of the washington _ union _ in a article which i have insert below as form a curious contrast to the exultation of that print only a week before and to which i have have occasion already to refer over the spread of the principle of liberty and universal emancipation the violent attack upon mr gidding because he have visit we three poor prisoner in jail and offer we the assistance of counsel -- as if the vilest criminal be not entitle to have counsel to defend they -- be well worthy of notice the follow be the article refer to the abolition incendiary those two abolition incendiary -lrb- gidding and hale -rrb- throw firebrand yesterday into the two house of congress the western abolitionist move a resolution of inquiry into the transaction now pass in washington which bring on a fierce and fiery debate on the part of the southern member in the course of which mr gidding _ be compel to confess _ on the cross-questioning of messr venable and haskell _ that he have visit the three piratical kidnapper now confine in jail and offer they counsel _ the reply of mr toomb of georgium be scorch to a intense degree the abolitionist john p hale throw a firebrand resolution into the senate call for additional law to compel this city to prevent riot this also give rise to a long and excited debate no question be take in either house before they adjourn but in the progress of the discussion in both house some doctrine be utter which be calculate to startle the friend of the union gidding justify the kidnapper and contend that though the act be legally forbid it be not morally wrong mr toomb bring home the practical consequence of this doctrine to the member from ohio in a most impressive manner hale of the senate whilst he be willing to protect the abolitionist express himself willing to relax the law and weaken the protection which be give to the slave property in this district mr davi of massachusett hold the strange doctrine that while he would not disturb the rights of the slave-holder he would not cease to discuss those rights as if congress ought to discuss or to protect a right to discuss a domestic institution of the southern state with which they have no right to interfere why discuss when they can not act why first lay down a abstract principle which they intend to violate in practice such fanatic as gidding and hale be do more mischief than they will be able to atone for they incessant and impertinent intermeddle with the most delicate question in we social relation be create the most indignant feeling in the community the fiery discussion they be exciting be calculate to provoke the very riot which they deprecate let these madman forbear if they value the tranquillity of we country and the stability of we union we conjure they to forbear they madden parricidal hand a article like this in the _ union _ be well calculate and probably be intend to encourage and stimulate the rioter and accordingly they assemble that same evening in greater force than before threaten the destruction of the _ era _ office the publication office of the _ era _ be not far from the patent office and the dwelling-house of dr bailey the editor be at no great distance the mob take upon themselves the character of a meeting of citizen appoint a committee to wait upon dr bailey to require he to remove he press out of the district of columbium of course as i be lock up in the jail try to rest my ache head and weary limb with a stone floor for a bed and a water-can for my pillow i can have no personal knowledge of what transpire on this occasion but a correspondent of the new york _ tribune _ who probably be a eye-witness give the follow account of the interview between the committee and dr bailey : clear he throat the leader of the committee stretch forth he hand and thus address dr bailey : _ mr radcliff _ -- sir we have be

among you who stand as i now stand the representative of a free press would accede to this demand and abandon he rights as a american citizen _ one of the committee _ -- we know it be a great

must do as they see proper i maintain my rights and make no resistance the committee then retire and dr bailey rentered he dwelling meanwhile the shout of the mob as they receive the report of the committee be rechoed along the street a fierce yell greet the reppearance of radcliff in front of the patent office he announce the result of the interview with the editor of the _ era _ shout imprecation blasphemy burst from the crowd down with the _ era _ now for it gut the office be the exclamation hear on all side and the mob rush tumultuously to seventh-street but a body of the city police have be station to guard the building and the mob finally contented themselves with pass a resolution to pull it down the next day at ten o'clock if the press be not meanwhile remove that same afternoon we three prisoner have be take before three justice who hold a court within the jail for we examination mr hall appear as we counsel the examination be continue till the next day when we be all three of we recommit to jail on a charge of steal slave we bail be fix at a thousand dollar for each slave or seventy-six thousand dollar for each of we meanwhile both house of congress become the scene of very warm debate grow out of circumstance connect with we case in the senate mr hale agreeably to the notice he have give ask leave to introduce a bill for the protection of property in the district of columbium against the violence of mob this bill as be state in the debate be copy almost word for word from a law in force in the state of maryland -lrb- and many other state have -- and all ought to have -- a similar law -rrb- make the city and town liable for any property which might be destroy in they by mob violence in the house the subject come up on a question of privilege raise by mr palfrey of massachusett who offer a resolution for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the currently-reported fact that a lawless mob have assemble during the two previous night set at defiance the constitute authority of the united state and menacing member of congress and other person in both those body the debate be very warm as any one interested in it will find by read it in the column of the _ congressional globe _ it be upon this occasion during the debate in the senate that mr foote then a senator from mississippus and now governor of that state whose speech on the french revolution have be already quote threaten to join in lynching mr hale if he ever set foot in mississippus whither he invite he to come for that purpose this part of the debate be so peculiar and so characteristic show so well the spirit with which the district of columbium be then blaze against I that i can not help give the follow extract from mr foote 's speech as contain in the official report : all must see that the course of the senator from new hampshire be calculate to embroil the confederacy -- to put in peril we free institution -- to jeopardize that union which we forefather establish and which every pure patriot throughout the country desire shall be perpetuate can any man be a patriot who pursue such a course be he a enlighten friend of freedom or even a judicious friend of those with whom he affect to sympathize who adopt such a course who do not know that such man be practically the worst enemy of the slave i do not beseech the gentleman to stop but if he persevere he will awaken indignation everywhere and it can not be that enlighten man who conscientiously belong to the faction at the north of which he be understand to be the head can sanction or approve everything that he may do under the influence of excitement in this body i will close by say that if he really wish glory and to be regard as the great liberator of the black -- if he wish to be particularly distinguish in this cause of emancipation as it be call -- let he instead of remain here in the senate of the united state or instead of secrete himself in some dark corner of new hampshire where he may possibly escape the just indignation of good man throughout this republic -- let he visit the good state of mississippus in which i have the honor to reside and no doubt he will be receive with such shout of joy as have rarely mark the reception of any individual in this day and generation i invite he there and will tell he beforehand in all honesty that he could not go ten mile into the interior before he would grace one of the tallest tree in the forest with a rope around he neck with the approbation of every virtuous and patriotic citizen and that if necessary i should myself assist in the operation mr hale 's reply be equally characteristic : the honorable senator invite I to visit the state of mississippus and kindly inform I that he would be one of those who would act the assassin and put a end to my career he would aid in bring I to public execution -- no death by a mob well in return for he hospitable invitation i can only express the desire that he would penetrate into some of the dark corner of new hampshire and if he do i be much mistaken if he would not find that the people in that benighted region would be very happy to listen to he argument and engage in a intellectual conflict with he in which the truth might be elicit i think however that the announcement which the honorable senator have make on this floor of the fate which await so humble a individual as myself in the state of mississippus must convince every one of the propriety of the high eulogium which he pronounce upon she the other day when he speak of the high position which she occupy among the state of this confederacy -- but enough of this personal matter -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : the follow paragraph which have recently be go the round of the newspaper will serve to show the sort of manners which prevail in the state so fitly represent by mr foote and how these southern ruffian experience in they own family the natural effect of the blood-thirsty sentiment which they so freely avow : the death of mr carneal -- the vicksburg _ sentinel _ of the 13th ult give the follow account of the shooting of mr thoma carneal son-in-law of governor foote : we have abstain thus long from give any notice of the sad affair which result in the death of mr thoma carneal the son-in-law of the governor of we state that we might get the particulars it seem that the steamer ec watkin with mr carneal as a passenger land at or near the plantation of judge jame in washington county mr carneal have hear that the judge be a extremely brutal man to he slave and be likewise excite with liquor and upon the judge invite he and other to take a drink with he carneal reply that he would not drink with a man who abuse he negro this the judge resent as a insult and high word ensue the company take they drink however all but mr carneal who go out upon the bow of the boat and take a seat where he be seek by judge jame who desire satisfaction for the insult carneal refuse to make any and ask the old gentleman if any of he son would resent the insult if he be to slap he in the mouth to which the judge reply that he would do it himself if he son would not whereupon mr carneal strike he in the month with the back of he hand the judge resent it by strike he across the head with a cane which stun mr carneal very much cause the blood to run freely from the wound as soon as carneal recover from the wound he draw a bowie-knife and attack the judge with it inflict several wound upon he person some of which be think to be mortal some gentleman in endeavor to separate the combatant be wound by carneal when judge jame arrive at he house bleeding and in a die state as be think he son seize a double-barrelled gun load it heavily with large shot gallop to where the boat be hitch he horse and deliberately raise he gun to shoot carneal who be sit upon a cotton-bale mr jame be warn not to fire as carneal be unarmed and he might kill some innocent person he take he gun from he shoulder raise it again and fire both barrel in succession killing carneal instantly it be a sad affair and carneal leave besides numerous friend a most interesting and accomplished widow to bewail he tragical end -rrb- such be the savage character of the debate that even mr calhoun who be not generally discourteous finding himself rather hard press by some of mr hale 's argument excuse himself from a answer on the ground that mr hale be a maniac the slave-holders set upon mr hale with all they force but though they succeed in vote down he bill it be generally agree and anybody may see by the report that he have altogether the best of the argument mr palfrey 's resolution be also lose but the boldness with which gidding and other avow they opinion and the freedom of speech which they use on the subject of slavery afford abundant proof that the gagging system which have prevail so long in congress have come at last to a end these movement though the proposition of messr hale and palfrey be vote down be not without they effect the common council of washington appoint a act mayor in place of the regular mayor who be sick president polk send a intimation to the clerk of the department some of whom have be active in the mob that they have better mind they own business and stay at home something be say about marine from the navy-yard and from that time the riotous spirit begin to subside meanwhile the unfortunate people who have attempt to escape in the pearl have to pay the penalty of they love of freedom a large number of they as they be take out of jail by the person who claim to be they owner be hand over to the slave-trader the following account of the departure of a portion of these victim for the southern market be give in a letter which appear at the time in several northern newspaper : _ washington April _ 22 1848 last evening as i be pass the railroad dpt i see a large number of color people gather round one of the car and from manifestation of grief among some of they i be induce to draw near and ascertain the cause of it i find in the car towards which they be so eagerly gaze about fifty color people some of whom be nearly as white as myself a majority of they be of the number who attempt to gain they liberty last week about half of they be female a few of whom have but a slight tinge of african blood in they vein and be finely form and beautiful the man be iron together and the whole group look sad and dejected at each end of the car stand two ruffianly-looking personage with large cane in they hand and if they countenance be a index of they heart they be the very impersonation of hardened villany itself in the middle of the car stand the notorious slave-dealer of baltimore slatter who i learn be a member of the methodist church ` in good and regular standing ' he have purchase the man and woman around he and be take he departure for georgium while observe this old gray-headed villain -- this dealer in the body and soul of man -- the chaplain of the senate enter the car -- a methodist brother -- and take he brother slatter by the hand chat with he for some time and seem to view the heart-rending scene before he with as little concern as we should look upon cattle i know not whether he come with a view to sanctify the act and pronounce a parting blessing but this i do know that he justify slavery and denounce anti-slavery effort as bitterly as do the most hardened slave-dealer a presbyterian minister who own one of the fugitive be the first to strike a bargain with slatter and make merchandise of god 's image and many of these poor victim thus manacle and destine for the southern market be regular member of the african methodist church of this city i do not hear whether they be permit to get letter of dismission from the church and of ` recommendation to any church where god in he providence might cast they lot ' probably a certificate from slatter to the effect that they be christian will answer every purpose no doubt he will demand a good price for slave of this character perhaps brother slicer furnish he with testimonial of they religious character to help they sale in georgium i understand that he be accustom to preach to they here and especially to urge upon they obedience to they master some of the color people outside as well as in the car be weep most bitterly i learn that many family be separate wife be there to take leave of they husband and husband of they wife child of they parent brother and sister shake hand perhaps for the last time friend parting with friend and the tenderest tie of humanity sunder at the single bid of the inhuman slave-broker before they a husband in the meridian of life beg to see the partner of he bosom he protest that she be free -- that she have free papers and be tear from he and shut up in the jail he clamber up to one of the window of the car to see he wife and as she be reach forward she hand to he the black-hearted villain slatter order he down he do not obey the husband and wife with tear stream down they cheek beseech he to let they converse for a moment but no a monster more hideous hardened and savage than the blackest spirit of the pit knock he down from the car and order he away the bystander could hardly restrain themselves from lay violent hand upon the brute this be but a faint description of that scene which take place within a few rod of the capitol under _ enactment _ recognize by congress o what a revolting scene to a feeling heart and what a retribution await the actor will not these wailing of anguish reach the ear of the most high ` vengeance be mine i will repay saith the lord ' of those send off at this time several through the generosity of charitable person at the north be subsequently redeem among whom be the edmundson girl of whom a account be give in the key to uncle tom 's cabin from one of the woman who be not sell but retain at washington i receive a mark of kindness and remembrance for which i feel very grateful she obtain admission to the jail the Sunday after we committal to see some of she late fellow-passenger still confine there and as she pass the passage in which i be confine she call to I and hand a bible through the grating i be happy to be able to add that she have since upon a second trial succeed in effect she escape and that she be now a free woman the great excitement which we attempt at emancipation have produce at washington and the rage and fury exhibit against we have the effect to draw attention to we case and to secure we sympathy and assistance on the part of person wholly unknown to we a public meeting be hold in faneuil hall in boston on the 25th of April at which a committee be appoint consist of samuel may samuel g howe samuel e sewell richard hildreth robert morris jr franci jackson elizur wright joseph southwick walter chan jw browne henry i bowditch william f channing joshua p blanchard and charle list authorize to employ counsel and to collect money for the purpose of secure to we a fair trial of which without some interference from abroad the exist state of public feeling in the district of columbium seem to afford little prospect a correspondence be open by this committee with the hon horace mann then a representative in congress from the state of massachusett with ex-governor seward of new york with salmon p chase esq of ohio and with gen fessenden of maine all of whom volunteer they gratuitous service should they be need a moderate subscription be promptly obtain the larger part of it as i be inform through the liberality of gerrit smith now a representative in congress from new york whose large pecuniary contribution to all philanthropic object as well as he zealous effort in the same direction both with the tongue and the pen have make he so conspicuous he have indeed a unique way of spend he large fortune without precedent at least in this country and not likely to find many imitator the committee be thus put in fund depute mr hildreth one of the member of it to proceed to washington to make the necessary arrangement he arrive there toward the end of the month of may by which time the public excitement against we or at least the exterior sign of it have a good deal subside but we be still treat with much rigor be keep lock up in we cell deny the use of the passage and not allow to see anybody except when once in a while mr gidding or mr hall find a access to we but even then we be not allow to hold any conversation except in the presence of the jailer it may well be imagine that the news of my capture and imprisonment and of the danger in which i seem to be have throw my family into great distress i also have suffer exceedingly on they account several of the child be yet too young to shift for themselves but i be presently relieve by the information which i receive before long that during my imprisonment my family would be provide for warm remonstrance have be make to the judge of the criminal court by mr hall against the attempt to exclude we from communication with we friend -- a liberty freely grant to all other prisoner the judge decline to interfere but mr mann have agree to act as we counsel be thenceforth freely admit to interview with we without the presence of any keeper book and newspaper be furnish I by friend out of door i presently obtain a mattress and the liberty of provide myself with better food than the jail allow i continue to suffer a good deal of annoyance from the capricious insolence and tyranny of the marshal robert wallace but i intend to go more at length into the detail of my prison experience after have first dispose of the legal proceedings against we the feeling against I be no doubt greatly increase by the failure of the effort repeatedly make to induce I to give up the name of those who have coperated with I and to turn states-evidence against they there be a certain mr taylor from boston i believe then in washington the inventor of a submarine armor for diving purpose i have formerly be well acquaint with he and at a time when no friend of mine be allow access to I he make I repeat visit at the jail at the request as he say of the district attorney to induce I to make a full disclosure in which case it be intimate i should be let off very easy as mr taylor do not prevail with I one of the jailer afterwards assure I that he be authorize to promise I a thousand dollar in case i would become a witness against those concern with I as i turn a deaf ear to all these proposition the resolution seem to be take to make I and sayre and even english suffer in a way to be a warn to all similar offender the law under which we be to be try be those of the state of maryland as they stand previous to the year 1800 these law have be temporarily continue in force over that part of the district cede by maryland -lrb- the whole of the present district -rrb- at the time that the jurisdiction of the unite spate commence and question of more general interest and the embarrassment grow out of the existence of slavery have defeat all attempt at a revise code these same old law of maryland still remain in force though modify in some respects by act of congress in a act of maryland pass in the year 1796 and in force in the district there be a section which seem to have be intend for precisely such case as ours it provide that any person or person who shall hereafter be convict of give a pass to any slave or person hold to service or shall be find to assist by advice donation or loan or otherwise the transporting of any slave or any person hold to service from this state or by any other unlawful means deprive a master or owner of the service of he slave or person hold to service for every such offence the party aggrieved shall recover damages in a action on the case against such offender or offender and such offender or offender shall also be liable upon indictment and conviction upon verdict confession or otherwise in this state in any county court where such offence shall happen to be fine a sum not exceed two hundred dollar at the discretion of the court one-half to the use of the master or owner of such slave the other half to the county school if there be any if there be no such school to the use of the county accordingly the grand jury under the instruction of the district attorney find seventy-four indictment against each of we prisoner base on this act one for each of the slave find on board the vessel two except who be runaway from virginium and the name of they master not know as it would have be possible to have fine we about fifteen thousand dollar apiece upon these indictment besides cost and as by the law of the district there be no method of discharge prisoner from jail who be unable to pay a fine except by a executive pardon one would have think that this might have satisfy but the idea that we should escape with a fine though we might be keep in prison for life from inability to pay it be very unsatisfactory it be desire to make we out guilty of a penitentiary offence at the least and for that purpose recourse be have to a old forget act of maryland pass in the year 1737 the fourth section of which provide that any person or person who after the say tenth day of September -lrb- 1737 -rrb- shall steal any ship sloop or other vessel whatsoever out of any place within the body of any county within this province of seventeen foot or upward by the keel and shall carry the same ten mile or upward from the place whence it shall be steal _ or who shall steal any negro or other slave _ or who shall counsel hire aid abet or command any person or person to commit the say offence or who shall be accessory to the say offence and shall be thereof legally convict as aforesaid or outlaw or who shall obstinately or of malice stand mute or peremptorily challenge above twenty shall suffer death as a felon or felon and be exclude the benefit of the clergy they would have be delighted no doubt to hang we under this act but that they could not do as congress by a act pass in 1831 have change the punishment of death inflict by the old maryland statute -lrb- except in certain case specially provide for -rrb- into confinement in the penitentiary for not less than twenty year to make sure of we at all event not less than forty-one separate indictment -lrb- that be the number of the pretended owner -rrb- be find against each of we for steal slave we counsel afterwards make some complaint of this great number of indictment when two against each of we include all the separate charge in different count would have answer as well it be even suggest that the fact that a fee of ten dollar be chargeable upon each indictment toward the five-thousand-dollar salary of the district attorney might have something to do with this large number but the district attorney deny very strenuously be influence by any such motive maintain in the face of authority produce against he that this great number be necessary he think it safest i suppose instead of a single jury on each charge against each of we to have the chance of a much greater number and the advantage besides of repeat opportunity of correct such blunder mistake and neglect as the prisoner 's counsel might point out on the 6th of July i be arraign in the criminal court judge crawford preside on one of the larceny indictment to which i plead not guilty whereupon my counsel messr hall and mann move the court for a continuance till the next term allege the prevail public excitement and the want of time to prepare the defense and to procure additional counsel but the judge could only be persuade and that with difficulty to delay the trial for eighteen day when this unexpected information be communicate to the committee at boston a correspondence be open by telegraph with messr seward chase and fessenden but governor seward have a legal engagement at baltimore on the very day appoint for the commencement of the trial and the other two gentleman have indispensable engagement in the court of ohio and maine under these circumstance as mr hall be not willing to take the responsibility of act as counsel in the case and as it seem necessary to have some one familiar with the local practice the boston committee retain the service of jm carlisle esq of the washington bar and mr hildreth again proceed to washington to give he assistance just as the trial be about to commence mr carlisle be take sick the judge be with great difficulty prevail upon to grant a further delay of three day this delay be very warmly oppose not only by the district attorney but by the same mr radcliff whom we have see figure as chairman of the mob-committee to wait on dr bailey and who have be retain at a expense of two hundred dollar by the friend of english as counsel for he they think it safest not to have he defense mix up in any way with that of myself and sayre before the three day be out governor seward have finish he business in baltimore hasten to washington but as the rule of the court do not allow more than two counsel to speak on one side the other counsel be also fully prepare it be judge best to proceed as have be arrange the trial accordingly commence on Thursday the 27th of July upon a indictment against I for steal two slave the property of one andrew houver the district attorney in open he case which he do in a very dogmatic overbearing and violent manner declare that this be no common affair the rights of property be violate by every larceny but this case be peculiar and enormous other kind of property be protect by they want of intelligence but the intelligence of this kind of property greatly diminish the security of its possession the jury therefore be to give such a construction to the law and the fact as to subject violator of it to the most serious consequence the fact which seem to be rely upon by the district attorney as establish the alleged larceny be -- that i have come to washington and staid from Monday to Saturday without any ostensible business when i have sail away with seventy-six slave on board conceal under the hatch and the hatch batten down and that when pursue and overtake the slave be find on board with provision enough for a month it be true that houver swear that the hatch be batten down when the pearl be overtake by the steamer but in this he be contradict by every other government witness this houver be accord to some of the other witness in a considerable state of excitement and at the time of the capture he address some violent language to I as already relate he have sell he two boy after they recapture to the slave-trader but have be oblige to buy they back again at a loss of one hundred dollar by the remonstrance of he wife who do not like to part with they as they have be raise in the family perhaps this circumstance make he the more inveterate against I as to the schooner be provision for a month the bill of the provision on board purchase in washington be produce on the trial and they be find to amount to three bushel of meal two hundred and six pound of pork and fifteen gallon of molasses which with a barrel of bread purchase in alexandrium would make rather a short month 's supply for seventy-nine person it be also prove by the government witness that the pearl be a mere bay-craft not fit to go to sea which do not agree very well with the idea hold out by the district attorney that i intend to run these negro off to the west indy and to sell they there but to make up for these deficiency william who act as the leader of the steamer expedition swear that i have say while on board that if i have get off with the negro i should have make a independent fortune but on the next trial he could not say whether it be i who tell he so or whether somebody else tell he that i have say so orme and craig with whom i principally converse and who go into long detail recollect nothing of the sort and it be very certain that as there be no foundation for it and no motive for such a statement on my part i never make it williams perhaps have hear somebody guess that if i have get off i have slave enough to make I independent and that guess of somebody else he perhaps remember or seem to remember as something say by I or report to have be say by I and such often in case produce great public excitement be the sort of evidence upon which man 's life or liberty be swear away the idea however of a intention to run the negro off for sale seem principally to rest on the testimony of a certain captain baker who have navigate the steamer by which we be capture at the mouth of the potomac and who see as he be cross over to coan river for wood a long black suspicious-looking brig with she sail loose lie at anchor under point lookout about three mile from we vessel this be prove by other witness to be a very common place of anchorage in fact that it be common for vessel wait for the wind or otherwise to anchor anywhere along the shore of the bay but captain baker think otherwise and he and the district attorney wish the jury to infer that this brig see by he under point lookout be a piratical craft lie ready to receive the negro on board and to carry they off to cuba besides houver william orme craig and baker another witness be call to testify as to the sale of the wood and my have be in washington the previous summer many question as to evidence arise and the examination of these witness consume about two day and a half in open the defense mr mann commence with some remark on the peculiarity of he position grow out of the unexpected urgency with which the case have be push to a trial and the public excitement which have be produce by it he also allude to the hardship of find against I such a multiplicity of indictment -- for what individual however innocent could stand up against such a accumulate series of prosecution back by all the force of the nation some observation on the cost thus unnecessarily accumulate and in particular on the district attorney 's ten-dollar fee produce a great excitement and loud denial on the part of that officer mr mann then proceed to remark that in all criminal trial which he have ever before attend or hear of the prosecute officer have state and produce to the jury in he open the law allege to be violate as the district attorney have do nothing of that sort he must endeavor to do it for he mr mann then proceed to call the attention of the jury to the two law already quote upon which the two set of indictment be found of both these act charge against I -- the stealing of houver 's slave and the help they to escape from they master -- i could not be guilty the real question in this case be which have i do to make the act steal there must have be -- so mr mann maintain -- a take _ lucrus causa _ as the lawyer say that be a design on my part to appropriate these slave to my own use as my own property if the object be merely to help they to escape to a free state then the case plainly come under the other statute in go on to show how likely it be that the person on board the pearl might have desire and seek to escape independently of any solicitation or suggestion on my part mr mann allude to the meeting in honor of the french revolution already mention hold the very night of the arrival of the pearl at washington as he be proceed to read certain extract from the speech of senator foote on that occasion already quote and well calculate as he suggest to put idea of freedom and emancipation into the head of the slave he be suddenly interrupt by the judge when the follow curious dialogue occur : _ judge crawford _ -- a certain latitude be to be allow to counsel in this case but i can not permit any harangue against slavery to be deliver here _ carlisle -lrb- rise suddenly and step forward _ -rrb- -- i be sure you honor must be labor under some strange misapprehension bear and breed and expect to live and die in a slave-holding community and entertaining no idea different from those which commonly prevail here i have watch the course of my associate 's argument with the closest attention the point he be make i be sure be most pertinent to the case -- a point it would be cowardice in the prisoner 's counsel not to make and i must beg you honor to deliberate well before you undertake to stop the mouth of counsel and to take care that you have full constitutional warrant for do so _ judge crawford _ -- i can not permit a harangue against slavery mr mann proceed to explain the point at which he be aim he have read these extract from mr foote 's speech deliver to a miscellaneous collection of black and whites bond and free assemble before the _ union _ office as show to what exciting influence the slave of the district be expose independently of any particular pain take by anybody to make they discontented and with the same object in view he propose to read some further extract from other speech deliver on the same occasion _ district attorney _ -- if this matter be put in as evidence it must first be prove that such speech be deliver _ mann _ -- if the authenticity of the speech be deny i will call the honorable mr foote to prove it _ district attorney _ -- what newspaper be that from which the counsel read _ mann _ -lrb- _ hold it up _ -rrb- -- the washington _ union _ of April 19th and without further objection he proceed to read some further extract he conclude by urge upon the jury that this case be to be view merely as a attempt of certain slave to escape from they master and on my part a attempt to assist they in so do and therefore a case under the statute of 1796 punishable with fine and not a larceny as charge against I in this indictment several witness be call who have know I in philadelphium to testify as to my good character the district attorney be very anxious to get out of these witness whether they have never hear I speak of as a man likely to run away with slave and it do come out from one of they that from the tenor of my conversation it use sometimes to be talk over that one day or other it would heave up that i have help off some negro to a free state but these conversation the witness add be generally in a jest tone and another witness state that the charge of run off slave be a common joke among the waterman accord to the practice in the maryland criminal court -- and the same practice prevail in the district of columbium -- the judge do not address the jury at all after the evidence be all in the counsel before argue the case may call upon the judge to give to the jury instruction as to the law these instruction which be offer in write and argue by the counsel the judge can give or refuse as he see fit or can alter they to suit himself but any such refusal or alteration furnish ground for a bill of exception on which the case if a verdict be give against the prisoner may be carry by writ of error before the circuit court of the district for they revisal my counsel ask of the judge no less than fourteen instruction on different point of law ten of which the judge refuse to give and modify to suit himself several of these related to the true definition of theft or what it be that make a take larceny it be contend by my counsel and they ask the judge to instruct the jury that to convict I of larceny it must be prove that the take the slave on board the pearl be with the intent to convert they to my own use and to derive a gain from such conversion and that if they believe that the slave be receive on board with the design to help they to escape to a free state then the offence be not larceny but a violation of the statute of 1796 this instruction variously put be six time over ask of the judge and as often refuse he be no less anxious than the district attorney to convict I of larceny and send I to the penitentiary but have a vast deal more sense than the district attorney he see that the idea that i have carry off these negro to sell they again for my own profit be not tenable it be plain enough that my intention be to help they to escape the judge therefore who do not lack ingenuity go to work to twist the law so as if possible to bring my case within it even he do not venture to say that merely to assist slave to escape be steal steal he admit must be a take _ lucrus causa _ for the sake of gain but -- so he tell the jury in one of he instruction -- this desire of gain need not be to convert the article take to he -- the taker 's -- own use nor to obtain for the thief the value in money of the thing steal if the act be prompt by a desire to obtain for himself or another even other than the owner a money gain or any other induce advantage a dishonest gain then the act be a larceny and in another instruction he tell the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the prisoner before receive the slave on board imbue they mind with discontent persuade they to go with he and by corrupt influence and inducement cause they to come to he ship and then take and carry they down the river then the act be a larceny upon these instruction of the judge to which bill of exception be file by my counsel the case which have be already near a week on trial be argue to the jury the district attorney have the opening and the close and both my counsel have the privilege of speak for the follow sketch of the argument as well as of the legal point already note i be indebted to the note of mr hildreth take at the time : _ district attorney _ -- i shall endeavor to be very brief in the opening reserve myself till i know the grounds of defense it be the duty of the jury to give they verdict accord to the law and evidence and so far as i know public opinion there neither exist now nor have exist at any other time the slightest desire on the part of a single individual that the prisoner should have otherwise than a fair trial i think therefore the solemn warning by the prisoner 's counsel to the jury be wholly uncalled for there be no doubt a excitement out of door -- a natural excitement -- at such a amount of property snatch up at one fall swoop but be that to justify the suggestion to a jury of twelve honest man that they be not to act the part of a mob the learn counsel who open the case for the prisoner have allude to the disadvantage of he position from the fact that he be a stranger i acknowledge that disadvantage and i have attempt to remedy it and so have the court by extend towards he every possible courtesy the prisoner 's counsel seem to think i press this matter too hard but be i to sit coolly by and see the hard-earned property of the inhabitant of this district carry off and when the felon be bring into court not do my best to secure he conviction -lrb- the district attorney here go into a long and labor defense of the course he have take in prefer against the prisoner forty-one indictment for larceny and seventy-four other on the same state of fact for transportation he deny that the forty-one larceny of the property of different individual could be include in one indictment and declare that if the prisoner 's counsel would show the slightest authority for it he would give up the case after go on in this strain for a hour or more attack the opposite counsel and defend himself in what carlisle pronounce ` the most extraordinary opening argument he have ever hear in he life ' the district attorney come down at last to the fact of the case -rrb- in what position be the prisoner place by the evidence how be he introduce to the jury by he philadelphium friend these witness be examine as to he character and the substance of they testimony be that he be a man who would steal a negro if he get a chance he pass for honest otherwise but he say himself he would steal a negro to liberate he and the court say it make no difference whether he steal to liberate or steal to sell be catch in the act he acknowledge he guilt and say he be a deserter from he god -- a backslider -- a church-member one year -- the next in the potomac with a schooner steal seventy-four negro why say he take they for gain if he do not steal they why say he know he should end he day in a penitentiary why say if he get off with the negro he should have realize a independent fortune do he not know they be slave he charter the vessel to carry off negro and if they be free negro or he suppose they to be how be he to realize a independent fortune he be afraid of the excitement at washington why so if the negro be not slave there be the fact of they be under the hatch conceal in the hold of the vessel -- do not that prove he mean to steal they add to that the other fact of he leave at night he come here with a miserable load of wood give it away sell it for a note do not care about the wood want only to get it out have a longing for a cargo of negro the wood be a blind besides he lie about it -- would he have ever come back to collect he note but the prisoner 's counsel say the slave might have hear mr foote 's torch-light oration and so have be persuade to go a likely story they all start off i suppose run straight down to the vessel and get into the hold seventy-four negro all together but be not the vessel charter in philadelphium to carry off negro this show the excessive weakness of the defense and how do the slave behave after they be capture if they have be run away would they not have be downcast and dishearten would not they have say now we be take on the other hand accord to the testimony of major william on they way back they be laugh shout and eat molasses in large quantity nero fiddle when rome be burn but do not eat molasses what a transition from liberty to molasses then it be prove that the bulkhead between the cabin and the hold be knock down and that the slave go to drayton and ask if they should fight do not that show he authority over they -- that the slave be under he control and that he be the master-spirit it speak volume -lrb- here follow a long eulogy on the gallantry and humanity of the thirty-five captor one man do threaten a little but he be drunk -rrb- the substance of the law as lay down by the judge be this : if drayton come here to carry off these people and by machination prevail on they to go with he and know they be slave it make no difference whether he take they to liberate or take they to sell if he be to be pay for carry they away that be gain enough suppose a man be to take it into he head that the northern factory be very bad thing for the health of the factory-girl and be to go with a schooner for the purpose of liberating those poor devil by steal the spindle would not he be serve as this prisoner be serve here would they not exhaust the law-book to find the severest punishment there may be those carry so far by a miserable mistaken philanthropy as even to steal slave for the sake of set they at liberty but this prisoner say he do it for gain we might look upon he with some respect if in a manly style he insist on he right to liberate they but he avowedly steal for gain he lie about it besides even a jury of abolitionist would have no sympathy for such a man try he anyhow by the word of god -- by the rule of common honesty -- he would be convict anyhow he be present to the world at large as a rogue and a common thief and liar there can be no other conception of he he do it for dishonest gain the prisoner must be convict he can not escape there can be no manner of doubt as to he guilt i be at a loss without appear absurd in my own eye to conceive what kind of a defense can be make i have not the least sort of feeling against the wretch himself -- i desire a conviction from principle i have hear doctrine assert on this trial that strike directly at the rights and liberty of southern citizen i have hear counsel seek to establish principle that strike directly at the security of southern property i feel no desire that this man as a man should be convict but i do desire that all person incline to infringe on we rights of property should know that there be a law hero to punish they and i be happy that the law have be so clearly lay down by the court let it be know from maine to texa to earth 's widest limit that we have officer and jury to execute that law no matter by whom it may be violate _ mann _ -- for the prisoner -- regret to occupy any more of the jury 's time with this very protracted trial i mention some day since that the prisoner be liable under the indictment against he to eight hundred year imprisonment -- a term hardly to be serve out by methuselah himself but apart from any punishment if he hundred and twenty-five trial be to proceed at this rate the chance be he will die without ever reach they termination the district attorney have dwell at great length on what pass the other day and more than once he have pointedly refer to I in a tone and manner not to be mistaken i have endeavor to conduct this trial accord to the principle of law and to that standard i mean to come up my client though a prisoner at this bar have rights legal social human and upon those rights i mean to insist this be the first time in my life that i ever hear a prisoner on trial and before conviction denounce as a liar a thief a felon a wretch a rogue it be unjust to apply these term to any man on trial the law presume he to be innocent the feeling of the prisoner ought not to be thus outraged he be unfortunate he may be guilty that be the very point you be to try this prisoner be charge with steal two slave the property of andrew houver do he or not that point you be to try by the law and the evidence because you may esteem this a peculiarly valuable kind of property you be not to measure out in this case a peculiar kind of justice you have hear the evidence the law for the purpose of this trial you be to take from the judge but you be not to be lead away with the idea that you must convict this prisoner at any rate it be a well-established principle that it be better for a indefinite number of guilty man to escape than for one innocent man to be convict and punish and for the best of reason -- for to have the very machinery establish for the protection of right turn into a instrument for the infliction of wrong strike a more fatal blow at civil society than any number of unpunished private injury nor be there any danger that the prisoner will escape due punishment for any crime he may have commit besides this and forty other larceny indictment hang over he head there be seventy-four transportation indictment against he now he can not be guilty of both and which of these offence if either do the evidence against he prove who be this man look at he you see he have pass the meridian of life you have hear about he from he neighbor they pronounce he a fair upright moral man no suspicion hitherto be ever breathe against he honesty he be a professor of religion and so far as we know have walk in all the ordinance and command of the law blameless now in all case of doubt a fair and exemplary character especially in a elderly man be a great capital to begin with this prisoner may have be mistake in he view as to matter of human right but as to violate what he believe to be duty there be not the slightest evidence that such be he character but abundance to the contrary he be find under circumstance that make he amenable to the law let he be try -- i do not gainsay that but let he have the common sentiment of humanity extend toward he even if he be guilty the point urge against he with such earnestness -- i may say vehemence -- be not that he take the slave merely but that he take they with design to steal he confession be dwell upon state and overstate as you will recollect but consider under what circumstance these allege confession be make there be circumstance which make such statement very fallacious consider he excitement -- he state of health for it be in evidence that he have be out of health suffering with some disorder which require he head to be shave consider the armed man that surround he and the imminent peril in which he believe he life to be it be great injustice to brand he with the foul epithet of liar for any little discrepancy if such there be in statement make under such circumstance other matter have be force in of a most extraordinary character to prejudice he case in you eye it have be suggest -- the idea have be throw out again and again -- that under pretence of help they to freedom he mean to sell these negro this suggestion which outrun all reason and discretion be found on the simple fact of a brig see lie at anchor in a place of common anchorage suggest no suspicious appearance but as to which you be ask to infer that these seventy-six slave be to be transport into she and carry to cuba or elsewhere for sale what a monstrous imagination what a gross libel on that brig she officer she crew she owner all of whom be thus charge as kidnapper and pirate and all this baseless dream get up for the purpose of influence you mind against the prisoner it mark indeed with many other thing the style in which this prosecution be conduct take the law as lay down by the court and it be necessary for the government to prove if this indictment be to be sustain that the prisoner corrupt the mind of houver 's slave and induce and persuade they to go on board he vessel they be find on board the prisoner 's vessel no doubt but as to how they come there we have not a particle of evidence here be a gap a fatal gap in the government 's case by what second-sight be you to look into this void space and time and to say that drayton entice they to go on board -lrb- the counsel here read from 1 _ starkie on evidence _ 510 & c to the effect that the prosecution be bind by the evidence to exclude every hypothesis inconsistent with the prisoner 's guilt -rrb- now be it the only possible means of accounting for the presence of houver 's slave on board to suppose that this prisoner entice they might not somebody else have do it might they not have go without be entice at all we wish to call the slave themselves as witness but the law shut up they mouth can you without any evidence say that drayton entice they and that by no other means could they come onboard presumptive evidence as lay down in the book -- a acknowledged and unquestioned authority -- from which i have read ought to be equally strong with the evidence of one unimpeached witness swearing positively to the fact be you as sure that drayton entice those slave as if that fact have be positively swear to by one witness testify that he stand by and saw and hear it if you be not then under the law as lay down by the court you can not find he guilty _ Thursday aug _ 13 _ carlisle _ for the prisoner -- the sun under which we draw we breath the soil we tottle over in childhood the air we breathe the object that earliest attract we attention the whole system of thing with which we youth be surround impress firmly upon we idea and sentiment which cling to we to we latest breath and modify all we view i trust i be man enough always to remember this when i hear opinion express and view maintain by man educate under a system different from that prevail here no matter how contrary those view and opinion may be to my own it may surprise those of you who know I -- the moral atmosphere in which i have grow up and the opinion which i entertain -- but never have i feel so deep and hearty a interest in the defense of any case as in this this prisoner i never see till i come from a sick bed into this court when i meet he for the first time i have participate strongly in the feeling which in connection with he have be excite in this community as you well know i have and could have no sympathy with the motive by which he may be presume to have be actuate why then this sudden feeling in he behalf not i assure you from mercenary motive he acquittal or he condemnation will make no difference in the compensation i receive for my service the overpowering interest i feel in this case originate in the fact that it place at stake the reputation of this district and in some respects of the country itself of which this city be the political capital the counsel for the government have dwell with emphasis on the great amount and value of property place at hazard by this prisoner there be something however far more valuable than property -- a fair honorable impartial administration of justice and of the chivalrous race of the south it may be expect that they will do justice though the heaven fall god forbid that the world should point to this trial as a proof that we be so besotted by passion and interest that we can not discern the most obvious distinction and that on a slave question with a jury of slave-holder there be no possible chance of justice many i assure you will be ready to fasten this charge upon we it be my hope my ardent desire it be you swear duty that no step be take against this prisoner without full warrant of law and evidence the duty of defense i discharge with pleasure i could have desire that this prisoner might have be defend entirely by counsel resident in this district it would have be my pride to have show to the world that of we own mere motion we would do justice in any case no matter how delicate no matter how sore the point the prisoner have touch my learn friend the district attorney have allude to the courtesy which he and the court have extend to my associate in this cause i hope he do not plume himself upon that a gentleman of my associate 's learning ability unexceptionable deportment and high character among he own people must and will be treat with courtesy wherever he go but at the same time that he boast of he courtesy the district attorney take occasion to charge my associate with gross ignorance of the law he say the forty-one charge could not have be include in one indictment and offer to give up the case if we will produce a single authority to that effect it be easy to produce the authority -lrb- see 1 _ chitty _ cl indictment -rrb- but unfortunately the district attorney have make a promise which he can not fulfil the district attorney be mistake in this matter at the same time let I admit that in the management of this case he have display a ability beyond he year this be the first prosecution ever bring so far as we can discover on this slave-stealing statute either in this district or in maryland this statute of the existence of which few lawyer be aware -- i be sure i be not -- have be wake up after a slumber of more than a century and bring to bear upon my client it be you duty to go into the examination of this novel case temperately and carefully to take care that no man and no court upon review of the case shall be able to say that you verdict be not warrant by the evidence if the case be make out against the prisoner convict he but if not as you value the reputation of the district and you own soul beware how you give a verdict against he you be not a lynch-law court it be no part of you business to inquire whether the prisoner have do wrong and if so to punish he for it it be you sole business to inquire if he be guilty of this special charge set forth against he in this indictment of steal andrew houver 's two slave the law you be not expect to judge of to enlighten you on that matter we have pray instruction from the court and those instruction for the purpose of this trial be to be take as the law the question for you be do the evidence in this case bring the prisoner within the law as lay down by the court to bring he within that law you be not to go upon imagination but upon fact prove by witness and it seem to I you have a very plain duty before you this be not a thing do in a corner take care that you render such a verdict that you will not be ashamed to have it set forth in letter of light visible to all the world there be two offence establish by the statute of maryland between which in this case it become you duty to distinguish everything depend on these statute because without these statute neither act be a crime at common law there be no such offence as steal slave or transport slave now which of these two act be prove against this prisoner in some respects they be alike the carry the slave away the deprive the master of they service be common to both but to constitute the stealing of slave accord to the law as lay down by the court there must be something more yet there must be a corruption of the mind of the slave and a seduce they to leave they master ' service and do not this open a plain path for this prisoner out of the danger of this prosecution where be the least evidence that the prisoner seduce these slave and induce they to leave they master have the district attorney with all he zeal point out a single particle of evidence of that sort have he do anything to take this case out of the transportation statute and to convert it into a case of steal he have to be sure indulge in some very harsh epithet apply to this prisoner -- epithet very similar to those which lord coke indulge in on the trial of sir walter raleigh and which draw out on the part of that prisoner a memorable retort my client be not a raleigh but neither i must be permit to say be the district attorney a lord coke i should be sorry to have it go abroad that we can not try a man for a offence of this sort without call he a liar a rogue a wretch -lrb- the district attorney here interrupt with a good deal of warmth he insist that he do not address the prisoner but the jury and that it be he right to call the attention of the jury to the evidence prove the prisoner to be a liar rogue and wretch -rrb- _ carlisle _ -- i do not dispute the learn gentleman 's right it be a matter of taste but with you gentleman of the jury these harsh epithet be not to make the difference of a hair you be to look at the evidence and where be the evidence that the prisoner seduce and entice these slave it may happen to any man to have a runaway slave in he premise and even in he employment it happen to I to have in my employ a runaway -- one of the best servant by the way i ever have he tell I he be free and i employ he as such if i have happen to have take he to baltimore there would have be a complete similitude to the case at bar and accord to the district attorney 's logic i might have be indict for steal because i have he with I i be to be presume to have entice he from he master as to the particular circumstance under which he come into my employment i might have be wholly unable to show they be it not possible to suppose a great number of circumstance under which these slave of houver leave they master 's service and come on board the pearl without any agency on the part of this prisoner now the government might positively disprove and exclude forty such supposition but so long as one remain which be not exclude you can not find a verdict of conviction the government be to prove that the prisoner entice and seduce these negro and you have no right to presume he do so unless every other possible explanation of the case be positively exclude by the testimony be it so extravagant a supposition that mr foote 's speech and the other torch-light speech heretofore allude to hear by these slave or communicate to they might have so work upon they mind as to induce they to leave they master i do not say that they have any right to suppose that these declamation about universal emancipation have any reference to they i be a southern man and i hold to the southern doctrine i admit that there be no inconsistency between perfect civil liberty and hold people of another race in domestic servitude but then it be natural that these people should overlook this distinction however obvious and important nor do they lack wit to apply these speech to they own case or interest in such matter i myself have a slave as quick to see distinction as i be and who would have make a better lawyer if he have have the same advantage it come out the other day in a trial in this court that the color people have debating-society among themselves it be a assault and battery case one of the disputant in the heat of the argument strike the other but then they have precedent for that in the house of representative be it a impossible or improbable or a disproved supposition that a number of slave have agree together to desert they master or have concerted such a plan with somebody here drayton be employ to come and take they away and that he receive they on board without ever have see one of they if he confession be to be take at all they be to be take together and do they not tend to prove such a state of fact drayton say he be hire to come here -- that he be to be pay for take they away do that look as if he seduce they -lrb- the counsel here comment at length on drayton 's statement for the purpose of show that they tend to prove nothing more than a transportation for hire and he throw no little ridicule on the ` phantom ship ' which the district attorney have conjure up in he opening of the case but which in he late speech he have wholly overlook -rrb- but even should you find that drayton seduce these slave to leave they master to make out a case of larceny you must be satisfy that he take they into he possession now what be possession of a slave not merely be in company with he if i ride in a hack i be not in possession of the driver possession of a slave be dominion and control and where be the slightest evidence that this prisoner claim any dominion or control over these slave the whole question in this case be be these slave steal or be they run away with the prisoner 's assistance the mere fact of they be in the prisoner 's company throw no light whatever on this matter the great point however in this case be this -- by the judge 's instruction enticement must be prove shall the record of this trial go forth to the world show that you have find a fact of which there be no evidence i believe in my conscience there be a gap in this evidence not to be fill up except by passion and prejudice if that be so i hope there be no one so ungenerous so little of a true southerner as to blame I for my zeal in this case or not to rejoice in a verdict of acquittal it be bad enough that stranger should have get up a mob in this district in relation to this matter it would however be a million time worse if jury can not be find here cool and dispassionate enough to render impartial verdict _ district attorney _ -- i hope gentleman of the jury you will rise above all out-of-door influence make yourselve abolitionist if you can but look at the fact of the case and look at those fact be it necessary for I to open my lip in reply in a case like this sustain by such direct testimony such overwhelming proof i defy any man -- however crazy on the subject of slavery unless he be blind by some film of interest -- to hesitate a moment as to he conclusion -lrb- the district attorney here proceed at great length and with a great air of offended dignity to complain of have be school and advise by the prisoner 's counsel and to justify the use of the foul epithet he have bestow on the prisoner -rrb- this be not a place for parlor talk i have choose the english word that convey my meaning most distinctly it be all very well for the prisoner 's counsel to smooth thing over but be i instead of call he a liar to say he tell a fib when i call he a thief and a felon do i go beyond the charge of the grand jury in the indictment if this be step over the limit of propriety in all similar case i shall do the same i do not intend to blackguard the prisoner -- i do not delight in use these epithet my heart be not lock up i be no jack ketch prosecute criminal for ten dollar a head i sympathize with the wretch bring here but when i choose to call they by they proper name i be not to be accuse of bandy epithet -lrb- the district attorney then proceed also at great length and in a high key to justify he hundred and twenty-five indictment against the prisoner and to clear himself from the imputation of mercenary motive on the ground that the business of the year independently of these indictment would furnish the utmost amount to which he be entitle he next refer to the matter of the brig testify to by captain baker which have be make the occasion of much ridicule by the prisoner 's counsel part of the evidence which he have rely on in connection with the brig have be rule out and the law as lay down by the court accord to which take to liberate be the same as take to steal have make it unnecessary for he so he say to dwell on this part of the case yet he now proceed to argue at great length from the testimony in the case that there must have be a connection between the brig and the schooner that as the schooner be confessedly unseaworthy and could not have go out of the bay it must have be the intention to put the slave on board the brig and to carry they off to cuba or elsewhere and sell they the testimony to this effect he pronounce conclusive -rrb- the united state -lrb- say the district attorney -rrb- have lay before you the clearest possible case i have just go through a pretty long term of this court i see several familiar face on the jury and i rely on you intelligence in fact the only point of the defense be that the united state have offer no proof that drayton seduce and entice these slave to come on board the pearl and that the prisoner 's counsel be pleased to call a gap a chasm which they say you can not fill up it be the same gap which occur in every larceny case where can the government produce positive testimony to the take that be do secretly in the dark and be to be presume from circumstance a man be find go off with a bag of chicken -- you chicken be you go to presume that the chicken run into he bag of they own accord and without he agency a man be find ride you horse be you to presume that the horse come to he of its own accord and yet horse love liberty -- they love to kick up they heel and run yet this would be just as sensible as to suppose that these slave come on board drayton 's vessel without he direct agency he come here from philadelphium for they they be find on board he vessel drayton say he would steal a negro if he could be not that enough then he be here some month before with a oyster-boat pretend to sell oyster he pretend that he come for he health likely story indeed i should like to see the doctor who would recommend a patient to come here in the fall of the year when the fever and ague be so thick in the marsh that you can cut it with a knife cruise about eat and sell oyster at that time of the year for he health nonsense he be here at that very time hatching and contrive that these very negro should go on board the pearl but the prisoner 's counsel say he might have be employ by other simply to carry they away who could have employ he but abolitionist and do he not say he have no sympathy with abolitionist so much for that hypothesis then he in fact plead guilty -- he say he expect to die in the penitentiary do not you think he ought to if there be any chasm here the prisoner must shed light upon it if he have employer who be they the prisoner 's counsel have say that he be not bind to tell and that the witness if summon here would not be compel to criminate themselves but shall this prisoner be allow to take advantage of he own wrong as to the metaphysics of the prisoner 's counsel about possession that be easily dispose of be not these slave find in drayton 's possession and do not he admit that he take they as to the caution give you about prejudice and passion i do not think they be necessary i have see no sort of excitement here since the first detection of this affair that would prevent the prisoner have a fair trial be there any crowd or excitement here the community will be satisfy with the verdict there be no question the party be guilty i never have anything to do with a case sustain by stronger evidence i do not ask you to give a illegal or perjured verdict take the law and the evidence and decide upon it nb -- the argument be now conclude and the jury about to go out some question arise whether the jury should have the write instruction of the court with they and some inquiry be make as to the practice one of the juror observe that in a case in which he have formerly act as juror the jury have the instruction with they and he proceed to tell a funny story about a bottle of rum tell by one of the juror on that occasion which story cause he to remember the fact it may be observe by the way that the proceedings of the united state criminal court for the district of columbium be not distinguish for any remarkable decorum or dignity the jury in this case be in constant intercourse during any little interval in the trial with the spectator outside the bar the case be give to the jury about three o'clock pm and the court after wait half a hour adjourn when the court meet at ten o'clock the next morning the jury be still out have remain together all night without be able to agree meanwhile the district attorney proceed to try I on another indictment for steal three slave the property of one william h upperman as this trial be proceed about half-past two the jury in the first case come in and render a verdict of guilty they present rather a haggard appearance have be lock up for twenty-four hour and some of they be perhaps a little troubled in they conscience the jury it be understand have be divide from the begin four for acquittal and eight for conviction these four be all irishman and perhaps they do not consider it consistent with they personal safety and business interest to persist in disappointing the slave-holding public of that verdict which the district attorney have so imperiously demand the agreement it be understand have take place only a few moment before they come in and have be reach entirely on the strength of william ' testimony to my have say that have i get off i should have make a independent fortune now it be a curious coincidence that at the very moment that this agreement be thus take place william again on the stand as a witness on the second trial wish to take back what he have then swear to on the first trial state that he could not tell whether he have hear I say this or whether he have hear of my have say it from somebody else after the rendition of the verdict of the other jury the second case be again resume the evidence vary in only a few particulars from that which have be give in the first case there be in addition the testimony of upperman the pretended owner of the woman and she daughter one of fifteen the other nine year old whom i be charge in this indictment with steal this man swear with no less alacrity and with no less falsehood than houver have do before he he state that about half-past ten of that same night that the pearl leave washington while he be fasten up he house he see a man standing on the side-walk opposite he door and observe he for some time not long after have go to bed he hear a noise of somebody come down stair and call out he be answer by he slave-woman who be just then go off though he have no suspicion of it at the time that man standing on the side-walk he pretend to recognize as I he be perfectly certain of it beyond all doubt and question the object of this testimony be to lead to a conclusion of enticement or persuasion on my part and so to bring the case within one of the judge 's instruction already state on a subsequent trial upperman be still more certain if possible that i be the man but he be entirely mistake in say so he house be on pennsylvanium avenue more than a mile from where the pearl lay and i be not within a mile of it that night i dare say upperman be sincere enough he be one of you positive sort of man but he case like that of houver show that man in a passion will sometimes fall into blunder i have reason to believe that after the trial be over upperman become satisfied of he error the first trial have consume a week the second one last four day the judge lay down the same law as before and similar exception be take by my counsel the jury again remain out all night be long divide -- nine for conviction to three for acquittal but on the morning of August 9th they come in with a verdict of guilty satisfied for the present with these two verdict against I the district attorney now propose to pass over the rest of my case and to proceed to try sayre my counsel object that have be force to proceed against my remonstrance i be here ready for trial and they insist that all my case should be now dispose of they do not prevail however and the district attorney proceed to try sayre on a indictment for steal the same two slave of houver in addition to the former witness against I english be now put upon the stand the district attorney have first enter _ nolle prosequus _ upon the hundred and fifteen indictment against he but he could state nothing except the circumstance of he connection with the affair and the come on board of the passenger on Saturday night as i have already related they on the other hand the phantom brig story of which the district attorney have make so great a handle in the two case against I be now rule out on the ground that the brig could not be bring into the case till some connection have first be show between she and the pearl the trial last three day the district attorney press for a conviction with no less violence than he have do in my case assure the jury that if they do not convict there be a end of the security of slave property but sayre have several advantage over I my two jury have be citizen of washington several of they belong to a class of loafer who frequent the court for the sake of the fee to be get as juryman some complaint have be make of this the officer have be send to georgetown and the country district and the present jury be draw from those quarter then again i be regard as the main culprit -- the only one in the secret of the transaction and as i be already convict the feeling against sayre be much lessen in fact the jury in he case after a absence of half a hour return a verdict of not guilty the district attorney greatly surprised and vexed proceed to try sayre on another indictment this trial last three day and a half but in spite of the effort of the district attorney who be more positive longer and louder than ever the jury in ten minute return a verdict of not guilty the trial have now continue through nearly four week of very hot weather and both side be pretty well wear out vex at the two last verdict the district attorney threaten to give up sayre on a requisition from virginium which be say to have be lodge for we some of the alleged slave belong there and we have be there shortly before finally it be agree that verdict should be take against sayre in the seventy-four transportation case he to have the advantage of carry the point of law before the circuit court and the remain larceny indictment against he to be discontinue thus end the first legal campaign english be discharge altogether without trial sayre have get rid of the charge of larceny i have be find guilty on two indictment for steal upon which judge crawford sentence I to twenty year imprisonment in the penitentiary while sayre on seventy-four indictment for assist the escape of slave be sentence to a fine on each indictment of one hundred and fifty dollar and cost amount altogether to seven thousand four hundred dollar but from these judgment a appeal have be take to the circuit court and meanwhile sayre and i remain in prison as before the hearing before the circuit court come on the 26th of November that court consist of chief-justice cranch a able and upright judge but very old and infirm and judge morrell and dunlap the latter of whom claim to be the owner of two of the negro find on board the pearl my case be argue for I by messr hildreth carlisle and mann the district attorney who be much better fit to bawl to a jury than to argue before a court have retain at the expense of the united state the assistance of mr bradley one of the ablest lawyer of the district the argument consume not less than three day many point be discuss but that on which the case turn be the definition of larceny it result in the allowance of several of my bill of exception the overturn of the law of judge crawford on the subject of larceny and the establishment by the circuit court of the doctrine on that subject contend for by my counsel but from this opinion judge dunlap dissent the case of sayre for want of time be postpone till the next term a new trial have be order in my two case everybody suppose that the charge of larceny would now be abandon as the circuit court have take away the only basis on which it could possibly rest but the zeal of the district attorney be not yet satisfied and no longer trust to he own unassisted effort he obtain -lrb- at the expense of the united state -rrb- the assistance of richard cox esq a old and very unscrupulous practitioner with whose aid he try the case over again in the criminal court the two trial last about fourteen day i be again defend by messr mann and carlisle and now with better success as the jury under the instruction which judge crawford find himself oblige to give and notwithstanding the desperate effort against I acquit I in both case almost without leave they seat finally the district attorney agree to abandon the remain larceny case if we would consent to verdict in the transportation case on the same term with those in the case of sayre this be do when judge crawford have the satisfaction of sentence I to fine and cost amount together to ten thousand and sixty dollar and to remain in prison until that amount be pay there be still a further hearing before the circuit court on the bill of exception to these transportation indictment my counsel think they have some good legal objection but the hearing unfortunately come on when judge cranch be absent from the bench and the other two judge overrule they by a strange construction of the law no criminal case except by accident can be carry before the supreme court of the united state otherwise the case against we would have be take there include the question of the legality of slavery in the district of columbium thus after a severe and expensive struggle i be save from the penitentiary but sayre and myself remain in the washington jail load with enormous fine which from we total inability to pay they would keep we there for life unless the president could be induce to pardon we and it be even question as i shall show presently whether he have any such power the jail of the district of columbium be under the charge of the marshal of the district that office when i be first commit to prison be fill by a mr hunter but he be sick at the time and die soon after when robert wallace be appoint this wallace be a virginian from the neighbor hood of alexandrium son of a doctor wallace from whom he have inherit a large property include many slave he have remove to tennessee and have set up cotton-planting there but fail in that business have return back with the small remnant of he property and polk provide for he by make he marshal it be not long before i find that he have a great spite against I it be in vain that i solicit from he the use of the passage the light which come into my cell be very faint and i could only read by sit on the floor with my back against the grate of the cell door but so far from aid I to read -- and it be the only method i have of pass my time -- wallace make repeat and vexatious attempt to keep I from receive newspaper i should very soon have die on the prison allowance the marshal be allow by the united state thirty-three cent per day for feed the prisoner for this money they receive two meal breakfast consist of one herr corn-bread and a dish of molasses and water very slightly flavor with coffee and for dinner corn-bread again with half a pound of the meanest sort of salted beef and a soup make of corn-meal stir into the pot-liquor this be the bill of fare day after day all the year round and as at the utmost such food can not cost more than eight or nine cent a day for each prisoner and as the average number be fifty the marshal must make a handsome profit the diet have be fix i suppose after the model of the slave allowance but congress after provide the means of feed the prisoner in a decent manner ought not to allow they to be starve for the benefit of the marshal such be the diet to which i be confine in the first day of my imprisonment but i soon contrived to make a friend of jake the old black cook of the prison who i could see as he come in to pour out my coffee evince a certain sympathy and respect for I through he agency i be able to purchase some more eatable food and indeed the surgeon of the jail allow I flour under the name of medicine it be impossible as he say for I to live on the prison diet wallace soon after he come into office find a small sum in my possession of about forty dollar take it from I he express a fear that i might corrupt old jake or somebody else -- especially as he find that i give jake my old newspaper -- and so escape from the prison but he leave the money in the hand of the jailer and allow I to draw it out a dollar at a time he presently turn out old jake and put in a slave-woman of he own as cook but she be better disposed towards I than she master and i find no difficulty in purchase with my own money and get she to prepare such food as i want i be able too after some six or eight week ' sleep on the stone floor of my cell to obtain some improvement in that particular and not for myself only but for all the other prisoner also the jailer be request by several person who come to see we to procure mattress for we at they expense and finally wallace as if out of pure shame procure a quantity of husk mattress for the use of the prisoner generally still we have no cot and be oblige to spread we mattress on the floor the allowance of clothing make to the prisoner who be confine without any means of support themselves correspond pretty well with the jail allowance of provision they receive shirt one at a time make of the very meanest kind of cotton cloth and of the very smallest dimension trousers of about equal quality and shoe it be say that the united state pay also for jacket and cap how that be i do not know but the prisoner never receive any the custody of the jail be intrust to a head jailer assist by four guard or turnkey one of whom act also as book-keeper of the personal treatment toward I of those in office at the time i be first committed i have no complaint to make the rigor of my confinement be indeed great but i be happy to say that it be not aggravate by any disposition on the part of these man to triumph over I or to trample upon I as they grow more acquaint with I they show they sense that i be not a ordinary criminal and treated I with many mark of consideration and even of regard and in one of they i find a true friend shortly after wallace come into office he make several change he be full of caprice and easily take offence from very small cause and of this the keeper as well as the prisoner have abundant experience the head jailer do he best to please behave in the most humble and submissive manner but all to no purpose he be discharge as be also the other one after another -- wallace undertaking to act as head jailer himself of wallace 's vexatious conduct towards I of he refusal to allow I to receive newspaper -- prohibit the under jailer to lend I even the baltimore _ sun _ of he accusation against I of bribe old jake whom he forbid the turnkey to allow to come near I of he keep I shut up in my cell and generally of a bitter spirit of angry malice against I -- i have abundant reason to complain during the weary fifteen month or more that i remain under he power but he subordinate though oblige to obey he order and to comply with he humor be far from be influence by he feeling even he favorite among the turnkey a person who pretty faithfully copy he conduct towards the other prisoner always behave very kindly towards I and even use to make a confidant of I by come to my cell to talk over he trouble but the person whose kind office and friendly sympathy do far more than those of any other to relieve the tediousness of my confinement and to keep my heart from sinking be mr wood there be no chaplain at the washington jail nor have congress so far as i be aware make any provision of any kind for the spiritual want or the moral and religious instruction of the inmate of it this great deficiency mr wood a man of a great heart though of very limited pecuniary means be then a clerk in the telegraph office have take it upon himself to supply so far as he could and for that purpose he be in the habit of visit the prison on sunday converse with the prisoner and furnish tract and book to such as be able and disposed to read he come to my cell or to the grate of the passage in which i be confine on the very first Sunday of my imprisonment and he readily promise at my request to furnish I with a bible though in that act of kindness he be anticipate by the color woman of whom i have already make mention who appear at my cell with a bible for I just after mr wood have leave it the kindness of mr wood 's heart and the sincerity of he sympathy be so apparent as to secure he the affectionate respect of all the prisoner to I he prove a very considerate and useful friend not only be i greatly indebted to he assistance in make known my necessity and those of my family to those dispose to relieve they but he cheerful and christian conversation serve to brighten many a dark hour and to dispel many gloomy feeling be all profess christian like my friend mr wood we should not hear so many denunciation as we now do of the church and complaint of she short-coming there be another person also whose kind attention to I i ought not to overlook this be mrs susannah ford a very respectable color woman who sell refreshment in the lobby of the court-house and who in the progress of the trial have evince a good deal of interest in the case as she often have boarder in the jail who like I could not live on the jail fare and whom she supply she be frequently there and she seldom come without bring with she some substantial token of she regard sayre and myself have look forward to the change of administration which result from the election of general taylor with considerable hope of advantage from it -- but for a considerable time this advantage be limit to a change in the marshal in whose custody we be the turn out of wallace give great satisfaction to everybody in the jail or connect with it except the turnkey who hold office by he appointment and who expect that he dismissal would be follow by they own the very day before the appointment of he successor come out i have be remonstrate with he against the cruelty of refuse I the use of the passage and i have even venture to hint that i hope he would do nothing which he would be ashamed to see speak of in the public print to which he reply g -- d d -- n the public print -- in that cell you will stay but in this he prove not much of a prophet the next day as soon as the news of he dismissal reach the jail the turnkey at once unlock my cell-door and admit I into the passage observe that the new marshal when he come to take possession should at least find I there this new marshal be mr robert wallach a native of the district very similar in name to he predecessor but very different in nature and from the time that he enter into office the extreme rigor hitherto exercise to I be a good deal abate one thing however i have to regret in the change which be the turn out of all the old guard with whom i be already well acquaint and the appointment of a new set one of these thus turn out -- the person to whom i have already refer to as the chief favorite of the late marshal -- make a desperate effort to retain he office but although he solicit and obtain certificate to the effect that he be and always have be a good whig he have to walk out with the other the new jailer appoint by wallach and three of the new guard or turnkey be very gentlemanly person and neither i nor the other prisoner have any reason to complain of the change of the fourth turnkey i can not say as much he be violent overbearing and tyrannical and he be frequently guilty of conduct towards the prisoner which make he very unfit to serve under such a marshal and ought to have cause he speedy removal but unfortunately the marshal be under some political obligation to he which make the turn he out not so easy a matter this person seem to have inherit all the feeling of hatred and dislike which the late marshal have entertain towards I and he do he best to annoy I in a variety of way though of course he power be limit by he subordinate position but although i gain considerably by the new-order of thing i soon find that it have also some annoying consequence under the old marshal either to make the imprisonment more disagreeable to I or from fear lest i should corrupt the other prisoner i have be keep in a sort of solitary confinement no other prisoner be place in the same passage this system be now altered and although my privacy be always so far respect that i be allow a cell by myself i often find myself with fellow-prisoner in the same passage from whose society it be impossible for I to derive either edification or pleasure i suffer a good deal from this cause but at length succeed in obtain a remedy or at least a partial one i be allow during the day-time the range of the debtor ' apartment a suite of spacious airy and comfortable room in which there be seldom more than one or two tenant i plead hard to be remove to these apartment altogether -- to be allow to sleep there as well as to pass the day there as it be merely for the non-payment of a sum of money that i be hold i think i have a right to be treat as a debtor but those apartment be so insecure that the keeper do not care to trust I there during the night by this change of quarter my condition be a good deal improve i not only have ample convenience for reading but i improve the opportunity to learn to write have only be able to sign my name when t be commit to the prison but a jail after all be a jail and i long and sigh to obtain my liberty and to enjoy again the society of my wife and child have it be wish to impress my mind in the strongest manner with the horror of slavery no better method could have be devise than this imprisonment in the washington jail i feel personally what it be to be restrain of my liberty and as many of the prisoner be runaway slave or slave commit at the request of they master i see a good deal of what slave be expose to of this i shall here give but a single instance wallace the marshal as i have already mention have two female slave the last remnant of the large slave-property which he have inherit from he father one of these be a young and very comely mulatto girl whom wallace have make he housekeeper and whom he seek to make also he concubine but as the girl already have a child by a young white man to whom she be attach she steadily repel all he advance not succeed by persuasion this scion of the aristocracy of the old dominion -- this virginian gentleman and marshal of the united state for the district of columbium -- shut the girl up in the jail of the district in hope of thus break she to he will and as she prove obstinate he finally sell she he then turn he eye on the other woman -- he property -- jemima we cook already the mother of three child but she set he at open defiance as she wish to be sell he have lose the greatest means of control she and as she openly threaten before all the keeper to tear every rag of clothing off he body if he dare lay he hand upon she he do not venture to brave she fury in most of the state if not in all of they certainly in all the free state there be no such thing as keep a man in prison for life merely for the non-payment of a fine which he have no means to pay the same spirit of humanity which have abolish the imprisonment of poor debtor at the caprice of they creditor have provide means for discharge after a short imprisonment person hold in prison for fine which they have no means of pay indeed what can be more unequal or unjust than to hold a poor man a prisoner for life for a offence which a rich man be allow to expiate by a small part of he superfluous wealth but this be one among many other barbarism which the existence of slavery in the district of columbium by prevent any systematic revision of the law have entail upon the capital of we model democracy there be as i have state no means by which sayre and myself could be discharge from prison except by pay we fine -lrb- which be totally out of the question -rrb- or by obtain a presidential pardon which for a long time seem equally hopeless there be indeed a peculiarity about we case such as might afford a plausible excuse for not extend to we any relief under the law of 1796 the sum impose upon we as fine be to go one half to the owner of the slave and the other half to the district and it be allege that although the president might remit the latter half he could not the other that same mr radcliff whom i have already have occasion to mention volunteer he service -- for a consideration -- to get over this difficulty in consequence of a handsome fee which he receive he undertake to obtain the consent of the owner of the slave to we discharge but have pocket the money he make so far as i could find very little progress in the business not have secure above five or six signer in answer to my repeat application he at length propose that my wife and youngest daughter should come on to washington to do the business which he have undertake and for which he have secure a handsome payment in advance they come on accordingly and by personal application succeed in obtain in all the signature of twenty-one out of forty-one the whole number the reception which they meet with from different party be very different show that there be among slave-holder as much variety of character as among other people some sign with alacrity say that as no slave have be lose i have be keep in jail too long already other require much urge other positively refuse some even add insult young franci dodge of georgetown would not sign though my life have depend upon it one want I hang and another tar and feathered one pious church-member lie on he death-bed as he suppose be persuade to sign but he afterwards draw back and nothing could prevail on he to put he name to the paper die or live he wholly refuse but the most curious case occur at alexandrium to which place my wife go to obtain the signature of a pious old lady who have be the claimant of a youngster find among the passenger of the pearl and who have be sell in consequence for the southern market the old lady it appear be still the owner of the boy 's mother who act as one of she domestic and if she be willing the old lady profess she readiness to sign the black woman be accordingly call in and the nature of my wife 's application state to she but with much positiveness and indignation she refuse to give she consent declare that my wife could as well do without she husband as she could do without she boy so imbruted and stupefy by slavery be this old woman that she seem to think the sell she boy away from she a perfectly humane christian and proper act while all she indignation be turn against I who have merely afford the boy a opportunity of secure he freedom i dare say they have persuade the old woman that i have entice the boy to run away whereas as i have already state i have never see he nor any other of the passenger till i find they on board as only twenty-one signer could be obtain the matter stand very much as it do before the attempt be make so long as president fillmore remain a candidate for relection there be little ground to expect from he a favorable consideration of my case i therefore feel sincerely thankful to the whig convention when they pass by mr fillmore and give the nomination to general scott mr fillmore be thus place in a position which enable he to listen to the dictate of reason justice and humanity my hope and those of my friend be greatly raise mr sumner the free democratic senator from massachusett have visit I in prison shortly after he arrival at washington and have evince from the begin a sincere and active sympathy for I some complaint be make against he in some anti-slavery papers because he do not present to the senate some petition in my behalf which have be forward to he care but mr sumner be of opinion and i entirely agree with he that if the object be to obtain my discharge from prison that object be to be accomplish not by agitate the matter in the senate but by private appeal to the equity and the conscience of the president nor do he think nor i either that my interest ought to be sacrifice for the opportunity to make a anti-slavery speech there be reason in everything and i think and he think too that i have be make enough of a martyr of already the case have be bring to the notice of the president he be no longer a candidate for relection could not fail to recognize the claim of sayre and myself to a discharge we have already be keep in jail upward of four year for a offence which the law have intend to punish by a trifling pecuniary fine nor be this all the earlier part of we confinement have be exceedingly rigorous and it have only be by the untiring effort of we friend and at a great expense to they that we have be save from fall victim to the conspiracy between the district attorney and judge crawford to send we to the penitentiary although my able and indefatigable counsel mr mann whose arduous labor and effort in my behalf i shall never forget and still less he friendly counsel and kind personal attention have receive nothing except i believe the partial reimbursement of he travel expense and although there be much other service gratuitously render in we case yet it have be necessary to pay pretty roundly for the service of mr carlisle and altogether the expenditure which have be incur to shield we from the effect of the conspiracy above mention far exceed any amount of fine which might have be reasonably impose under the indictment upon which we have be find guilty be not the enormous sum which judge crawford sentence we to pay a gross violation of the provision in the constitution of the united state against excessive fine any fine utterly beyond a man 's ability to pay and which operate to keep he a prisoner for life must be excessive or else that word have no meaning but though we case be a strong one there still remain a serious obstacle in the way in the idea that because half the fine be to go to the owner of the slave the president could not remit that half here be a point upon which mr sumner be able to assist we much more effectually than by make speech in the senate it be a point too involve in a good deal of difficulty for there be some english case which deny the power of pardon under such circumstance mr sumner find however by a laborious examination of the american case that a different view have be take in this country and he draw up and submit to the president a elaborate legal opinion in which the right of the executive to pardon we be very clearly make out this opinion the president refer to the attorney general a considerable time elapse before he find leisure to examine it but at last it obtain he sanction also information at length reach we -- the matter have be pend for two month or more -- that the president have sign we pardon it have yet however to pass through the office of the secretary for the interior and meanwhile we be not by any means free from anxiety the reader will perhaps recollect that among the other thing which the district attorney have hold over we head have be the threat to surrender we up to the authority of virginium on a requisition which it be allege they have make for we the story of this requisition have be repeat from time to time and a circumstance now occur which in seem to threaten we with something of the sort serve to revive all we apprehension mr stuart the secretary of the interior through whose office the pardon be to pass send word to the marshal that such a pardon have be sign and at the same time request he if it come that day into he hand not to act upon it till the next as this stuart be a virginian out apprehension be naturally excite of some movement from that quarter the pardon arrive about five o'clock that afternoon and immediately upon receive it the marshal tell we that he have no longer any hold upon we -- that we be free man and at liberty to go where we choose as we be prepare to leave the jail i observe that a gentleman a friend of the marshal whom i have often see there and who have always treat I with great courtesy hardly return my good-day and look at I as black as a thunder-cloud afterwards upon inquire of the jailer what the reason could be i learn that this gentleman who be a good deal of a politician be greatly alarmed and disturbed lest the act of the president in have pardon we should result in the defeat of the whig party -- and though willing enough that we should be release he do not like to have it do at the expense of he party and he own hope of obtain some good office the whig be defeat sure enough but whether because we be pardon -- though the idea be sufficiently nattering to my vanity -- be more than i shall venture to decide the black prisoner in the jail have nothing to hope or fear from the rise or fall of party yield freely to they friendly feeling and greet we departure with three cheer we leave the jail as privately as possible and proceed in a carriage to the house of a gentleman of the district where we be entertain at supper we imprisonment have last four year and four month lack seven day we do not feel safe however with that virginium requisition hang over we head so long as we remain in the district or anywhere on slave-holding ground and by the liberality of we friend a hack be procure for we to carry we that same night to baltimore there the next morning to take the car for philadelphium the night prove one of the darkest and stormiest which it have ever be my fate to encounter -- and i have see some bad weather in my time the rain fall in torrent and the road be only now and then visible by the flash of the lightning but we trusty driver persevere and in spite of all obstacle bring we to baltimore by the early dawn sayre proceed by the direct route to philadelphium have still some apprehension of pursuit and a requisition i take the route by harrisburg great be the satisfaction which i feel as the car cross the line from maryland into pennsylvanium it be like escape out of algier into a free and christian country i shall leave it to the reader to imagine the meeting between myself and my family they have receive notice of my come and be all wait to receive I if a man wish to realize the agony which we american slave-trade inflict in the separation of family let he personally feel that separation as i do let he pass four year in the washington jail when commit to the prison i be by no means well i have be a good deal out of health as appear from the evidence on the trial for two or three year before close confinement or indeed confinement of any sort do not agree with person of my temperament and i come out of the prison a good deal older and much more of a invalid than when i enter it the reader perhaps will inquire what good be gain by all these suffering of myself and my family -- what satisfaction i can have as it do not succeed in look back to a enterprise attend with so much risk and which involve I in so long and tedious a imprisonment the satisfaction that i have be this : what i do and what i attempt to do be my protest -- a protest which resound from one end of the union to the other and which i hope by the dissemination of this my narrative to renew and repeat it -- it be my protest against the infamous and atrocious doctrine that there can be any such thing as property in man we can only do accord to we power and the capacity gift and talent that we have other more fortunate than i may record they protest against this wicked doctrine more safely and comfortably for themselves than i do they may embody it in burn word and eloquent speech they may write it out in book they may preach it in sermon i could not do that i have as many thought as another but for want of education i lack the power to express they in speech or write i have not be able to put even this short narrative on paper without obtain the assistance of a friend i could not talk i could not write but i could act the humblest the most uneducated man can do that i do act and by my action i protest that i do not believe that there be or could be any such thing as a right of property in human being nobody in this country will admit for a moment that there can be any such thing as property in a white man the institution of slavery could not last for a day if the slave be all white but i do not see that because they complexion be different they be any the less man on that account the doctrine i hold to and which i desire to preach in a practical way be the doctrine of jefferson and madison that there can not be property in man -- no not even in black man and the rage exert against I on the part of the slave-holder grow entirely out of my preach that doctrine action as everybody know speak louder than word by virtue of my action proclaim my opinion on that subject i become at once powerless as i otherwise be elevated in the mind of the slave-holder to the same high level with mr gidding and mr hale who they could not help believe must have be my secret confederate if i have believe as the slave-holder do that man can be own if i have really attempt as they falsely and meanly charge I with do to steal have i actually seek to appropriate man as property to my own use have that be all do anybody imagine that i should ever have be pursue with such persevere enmity and personal virulence do they get up a debate in congress and a riot in the city of washington every time a theft be commit or attempt in the district it be purely because i be not a thief because in help man woman and child claim as chattel to escape i bear my testimony against rob human being of they liberty this be the very thing that excite the slave-holder against I just as a strong anti-slavery speech excite they against mr hale or mr gidding or mr mann or mr stunner those gentleman have word at command they can speak and can do good service by do so as for I it be impossible that i should ever be able to make myself hear in congress or by the nation at large except in the way of action the opportunity occur i do not hesitate to improve it nor have i ever yet see occasion to regret have do so end of the project
