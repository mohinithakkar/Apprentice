this be we time let we embrace it we democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of we own renewal there be nothing wrong with america that can not be cure by what be right with

before we must invest more in we own people in they job and in they future and at the same time cut we massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity it will not be easy it will require sacrifice but it can be do and do fairly not choose sacrifice for its own sake but for we own sake we must provide for we nation the way a family provide for its child we founder see themselves in the light of posterity we can do no less anyone who have ever watch a child 's eye wander into sleep know what posterity be posterity be the world to come the world for whom we hold we ideal from whom we have borrow we planet and to whom we bear sacred responsibility we must do what america do best offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all it be time to break the bad habit of expect something for nothing : from we government or from each other let we all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and we family but for we community and we country to renew america we must revitalize we democracy this beautiful capitol like every capitol since the dawn of civilization be often a place of intrigue and calculation powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who be in and who be out who be up and who be down forget those people whose toil and sweat send we here and pave we way american deserve better and in this city today there be people who want to do better and so i say to all of you here let we resolve to reform we politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people let we put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america let we resolve to make we government a place for what franklin roosevelt call bold persistent experimentation a government for we tomorrow not we yesterday let we give this capitol back to the people to whom it belong to renew america we must meet challenge abroad as well as at home there be no longer a clear division between what be foreign and what be domestic the world economy the world environment the world aid crisis the world arm race : they affect we all today as a old order pass
