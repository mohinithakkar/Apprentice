valley -- high-pressure steam-tug frolic -- slave-auction facetia the ill health of my wife occasion by long residence amid the sultry swamp of guiana compel I a few month ago to accompany she on a visit to the united state of america have take we passage in a ship to new orlean we find ourselves in fifteen day on the far-famed mississippus -- the father of water on gaze around we first feeling be one of awe to find ourselves actually ascend that majestic stream that great artery of the greatest valley in the world lead into the very heart of a continent the weather be very cold the tree on the river 's bank be leafless and the aspect of nature on every hand tell it be winter what a change but a fortnight before we be pant under a almost vertical sun we find the mississippus much narrower than we have anticipate in some place it be only about half a mile wide while below new orlean it never i should say exceed a mile in width this be remarkable since not less than fifty-seven large navigable river contribute to swell its water it be however very deep and even at the distance of 500 mile above new orlean be navigate by vessel of 300 ton nay at 1364 mile from its mouth it attain a average depth of fifteen foot in its course it water 2500 mile of country among the river that pour themselves into this immense stream be -- the missourus which have first traverse a space of 2000 mile the arkansa 1300 mile the red river 1000 mile and the ohio 700 mile unfortunately at the entrance of this noble river there be a bar call the balize so shallow as hitherto to have seriously interfere with the navigation of large and deeply-laden vessel even for the cotton trade a particular construction of ship have be find needful with a flatter bottom than usual in order to pass easily over this bar any effort to remove which the rapidity of the stream would render fruitless this circumstance with the want of harbor at the mouth of the mississippus have hitherto operate greatly against the trade with new orlean which be 110 mile up the river recently however a magnificent harbor have be discover between cat island and isle apitre within lake borgne and only ten mile from the coast of the mainland this new harbor easily accessible from the sea at all time contain a depth of water vary from thirty to fifty foot and be so protect on all side that vessel may ride with the greatest safety in the worst weather from this harbor to bayou on the mainland the distance be only twelve mile and from bayou to new orlean forty-six mile -- make altogether only fifty-eight mile from cat island harbor to new orlean whereas by the difficult and dangerous route of the mississippus the distance be 110 mile the importance and value of such a harbor it be difficult to over-estimate its beneficial effect on the future destiny of the great valley will be prodigious i have say the great valley and well it deserve the appellation it contain as many square mile with more tillable ground than the whole continent of europe it measure about 1341649 square mile and be therefore six time larger than france and this valley be as rich as it be extensive it be the fat valley never do human eye behold a finer soil or more luxuriant production the treasure beneath the surface be as precious as those above the lead and copper mine be among the best in the world iron and coal also abound building material of beauty and strength adapt to form cottage for the poor or palace for the rich be not want nature have here furnish in lavish profusion everything necessary for convert the wilderness into smile field stud with populous city but we be not yet within the great valley we be only at its entrance sailing up the father of water against the stream at the rate of four or five mile a hour it be usual for sailing-vessel to be tow by steam-tug to they destination but have a fair breeze and no tug at hand we be indebted to we sail alone the motion be exceedingly pleasant after the tossing we have have in the gulf of mexico the vessel glide smoothly along and new object present themselves continually on either hand my enjoyment of the scenery however be soon mar by a attack of fever and ague which send I below while i be down several steam-tug tow vessel down the river meet we they unearthly groan fill I with terror they noise be not that of puff -- puff -- puff -- puff like all the other steamer that i have ever hear but something compose of a groan a grunt and a growl -- deep-drawn as from the very cavern of vulcan and that at awfully-solemn interval -- grunt -- grunt -- grunt -- grunt this peculiarity i be tell arise from they high-pressure engine the sound thus explain bring to my recollection all the dreadful story of boiler explosion with which the very name of the mississippus have become associate in my mind but -lrb- think i -rrb- they have surely learn wisdom from experience and be become more skilful or more cautious than they use to be while i be engage with these reflection we captain come down and hand I a couple of new orlean papers which he have just receive from the pilot here be a treat and feel a little better i begin with eagerness to open one of they out it be the _ new orlean bee _ of January 23 and _ horresco referen _ the first thing that catch my eye be the follow paragraph : -- steam-boat explosion -- loss of life -- captain haviland of the steam-ship ` galveston ' from galveston report that the tow-boat ` phoenix ' captain crowell burst she boiler when near the head of the south-west pass -lrb- which we have but just pass -rrb- killing and wound about twenty-five in number seven of whom belong to the boat the _ balance _ to a barque she have alongside carry away the foremast of the barque close to she deck and she mainmast above she cross-tree together with all she fore-rigging bulwark and injure she hull considerably the ship ` manchester ' which she have also alongside be seriously injured have she bulwark carry away she longboat destroy & c such be the paragraph with not a syllable of note or comment on cause or consequence it be evidently a every-day occurrence what recklessness be here indicate and how comforting to a sick and nervous man now near the very spot of the occurrence and in a vessel about to be place in the same pleasant relation to one of those grunt monster as the unfortunate barque have but three day before occupy with the trifling balance of eighteen of she crew kill and wound the fever have leave I i venture on deck at this moment one of these infernal machine come in sight tow down three large ship instead of have they behind as on the thame and mersey she -lrb- like the phoenix -rrb- have one on either side closely lash to herself and the other only behind this terrific monster seem to be carry they away arm-in-arm like two prisoner to destruction at all event it be a position of familiarity and friendship with the sprite of steam of which i do not at all like the idea and yet we ourselves be by-and-by to be place in its perilous embrace the dreaded monster go by i resume the perusal of my new orlean papers now -lrb- think i -rrb- i be in a slave country i wonder whether these papers will give any indication of the fact in a little while my eye survey the _ bee _ of January 21 catch sight of a advertisement sign n st martin sheriff parish of st charle and contain a list of 112 human being offer for sale the miserable catalogue be full of instruction in draw it up the humane sheriff become quite facetious tell the public that frank 35 year old american negro -lrb- be -rrb- _ good for everything _ while stephen 46 year old -lrb- be -rrb- _ fit for nothing at all _ that salinette 60 year old hospital-nurse -lrb- be -rrb- _ a good subject subject to rheumatism _ and that peter american negro-man 38 year old -lrb- be -rrb- _ a good cook have have two fit of madness _ i will back this

the oyster but the boatman -- to fasten a rope to we vessel to help they on they give we a generous and refreshing supply but such oyster in neither size nor shape do they resemble those of the old world as to size they be gigantic -- as to shape not unlike the human foot they abound not far from the mouth of the river and many man obtain a livelihood by carry they up to the new orlean market the mode of cooking adopt in this instance be that of put they on the fire till the shell open to we taste they be not in flavor to be compare to the london oyster but we do not venture to tell we american captain so we have yet however to taste the deliciously-cooked oyster of the northern city about 10 pm the breeze have in a great measure die away we captain think it imprudent to attempt to go a-head further that night and the anchor be cast we be now fifty mile above the entrance of the river early next day the anchor be raise the sail be unfurled and we again move along about 8 be through the narrowness of the river the rapidity of the stream and other cause we smart captain who have chuckle vastly on pass all other ship in the river -- and especially british ship -- run he own vessel right ashore there we be in a complete fix till one of the grunt monster -lrb- come up with two vessel -- one on each arm as usual -- and let they go for a few minute -rrb- come to we rescue forbid as be he aspect we be very glad to feel a little of he giant power of this one i have of course a better view than i have have of any other of the species it have like the rest two chimney in front like perpendicular tusk with a ladder between they the ladder be for the purpose of ascent -- the ascent for the purpose of elevation -- and the elevation for the purpose of look out the top of the ladder in short render the same service as the top of a ship 's mast at sea this tug have also a little further aft a funnel-like sort of chimney for the emission of steam the whole structure be -- like a forge below and a palace above in the lower story be the boiler engine fuel & c all expose to view while the upper contain splendid apartment for the captain the engineer and other officer

bowels to burst and send we into eternity the noise of the engine the grunting of the steam the rage of the wind the pelting of the rain and the roaring of the thunder make it almost impossible to hear anything besides but i manage to shout in my wife 's ear the natural though not very consolatory question be we ever in so fearful a position before never -lrb- and we have have some experience of storm by both land and sea -rrb- be she awe-stricken reply we detach ourselves from the sailing-vessel but with all the power of steam we could scarcely get along at last the monster 's bellow be

my mind for they yet -lrb- now that they be actually before I -rrb- i be completely overcome and be oblige to seek a place to sit down while i compose my feeling with what sentiment my companion behold the scene i will leave you to conjecture it be Saturday morning and with my professional habit i naturally think of the many divine in that very city who be at that moment shut up in they study prepare they discourse for the morrow i wish i have they all before I i could have give every one of they a text to preach upon i would have say gentleman see there and blush for you fellow-citizen

love thy neighbor as thyself ' in the afternoon of the same day as i walk along one of the principal street i see a flag issue from a fine large public building to invite lady and gentleman to see the magnificent picture of the departure of the israelite from egypt -- the canvas contain 2000 square foot and 2000000 of figure how significant it would have be still more so if the number of figure have be 3000000 instead of 2000000 what a abolition picture it must have be worse than jacob and he son which be expunge from a catalogue of the american sunday-school union because in reprehend the sale of joseph to the merchant it reflect upon the _ internal _ slave-trade surely such exhibition will affect the safety of the peculiar institution letter iv a sabbath in new orlean -- the first presbyterian church -- expectoration -- a negro pew -- the sermon think of a sabbath in new orlean curious to know how people do really pray and preach with slavery and slave-trading in they vilest form around they i set off in search of the first presbyterian church it be a beautiful building seldom if ever have i see a place of worship the exterior of which i like so much be a quarter of a hour too soon i have opportunity for some preliminary research wish to see whether there be a negro pew i go into the gallery and take a seat on the left side of the organ the church i find as beautiful inside as out instead of a pulpit there be a kind of platform line with crimson which look very nice most of the pew below and some above be line with the same material a splendid chandelier have many circle of glass brilliant be suspend from the ceiling altogether the church be a very neat and graceful structure -- capable as i learn of accommodate about 1500 people but the floor -- the floor what a drawback it be stain all over with tobacco juice faugh those southern man be the most filthy people in that respect i ever meet with they be a great spit community to make it still more revolting to luckless traveller this nasty habit be generally attend with noise in the throat resemble the unite growling of a dozen mastiff while the congregation be assemble a greyhead aristocratic-looking old negro come up into the gallery walk along as one have authority and place himself in a front pew on the right-hand side of the pulpit two black woman shortly follow take they seat in the same region other succeed till ultimately there be from forty to fifty of the sable race in that part of the gallery not one white be to be see among the black nor one black among the whites there then be the negro pew it be the first time even my west indium eye ever behold a distinction of color maintain in the house of god at eleven o'clock precisely a man of tall but stoop figure and dark complexion about forty year of age muffle up in a cloak take he stand at the bottom of the pulpit or platform stair it be dr s -- he appear to beckon to some one in the congregation a tall lank old gentleman with a black cravat and shirt-collar turn over it _ à l'américain _ step forward and ascend the step before the doctor occupy one of the two chair with which the rostrum be furnish the doctor take the other i suppose he to be one of the elder go to give out the hymn or to assist in the devotional exercise at this moment the organ -- a fine-toned instrument -- strike up and the choir sing some piece -- known i presume only to themselves for no other join in it this prelude i have since find be universal in america in all place of worship provide with a organ a voluntary on that instrument be the first exercise in the present instance the choir have no sooner cease than the doctor stand up have he cloak still rest upon he shoulder and stretch forth he right hand at this signal all the people stand up and he offer a short prayer where be abel thy brother think i during this address to the father of the spirit of all flesh he then read the 23rd and 24th psalm where be abel thy brother be still ring in my ear the 33rd psalm be then sing where be abel thy brother be still hear -lrb- by I at least -rrb- louder than the swell tone of the organ the singing do of which the choir still have a entire monopoly the doctor read the 14th chapter of mark and as he read the awful story of we lord 's betrayal i could not help think that the only difference between some of the southern slave-dealer and juda be that have they be in he place they would have make a smarter bargain the reading though free from affectation be not by any means in the best style the chapter finish the tall elder -lrb- as i take he to be -rrb- pray -- the congregation stand the prayer be short and appropriate and the language tolerably correct but the tone and pronunciation be queer i suppose they to indicate some provincialism with which i be not acquaint along with that peculiar nasal sound for which nearly all american be distinguish there be in the voice a mixture of coax and familiarity which be a little offensive still as a layman 's exercise it be very good he pray for every grace and christian virtue aman ejaculate i -- then you slave will soon be free he pray for we nation and ruler he pray that the great blessing of civil and religious liberty which we enjoy may be hand down to future generation look out for a few nigger this morning think i he also pray for the army and navy and we fellow-citizen now on the field of battle in allusion to the mexican war -- the prayer end dr s -- give out another hymn during the whole of the service i may here remark there be a good deal of go in and out talk whisper spit guttural turbulence & c at first there be about a dozen white boy in my neighborhood who seem as if they belong to the sabbath-school but have no teacher to look after they and enjoy the full swing of liberty they have before sermon all disappear after the singing dr s -- make several announcement -- amongst other that the monthly concert to pray for the success of foreign mission would be hold there to-morrow evening when several speaker would address the meeting by all means -lrb- say i to myself -rrb- and i 'll try to be present he also tell he people that the rev -- ------ -lrb- from some place in kentucky -- the particulars i do not catch -rrb- be in the city as a deputation from the lady to solicit subscription for the erection of a new church that be greatly need the tall man in the black neckcloth then rise and to my surprise and disappointment read a text it be i cor iii 21 : for all thing be yours i imagine _ he _ be the deputation from the kentuckian lady after a few introductory remark explanatory of the context he propose to inquire what be the thing which enter into -lrb- constitute we should say -rrb- the inheritance of god 's people slave -lrb- say i to myself -rrb- be a part of the inheritance of god 's people both here and in kentucky : i wonder if he will notice that the first thing i observe -lrb- say he -rrb- that enter into the inheritance of god 's people be the living ministry -- paul or apollo or cepha to illustrate the value of this blessing he refer to the imaginary elixir of life the philosopher 's stone and the universal panacea if such thing really exist what a high value would man set upon they but here be something of incomparably higher worth in order to form a estimate of its value he lead he hearer to imagine the entire loss of the living ministry secondly the world belong to god 's people it be sustain for they sake and therefore sinner be indebted to god 's people for the preservation of they life to prove this he refer to the word of we lord ye be the salt of the earth in speaking of the preserve nature of salt he suppose the sea to be without salt how pestilential then but as it be how salubrious the air that have sweep over it he also refer to another case there be once -lrb- say he -rrb- a ship in a tremendous storm the crew and passenger -- about 270 in number -- be at they wit ' end nothing appear before they but a watery grave on board of that ship be a poor prisoner bind in chain he be deem to be of the filth of the world and the off-scouring of all thing to that poor prisoner the angel of the lord come and tell he what must be do to save the life of every one on board the angel 's direction be obey and all be preserve thus for the sake of one of god 's people be 270 life spare he offer another illustration three man come to converse with abraham on the plain of mamre they tell he that god be about to destroy five city abraham begin to intercede for they the preacher recapitulate the wondrous story of this intercession and its success as further prove that ungodly man owe the preservation of they life to the presence and prayer of the people of god the parable of the tare be also cite as illustrate the same position let both grow together until the harvest imagine -lrb- say he -rrb- all the people of god remove from the face of the earth -- no heart to love he -- no tongue to praise he -- there would be no reason why the earth should be continue in existence another moment in the light of this subject see how great a privilege it be to have pious relative life also be in the third place a part of the inheritance of the child of god because during it he make a provision for eternity he dwell on the richness of the treasure which god 's people be lay up suppose -lrb- say he -rrb- any of you be make money at the rate of fifty dollar a hour -- -lrb- i dare say you do so sometimes reflect i when you get a good price for you nigger -rrb- -- how rich you would soon be and how anxious that not a single hour should be lose but the child of god be lay up treasure at a faster rate than this every time he work for god he be lay it up the christian 's treasure be also of the right kind and lay up in the right place if any of you be go to emigrate to another country you would be anxious to know what sort of money be current in that country and to get yours change into it the christian 's treasure be the current coin of eternity it be also in the right place where would you like to have you treasure why at home the christian 's treasure be at home -- in he father 's house life be he also because during it he fight the battle of the lord here the preacher make a approve reference to the war against the mexican and i strongly suspect that this view of the christian 's inheritance be drag in for the very purpose we fight -lrb- say he -rrb- under the eye of the general we fight with a certainty of victory death too be in the fourth place a portion of the christian 's inheritance to the people of god curse be make blessing and to those who be not he people blessing be make curse so sickness persecution and death be make blessing to the saint death to the christian be like a honorable discharge to the soldier after the toil and the danger of the field of strife but that illustration -lrb- say he -rrb- be too feeble : i will give you another imagine on a bleak and dreary mountain the humble dwelling of two old people they be bend under the weight of year amidst destitution and want they be totter on the verge of the grave a messenger come and tell they of a relative who have die and leave they a large inheritance -- one by which every want will be supply and every desire realize -- one that will the moment they touch it with the sole of they foot make they young again : he point moreover to the very chariot that be to convey they thither would this be bad news to those old people now such be death to the child of god the cord be cut and the spirit take its flight to the abode of the blest or take another illustration a stage-coach be once upset many of the passenger be in great danger one man snatch a little babe from among the wheel and lay it down in a place of safety on the roadside twenty year after the same man be travel in a stage on the same road and tell those around he about the accident which have take place a long time before a young lady sit opposite be listen to the narrative with eager interest and at last she burst out with rapture be it possible that i have at last find my deliverer i be that little babe you rescue something like this will be the disclosure that death will make have thus illustrate the inheritance of the people of god let I ask you -lrb- say he -rrb- who be not he people -- what will all these thing be to you if you die without christ the living ministry the world life death have speak briefly with power and pathos on each of these particulars he very coolly and deliberately turn to rev xxii 17 and read the spirit and the bride say come and let he that heareth say come & c & c and close abruptly with neither a aman nor a invocation of any kind such be the first sermon i hear in the united state it be thoroughly evangelical and good but i listen to it with mingle feeling it be painful to think that such a ministry could co-exist with slavery the creed it be evident may be evangelical while there be a woful neglect of the duty of practical piety letter v first religious service in america -lrb- continue -rrb- -- a collection take up -- rush out -- evening service -- sketch of the sermon -- profanation of the sabbath -- the monthly concert for prayer after sermon dr s give out a hymn and tell the congregation that the collection for the support of the beneficiary of that church would be take up that morning add that in consequence of this collection not have be make at the usual time -lrb- in may last -rrb- some of the young man who be prepare for the ministry and dependent on that congregation for food and clothing be now in great want he also suggest that if any present be unprepared with money they might put in a slip of paper with they name address and the amount of they contribution and some one would call upon they the collection be take up during the singing at the last verse the congregation stand up the benediction be pronounce with outstretched arm by the doctor and the moment he utter the aman all rush out of the place as fast as they could this rush be a characteristic of the american it be see in they approach to the dining-table as well as in a hundred other instance i suppose it be what they call be smart and go a-head in the evening i go again to the same church the introductory part be shorter and more simple than in the morning the doctor 's prayer -lrb- seven or eight minute long -rrb- be admirable i wish some dry prosy petitioner in england could have hear it it be devout comprehensive and to the point all class of man -- but one -- be remember in it the slave be not mention -- they freedom be not pray for the doctor give we to understand that he be about to deliver the fifth of a series of lecture to young man in great city the text be the sabbath be make for man and not man for the sabbath the subject the importance of the sabbath to young man in great city the text -lrb- he observe -rrb- involve the principle that man be not make to observe certain ceremony and obey certain precept but that the observance of rite and law be enjoin for man 's own sake this principle apply to the institution of the sabbath the body the intellect the affection -- all require the rest which the sabbath afford the experiment have be abundantly try and it have be invariably find that more could be do in every department of labor with the regular observance of the sabbath as a day of rest than without it the farmer the student the legislator have all try it man could no more do without the sabbath than he could do without sleep writer on slavery however they differ on other point be all agree on this -- that the withholding of the sabbath from the slave in the west indy together with the other cruelty inflict upon they have materially shorten they life -lrb- how telescopic by the way be we view with regard to evil at a distance west indium slavery never wear the hideous feature which slavery present in the southern state of america slavery even in cuba with all its horror be far milder than in the united state -rrb- france once present a fearful example of what a nation would be without a sabbath the testimony of dr spurzheim and rush be cite in confirmation also that of a respectable merchant in new york well know to the preacher who after the observation and experience of twenty-five year in that city declare that of those who keep they counting-house open on the sabbath not one have escape insolvency a poor boy be apprentice to a apothecary in a large city to increase he wages and encourage he effort he master give he a recipe and material for make black on he own account the black be make and place in pot in the shop window but day after day pass and no purchaser appear one Sunday morning while the shop be open for medicine before the hour of public service a person come in and ask for a pot of black the boy be in the very act of stretch out he hand to reach it when he reflect it be the lord 's - day falteringly he tell the customer it be the sabbath and he could not do it after this the boy go to church the tempter there tease he about he folly in lose a customer for he black : the boy hold in reply that he have do right and be the case to occur again he would do just the same on Monday morning as soon as he have take down the shutter a person come in and buy every pot of black there be and the boy find that after deduct the cost of material he have clear one dollar with more faith and fortitude than some of you possess -lrb- say the preacher -rrb- he go and take that dollar -- the first he have ever earn -- to the bible society that poor boy be still live and be now a wealthy man the preacher say he know a man in he own native state of tennessee who on he arrival in america have nothing but a pocket bible but he make two resolution -- 1st that he would honor the sabbath 2nd that he would remember he mother the first dollar he get he send to she and declare that he would never forget the sabbath and he mother he also be now a wealthy

heavy that he would certainly have sink under they have it not be for the rest the sabbath afford but the sabbath be not merely a day of rest -- it be a day for improvement where there be no sabbath all be bad the inhabitant of scotland and new england be distinguish for industry and mental vigor and they be equally distinguish for observance of the sabbath the universal observance of the same day be of great importance it guard against neglect it tell upon the ungodly as be show by a eloquent induction of circumstance -- the shop close -- the sound of the church-going bell -- the throng of decent worshipper go to and fro & c young man in great city -lrb- it be observe -rrb- be in great danger chiefly from example they meet with those who be older in sin than themselves -- who pride themselves on know where the best oyster be sell the cheapest horse to be hire or the cheapest boat to be engage for the Sunday 's excursion young man be ready to think if i do not do this i may do something worse the fallacy and danger of this mode of reasoning be expose it might be employ to excuse any sin public place of amusement be highway to destruction ah how those old people in that little cottage -- surround with a stone wall -- on the hill side -- far away -- would weep if they know they son be tread on the verge of these burn crater familiarity with sabbath-breaking destroy the sense of guilt the young medical student when he first visit the dissecting-room and the soldier when he first stand on the field of battle be sensible of misgiving against which repetition only make they proof -- each gradually lose he first sensation the desecration of the sabbath be a greater evil to society than any tyrant could inflict how would any infringement of civil rights be resist here be a infringement with consequence infinitely more injurious and yet the press be dumb dog and the pulpit itself be not guiltless this masterly discourse be read but read in such a manner as to lose none of its effect it occupy upward of a hour my irresistible impression as i listen be _ there be a man of god _ truly a light shine in a dark place for as i return to my lodgings i find the coffee-houses oyster-saloon and theater all open just as on any other day only more throng with customer how much such discourse be need in this place i leave you to judge from the follow extract from the _ new orlean guide _ : -- the greatest market-day be Sunday at break of day the gathering commence -- youth and age -- beauty and not so beautiful -- all color nation and tongue be co-mingle in one heterogeneous mass of delightful confusion the traveller who leave the city without visit one of the popular market on Sunday morning have suffer a rare treat to escape he on the evening of the next day be the first Monday in the month i go to the concert for prayer which have be announce the day before it be hold in a vestry or a school-room under the church about sixty or seventy person be in attendance when i get there they be sing the last verse of o'er the gloomy mil of darkness & c a gentleman then give a address he object be to show that extensive field be open in various part of the world for the introduction of the gospel there be nothing clerical in he appearance and he boggle a great deal but as he say we the minister of the gospel i infer that he be the pastor of some other presbyterian church in the city behind the desk where sit dr s -- be hang up a missionary map of the world draw on canvas and illuminate from behind it be a excellent device all missionary prayer-meeting should be furnish with one those part where the gospel be already preach be light the realm of heathenism dark the land of popery red and so forth after the address the pastor call upon brother franklin to lead in prayer the phrase be new to I but i like it -- it be appropriate the prayer be scriptural and good as be that also of another brother the second pray that the war in which they be then as a nation engage might be overrule for good and be the means of introduce the gospel and free institution to a neighbouring republic free institution indeed -lrb- i say to myself -rrb- : if you conquer i fear it will be the means of introduce slavery where now it be not after this prayer the pastor have deliver a very short address give out a hymn and say that while they be sing brother such-a-one would take up the collection -- a phrase which seem to indicate a greater degree of preparation on the part of the people than we make a collection the american suppose it to be already make and nothing remain but to take it up the good brother come round with a old hat to receive contribution for the cause of mission the pastor then close with a short prayer and the benediction upon the whole there be indication of a considerable degree of warm-heartedness in reference to the missionary cause and especially of tender sympathy and affection towards missionary themselves as one of the tribe i find it rather difficult to preserve my _ incog _ there be present about half-a-dozen black people some on the right and some on the left of the pastor -- the place of

cheer i ever hear -- bravo -- bravo -- bravo -- whoo -- hoo -- whoo the last sound be to I altogether new not have learn phonography i can give you no adequate notion of it but it be a combination of the owl 's screech and the pig 's scream the favored orator continue he speech a little longer and at the close there be a storm of applause ten time more terrific than the former and who be the speaker it be none other as i subsequently ascertain than the celebrated henry clay in depart from the tone of eulogy in which it be fashionable to speak of he i may be charge with a want of taste and discrimination that i can not help my simple object in these letter be to tell how transatlantic man and manners appear to my eye or ear before i go to america my respect for henry clay be very great i be sorry to say it be not so now i have closely examine he conduct in reference to the peculiar institution and find it to have be that -- not of a high-minded statesman and true philanthropist -- but of a trim time-serving partisan he have be a main pillar of slavery and as the idol of the whig party a great stumbling-block in the way of those who seek the overthrow of that system the man of whom i have thus freely yet conscientiously express myself be nevertheless thus speak of in the _ new englander _ a quarterly review of high character now open before I : -- we intend to speak in the praise of henry clay he place among the great man of we country be permanently fix he stand forth prominent above the politician of the hour in the midst of the choose few who be perpetual guardian of the interest and of the honor -lrb- slavery -rrb- of the nation the foundation of he fame be lay deep and imperishable and the superstructure be already erect it only remain that the mild light of the evening of life be shed around it the cheer at the close of mr clay 's speech merge into a awful tempest of bark i could compare it to nothing else -- 500 man bark with all they might i think it be all up with the meeting -- that all be lose in incurable confusion and yet the gentleman on the platform look down upon the rage tempest below with calmness and composure as a thing of course amidst the noise i see a middle-aged gentleman rise on the platform deliberately take off he top-coat and all be hush -- except at the outskirts of the assembly where a great trade in talk and tobacco be constantly carry on this gentleman 's name be ss prentiss esq and the bark it be now evident consist of call out prentiss -- prentiss -- prentiss with all they might on the top of the voice and with a accent sharp and rise on the first syllable this gentleman give we to understand that he be a lawyer -- that he have often appear before he fellow-citizen on former occasion -lrb- those occasion he briefly enumerate -rrb- but that the present be the most painful of all he expatiate largely and with great vehemence of tone and action on the misery of famine as experience in ireland -- talk much of they own glorious and free country -- -lrb- look out for a few nigger this morning occur to I -rrb- -- and make some severe reflection -- not i admit altogether undeserved -- on the government of england this man be fluent though turgid he seem resolve to _ act _ the orator throughout and certainly to I appear in point of talent far -- far a-head of henry clay bravo and hoohoo in abundance greet mr prentiss he speak long but the noise of the suburb prevent my hearing so perfectly as i wish the cheer at the close of this speech merge into bark as before in this instance it be hunt -- hunt -- hunt that they call for the president -lrb- standing -rrb- show they a sheet of paper contain probably a list of subscription and smile coaxingly to intimate that he wish that to be read but it would not do hunt -- hunt -- hunt be still the cry and the democracy as before carry the day by this time the atmosphere of the room have become so poison with smoking that i could endure it no longer i have not only the general atmosphere to bear but special puff right in my face accompany the question and remark which in that free meeting of free citizen in a free country be freely put to I by the free-and-easy gentleman around the meeting result in the raising of 15000 dollar for the relief of the irish the sum be hand by the american minister in london to lord john russell and a note from he lordship acknowledge the gift have go the round of the papers on both side of the atlantic the subject of relief to ireland be subsequently in many way and place bring under my notice and while i have be delighted in many instance with the display of pure and noble generosity it be too evident that much of what be do be do in a spirit of self-glorification over a humble and afflict rival it be a fine opportunity to feed the national vanity and to deal hard blow to england not that i be sorry to see those blow or to feel they they draw no blood and be a hundred time more efficacious than if they have i feel that there be much in the conduct of england towards she unhappy sister-isle for which she deserve the severest castigation but i must protest against the form of put the case which be very common throughout the united state : you be shock at we slavery and yet you have horror of ten time greater magnitude in the irish famine at you own door in this way the irish famine be a god-sent sort of a salvo for the slave-holder 's conscience so soothing and grateful to he tortured feeling that he be but too happy to pay for it by a contribution for the relief of

word to one and then to another in a very bustling manner as i look down the aisle i see on one side of it near the pulpit end a leg project about eighteen inch in a pendent position at a angle of about forty-five degree this leg attract my notice by its strange and solitary appearance it seem as if it have get astray from its owner in america gentleman 's leg do get sometimes most strangely astray -- on the chair arm on the table on the chimney-piece and into all sort of out-of-the-way place while other people generally try how high they can carry they head the ambition of the american be to try how high they can carry they heel observe the leg in question a little more attentively i find that behind it -lrb- in the adjoining pew -rrb- and in close and intimate connection with it be a man dress in black the bustling old gentleman come by tap he on the shoulder and beckon he forward along with himself to the rostrum here they be meet by a tall man of grave appearance about thirty year of age with a pale face and bald forehead wear a white cravat with corner about ten inch long stretch out on either side towards the shoulder he be make to take the central position at the desk while the man with the leg take the right and the elderly gentleman the leave the elderly gentleman -lrb- who from he i be - at-home kind of air be evidently the pastor -rrb- offer up a short prayer and then give out a hymn which some few friend in the gallery -lrb- stand up -rrb- sing all the rest of the congregation sit down and very few join at all in the psalmody this exercise over the central gentleman arise and have first read a few verse of scripture offer up a very suitable prayer about eight or ten minute long the man on the right then give out another hymn which be sing as before the central gentleman now in a very low do not - care-whether-you-hear-or-not tone of voice give out a text it be john iii 7 : marvel not that i say unto thee ye must be bear again i will give you a sketch of he sermon he observe that of all subject on which man might be address religious subject be the most important and that of all religious subject that to which the text refer be the most momentous have notice the context he propose to inquire first into the necessity of be bear again this change -lrb- he observe -rrb- be necessary in order to enjoy heaven it be a common observation that society seek its level the indian for example could not be happy amidst the refinement of civilization the gambler and the swearer could not be happy in the society of the pious and devout if so in this world amidst imperfect holiness how much more so in the pure society of the celestial state during these remark i be much annoy by the crack of nut not very far off i look around and actually find it be a mother crack they for she two boy one of whom might be seven and the other five year of age -- one by she side and the other in the next pew behind to the latter she deliberately hand over the kernel in a pocket-handkerchief and yet to look at she you would have think she a woman of sense and piety the preacher notice in the second place the nature of this change it be spiritual not physical -- a revolution -lrb- -rrb- of the mind rather than a mere change of opinion or of outward deportment the third observation related to the evidence of the change its existence might be ascertain by we own experience and by the word of god the former be not to be trust without a reference to the latter this change destroy the love of the world it lead man to abandon he favorite sin and to live and labor to do good it also create in he new desire and enjoyment these topic be variously and suitably illustrated and the whole be a very good sermon on the subject at the close the man on the right offer a appropriate prayer the pastor then make several announcement among they that a meeting to pray for the success of sabbath-school would be hold on the morrow evening in connection with that announcement he say : i be a very plain man and my god be a very plain god he be so in all he dealings with man he always act on the plain common-sense principle that if a favor be worth bestow it be worth ask for he also intimate that there would be a church-meeting immediately after the service preparatory to the ordinance of the lord 's supper in the afternoon invite at the same time any member of other baptist church who might be present to participate with they in that privilege this form of invitation lead I to understand that they be close communionist and such i have ascertain to be the case not only with they but also with all the regular baptist in america the influence of robert hall and other be not feel so powerfully on that side of the atlantic as on this i suppose that while this worthy pastor would have freely admit to the lord 's supper any immerse slave-holder he would have sternly refuse that privilege to I -- a sprinkle missionary from a distant land you will readily believe however that the anti-slavery missionary -- the pastor of a large congregation of black and colored people -- be not very ambitious of christian fellowship with slave-holders letter x interview with a baptist minister -- conversation with a young man in the baptist church -- the presbyterian church and dr scott again -- a peep at the house of representative of louisiana -- contrast between the french and the american in the treatment of they slave -- dinner table in new orlean -- american manners the decide part act by the baptist missionary in the british colony in reference to slavery make I anxious to know the whereabouts of the baptist minister in new orlean on that subject and i therefore visit he place of worship again in the afternoon they be engage in celebrate the ordinance of the lord 's supper a very clean and neatly-dressed black woman be stand in the portico look in and watch the proceedings with deep interest she evidently wish to enter but dare not at the close i introduce myself to the minister as davy from british guiana attach to the ministry of the missionary of the london society he be very kind and cordial and press my wife and myself to go home with he to tea we accept the invitation among other question he ask how we negro work now that they be free i tell he very well indeed and you may very safely venture to emancipate you slave as soon as you please this lead we at once _ in media re _ he view i find to be simply as follow : how pious how plausible how convenient how extensively prevalent in reference to other evil than slavery slavery be a political institution as a christian minister i have nothing to do with politics my business be to preach the gospel and try to save man 's soul in this course i be sanction by the example of the apostle paul slavery exist in he day but he turn not aside from the great object to attempt its overthrow he simply tell master and slave they duty without at all interfere with the relation subsist between they besides the opposite of this course would render we and we church unpopular and thereby destroy we usefulness he also seem very sore at the idea of the christianity of slave-holder be at all call in question people say he or word to the same effect may spare themselves the trouble to pass resolution of non-fellowship with we we wish for no fellowship with those who be so uncharitable as to question we piety i begin now to understand why the abolitionist call the american church the bulwark of slavery subsequently on the same day i have conversation with a young man whom i have that afternoon see sit down at the lord 's table in the baptist church he tell I that there be in new orlean two baptist church of color people preside over by faithful and devoted pastor of they own color and do you pastor i inquire recognize they and have fellowship with they oh yes he have often preach to they he feel very anxious i can assure you for the conversion of the slave and do those color preacher ever occupy you pulpit oh dear I no with evident alarm why not you say they be good man and sound in doctrine oh they would not be tolerate besides they be accustom to speak in broken english and in very familiar language otherwise the slave could not understand they the slave you know can not read and be not allow to learn this he say in a tone of voice which indicate a entire acquiescence in that state of thing as if he think the arrangement perfectly right but what iniquity to come between the word of god and he rational creature to interpose between the light of heaven and the soul of man to withhold the lamp of life from one-sixth of the entire population of all the damning feature of american slavery this be the most damning i suppose continued i if any of the black people come to you church they have to sit by themselves _ young man _ -- of course : i have never see it otherwise _ myself _ -- and i have never before see it so with we in british guiana black and whites mingle together indiscriminately in the worship of we common father _ young man _ -lrb- with amazement -rrb- -- there must be a a great change here before it come to that it must appear very strange _ myself _ -- very much like heaven where they shall come together from the east and from the west from the north and from the south & c why we have black deacon who at the celebration of the lord 's supper carry the bread and wine and give they even to white people _ young man _ -lrb- with more astonishment than ever and in a tone of offended dignity -rrb- -- i do not think i could stand that -- i do not a great change must take place in my feeling before i could i do not like to mingle ham and japhet together for my part -- i do not _ myself _ -- why they be mingle together in the ark _ young man _ -- yes but old noah quarrel with ham soon after he come out and curse he _ myself _ -- grant but you and you pastor profess to be anxious for the slave ' conversion to god and thereby to roll away the curse here the dialogue end in the evening i be desirous of hear dr hawke a episcopalian minister of whose talent and popularity i have hear much in new orlean but find that he do not preach in the evening i go again to hear dr scott at the presbyterian church have stand a considerable time at the door inside and receive no encouragement to advance i venture along with my wife to enter the pew next to the door this prove a most unfortunate position there be not light enough to take any note while the incessant opening and shut of the door with its rusty hinge make it extremely difficult to hear the discourse however which be again address to young man in great city be characterize by all the power and piety which distinguish the one of the previous sabbath i retire deeply impressed with the value of such a ministry in such a place dr scott be one of the american delegate to the conference for the formation of the evangelical alliance in 1846 he be a southern man bear and breed amidst the wild of tennessee whose early educational advantage be very small he be in a great measure a self-made man bring up in the midst of slavery he be -lrb- i rejoice to hear -rrb- a cordial hater of the system as a minister he be thoroughly furnish -- a workman that needeth not to be ashamed he knowledge of the world as well as of the word of god and of the human heart be extensive and be turn to the best account in he ministration in leave new orlean i feel no regret but that i have not call upon this good man on Monday morning the 8th of February i have a peep at the house of representative of the state of louisiana then in session at new orlean the room a dark and dingy-looking place be fit up with desk and seat in the form of the letter d a desk and a spittoon be allow to each honorable member -- the latter article be deem as necessary as the former whether smoking be suffer during the hour of business or not i can not tell but the room smell horribly of stale tobacco between fifty and sixty member be present and never certainly either in the old world or in the new do i see a assemblage of worse-looking man they seem fit for any deed of robbery blood and death several distinguished duellist be point out to I among they colonel crane a old man who have repeatedly fight with mr bowie the inventor of the bowie knife and have kill several man in personal combat the motion before the house just at that time be for the release from prison of a mr simm who a few day before have violently assault one of the member in the lobby he be release accordingly who will not pity the 200000 slave of this state who be at the tender mercy of these sanguinary man nor let it be say as it often be that new orlean and louisiana be not a fair specimen of thing even in the south -- that they be more french than american & c this be not the case nothing in new orlean strike I more forcibly than its thoroughly american character american usage american influence american law and american religion be there predominant thing be much better for the black and colored people when it be not so the french treat they slave incomparably kinder than the american do they often married color woman and invariably treat they own color offspring whether legitimate or illegitimate with tenderness and regard they have they suitably educate and adequately provide for so that at the present moment a large portion of the city of new orlean be the freehold property of color person not so act the american they indulge in the grossest licentiousness with color woman but would shudder at the idea of marry one of they and instead of give any property to they color offspring they do not scruple to sell they as slave have i go to the roman catholic cathedral in that city which be attend chiefly by the french and they descendant i should have find no negro pew but person of all color intermingle together in religious observance the southerner seem to have no heart -- no feeling except that of love to the almighty dollar the population of new orlean be about 90000 on this mass of people be bring to bear the labor of at least thirteen minister of the methodist episcopal church seven presbyterian four episcopalian and three baptist -- all professedly evangelical -- besides a considerable number of roman catholic and other non-evangelical teacher but satan have there a large array of synagogue i omit at the proper time to describe the scene we witness at we private lodgings the first day we sit down to dinner though it be call a private boarding-house and we have take the apartment as such we find ourselves surround by about thirty boarder these be all respectable man or rather man whom from they position in society you would expect to be respectable doctor lieutenant in the army captain merchant editor clerk of the senate and so forth be among they my wife be the only lady besides the mistress of the house we be all wait in a ante-room for the summons to dinner it come the door of the dining-room be throw open and before you could have say jack robinson the whole have rush through be seat at table and send forth a forest of fork in the direction of the various dish i have often hear of this wolfish habit but think we cousin be caricature here however be the reality have i not be a eye-witness i could not have believe it not a single seat have be keep vacant for the only lady who have to be accommodate and we be both leave to console ourselves in the ante-room the landlady however have a eye to business arrange for we accommodation at the table there have be on the table a turkey a piece of beef some fish and pastry -- all ready carve most of these thing have instantly disappear -- the knife and fork have bear they away in triumph there be no wait to be serve : every one stick he fork in what he like best or what be most within he reach it be a regular scramble the principle seem to be to _ begin _ to eat as soon as possible no matter what some begin with nothing but potato some with a bit of bread some with a piece of beef some with a limb of the turkey some i notice begin with fowl then take roast beef then boil mutton then fish and then some pastry -- all on the same plate and -- faugh -- portion of most of they there at the same time no change of plate -- that would have be extravagant and would have savor of aristocracy freedom it seem allow every one to help himself and that with he own knife and fork which he have before use for all sort of purpose such luxury as salt-spoon and mustard-spoon be very rare south of the ohio my wife ask the lady of the house for a small slice of the ham she have before she when the latter very politely beg mr davy to lend she she knife to cut it with this be good society in new orlean thing improve as we advance towards the north but in most place though the american provide bountifully the cooking be not good and they make a strange jumble of thing at table they have the appearance of a people suddenly raise in the world and able to afford themselves nice thing but very ignorant and awkward in the use of they with so much hurry to begin the time occupy in eating by we company be very short we britisher have scarcely begin when one and another get up from table finish he dinner as he walk away they can not bear to sit at table a moment longer than be absolutely necessary while we remain seat they pass before we on they way out -- one eat one pick he tooth one scrape he throat one spit on the floor of course we seldom make a hearty meal under such circumstance letter xi farewell to new orlean -- revolting bargain -- the anglo saxon

lower sugar and molasses in return this stoppage afford a opportunity of go ashore i go to see the estate building and though such building as exist in guiana be quite familiar to I i be interested in observe the difference those of guiana be incomparably superior but _ these _ be the result of a better policy ours be too large and too expensive these be rude simple and cheap and yet answer the purpose see slave at work i address several question to one of they relative to the cultivation and manufacture of sugar and receive very sensible and even _ polite _ answer by this time we have receive a impression of the character of we fellow-passenger the mass of the gentleman be rude and filthy beyond expression the promenade or gallery outside which might be very pleasant be bespatter

on the route end in _ ville _ -- as donaldsonville francisville iberville nashville & c -- i could not help ask if we have not many passenger from _ spitville _ but this be not the worst feature in the character of we fellow-traveller who comprise gambler fighter swearer drunkard soul driver and everything base and bad of these we have about fifty as cabin passenger but there be upward of a hundred deck passenger below -- not above -- and they be ten time worse among man so much resemble demon i have never before be however my wife be with I i have the _ entrée _ of the lady ' cabin this

except towards the color people i find on board a baptist minister from the state of maine in new england a thorough anti-slavery man he testimony against the south on this subject be strong he have lately be on a visit to a brother minister of he own denomination in north carolina at first whenever the new englander desire to go into the yard it be necessary for he reverend brother to accompany he and introduce he to a number of large dog otherwise they would have worry he these animal be keep to prevent he reverence 's slave from run away and to hunt they if they do and yet as my travel companion assure I this reverend slave-holder gravely and pathetically complain of the reluctance of the slave to attend family worship letter xii voyage up the mississippus -lrb- continue -rrb- -- patriarchal establishment -- the red river -- elder wright -- lynch-law administer by a preacher -- natchez -- story of mary brown -- the flat boat of the mississippus on the 10th of February we pass a great many sugar estate on both side of the river which would be agreeable object but for the curse of slavery for who can look with pleasure upon the foul abode of lust oppression and cruelty at the outer gate in front of one of these patriarchal establishment be a small octagonal building about 6 or 8 foot in mean diameter the basement be of brick pierce by small air hole bar with iron at the height of about 8 foot from the ground and the upper part be of wood terminate in a pigeon-house make a short stay there to take in fire-wood we inquire into the use of the building but all the answer we could get be that it be a pigeon-house the baptist minister from maine ask a negro who be help to bring wood on board and from he he learn the real truth -- that it be a place of punishment and torture for the oppressed slave we have since ascertain that such building be very common and generally pass under the euphemistic name of pigeon-house on the 11th of February -- a fine frosty day -- we come to red river branch on we leave in the direction of texa with which country it form a important means of communication this river even where it pour its water into the mississippus be not more than from 300 to 500 foot wide and yet be navigable by steamer for about 1200 mile my baptist friend have recently be on a visit to elder wright a planter and a slave-holder on that river this wright be a new-england man have graduate at yale college and boast that he be a northern man with southern feeling he be call elder wright because he be a preacher -- the baptist here call all preacher elder now this elder wright tell my friend that a few year ago there be great fear in he district of the slave rise up against they master to this they be suppose to be instigate by the presence and influence of some stranger under this apprehension a secret committee be form to seize and try every suspected stranger and if he could not clear himself to they satisfaction to hang he up quietly of this secret and murderous committee elder wright -- a _ alumnus _ of yale college a professor of religion and a preacher of the gospel -- be choose chairman and the statement i have just make come in the way describe from he own lip it be notorious that in the south they think nothing of take away a man 's life if he be even suspect of sympathy with the slave and a country so thinly inhabit afford abundant opportunity of do it as quietly as can be desire america be indeed a land of liberty at night we come to natchez a town beautifully situate on the top of a hill about 300 foot above the level of the river and for this reason call natchez-on-the-hill its population be about 5000 and it be the largest town in the state of mississippus its distance from new orlean be 300 mile darkness have set in when we approach it yet the numerous light on shore rise row above row to a great elevation give it a lively and interesting appearance but alas natchez also be a great slave market and i can never think of it without remember the suffering of poor mary brown let I narrate she painful story it may waken in some breast a feeling of sympathy for the american slave mary brown a color girl be the daughter of _ free _ parent in washington city -- the capital of the freest nation under heaven she live with she parent till the death of she mother one day when she be near the potomac bridge the sheriff overtake she and tell she that she must go with he she inquire what for he make no reply but tell she to come along and take she immediately to a slave-auction mary tell he she be free but he contradict she and the sale proceed the auctioneer soon sell she for 350 dollar to a mississippus trader she be first take to jail and after a few hour be handcuff chained to a _ man-slave _ and start in a drive of about forty for new orlean she handcuffs make she wrist swell so much that at night they be oblige to take they off and put fetter round she ankle in the morning the handcuffs be again put on thus they travel for two week wade river whip up all day and beat at night if they have not perform the prescribe distance she frequently wade river in she chain with water up to she waist the month be October and the air cold and frosty after she have travel thus twelve or fifteen day she arm and ankle have become so swollen that she feel as if she could go no further they have no bed usually sleep in barn sometimes out on the naked ground and such be she misery and pain that she could only lie and cry all night still she be drive on for another week and every time the trader catch she cry he beat she utter fearful curse if he catch she pray he say he would give she _ hell _ mary be a member of the methodist church in washington there be several pious people in the company and at night when the driver find they melancholy and disposed to pray he have a fiddle bring and make they dance in they chain whipping they till they comply mary at length become so weak that she really could travel on foot no further she feeble frame be exhaust and sink beneath accumulate suffering she be seize with a burning fever and the diabolical trader -- not move with pity but only fear he should lose she -- place she for the remainder of the way in a waggon arrive at natchez they be all offer for sale mary be still sick begged she might be sell to a kind master sometimes she make this request in the hearing of purchaser but be always insult for it and afterwards punish by she cruel master for she presumption on one occasion he tie she up by the hand so that she could barely touch the floor with she toe he keep she thus suspend a whole day whipping she at interval in any other country this inhuman beast would have be try for the greatest crime short of murder that man can commit against woman and transport for life poor mary brown be at length sell at 450 dollar as a house-servant to a wealthy man of vicksburgh who compel she to cohabit with he and have child by she -- most probably fill up the measure of he iniquity by sell he own flesh wrong like these must have inspire we poet when he exclaim -- to think that man -- they just and gentle god -- should stand before thee with a tyrant 's rod o'er creature like himself with soul from thee yet dare to boast of perfect liberty away away i would rather hold my neck in doubtful tenure from a sultan 's beck in clime where liberty have scarce be name nor any right but that of ruling claim than thus to live where bastard freedom wave she fustian flag in mockery over slave as we advance we continually meet with flat boat laden with produce and float sluggishly down in the vernacular phrase these boat be call kentucky flat or broad-horn they be curiously construct at a distance they appear like large chest or trunk afloat they be from 50 to 100 foot long and generally about 15 or 20 foot wide the timber of the bottom be massive beam the side be board up square to the height of 6 foot above the water the roof be slightly curve like a trunk lid to throw off rain they be adapt to carry from 200 to 400 barrel great number of cattle hog and horse be convey to market in they coal too be thus bring down from the upper part of the valley some of these barge have apartment fit up for the accommodation of a family with a stove bed table & c you may sometimes see in they lady servant cow horse sheep dog and poultry -- all float on the same bottom it be precisely in this fashion that the pennsylvanian farmer and he wife have reach new orlean indeed most of we fellow-passenger have come as captain or crew of flat boat of course no attempt be make to get these unwieldy boat back against the current it would be impracticable the flat boat make but one trip during its individual existence arrive at new orlean it be sell for lumber and take to piece in short by this arrangement timber and produce be bring to market at the same time the stuff of which the float be compose be but little injured one can not look at these temporary structure without be impress with the vast importance of those water-power which the american with a wonderful tact bring to bear in the way of saw-mill on the exhaustless resource of the forest the very first thing look for in settle a new district be water-power these flat though destine for but a single voyage sometimes do not reach they port -- seldom without more or less of danger -- and never without infinite toil ' they usually carry but three or four hand they form and gravity render they very unmanageable lie flat and dead in the water with square timber below they bottom plank they often run on a sandbank with a strong head-way and bury they timber in the soil to get they afloat again be a great labor sometimes they run upon a snag and be instantly swallow up with all they crew and all they cargo sometimes a steamer run into one of they and produce a catastrophe equally fatal to both but all the toil and danger and exposure connect with the long and perilous voyage of a flat boat do not appear to the passer-by as you cut along by the power of steam the flat boat seem anything but a place of toil or care one of the hand scrape a violin while the other dance affectionate greeting or rude defiance or trial of wit or proffer of love to the girl on shore or saucy message pass between they and the spectator along the bank or on the steam-boat yet know the danger to which they be really expose the sight of they often bring to my remembrance a appropriate verse of dr watt : -- you stream be float I along down to the gulf of black despair and whilst i listen to you song you stream have e ` en convey I there these boat however do not venture to travel by night consequently at any good landing-place on the mississippus you may see towards evening a large number of they assemble they have come from region thousand of mile apart they have never meet before -- they will probably never meet again the fleet of flat cover perhaps a surface of several acre fowl be flutter over the roof as invariable appendage the piercing note of the chanticleer be hear the cattle low the horse trample

former be situate at the base of a bold and solitary bluff here a few year ago a negro man be condemn by the _ mob _ to be _ burned alive over a slow fire _ which be put into execution for murder a black woman and she master mr green a respectable citizen of that place who attempt to save she from the clutch of this monster such be the newspaper version of the affair have the real truth be state it would have appear that this green be the _ monster _ who have seduce the wretched negro 's wife the big black river be not so very big after all it be extremely narrow although navigable for some hundred of mile besides the danger of explosion -- which i apprehend arise from race and carelessness more than from any other cause -- steam-boat on the father of water be expose to snag these snag be trunk of large tree that have become fasten in the bed of the river and be often find lie against the stream at angle of from 30 to 40 degree as the river vary much with regard to the quantity of water in its channel -- frequently rise or fall from 6 to 12 foot in a few hour -- these snag be sometimes so deep in the water that they can be pass over with safety at other time however they be but just cover if a boat come -- especially down the stream -- with high pressure and at full speed make between twenty and thirty mile a hour run against one of these firmly-fixed immoveable snag it sustain a fearful shock not unfrequently a large hole be thus make in the bottom and boat cargo crew passenger and all sink in a instant the danger be greatly increase by fog often so dense that the helmsman though situate on the hurricane-deck and over the fore part of the vessel can see nothing before he in such a case wise and cautious man lie to and wait till the mist have clear off may not these snag serve to remind we of certain character and circumstance with which we meet on the voyage of life who can not call to mind many snag -- man rugged stubborn and contentious -- snag by all means to be avoid d'israelus be the snag of peel -- russium be the snag of napoleon -- slavery be the snag of the evangelical alliance on board we steamer be a fine black young man who act as barber waiter and man-of-all-work curious to know whether he be a slave or not i request my friend from maine to sound he to whom do you belong say the baptist i belong to myself sir be the prompt and dignified reply that be right i involuntarily exclaim he be free in answer to further question he tell we that he be from new orlean and have buy himself about two year before for 600 dollar he could therefore truly say i belong to myself sir oh that every slave in america could say the same but how monstrous that a man should have to pay to one of he fellow-men upward of 120_l _ sterling in order to own himself land of liberty forsooth in the evening we reach vicksburg this place like nearly all other place in this region be deeply stain with deed of violence and blood a few year ago a set of thief and gambler be here put to death by lynch law gentleman of property and standing laugh the law -lrb- the constitutional law -rrb- to scorn rush to the gambler ' house put rope round they neck drag they through the street hang they in the public square and thus save the sum they have not yet pay thousand witness this wholesale murder yet of the score of legal officer present not a soul raise a finger to prevent it : the whole city consent to it and thus aid and abet it how many hundred of they help to commit the murder with they own hand do not appear but not one of they have be indict for it and no one make the least effort to bring they to trial thus up to the present hour the blood of those murder man rest on that whole city and it will continue to be a city of murderer so long as its citizen agree together to shield those felon from punishment darkness have cover the city of blood when we arrive and therefore we could not see it one of the passenger in step on a plank to go ashore fall into the water it be a frightful sight to see the dark figure of a fellow-man splattering and holloing in so perilous a position seldom can a person be save who fall into the mississippus so rapid be the current and moreover the bank be so steep that though he be a good swimmer he can not get up the knowledge of these fact generally destroy in the person who fall in all hope and self-command fortunately however in the present instance a rope be instantly throw out and the individual be save he assure we afterwards that some one have designedly push he from the plank into the water on the 13th of February we breast a small settlement on we left call providence in louisiana we observe on the river 's bank what a man at my elbow -lrb- a professor of religion who have discover a great propensity to talk about he religious experience before gambler -rrb- coolly designate a drive of horse mule and nigger observe the order of he enumeration of the nigger there be

mississippus say a manual of american slavery be stow away on the deck of steam-boat male and female old and young usually chained subject to the jeer and taunt of the passenger and navigator and often by bribe or threat or by the lash make subject to abomination not to be name on the same deck you may see horse and human being tenant of the same apartment and go to supply the same market the

do nothing but gamble eat drink smoke and spit from morning till night in the afternoon a dispute arise between two of they about ten dollar which the one maintain he have win from the other one of the two quickly draw out he bowie knife and would certainly have stab the other but for the intervention of the boat 's officer when the whites have so little hesitation in shed each other 's blood we

vicinity -rrb- and one of the negro it seem the overseer wish to chastise the negro for some offence and the negro resist and strike the overseer with a spade the overseer grapple with he and call

at 4 o'clock pm of February the 14th we reach the mouth of the arkansa this be a noble river navigable for 2000 mile not twenty year ago the remnant of the four great indian nation of the southern part of what be now the united state amount to about 75000 soul be urge to remove to the bank of this river with a assurance of a undisturbed and permanent home these four nation be the choctaw the chickasaw the creek and the cherokee they be establish upon a territory which they occupy before the settlement of any european in they vicinity and which have be confirm to they by solemn treaty again and again the anglo-american of the state of georgium alabama and mississippus be however annoy at they proximity because it be unfavourable to the peculiar institution of america slave occasionally make they escape to these child of the forest and find sympathy and succor this would not do the indian must be remove but how be it to be accomplish annoy they harass they wrong they in every possible way so that they may be sicken with the place georgium accordingly first attempt to establish a division line for the purpose of limit the boundary of the cherokee then in 1829 the state of alabama divide the creek territory into county and subject the indian population to the power of white magistrate and in 1830 the state of mississippus assimilate the chocktaw and chickasaw to the white population and declare that any one who should take the title of chief should be punish with a fine of 1000 dollar and a year 's imprisonment under these accumulate annoyance the cherokee on the 18th of December 1829 address to congress the follow powerful and touching appeal : -- by the will of we father in heaven the governor of the whole world the red man of america have become small and the white man great and renowned when the ancestor of the people of the united state first come to the shore of america they find the red man strong though he be ignorant and savage yet he receive they kindly and give they dry land to rest they weary foot they meet in peace and shake hand in token of friendship whatever the white man want and ask of the indian the latter willingly give at that time the indian be the lord and the white man the suppliant but now the scene have change the strength of the red man have become weakness as he neighbor increase in number he power become less and less and now of the many and powerful tribe who once cover the united state only a few be to be see -- a few whom a sweeping pestilence have leave the northern tribe who be once so numerous and powerful be now nearly extinct thus it have happen to the red man of america shall we who be remnant share the same fate oh no be the response beyond the great river mississippus say the president to they in 1829 where a part of you nation have go you father have provide a country large enough for all of you and he advise you to remove to it there you white brother will not trouble you : they will have no claim to the land and you can live upon it you and you child as long as the grass grow or the water run in peace and plenty _ it will be yours for ever _ with this assurance many leave the land of they birth and the home of they childhood travel hundred of mile cross the mississippus and settle on the bank of the arkansa m de tocqueville be assure towards the end of the year 1831 that 10000 indian have already go to the shore of the arkansa and fresh detachment be constantly follow they many however be unwilling to be thus expatriate the indian readily discover say m de tocqueville that the settlement which be propose to they be merely a temporary expedient who can assure they that they will at length be allow to dwell in peace in they new retreat the united state pledge themselves to the observance of the obligation but the territory which they at present occupy be formerly secure to they by the most solemn oath of anglo-american faith the american government do not indeed rob they of they land but it allow perpetual incursion to be make upon they in a few year the same white population which now flock around they will track they to the solitude of the arkansa : they will then be expose to the same evil without the same remedy and as the limit of the earth will at last fail they they only refuge be the grave the view of this keen french philosopher be prophetic in vain do i strain my eye as we pass along to discover any trace of these indian not one representative of those noble aborigine be to be see in 1836 arkansa be constitute a state and admit into the union and if you look at a recent map of the united state you will see the location of these indian mark not in the state of arkansa at all but far -- far beyond towards the setting sun

north -- all free state and virginium kentucky and tennessee on the south -- all slave state a trip on this river therefore afford a fine opportunity for observe the contrast between slavery and freedom the ohio be the great artery through which the inland commerce of the eastern state flow into the valley of the mississippus in ascend this river we have first on we leave the state of illinoi this territory which contain a area of 60000 square mile be settle by the french in 1720 and be admit into the union in 1818 its population in 1810 be 12300 in 1840 476180 it be now probably not far short of 1000000 on the 19th of February about noon we arrive at evansville on the indiana side of the river this be the prettiest place we have yet see and its charm be enhance by the assurance that it be free from the taint of slavery the rise of this little town have be rapid its population be about 3000 three church with they neat and graceful spire rise above the other building be conspicuous in the distance at 5 pm we pass owensborough on the kentucky side of the river this too be a neat little town with a proportionate number of place of worship indeed on every hand place of worship appear to rise simultaneously with the young settlement the free and efficient working of the voluntary principle be the glory of america in reference to church accommodation it everywhere appear to decide advantage compare to the most favored part of england on this subject dr baird 's book on religion in america be very truthful the fever leave I on enter the ohio and return no more -- a clear

new albany on the indiana side it be a flourish place with from 5000 to 6000 inhabitant just above this town be some fall in the ohio that can seldom be ascend by steamer which therefore pass through a side canal with lock form -lrb- through the superior influence of the slave-power -rrb- on the kentucky or slave bank of the river we have to pass through three lock which have be very foolishly make too small to receive steamer of the largest class in the navigation of the ohio ours fortunately not be of that class could go a-head at 5 pm we get to louisville a city of about 30000 or 40000 inhabitant on the kentucky side this city be a great depot for slave whence they be ship for the new orlean market by this mean it have acquire a detestable notoriety a trader be about to start from louisville kentucky say the _ anti-slavery record _ with one hundred slave for new orlean among they be two woman with infant at the breast know that these infant would depreciate the value of the mother the trader sell they for _ one dollar each _ another mother be separate from she sick child about four or five year old she anguish be so great that she sicken and die before reach she destination take another instance on the same authority : -- not very long ago in lincoln county kentucky a female slave be sell to a southern slaver under most afflicting circumstance she have at she breast a infant boy three month old the slaver do not want the child on any term the master sell the mother and retain the child she be hurry away immediately to the depot at louisville to be send down the river to the southern market the last news my informant have of she be that she be lie _ sick _ in the most miserable condition she breast have rise inflamed and _ burst _ let another case testify by the rev c renshaw add to the fame of this _ infamous _ city hughe and neil trade in slave down the river : they have buy up a part of they stock in the upper county of kentucky and bring they down to louisville where the remainder of they drive be in jail wait they arrival just before the steam-boat put off for the lower country two negro woman be offer for sale each of they have a child at the breast the trader buy they take they babe from they arm and offer they to the highest bidder and they be sell for one dollar a piece whilst the stricken parent be drive on board the boat and in a hour be on they way to the new orlean market you be aware that a young babe diminish the value of a field hand in the lower country while it enhance she value in the breed state February 21 -- another dreary sabbath on board the principal object of interest point out to we on that day be the residence and the tomb of the late president harrison the latter be a plain brick erection in the midst of a field on the top of a hill about half a mile in the rear of the former the recollection of that man so highly elevated and so quickly cut down could hardly fail to suggest a train of not unprofitable reflection he be i suppose a moral and well-meaning man distinguish for quality not often to be find in high place but i be sorry to be oblige to infer that much of what i have hear respect the _ religiousness _ of he character want confirmation at half-past 4 pm we arrive at the long-wished-for cincinnatus -- the queen of the west we voyage from new orlean have thus occupy twelve day during which time we have be board and lodge as well as convey over a space of 1550 mile for 12 dollar each or one dollar per diem it be the cheapest and -lrb- apart from the companionship -rrb- the most pleasant mode of travel we have ever experience as the boat stay but a couple of hour at cincinnatus we have to land without delay be a stranger in a strange land i inquire for the congregational minister and be tell that he name be boynton in perambulate the street in search of he house i be please to see but one shop open it be a tailor 's and as i afterwards learn belong to a jew who close it on saturday the law of the state compelling all to close they shop one day in the week in every street we be strike with the glorious liberty enjoy by the pig on all hand the swinish multitude be see luxuriate in unrestricted freedom mr boynton who receive we kindly do not know of any place where we could be accommodate with private board and lodging but promise to make inquiry that evening he be a man of about forty year of age wear on the sabbath and even in the pulpit -lrb- as most american minister do -rrb- a black neckerchief and shirt-collar turn down over it that night we have to go to a hotel and be recommend to the denison house which we find pretty cheap and comfortable but the american hotel be not in point of comfort to be compare for a moment to those of old england my wife be too tired to go out in the evening and unwilling for my own part to close the sabbath without go to some place of public worship i think i would try to find the sanctuary of my brethren -- my kinsman accord to the flesh -- the welsh follow the direction i have receive i arrive at the top of a certain street when i hear the sound of sacred song but i could not tell whether it be welsh or not nor exactly whence it come as i stand listen a overgrown boy come by of whom i inquire where do that singing come from -- i _ guess _ it come from a church down below there be it a welsh church -- i can not tell but i _ guess _ it be well then i rejoin i _ guess _ i will go and see i turn and the youth guess he would follow I i get to the door the singing have not cease it _ be _ welsh -- the language in which i have first hear _ be geidwad i ' r colledig _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- how interesting in the far west to hear sound so sweet and so familiar to my childhood none but those who have experience can tell the charm of such a incident the minister be in the pulpit he dress and hair be very plain and he complexion be extremely dark he be evidently a welshman : there be no mistake about it : he gravity plainness attitude -- all tell the fact i venture forward and walk along to the stove which to I be a object of agreeable attraction around the stove be two or three chair a big aristocratic-looking welshman a sort of a blaenor who occupy one of these chair invite I to take another that be vacant the eye of all in the synagogue be upon I my guess informant have follow I even there though he evidently understand not a word of welsh the building be about 40 foot by 35 without gallery and be about two-third full the pulpit be fit up in the platform style -- the genuine american mode the text be how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation the sermon be good and faithful the audience -- the man on one side of the chapel and the woman on the other -- do not excite much interest the man especially be among the worst hearer i have ever see i feel ashamed of my countryman the spitting be incessant and attend with certain unmentionable circumstance which render it most disgusting and offensive what a contrast to my own clean and comely congregation of black and colored people in new amsterdam in about twenty minute after the preacher have begin he sermon one-half of the man have they head down rest on both arm fold on the top of the pew before they whether they be asleep or not the attitude be that of deep sleep this behavior be grossly rude -- to say nothing of the apathetic state of mind which it indicate i wonder how the preacher could get on at all with such hearer before he i be sorry to say that the welsh too frequently manifest a great want of decorum and devotion in they religious assembly this be tell and will tell against dissent in the principality -lrb- footnote 1 : literally of a savior for the lose -rrb- letter xvi stay

another welsh phrase -rrb- to preach there some night during the come week and he wish it to be announce there and then to which i would not consent he introduce I to mr jone the minister after most of the congregation be go a groupe include my big friend and mr jone collect around I and most earnestly press for my publication i tell they i have never be a welsh preacher that it be nearly five-and-twenty year since i have leave the principality and that moreover _ i could not _ preach at all to man who put down they head in the sluggish and sleepy manner in which most of they man have do that night oh but they will not do so when you a stranger preach be the reply then i say there must be a great want of true devotion among they if that would make all the difference however be much press i promise at last to give they before i leave the city a little missionary information in welsh the name of my big friend be bebb a near relative as i subsequently learn of he excellency w bebb

and a population of 2000000 mr jone the minister be intimately acquaint with mr bebb who carefully instruct she distinguished son in the good old language of wale so that at the time of he recent canvass for office he be able to address the cambrian portion of he constituency in they mother tongue on enter into office he declare he determine opposition to the black law of ohio those black law be black indeed they be the foul blot of this otherwise honor state one of they be intend to prevent the color citizen of other state from remove to ohio it be enact in 1807 and be to this effect -- that within twenty day after the entrance of a emigrant into the state he be to find two freehold surety in the sum of 500 dollar for he _ good behavior _ and likewise for he _ maintenance _ should he at any future period be unable to maintain himself the legislature well know that it would be utterly impossible generally speak for a _ black _ or _ color _ stranger to find such security in 1800 there be only 337 free black in the territory but in 1830 notwithstanding the black law there be 9500 a large portion of they enter in entire ignorance of this iniquitous law and some perhaps in bold defiance of it but it have by no means remain a dead letter in 1829 a very general effort be make to enforce it -- about 1000 free black be drive from the state to take refuge in the more free and christian country of canada sir j colebrook the governor of upper canada say to the color deputation that wait upon he tell the _ republican _ on you side of the line that we royalist do not know man by they color should you come to we you will be entitle to all the privilege of the rest of he majesty 's subject a noble sentiment and one calculate to make a _ britisher _ proud of he country particularly since the abolition of slavery in we other colony at the time these people be thus drive away the state of ohio contain but 23 inhabitant to one square mile in 1838 official notice be give to the inhabitant of the town of fairfield in ohio that all black or mulatto person reside there be to comply with the requirement of the law of 1807 within twenty day or it would be enforce against they the proclamation address the _ white _ inhabitant in the follow remarkable term : whites look out if any person or person _ employ _ any black or mulatto person contrary to the 3rd section of this law you may look out for the breaker at the very time i be in ohio a attempt be make in mercer county to eject by force a number of inoffensive black people originally slave in virginium they have be liberate by the will of they late master and located on a suitable quantity of land which he have secure for they but the magnanimous and liberty-boasting american would not allow they to enjoy they little settlement unmolested and it be extremely doubtful whether the governor would be able to protect they from outrage in 1839 a number of color inhabitant of ohio address a respectful petition to the legislature pray for the removal of certain legal disability under which they be labor the answer be a denial not merely of the _ prayer _ of the petition but of the very _ right _ of petition resolve that the black and mulatto who may be resident within this state have no constitutional right to present they petition to the general assembly for any purpose whatsoever and that any reception of such petition on the part of the general assembly be a mere act of privilege or policy and not impose by any express or imply power of the constitution but the _ blackest _ of these black law be the following : that no black or mulatto person or person shall hereafter be permit to be swear or give evidence in any court of record or elsewhere in this state in any cause depend or matter of controversy when either party to the same be a _ white _ person or in any prosecution of the state against any _ white _ person under such a law a white man may with perfect impunity defraud or abuse a negro to any extent provide that he be careful to avoid the presence of any of he own caste at the execution of he contract or the commission of he crime to these black law governor bebb have avow a uncompromising hostility but the first session of the state legislature after he election have just close and the black law be still in force mr bebb be not sufficiently support in he just and humane intention to enable he to carry those intention out i be assure however by those who know he well that he be only bide he time be as determine as ever to wipe away from the statute-book every remnant of these foul enactment if he succeed the poor old welsh-woman in she obscurity and widowhood will have render a important service to the cause of humanity and justice let mother think of this and be encourage the day after we arrival in cincinnatus be the 22nd of February we obtain by the aid of dr weed -lrb- one of mr boynton 's deacon -rrb- a suitable private

invite I to go up some day to see lane seminary about two mile off to this invitation i readily accede i be greatly interested in this veteran of whose fame i have so often hear February 23rd -- in the evening i go to a meeting of the democratic party in the town-hall think it would afford I a good opportunity for observe american manners the place be full and when i arrive a gentleman be address the meeting with great vehemence of tone and gesture he speech consist of innumerable change ring on the sentiment -- there must be a vigorous prosecution of the war against mexico but i must reserve any further account of this meeting for my next letter letter xvii stay at cincinnatus -lrb- continue -rrb- -- the democratic meeting -- a visit to lane seminary -- public declamation -- poem on war -- essay on education in resume my notice of the democratic meeting let I observe that the democratic party in america be not very reputable it be the war party the pro-slavery party the mob

by thoma corwin esq one of the ohio senator this meeting then be intend as a demonstration in favor of polk and he policy but it turn out a miserable failure when the bluster speaker who have the floor when i enter sit down the president -lrb- for they do not say the chairman -rrb- rise amidst a tremendous storm of favorite name utter simultaneously by all present at the top of they voice and as soon as he could be hear say it have be move and second that so-and-so esq be request to address the meeting : those who be in favor of that motion be to say ay -- those against it no one great ay

he green isle and land on one of the quay at liverpool but john brough again decline the honor confer upon he then it be move and second and aye that so-and-so esq be request to address the meeting but _ he _ also be not forthcoming _ nil desperandum _ it be move and second and aye that -- callaghan esq be request to address the meeting after some hesitation and a reference to he own proverbial modesty he proceed to foam and stamp and thump and bluster for the vigorous prosecution of the war till the american eagle should stretch he wing over the hall of the montezuma at this stage of the proceedings the spitting and smoke have become so offensive that i be compel to retire and i do so with no very high notion of the intelligence and respectability of the american democrat the next day be fine and frosty and the road hard i set off in the morning to pay my intended visit to lane seminary i find it a long two mile all up hill the seminary itself the building in which the student be accommodate be a large plain brick edifice four story high besides the basement-story and have very much the appearance of a small lancashire factory it be 100 foot long by about 40 foot wide and contain 84 room for student the situation be pleasant and at a nice distance from the roadside a large bell be be toll awkwardly when i arrive it be 11 o'clock be i find the front door throw wide open with every indication of its be enter by all comer without the least ceremony -- not even that of wipe the shoe there be neither door-bell nor knocker scraper nor mat and the floor of the lobby seem but slightly acquaint with the broom -- to say nothing of the scrubbing-brush it look like the floor of a corn or provision warehouse i have no alternative but to venture in immediately after there enter a young man with a fowling-piece whom before i have see at a little distance watch the movement of a flock of wild pigeon i take he for a sportsman but he be a young divine i ask he if dr beecher be about he reply that he guess not but he would be at the lecture-room in a few minute for the bell that have just toll be a summons to that room do the doctor then say i deliver a lecture this morning -- no it be _ declamation _ this morning be it such a exercise i continue as a stranger may attend -- oh yes he reply it be _ public _ declamation he then direct I to the lecture-room it be across the yard and under the chapel belong to the institution this chapel be a very neat building after the model of a grecian temple have the roof in front carry out and support by six well-proportioned column in the form of a portico in a part of the basement-story be the lecture-room in question the student be muster by-and-by dr stowe enter he invite I to take a chair by he side on a kind of platform professor allen then come in and after he dr beecher the exercise begin with a short prayer by mr allen he then call upon a mr armstrong one of the student to ascend the platform the young man obey and somewhat abruptly and vehemently rehearse from memory a poem on war suit the action to the word he begin -- _ on _ -- to the glorious conflict -- on it quite startle I soon afterwards i hear -- and montezuma 's hall shall _ ring _ what -lrb- reason i -rrb- be this the sequel to the democratic meeting of last night have mar who preside at the town-hall a seat in the lecture-room of this theological seminary as the young man proceed however i perceive that he poem be in fact a denunciation of the horror of war -- not as i have suppose the composition of another person commit to memory and now rehearse as a exercise in elocution but entirely he own it be altogether a creditable performance the professor at the close make they criticism upon it which be all highly favourable dr beecher say my only criticism be _ print it print it _ the venerable doctor with the natural partiality of a tutor afterwards observe to I he have never hear anything against war that take so strong a hold of he feeling as that poem dr stowe also tell I that mr armstrong be consider a young man of fine talent and great devotion and that some of the student have facetiously say brother armstrong be so pious that even the dog would not bark at he mr armstrong be not at all disposed to take he tutor 's advice but he favor I with a copy of he poem on condition that i would not cause it to be print in america -- in england i might it contain some turgid expression some halting and prosaic line and might be improve by a severe revision but besides its interest as a transatlantic college-exercise i feel it possess sufficient merit to relieve the tediousness of my own prose ' _ on _ -- to the glorious conflict -- on ' -- be hear throughout the land while flash column thick and strong sweep by with swell band ` we country right or wrong ' they shout ` shall still we motto he : with _ this _ we be prepare to rout we foe from sea to sea we own right arm to we

education it be clever and indicate a mind of a high order but be too playful and the performance be severely criticise here end the public declamation letter xviii visit to lane seminary -lrb- continued -rrb- -- dr beecher and he gun -- the college library -- dr stowe and he hebrew class -- history of lane seminary -- qualification for admission -- the curriculum -- manual labor -- expense of education -- result -- equality of professor and student the public declamation end dr beecher ask I to accompany he to he house it be about a eighth of a mile from the institution over a very bad road or rather over no road at all he conduct I into a snug little sitting-room have no grate but a wood fire on the floor under the chimney it look primitive and homely this style of fire be not uncommon in america the log of wood lie across two horizontal bar of iron by which they be raise four or six inch from the floor the doctor 's first care be to replenish the fire with a few sturdy piece of wood all through the state i have observe that the task of feed the fire generally devolve on the head of the family in this little room i be introduce to mr beecher she be i believe the third lady on whom the doctor have confer he name in one corner of this apartment be a gun and on the sofa a heap of shot thousand of wild pigeon be fly about the visit of these bird make the doctor very uneasy he be ever and anon snatch up he gun and go out to have a pop at they though upward of seventy year of age he be a excellent marksman it be to I a little odd to see a venerable dd a professor of theology handle a fowling-piece the american have by circumstance be train to great skill in the use of fire-arm the gun however prove a fatal instrument in the hand of one of the doctor 's son a young man of great promise who be kill by the accidental explosion of one nevertheless dr beecher have five son all -lrb- like himself -rrb- in the ministry he have a maiden daughter who have distinguish herself by she literary attainment and active benevolence the excellent and accomplished wife of dr stowe be also a miss beecher at 1 o'clock pm we dine the professor never dine or take any other meal with the assemble student this be a disadvantage but in america eating under any circumstance be not so sociable a matter as in england after dinner i take my leave of dr beecher and go to see the library of the institution this be over the chapel but so arrange as not at all to detract from the just proportion of the building indeed no one would suspect that there be a story above this library be collect with great care and judgment by dr stowe in england and on the continent of europe and contain 10000 volume the library-room be capable of receive 30000 volume but even now it be the largest library on this side the allegany mountain it comprise not only the standard work in all the department of a theological course but also a very rich variety of author in general literature and science the book be arrange in alcove accord to they character -- theology -- biblical literature -- classic -- history -- philosophy and so forth there be a society of inquiry in connection with the seminary which have a distinct library of 326 volume the reading room and athenaeum be furnish with 21 newspaper and several of the best literary and theological periodical from the library my guide -lrb- one of the student -rrb- lead I down into the lecture-room where professor stowe be engage with a hebrew class they be read in the song of solomon the exhibition do not strike I as much superior to what we use to have at rotherham college ten or twelve year ago in point of domestic _ comfort _ the latter be incomparably before lane seminary and in literary advantage not far behind professor stowe kindly drive I back to cincinnatus in he buggy or waggon or phaeton lane seminary be a institution devoted entirely to theological education in connection with the new-school presbyterian the building include chapel and library cost about 50000 dollar or 10000_l _ and must have be very cheap at that in 1828-30 ebenezer lane esq and he brother andrew lane esq

a large portion be give by john tappan esq of boston a literary department be organize in 1829 which be discontinue in 1834 at which period the institution in its full operation as a theological seminary may be say to have commence since then it have send forth about 250 minister candidate for admission must produce satisfactory testimonial that they be member in good standing of some christian church that they possess competent talent and that they have regularly graduate at some college or university or have pursue a course of study equivalent to the common college course the

examination dr andrew reed who visit lane seminary in 1834 refer to it as a _ model _ manual-labour institution with the advancement of society around it have lose in a great measure that peculiarity there be now but little do in that way though it be still record in italics among its regulation that every student be expect to labor three hour a day at some agricultural or mechanical business while the lead aim of this regulation it be add be to promote health and vigor of both body and mind compensation be receive accord to the value of the labor no charge be make for tuition room be fully furnish and rent at 5 dollar a year from each student the incidental expense include fuel and light for public room ring the bell and sweeping be 5 dollar more the room-rent and incidental bill be pay in advance for the aid of indigent student fund be collect annually by means of which board be furnish to such gratuitously to those who receive no assistance from the fund the price of board be about 90 cent a week the cost of fuel and light for each student in he own room will average from 8 to 12 dollar a year thus the entire expense to a young man for a whole term of nine month be only from 50 to 60 dollar or from 10 to 12 guinea of we money the result of these thirteen year of labor say the trustee in a document recently issue consider the difficulty attend the establishment of such a institution in a new country amid a population as yet unassimilated in feeling and habit and whose school academy and college be of comparatively recent origin be indeed highly encourage the friend of the institution and of religion and learn generally thankful for what have already be accomplish will feel encouraged to do whatever may be necessary for the highest efficiency of the seminary and will give they prayer that the labor of the 300 young man who have enjoy or now enjoy its advantage -lrb- there be about 50 then in the house -rrb- may be abundantly bless by the head of the church lane seminary be a valuable and catholic institution at they entrance the student have to subscribe to no confession of faith and when they have complete they curriculum they be at perfect liberty to exercise they ministry among whatever denomination they please congregational as well as presbyterial church obtain pastor from this school of the prophet the faculty at present consist of the rev lyman beecher dd president and professor of theology the rev calvin e stowe dd professor of biblical literature and lecturer on church history and the rev d howe allen professor of sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology and lecturer on church polity nothing strike I more than the feeling of equality that seem to subsist between student and professor the latter in speak to or of any of the former would generally say brother so-and-so the student also in they bearing towards the professor seem each to say i be as good a man as you be this be the genius of america you meet it everywhere there man be man -lrb- except he skin be black -rrb- and he expect to be treat as such respect to superior be not among the maxim of we transatlantic brethren the organ of veneration be perhaps imperfectly develop letter xix a sabbath at cincinnatus -- the second presbyterian church -- mutilation of a popular hymn -- the rush habit -- a wrong guess -- a german sunday-school -- visit to a church of color people -- engagement at the welsh church -- monthly concert -- the medical college of ohio -- tea at the house of a color minister on the previous Friday professor allen call to request I to preach in he stead at the second presbyterian church on Sunday morning the 28th of February as he have to go some twenty mile into the country to assist at a revival i agree to do so Sunday morning be excessively cold with a heavy fall of snow on arrive at the church i find there be no vestry indeed a vestry as a private room for the minister be seldom find in america the place be exceedingly neat and comfortable but they want _ that _ convenience i have therefore to go with my hat and top-coat cover with snow right into the pulpit this church outside be a noble-looking building with massive pillar in front and a bell-tower contain a town-clock but the interior seem comparatively small it have a gallery at one end which hold only the singer and the organ the seat below be not more than one-third full dr beecher minister in this place for about ten year it be now without a pastor but be temporarily supply by professor allen the congregation be far more decorous and attentive than those in new orlean after the introductory service and while the hymn before sermon be be sing a man come trudge down the aisle bear a immense scuttle full of coal to supply the stove how easy it would have be before service to place a box of fuel in the vicinity of each stove and thereby avoid this unseemly bustle but in the singing of the hymn i find something to surprise and offend I even more than the coal-scuttle the hymn be -- o'er the gloomy hill of darkness & c i have select it myself but when i get to the second verse where i have expect to find let the indian let the negro let the rude barbarian see & c lo the indian and the negro have vanish and let the dark benighted pagan be substitute a wretched alteration -- as feeble and tautological in effect as it be suspicious in design the altered reading i learn prevail universally in america except in the _ original _ version use by the welsh congregation slave-holder and the abettor of that horrid system which make it a crime to teach a negro to read the word of god feel perhaps that they could not devoutly and consistently sing let the indian let the negro & c this church i hear be more polluted with a pro-slavery feeling than any other in cincinnatus of the same denomination -- a circumstance which i believe have something to do with dr beecher 's resignation of the pastorate at the close of the sermon have pronounce the benediction i engage accord to we english custom in a short act of private devotion when i raise my head and open my eye the very last man of the congregation be actually make he exit through the doorway and it be quite as much as i could manage to put on my top-coat and glove and reach the door before the sexton close it this rush habit in the house of god strike a stranger as rude and irreverent you meet with no indication of private devotion either precede or follow public worship a man march into he pew or he pulpit sit down wipe he nose and stare at all about he and at the close the moment the aman be utter he be off with as much speed as if the house be on fire in this instance the service have not exceed a hour and a half and yet they hurry out as if they think the beef be all burnt and the pudding all spoil of course there be no thanks to the stranger for he service -- to say nothing of the _ quiddam honorarium _ which to a man travel for health at he own expense with a invalid wife might have be suppose not unacceptable when however i get to the portico outside a gentleman with he wife be wait to see I before they step into they carriage here be some token of politeness and hospitality -- a invitation to dinner no doubt -- thank you sir i be very much oblige to you but i leave my wife very ill at we lodgings this morning and therefore i can not have the pleasure to dine with you to-day be the civil excuse i be prepare never be expectation more beside the mark my guess be altogether wrong what be you go to do with yourself this afternoon be the gentleman 's blunt salutation what have _ you _ to propose sir be my reply i be the superintendent he say of a german sunday-school in the upper part of the city and i should like you to come and address the child this afternoon i promise to go and he to send to my lodgings for I we both keep we appointment the number of scholar be about 100 this effort to bring the german under a right religious influence be very laudable for there be about 10000 of that people in cincinnatus one quarter of the city be entirely german you see nothing else on the sign-board you hear nothing else in the street of these german the greater part be roman catholic after visit the school i find myself in time to attend one of the chapel of the color people at 3 pm a medical student whom i have meet in the morning and again at the german school accompany I he be a new englander and a thorough anti-slavery man when we get to the chapel -- a baptist one -- they be at prayer walking in softly we enter a pew right in the midst of they the minister -- a mulatto of about thirty year of age with a fine intelligent eye -- be very simple in dress and unostentatious in manner he language too be appropriate and correct he be evidently a man of good common sense he text be psalm li l2 l3 he refer very properly to the occasion on which the psalm be compose and draw from the text a large mass of sound practical instruction the chapel -lrb- capable of contain about 150 people -rrb- be only half-full before the sermon i have observe a very old negro in a large shabby camlet cloak and a black cap ascend the pulpit-stairs i suppose that be dull of hear he have take that position that he might better listen to the service however when the sermon be over this patriarchal-looking black man rise to pray and he pray like a bishop with astonishing correctness and fluency he be formerly a slave in kentucky and be at this time about eighty year of age they call he father watkin at the close i introduce myself to he and to the minister they both express regret that they have not have I up in the pulpit to tell they something as father watkin say about they brother and sister on the other side of the water the minister give I he card and invite I and my wife to take tea with he on Tuesday afternoon this be the first invitation i receive within the city of cincinnatus to take a meal anywhere and it be the more interesting to I as come from a color man in the evening i go accord to appointment to the welsh chapel there i meet a mr bushnel a american

facility afford for professional education in the afternoon my wife and myself go to take tea with the color minister he dwelling though small and humble be neat and clean with he intelligence and general information we be quite delighted he speak with feeling of the gross insult to which the color people even in this free state be expose when they travel by railway though they pay the same fare as other people they be generally put in the luggage-van he have himself when on board of steam-boat often be send to the pantry to eat he food nor will the white people employ they but in the most menial office so that it be nearly impossible for they to rise to affluence and horse-and-gig respectability the consequence be that they be deeply and justly disaffected towards the american people and the american law they clearly understand that england be they friend for one month all the free colored people wear crape as mourning for thoma clarkson letter xx stay at cincinnatus -lrb-

cincinnatus be roman catholic they have lately discontinue the use of public government-school for they child and have establish some of they own i be not so much alarm at the progress of popery in america as i be before i visit that country its proselyte be exceedingly few its supporter consist chiefly of the thousand of european already roman catholic who flock to the new world the real _ progress _ of popery be greater in britain than in america in the evening i preach for mr boynton in the sixth-street church mr boynton and he church heretofore presbyterian have recently become congregationalist this have give great umbrage to the presbyterian congregationalism be rapidly gain ground in the western world and seem destine there as in england since cromwell 's time to swallow up presbyterianism i make no invidious comparison between the two system : i merely look at fact and it do appear to I that congregationalism -- so simple so free so unsectarian and so catholic -- be nevertheless a powerful absorbent it _ have _ absorb all that be orthodox in the old presbyterian church of england and it _ be _ absorb the calvinistic methodist and the church name after the countess of huntingdon it have all along exert a powerful influence on the presbyterianism of america the congregational element diffused among those church occasion the division of the presbyterian church into old school and new school mr boynton be what a friend of mine call intensely american he have lately publish under the title of we country the herald of a new era a lecture deliver before the young man 's mercantile library association to show the magnificent idea the american entertain of themselves and they country i will transcribe a few passage this nation be a enigma whose import no man as yet may fully know she be a germ of boundless thing the unfold bud excite the hope of one-half the human race while it stir the remainder with both anger and alarm who shall now paint the beauty and attraction of the expand flower we eagle be scarcely fledge but one wing stretch over massachusett bay and the other touch the mouth of the columbium who shall say then what land shall be overshadow by the full-grown pinion who shall point to any spot of the northern continent and say with certainty here the starry banner shall never be hail as the symbol of dominion -lrb- the annexation of canada -rrb- \* \* \* it can not be disguise that the idea be gather strength among we that the territorial mission of this nation be to obtain and hold at least all that lie north of panama \* \* \* whether the million that be to dwell on the great pacific slope of we continent be to acknowledge we banner or rally to standard of they own whether mexico be to become ours by sudden conquest or gradual absorption whether the british province when they pass from beneath the sceptre of england shall be incorporate with we or retain a independent dominion -- be perhaps question which a not distant future may decide however they may be settle the great fact will remain essentially the same that the two continent of this western hemisphere shall yet bear up a stupendous social political and religious structure work by the american mind mould and color by the hue of american thought and animated and unite by a american soul it seem equally certain that whatever the division of territory may be these unite state be the living center from which already flow the resistless stream which will ultimately absorb in its own channel and bear on its own current the whole thought of the two america \* \* \* if then i have not over-rated the moral and intellectual vigor of the people of this nation and of the policy lately avow to be act upon -- that the further occupation of american soil by the government of europe be not to be suffer -- then the inference be a direct one that the stronger element will control and absorb the lesser so that the same cause which melt the red race away will send the influence of the united state not only over the territory north of panama but across the isthmus and southward to magellan the new era of which america be the herald be he tell we to be mark by three grand characteristic -- first a new theory and practice in government and in social life such as the world have never see of which we only perceive the germ as yet already have you indeed present before the world you peculiar institution of slavery in a light new and striking already have you a theory and practice in the government of slave such as the world never behold second a literature which shall not only be the proper outgrowth of the american mind but which shall form a distinctive school as clearly so as the literature of greece under this head he say very much would i prefer that we literature should appear even in the guise of the awkward speculate guess but still original strong-minded _ american _ yankee than to see it mince in the costume of a london dandy i would rather see it if need be show the wild rough strength the naturalness and fervor of the extreme west equally prepare to liquor with a stranger or to fight with he than to see it clothe in the gay but filthy garment of the saloon of pari nay more much as every right mind abhor and detest such thing i would sooner behold we literature hold in one hand the murderous bowie knife and in the other the pistol of the duellist than to see she laden with the foul secret of a london hell or the gaming-house of paris \* \* \* if we must meet with vice in we literature let it be the growth of we own soil for i think we own rascality have yet the healthier aspect third a new era in the fine art from which future age shall derive they model and they inspiration as we do from greece and italy \* \* \* so far as scenery be concern in the moulding of character we may safely expect that a country where vastness and beauty be so wonderfully blended will stamp upon the national soul its own magestic and glorious image it must be so the mind will expand itself to the measure of thing about it deep in the wide american soul there shall be lake superior inland ocean of thought and the stream of she eloquence shall be like the sweep of the mississippus in he strength the rugged strength of the new england hill the luxuriance of the sunny south the measureless expanse of the prairie the broad flow of we river the dashing of we cataract the huge battlements of the everlasting mountain -- these be _ american _ on the face of the globe there be nothing like to they when therefore these various influence have be thoroughly work into the national soul there will be such a correspondence between man and the work of god about he that we music we poetry we eloquence we all shall be we own individual and peculiar like the amazon and the ande the mississippus and niagara alone in they strength and glory now mark you amidst all these splendid vision of the future there be no vision of liberty for 3000000 of slave that idea be too small to find a place among conception so vast the lecture contain not a syllable of reference to they on the contrary the empty boast of freedom be hear in the follow word of solemn mockery : _ the soul of man _ here no longer sit _ bind _ and blind amid the despotic form of the past it walk abroad _ without a shackle _ and with a uncovered eye it follow then that there be a essential difference between the soul of man and the soul of nigger or rather that nigger have no soul at all how _ can _ man of sense and especially minister of the gospel sit down to pen such fustian these extract show how intensely national the american be and consequently how futile the apology for the existence of slavery so often present that one state can no more interfere with the affair of another state than the people of england can with france and the other country of the european continent the american be to all intent and purpose _ one _ people in short the identity of feeling among the _ state _ of the union be more complete than among the _ county _ of great britain on the morning of the 4th of march dr stowe call to invite I to address the student at lane seminary on the follow sabbath evening on the subject of mission and the working of freedom in the west indy i readily promise to comply glad of a opportunity to address

height and with a look of horror and indignation -rrb- -- indeed we would _ myself _ -- oh shocking shocking _ the lady _ -- oh there be another asylum for the colored child they be not neglect _ myself _ -- ay but why should they not be together -- why should there be such a distinction between the child of we common father _ the lady _ -lrb- in a tone of triumph -rrb- -- why have god make such a distinction between they _ myself _ -- and why have he make such a distinction between I and tom thumb or -lrb- for i be not very tall -rrb- why have he make I a man of 5 foot 6 inch instead of

say that she be oppose to slavery -- be a colonizationist and heartily wish all the color people be back again in they own country in they own country indeed i be go to say -- why this be they country as much as it be yours but i remember my wife 's admonition and hold my peace these be the sentiment of a lady first and foremost in the charitable movement of the day and regard by those around she as a pattern of piety and benevolence she be shock at the notion of the poor color orphan mingle with fellow-orphan of a fairer hue in the evening we go to take tea at the house of a english quaker about half-a-dozen friend have be invite to meet we these be kindred spirit anti-slavery out-and-out and we spend the evening very pleasantly one of the company in speaking of the american prejudice against color mention a remarkable circumstance some time ago at a hotel in one of the eastern state a highly respectable color gentleman well know to the host and to he guest be about to sit down at the dinner table a military officer -- a conceited puppy -- ask the landlord if that nigger be go to sit down the landlord reply in the affirmative then say the fop _ i _ can not sit down with a nigger the rest of the company understand what be go forward rise as one man from they seat order another table to be spread and present a respectful invitation to the color gentleman to take a seat with they the military dandy be leave at the first table alone in he glory when thus humble and when he also understand who the color man be he go up to he to apologize in the best way he could and to beg that the offence might be forget the color gentleman 's reply be beautiful and touching -- favor i write on marble insult on sand on the morning of the 5th of march the sun shine pleasantly we be tempt to cross over to covington on the kentucky or slave side of the river ferry-steamer run every five or ten minute and the fare be only 5 cent at this place the baptist have a large and important college why do they erect it on the slave rather than on the free side of the ohio this institution i be anxious to see but i find it too far off and the road too bad feeling weary and faint we call at a house of refreshment where we have a genuine specimen of american inquisitiveness in five minute the daughter of the house have ask we where we come from -- what sort of a place it be -- how long we have be in the united state -- how long it take we to come -- how far we be go -- how long we should stay -- and if we do not like that part of america so well that we would come and settle in it altogether and in five minute more we answer to all these important question have be duly report to the rest of the family in a adjoining room this inquisitiveness prevail more in the slave than in the free state and originate i believe in the fidgetty anxiety they feel about they slave the stranger must be well catechised lest he should prove to be a abolitionist come to give the slave a sly lesson in geography in the afternoon i go to see the school of the colored child in cincinnatus this be establish about four year ago by a mr gilmore a white gentleman who be also a minister of the gospel he be a man of some property and all connect with this school have be do at he own risk and responsibility on my venture to inquire what sacrifice of property he have make in the undertaking he seem hurt at the question and reply no sacrifice whatever sir but what may i ask have these operation cost beyond what you have receive in the way of school-fee i continue about 7000 dollar -lrb- 1500_l _ -rrb- say he include two or three branch there be about 300 colored child thus educate mr gilmore be at first much oppose and ridicule but that state of feeling be begin to wear away several of the child be so fair that accustomed as i be to shades of color i could not distinguish they from the anglo-saxon race and yet mr gilmore tell I even they would not have be admit to the other public school how discerning the american be how proud of they skin-deep aristocracy and the author of cincinnatus in 1841 in speaking of those very school from which these fair child be exclude say these school be found not merely on the principle that all man be free and equal but that all man 's child be so likewise and that as it be we duty to love we neighbor as ourselves it be we duty to provide the same benefit and blessing to he child as to we own these establishment result from the recognition of the fact also that we have all a common interest -- moral political and pecuniary -- in the education of the whole community those gloriously exclusive school i have no wish to visit but i feel a peculiar pleasure in visit this humbler yet well-conducted institution for the benefit of those who be despise and degrade on account of they color as i enter a music-master be teach they with the aid of a piano to sing some select piece for a approach examination both the instrument and the master have be provide by the generous gilmore even the music-master notwithstanding he first-rate ability suffer considerable loss of patronage on account of he service in this branded school

present century find here but 750 inhabitant in 1810 there be 2540 in 1820 9602 in 1830 24381 in 1840 46382 at present the population be estimate at 80000 the color population form one twenty-fifth or 4 per cent of the whole the native european form one-fifth of the white population 2 _ its trade and commerce _ -- the principal trade be in pork hence the nickname of _ porkapoli _ the yearly value of pork packed and export be about five million of dollar or one million of guinea as a proof of the amazing activity which characterize all the detail of cut cure packing & c i have be credibly inform that two man in one of the pork-houses cut up in less than thirteen hour 850 hog average 300 lb each -- two other place they on the block for the purpose all these hog be weigh singly on scale in the course of eleven hour another hand trim the ham 1700 piece in cincinnatus style as fast as they be separate from the carcase the hog be thus cut up and disposed of at the rate of more than one per minute and this i be tell be not much beyond the ordinary day 's work at the pork-houses steam-boat building be another important branch of trade in this place dollar in 1840 there be build here 33 boat of 15341 ton cost 592600 1844 37 7838 542500 1845 27 6609 506500 3 _ its periodical press _ -- there be sixteen daily papers of these thirteen issue also a weekly number besides these there be seventeen weekly papers unconnected with daily issue but cincinnatus be liberal in she patronage of eastern publication during the year 1845 one house that of robinson and jone the principal periodical depot in the city and through which the great body of the people be supply with this sort of literature sell of magazine and periodical 29822 number newspaper 25390 -lrb- 1 -rrb- serial

single copy of such papers be only 2 cent or one penny and many papers be only one cent or a half-penny per copy 4 _ its church accommodation _ -- by the close of the year 1845 the voluntary principle without any governmental or municipal aid whatever have provide the follow place of worship : -- presbyterian 12 new jerusalem 1 methodist episcopal 12 universalist 1 roman catholic 7 second advent 1 baptist 5 mormon 1 lutheran 5 friend 1 protestant episcopal 4 congregational 1 christian disciple 4 restorationist 1 methodist protestant 3 unite brethren 1 jewish 2 christian 1 welsh 2 german reform 2 total 67 this number of place of worship at a average of 600 person to each would afford accommodation for nearly two-third of what the entire population be at that time and surely two-third of any community be quite as large a proportion as can under the most favourable circumstance be expect to attend place of worship at any give time behold then the strength and efficiency of the voluntary principle this young city with all its want be far better furnish with place of worship than the generality of commercial and manufacturing town in england dr reed visit cincinnatus in 1834 he give the population at that time at 30000 and the place of worship as follow i insert they that you may see at a glance what the voluntary principle do in the eleven year that follow presbyterian 6 campbellite baptist 1 methodist 4 jew 1 baptist 2 -- episcopalian 2 total in 1834 21 german lutheran 2 do in 1845 67 unitarian 1 -- roman catholic 1 increase 46 swede 1 5 _ its future prospects _ -- the author of cincinnatus in 1841 say i venture the prediction that within 100 year from this time cincinnatus will be the greatest city in america and by the year of we lord 2000 the greatest city in the world we cousin here use the superlative degree when the comparative would be more appropriate deduct 80 or 90 per cent from this calculation and you still leave before this city a bright prospect of future greatness we must however bid adieu to this queen of the west and pursue we course against the ohio 's current towards pittsburg we steam along between freedom and slavery the contrast be striking on this subject the remark of the keen and philosophic m de tocqueville be so accurate and so much to the point that i can not do better than transcribe and endorse they a century have scarcely elapse since the foundation of the colony when the attention of the planter be strike by the extraordinary fact that the province which be comparatively destitute of slave increase in population in wealth and in prosperity more rapidly than those which contain the greatest number of negro in the former however the inhabitant be oblige to cultivate the soil themselves or by hire labourer in the latter they be furnish with hand for which they pay no wages : yet although labor and expense be on the one side and ease with economy on the other the former be in possession of the most advantageous system \* \* \* the more progress be make the more be it show that slavery which be so cruel to the slave be prejudicial to the master but this truth be most satisfactorily demonstrate when civilization reach the bank of the ohio the stream which the indian have distinguish by the name of ohio or beautiful river water one of the most magnificent valley which have ever be make the abode of man undulating land extend upon both shore of the ohio whose soil afford inexhaustible treasure to the labourer on either bank the air be wholesome and the climate mild and each of those bank form the extreme frontier of a vast state : that which follow the numerous winding of the ohio on the left be kentucky -lrb- in ascend the river it be on we _ right _ -rrb- that on the right -lrb- we left -rrb- bear the name of the river these two state differ only in one respect -- kentucky have admit slavery but the state of ohio have not \* \* \* upon the left bank of the stream the population be rare from time to time one descry a troop of slave loitering in the half-desert field the primeval forest recur at every turn society seem to be asleep man to be idle and nature alone offer a scene of activity and life from the right bank on the contrary a confused hum be hear which proclaim the presence of industry the field be cover with abundant harvest the elegance of the dwelling announce the taste and activity of the labourer and man appear to be in the enjoyment of that wealth and contentment which be the reward of labor the kentucky and the ohio state be nearly equal as to they area in square mile kentucky be found in 1775 and ohio in 1788 in 1840 the population of kentucky be 779828 while that of ohio be 1519467 -- nearly double that of the former by this time it be far more than double upon the left bank of the ohio continue de tocqueville labor be confound with the idea of slavery upon the right bank it be identify with that of prosperity and improvement : on the one side it be degrade on the other it be honor on the former territory no white labourer can be find for they would be afraid of assimilate themselves to the negro on the latter no one be idle for the white population extend its activity and its intelligence to every kind of improvement thus the man whose task it be to cultivate the rich soil of kentucky be ignorant and lukewarm while those who be active and enlighten either do nothing or pass over into the state of ohio where they may work without dishonor march the 9th be a dull day but the scenery be of surpass beauty at night a terrible storm of thunder and lightning accompany with rain compel we to lie to a charming morning succeed during the forenoon we pass a small town on the virginia side call elizabeth town a indian mound be point out to I which in size and shape resemble toman y balum in north wale these artificial mound be very numerous in the valley of the ohio and the mississippus the ancient relic they be sometimes find to contain afford abundant proof that these fertile region be once people by a race of man in a far higher state of civilization than the indian when first discover by the white man the innocent and imaginative speculation of a christian minister in the state of ohio on these ancient remain lay the foundation of the curious book of mormon nature be now array in she winter dress we could form but a faint conception of she summer loveliness when clothe in she gayest green hill be see rise up sometimes almost perpendicularly from the stream and sometimes skirt with fertile field extend to the river 's edge here a house on the brow of a hill and there another at its base here the humble log hut and there the elegant mansion and sometimes both in unequal juxtaposition the hill be in part scollop in continuous succession present a beautiful display of unity and diversity combined but often they appear in isolate and distinct grandeur like a row of semi-globe while in other instance they rise one above another like apple in a fruit-vase sometimes the rivulet be see like silver cord fall perpendicularly into the river at other time you discern they only by they musical murmur as they roll on through deep ravine form by they own action these hill for more than 100 mile before you come to pittsburg be literally heap of coal in height they vary from 100 to 500 foot and nothing more be require than to clear off the soil and then dig away the treasure what strike I most be the immense number of child everywhere gaze upon we from the river 's bank at settlement of not more than half-a-dozen house i count a groupe of more than twenty child letter xxiii arrival at pittsburg -- its trade and prospects -- temperance -- newspaper --

directly by means of the ohio the mississippus red river & c with immense country extend to texa to mexico and to the gulph its population already 70000 be -lrb- i believe -rrb- incomparably more intelligent more temperate more religious and more steady than that of any manufacturing town in england in fact england have not much chance of compete successfully with america unless she artizan copy more extensively the example of the american people in the entire abandonment of intoxicate liquor in travel leisurely from new orlean to boston -lrb- the whole length of the united state -rrb- and sit down at all sort of table on land and on water private and public i have never once see even wine bring to the table nothing but water be universally use at pittsburg i buy three good-sized newspaper for 5 cent or twopence-halfpenny one of they _ the daily morning post _ be a large sheet measure 3 foot by 2 and well fill on both side with close letter-press for 2 cent or one penny the absence of duty on paper and of newspaper stamp be no doubt one great cause of the advanced intelligence of the mass of the american people what a absurd policy be that of the british government first to impose tax upon _ knowledge _ and then to use the money in promote _ education _ at pittsburg the ohio end or rather begin by the confluence of the alleghany and the monongahelum river we ascend the latter to brownsville about 56 mile have book ourselves at a office we have to get into a smaller steamer on the other side of the bridge which span the river the entire charge to philadelphium be 12 dollar each we go by the consul at half-past 8 be of the 11th of march the water be very high as have be the case in the ohio all the way from cincinnatus we have not proceed far when i find the passenger a-stir as if they have get to they journey 's end what be the matter why we have come to fall which it be very doubtful whether the steamer could get over the passenger be soon land and the steamer with the crew leave to attempt the ascent there be lock at hand by which under ordinary circumstance boat evade the difficulty but the flood be now so great that they could not be use we steamer therefore stir up she fire raise she steam bring all she power to bear face the difficulty dash into it cut along and set at defiance the fury of the flood there she go -- no -- yes -- no -- she be at a stand -- the next moment she be glide back with the torrent : she have fail but _ nil desperandum _ try -- try -- try again a immense volume of smoke issue from she chimney and soon she seem again to be fully inflate with she vapoury aliment i expect every moment a explosion and while rejoice in we own safety on _ terra firma _ feel tremblingly anxious for the life of those on board have have sufficient time to recover strength she make for the foam surge once more there she go -- no -- yes -- she pause -- but it be only for the twinkling of a eye -- the next moment she be over and the bank 's of the monongahelum resound with the joyful shout of the gaze passenger we now breathe more freely and be soon on board again but we have not advance very far before we have to get out once more in consequence of other fall which be stem with the same inconvenience the same anxiety and the same success as in the precede instance but ere long a obstacle more formidable than the fall present itself -- a bridge across the river this bridge the boat be accustom to pass under but the water be now so high that it could not be do and we have to wait till another boat belong to the same company above the bridge come down from brownsville and enable we to effect a exchange of passenger for neither of the boat could get under the bridge the down boat soon make its appearance and a scene of confusion ensue which i know not how to describe imagine two set of passenger about 150 person in each set exchange boat three hundred traveller jostle against each other with plunder amounting to some thousand of package to be remove a distance of 300 or 400 yard at the risk and responsibility of the owner without any care or concern on the part of the officer of the boat trunk seem to run on wheel carpet-bag to have wing and portmanteau to jump about like grasshopper if you have put down one article while look for the rest in a instant it would be go in this amusing scuffle be involve several member of congress return in the down boat from they legislative duty the celebrated judge m ` lean be among they but the safety of some box or parcel be just then -- to most of we -- of more importance than all the great man in the world the baggage storm be over and the great division and trans-shipment effect we move forward in peace by-and-by however each one be call upon to show he baggage that it might be set apart for the particular coach to which it would have to be consign this be a most troublesome affair at half-past 6 in the evening we arrive at brownsville have be ten hour in get over the 56 mile from pittsburg and now for the stage-coach for _ nolen volen _ a-head we must go that very night about seven or eight coach be fill by those of we fellow-passenger who like ourselves be go to cross the mountain some of the vehicle set off immediately but three wait to let they passenger get tea or supper meal which in america be identical about 8 pm we start on we cold and dreary journey of 73 mile across the alleghany mountain a stage-coach in america be a very different thing from the beautiful machine that use to pass by that name in england it have no outside accommodation except for one person on the box along with the driver the inside in addition to the fore seat and the hind seat have also a middle seat across the vehicle each of these three seat hold three person make nine in all in we stage we have ten person but the ten in a pecuniary point of view be only eight and a half the night be fearfully dark and the road be altogether unworthy of the name yet there be a immense traffic on this route which be the highway from east to west the american with all they smartness have not the knack of make either good road or good street about 11 pm we arrive at uniontown 12 mile from brownsville there the horse be to be change a operation which take about a hour to accomplish three coach be there together the passenger rush out of the inn where we have be warm ourselves and jump into the coach crack go the whip off go the horse and round go the wheel but alas while we could hear the rattle of the other coach we own move not at all driver why do not you be off no answer driver push on no reply go a-head driver -- do not keep we here all night no notice take we begin to thump and stamp no response at last i put my head out through the window there _ be _ no driver and worse still there be no horse how be this there be no team we be tell for we coach i jump out and begin to make diligent inquiry : one tell I one thing and another another at length i learn that there be a team in the stable but there be no driver dispose to go the one who should have take we be cursing and swearing in bed and would not get up this be provoke enough where be the agent of the stage-coach company -- he live about 47 mile off where be the landlord of this house -- he be in bed there we be helpless and desert on the highroad between 12 and 1 o'clock in a extremely cold night without any redress or any opportunity of appeal it be nobody 's business to care for we i groped my way however to some outbuilding where about half-a-dozen driver be snore in they bed and with the promise of make it worth he while succeed in induce one of they to get up and take we to the next place for change horse but before we could get off it be 2 o'clock in the morning we reach the next station a distance of 10 mile at 5 pm and pay we driver two dollar in america driver be not accustom to receive gratuity from passenger but ours be a peculiar case after a most wearisome day of travel be toss about in the coach like ball expect every moment to be upset and feeling bruise all over we reach cumberland at 9 pm have be 25 hour in get over 73 mile at the amazing rate of 3 mile a hour in cumberland we have to stay all night at 8 be the next day we set off by railway or -lrb- as the american would say -rrb- by the car to baltimore in commit my trunk to the luggage-van i be strike with the simplicity and suitableness of the check system there adopt a piece of tin with a certain number upon it be fasten by a strap to each article of baggage and a duplicate piece give to the passenger i also remark the size shape and fittings-up of the car they be from 30 to 50 foot long have a aisle right through the middle from end to end and on each side of that aisle row of seat each of sufficient length to accommodate two person the arrangement remind I of a little country meeting-house the congregation amounting to from 50 to 100 person each carriage contain a stove -- at that season a most important article of furniture the seat which be very nicely cushion have they hack so arrange as that the passenger could easily turn they as they pleased and sit with either they face or they back towards the horse as they might feel disposed this part of the arrangement be indispensable as these long carriage can never be turn the hind part in come be the fore part in go and _ vice versa _ the distinction of first second and third class carriage be unknown that would be too aristocratic but the nigger must go into the luggage-van these republican carriage be very neatly fit up be mostly of mahogany with crimson velvet lining but you often feel annoyed that such dirty people should get in letter xxiv journey by railroad from cumberland to baltimore -- a tedious stoppage -- a sabbath in baltimore -- fruitless inquiry -- a presbyterian church and dr plummer -- richmond and its resolution -- dr plummer 's pro slavery manifesto -- the methodist episcopal church the railway from cumberland to baltimore be 178 mile long and -lrb- like most line in the state -rrb- be single this fact be important for we cousin in boasting of the hundred or thousand of mile of railway they have construct forget to tell we that they be nearly all single here and there they have a double set of rail like we siding to enable train to pass each other the ground be cover with snow otherwise the scenery would have be magnificent for a long time the potomac be we companion more than once we have to cross the stream on wooden bridge so that we have it sometimes on we right and sometimes on we left ourselves be alternately in virginium and in maryland when within 14 mile of baltimore and already benighted we be tell we could not proceed on account of some accident to a luggage-tram that be come up the engine or -lrb- as the american invariably say -rrb- the locomotive have get off the rail and tear up the ground in a frightful manner but no one be hurt we be detain for 7 hour and instead of get into baltimore at 8 pm make a average of about 15 mile a hour which be the utmost we have be lead to expect we do not get there till 3 be bring we average rate per hour down to about 9-1\/2 mile the tediousness of the delay be considerably relieve by a man sit beside I avow himself a thorough abolitionist and a hearty friend of the color race he speak out he sentiment openly and fearlessly and be quite a match for any one that dare to assail he he name be daniel carmichael of brooklyn he be a great railway and canal contractor and have generally in he employ from 500 to 800 people he be also a very zealous teetotaler we have also a _ mr malaprop _ from baltimore with we who tell we among other marvellous thing that in that city they take the _ sens _ -lrb- census -rrb- of the people every month she be very anxious to let all around she know that she husband be a medical man : she therefore wonder what the doctor be then do what the doctor thought of the non-arrival of the train whether the doctor would be wait for she at the station and whether the doctor would bring he own carriage or hire one to meet she & c march 14 -- the day on which we arrive at baltimore be the sabbath in a public room in the national hotel at which we be stop be hang up a nicely-framed announcement of the order of service in one of the presbyterian church we wish however to find a congregational place of worship and set off with that view it be a beautiful day and baltimore seem to send forth its inhabitant by streets-full to the various church in the _ old _ world i never see anything like it nor elsewhere in the _ new _ except perhaps at boston all secular engagement seem to be entirely suspend and the whole city seem to enjoy a sabbath as we walk along i ask a young man if he could direct I to a congregational church he stare at I for a moment and then say do you mean a church with pew in it i ask another can you tell I where i shall find a congregational church in this city -- what congregation do you mean sir be the reply they evidently know nothing at all about congregationalism the fact be as i afterwards understand we have not yet come into its latitude for in america presbyterianism and congregationalism have hitherto be matter of latitude and longitude rather than of earnest conviction and firm adherence we now inquire for a _ presbyterian _ church and be tell that there be one not far from where we then stand in which mr plummer -- a very popular minister just come into the city -- preach follow the direction give we come to a certain church in front of which two or three grave man stand talk to each other in answer to the question what church be this one of these grave man say with a good broad scotch accent it be a presbyterian church the accent give a double confirmation to the answer be it mr plummer 's church i continue with the same accent and in a tone of gentle rebuke i be tell yes it be _ doctor _ plummer 's we enter the congregation be assemble we be leave either to stand in the aisle or to take a seat as we please we prefer the latter the building be new but build in the old gothic style the pew the pulpit the front of the gallery the organ and the framework of the roof which be all expose be of oak which have be make to resemble in color wood that have stand the test of 400 or 500 year the window also be darken the whole affair be tremendously heavy enough to mesmerize any one the congregation be large respectable and decorous after a few glance around to see if there be a negro pew anywhere i observe several color face peep from a recess in the gallery on the left side of the organ -- there be the negro pew in due time _ doctor _ plummer ascend the pulpit he be a fine tall man grey-hair well dress with commanding aspect and a powerful voice i cease to wonder at the emphasis with which the scotchman call he _ doctor _ plummer he be quite the _ ideal _ of a _ doctor _ he text be john iii 18 : he that believeth on he be not condemn but he that believeth not be condemn already because he have not believe in the name of the only begotten son of god he subject be that man be justly accountable to god for he belief this truth he handle in a masterly manner toss about as with a giant 's arm lord brougham and the universalist notwithstanding my want of rest on the previous night the absurd heaviness of the building and the fact that the sermon -- which occupy a full hour -- be all read i listen with almost breathless attention and be sorry when he have do and who be this dr plummer it be dr plummer late of richmond in virginium richmond say dr reed be still the great mart of slavery and the interest of morality and religion suffer from this cause several person of the greatest wealth and therefore of the greatest consideration in the town be know slave-dealer and they influence in addition to the actual traffic be of course unfavourable the sale of slave be as common and produce as little sensation as that of cattle it occur in the main street and before the door of the party who be commission to make the sale and what be the conduct of this doctor of divinity in reference to this state of thing he sanction it he plead for it he live upon it he be once actually support either wholly or in part by slave labor the church of which he be the pastor be endowed with a number of slave these slave be hire out and the proceeds be give in the way of stipend to the _ doctor _ nor be this all a few year ago the slave-holder of the south be greatly alarm by the vigorous effort of the abolitionist of the north it be about the time that the charleston post-office be plunder by a mob of several thousand people and all the anti-slavery publication there find be make a bonfire of in the street and where the clergy of all denomination attend in a body lend they sanction to the proceedings and add by they presence to the impressive character of the scene on that occasion the clergy of the city of richmond be not less prompt than they brethren of charleston in respond to the public sentiment ' they resolve _ unanimously _ -- that we earnestly deprecate the unwarrantable and highly improper interference of the people of any other state with the domestic relation of master and slave that the example of we lord jesus christ and he apostle in not interfere with the question of slavery but uniformly recognize the relation of master and servant and give full and affectionate instruction to both be worthy the imitation of all minister of the gospel that we will not patronise nor receive any pamphlet or newspaper of the anti-slavery society and that we will discountenance the circulation of all such papers in the community that the suspicion which have prevail to a considerable extent against minister of the gospel and professor of religion in the state of virginium as identify with abolitionist be _ wholly unmerited _ believe as we do from extensive acquaintance with we church and brethren that they be unanimous in oppose the pernicious scheme of abolitionist after this be man to be brand as infidel because they say the american church be the bulwark of slavery but what have all this to do with we fine-looking and dignified _ doctor _ i will tell you when these resolution be pass he be from home but on he return he lose no time in communicate to the chairman of the committee of correspondence he entire concurrence with what have be do -- and here be extract from he letter : -- i have carefully watch this matter from its earliest existence and everything i have see or hear of its character both from its patron and its enemy have confirm I beyond repentance in the belief that let the character of the abolitionist be what it may in the sight of the judge of all the earth this be the most meddlesome impudent reckless fierce and wicked excitement i ever see if abolitionist will set the country in a blaze it be but right that they should receive the _ first warm at the fire _ let it be proclaim throughout the nation that every movement make by the fanatic -lrb- so far as it have any effect in the south -rrb- do but rivet every fetter of the bondman and diminish the probability of anything be successfully undertake for make he either fit for freedom or likely to obtain it we have the authority of montesquieu burke and coleridge three eminent master of the science of human nature that of all man slave-holder be the most jealous of they liberty one of pennsylvanium 's most gifted son have lately pronounced the south the _ cradle of liberty _ lastly abolitionist be like infidel wholly unaddicted to martyrdom for opinion 's sake let they understand that _ they will be catch _ -lrb- lynch -rrb- if they come among we and they will take good heed to keep out of we way there be not one man among they who have any more idea of shed he blood in the cause than he have of make war on the grand turk so much for my splendid dd on whose lip i hang with such intense interest i do not know all this at the time or i should have feel very differently as he have but recently leave richmond when i see he it be not at all unlikely that those fine clothes he have on be the fruit of the slave 's unrequited toil he have always i believe stand high among he brethren and one or two excellent tract of he be publish by the american tract society all denomination be here alike guilty in reference to they color brethren in this very city the general conference of the methodist episcopal church for 1840 pass the following resolution : -- that it be inexpedient and unjustifiable for any preacher to permit color person to give testimony against white person in any state where they be deny that privilege by law against this iniquitous resolution the official member of two of the color methodist episcopal church in baltimore immediately remonstrate and petition the follow powerful and pathetic passage be from they address : -- the adoption of such a resolution by we highest ecclesiastical judicatory -- a judicatory compose of the most experienced and the wisest brethren in the church the choice selection of twenty-eight annual conference -- have inflict we fear a irreparable injury upon eighty thousand soul for whom christ die -- soul who by this act of you body have be strip of the dignity of christian degrade in the scale of humanity and treat as criminal for no other reason than the color of they skin you resolution have in we humble opinion _ virtually _ declare that a mere physical peculiarity the handiwork of we all-wise and benevolent creator be _ primâ facie _ evidence of incompetency to tell the truth or be a unerring indication of unworthiness to bear testimony against a fellow-being whose skin be denominate white \* \* \* brethren out of the abundance of the heart we have speak _ we grievance be before you _ if you have any regard for the salvation of the eighty thousand immortal soul commit to you care -- if you would not _ thrust _ beyond the pale of the church _ twenty-five thousand soul in this city _ who have feel determine never to leave the church that have nourish and bring they up -- if you regard we as child of one common father and can upon reflection sympathize with we as member of the body of christ -- if you would not incur the fearful the tremendous responsibility of offend not only one but many thousand of he ` little one ' -- we conjure you to wipe from you journal the odious resolution which be ruin we people this address be present to one of the secretary a delegate of the baltimore conference and subsequently give by he to the bishop how many of the member of conference see it be unknown one thing be certain _ it be never read to the conference _ letter xxv a sabbath at baltimore -lrb- continue -rrb- -- a color congregation -- the thought of see washington abandon -- departure from baltimore -- color lady in the luggage-van -- american railway -- chesapeak bay -- susquehannah -- state of delaware and abolition of slavery -- philadelphium -- albert barne -- stephen girard 's extraordinary will in the afternoon of my first sabbath at baltimore i find after much inquiry a congregation of color people who be some sort of methodist my wife and i be the only white people in the place we be treat with great politeness and put not in a pew apart by ourselves but in one of the best place they could find in the very midst of the congregation a serious-looking color man open the service with great propriety of manner and expression he be the regular pastor a black man a stranger as i understand preach he text -lrb- he say -rrb- be behold i come quickly and they would find it in the book of revelation but chapter and verse be not give nor have he the bible open in revelation at all i suspect that he could not read and that suspicion be confirm by the amount of nonsense which he soon utter at first he word be few and far between utter in a tone of voice scarcely audible soon however he work both himself and he audience into a tremendous phrenzy the burden of he song be -- how john have live to a very great age in spite of all attempt to put he to death how he enemy have at last decide to try the plan of throw he into a kittle of biling ile how god have say to he never mind john -- if they throw thee into that kittle i 'll go there with thee -- they shall bile I too how john be therefore take up alive and how he persecutor baffle in all they effort to despatch he ultimately determine to throw they victim upon a desolate island and leave he there to live or perish as he might during the delivery of all this nonsense the laugh the shout the groan and the jump be positively terrific it be methodism go mad how disgraceful that american christian so call with all they school and college and with all they effort to send the gospel to africa should leave these people at they very door thus to feed upon husk and ash between 500 and 600 people be listen to this ignorant man give as the pure and positive word of god what be of very doubtful authority intermingle with the crudity of he own brain i wish to stay through the service and perhaps at the close express my fraternal feeling but i be so shocked and grieve at this ranting exhibition that i feel it unwarrantable to remain leave these unfortunate people we peep into two cathedral church -- that of the church of england or -lrb- as it be here call -rrb- the protestant episcopal church and that of the church of rome both building be very splendid we have be in the former some time before we feel quite sure that we be not in a popish place of worship so papistical be its aspect and arrangement it be evident that puseyism or popery in some form have there its throne and its sceptre the avowedly popish cathedral be crowd with worshipper and to the shame of protestantism be it speak black and colored people be _ there _ see intermingled with the whites in the performance of they religious ceremony the state of maryland of which baltimore be the capital have be first settle by a colony of roman catholic might be expect to be a stronghold of popery yet it be not so the adherent of that system be but a small minority of the population baltimore be however a stronghold of slavery here garrison 's indignation against the system be first kindle -- here frederick dougla taste some of its bitter draught -- and here torrey die its victim the follow be specimen of the manner in which the trade in human flesh be carry on in this city : -- negro want -- i have remove from my former residence west pratt-street to my new establishment on camden-street immediately in the rear of the railroad depôt where i be permanently located person bring negro by the car will find it very convenient as it be only a few yard from where the passenger get out those have negro for sale will find it to they advantage to call and see I as i be at all time pay the highest price in cash j s donovan balt md o28 -- 6m \* cash for five hundred negro -- at the old establishment of slatter 's no 244 pratt-street baltimore between sharp and howard street where the highest price be pay which be well know we have large accommodation for negro and always buy be regular shipper to new orlean person should bring they property where no commission be pay as the owner lose it all communication attend to promptly by address h f slatter j5 -- 6m \* before and since my arrival in the united state i have think much of see washington and if possible congress in session but such be the severity of the weather that we could not cross the alleghany before that assembly have rise and disperse at baltimore i be within two hour ' journey of the capital should i go and see it no for what can _ there _ be find to gratify the friend of freedom and of man the missourus compromise the annexation of texa and the mexican war be all associate with washington the capital itself be but a great slave-mart with its baracoon and manacle its handcuffs and auction-stand ay and all this in full view of the national edifice wherein be deposit that instrument which bear on its head and front the noble sentiment -- that all man be create equal that they be endow by they creator with certain inalienable rights that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness under the influence of these recollection i abandon the idea of visit washington at 9 o'clock on Monday morning we set off by railway for philadelphium while i be take a last glance at my trunk in the luggage-van at the baltimore station about half-a-dozen very clean and respectable color lady come up and make for the say van as a matter of course it be the only accommodation that would be allow they though they pay the same fare as other people they be lady to whom any gentleman in england would have be proud to resign a seat but in the land of equality they be consign to the cold dark and dirty region of the luggage-van i notice one important difference between the railway economy of england and that of america in the former as you know the railway be haughty exclusive and aristocratic it scorn all fellowship with common road and dash on either under or over the house with arbitrary indifference in america it generally condescend to pass along the public street to the very center of the city the engine be take off or put to in the suburb and its place _ intra muro _ if i may so say supply by horse in leave baltimore the engine be attach _ before _ we get quite out of the city and we be go for some time along the common road meeting in one place a horse and cart in another a man on horseback in another a pair of oxen fasten to each other and so on dangerous enough apparently yet railway accident be much less frequent in america than in england it be besides a immense saving of capital in we progress we have to cross several arm of the chesapeak bay these arm be from one to two mile wide and the railway be carry over they upon post drive into the ground it seem like cross the sea in a railway carriage at havre de grace we have to cross the susquehannah river this word susquehannah be indian and mean literally i be tell the rolling thunder in cross it however we hear no thunder except that of the luggage-van over we head on the top of the steamer here we change carriage we soon get sight of the delaware which keep we company nearly all the way to philadelphium delaware the smallest of all the state except rhode island we entirely cross a few day before delaware have well nigh do herself great honor she house of representative carry by a majority a vote for the abolition of slavery within she boundary but the measure be lose in she senate by a majority of one or two the state legislature will not meet again for two year all party be confident that the measure will then be triumphantly carry through in america however the abolition of slavery in any state do not always mean freedom to the slave too often it be a mere transportation of they to the southern state have delaware pass a law that all slave should he free at the expiration of five year or that all child bear after a certain period should he free the owner of slave would have have a obvious interest in dispose of they human property to the southern trader _ before _ that period arrive mother too would have be hasten southward to give birth to they offspring so that the peculiar institution might lose none of its prey measure for the abolition of slavery in any part of america do not arise from sympathy with the negro and from a wish to improve he condition and promote he happiness but from aversion to he presence or perhaps from a conviction that the system of slavery be expensive and impolitic those who feel kindly towards they color brother and act towards he under the impulse of pure and lofty philanthropy be i be sorry to say very few indeed these view may appear severe and uncharitable towards the american people but they be confirm by m de tocqueville when a northern state declare that the son of the slave should be bear free observe that impartial writer the slave lose a large portion of he market value since he posterity be no longer include in the bargain and the owner have then a strong interest in transport he to the south thus the same law prevent the slave of the south from come to the northern state and drive those of the north to the south the want of free hand be feel in a state in proportion as the number of slave decrease but in proportion as labor be perform by free hand slave labor become less productive and the slave be then a useless or a onerous possession whom it be important to export to those southern state where the same competition be not to be fear _ thus the abolition of slavery do not set the slave free : it merely transfer he from one master to another and from the north to the south _ m de tocqueville add in a note the state in which slavery be abolish usually do what they can to render they territory disagreeable to the negro as a place of residence and as a kind of emulation exist between the different state in this respect the unhappy black can only choose the least of the evil which beset they this be perfectly true cross the schuilkyl we arrive about 3 o'clock p m in philadelphium the city of brotherly love have perform the journey of 97 mile in six hour a rate of only 16 mile a hour in philadelphium be many man and thing that i wish to see first and foremost in my professional curiosity be albert barne but be anxious to push on to new york that night i have but a hour and a half to stay of a sight of the famous author of the note i be therefore compel to deny myself my regret be diminish when i learn from a english minister of high standing who under the influence of the best feeling and with a excellent introduction have call upon the commentator that he receive he with a degree of indifference border on rudeness in philadelphium there be no congregational church a few year ago john todd the well-known author of the student 's guide attempt to raise one he be but little countenanced however by albert barne and the presbyterian and fail in pass through this city i have a distant glimpse of a most remarkable institution m girard a old bachelor a native of france who have accumulate immense wealth die a few year ago leave by will the enormous sum of two million of dollar or upward of four hundred thousand pound sterling to erect and endow a college for the accommodation and education of three hundred orphan boy the ground on which it be to be build consist of no less than 45 acre he order to be enclose with a high solid wall cap with marble and line upon the top with long iron spike he also insert in he will the follow extraordinary clause : i enjoin and require that no ecclesiastic missionary or minister of any sect whatever shall ever hold or exercise any station or duty whatever in say college nor shall any such person ever be admit for any purpose or as a visitor within the premise appropriate to the purpose of say college a attempt be make before the supreme court of the united state to set aside this will and daniel webster the great new england barrister deliver a powerful plea against it but the attempt be overrule for some year the building have be slowly proceed and be not yet ready for occupation have i have time i could not be a minister have enter the premise to I and to all like I _ procul procul este profani _ be chisel on every stone -- a singular monument of the priest-hating propensity of the old french revolutionist letter xxvi departure from philadelphium -- a communicative yankee -- trenton -- the mansion of joseph bonaparte -- scene of brainerd 's labor one hundred year ago -- first impression of new york -- 150 nassau-street -- private lodgings -- literary society -- american lodging-house -- a lecture on astronomy -- the negro pew in dr patton 's church at half-past 4 in the afternoon of march 15 we leave philadelphium by railway for new york which we reach at 10 pm a average again of about 16 mile a hour in this journey i meet with a very communicative yankee who though not a religious man be proud to trace he genealogy to the pilgrim father and through they to the norman intercourse he say have be maintain for the last two century between the english and american branch of the family he also take care to inform I that the head of the english branch be a baronet this be but one of many instance in which i find among we transatlantic friend a deep idolatry of rank and title in talking of they own political institution he declare they last two president to have be -- the one a fool and the other a knave -- polk the fool and tyler the knave he entertain a insane and cruel prejudice against those whose skin be not exactly of the same color with he own and thank god that he have no african blood in he vein we pass through trenton celebrate as the scene of a bloody conflict between the british and the american force the american i be sorry to say dwell too fondly on the remembrance of those deadly struggle they cherish the spirit of war the influence of elihu burritt and he bond of brotherhood be indeed greatly need on both side of the atlantic we also pass what once be the residence of ex-royalty -- the princely mansion which joseph bonaparte erect for himself after he lose the throne of spain it be surround with about 900 acre of land he own private property and be still in the family though about to be sell what a home have america prove both to fall greatness and to struggle poverty prince and peasant alike find shelter here this journey conduct we through new brunswick elizabeth town newark -- place associate with the name of david brainerd and often -lrb- a hundred year ago -rrb- the scene of he toil and travels but where be the descendant of those indian on whose behalf he feel such intense solicitude alas not a vestige of they be to be see have thus cross new jersey state we come to new jersey city where we cross a ferry to new york after rather more than the usual amount of anxiety about baggage & c we reach the planter 's hotel a little after 10 at night next morning i sallied forth to gaze for the first time at the wonder of new york the state of the street impress I unfavourably the pig be in the enjoyment of the same unstinted liberty as at cincinnatus merchant and storekeeper spread they goods over the entire breadth of the causeway and some even to the very middle of the street slop of all sort and from all part of the house be empty into the street before the front door the ash be dispose of in a very peculiar manner each house have on the edge of the parapet opposite a old flour-barrel or something of the sort into which be throw ash sweepings fish-bones dead rat and all kind of refuse a dead rat very frequently garnish the top of the barrel this be the order of thing not in small by-street only but also in the very best street and before the very best house the pavement too even in broadway be in a very wretched state i make for no 150 nassau-street where the tract society the home missionary society and the foreign missionary society have they room to some party in that house i have introduction the brethren connect with those society treat I with great kindness and cordiality and make I feel as though i have be in we own missionary room in blomfield-street by they aid i obtain private lodgings in a good situation and in good society the landlady be a quaker with half-a-dozen grown-up daughter we fellow-lodger consist of the rev ae lawrence assistant-secretary of the american home missionary society -lrb- who have a few month before become the landlady 's son-in-law -rrb- the rev mr martyn and he wife a woman of fine talent and editor of the lady ' wreath the rev mr brace a editor in the employ of the tract society mr daniel breed md a quaker and principal of a private academy for young gentleman -lrb- also the landlady 's son-in-law -rrb- mr oliver johnson a sub-editor of the _ daily tribune _ and a well-known abolitionist and mr lockwood a retired grocer -- who have gain a small independence be thus enjoy it with he youthful wife and child in lodgings into society better adapt to my taste and purpose i could not have go this mode of life be very extensively adopt in america -- married couple with family live in this manner for year without the least loss of respectability they seldom have sitting-room distinct from they bed-room which be make to answer both purpose and as to meal all meet to eat the same thing at the same table and at the same time the custom be economical but it have a injurious effect upon character especially in the case of the woman the young wife not be call upon to exercise herself in domestic economy be apt to become idle slovenly and -- in a certain sense -- worthless the soften association and influence and even the endearment of home be lose there be no _ domesticity _ in the evening of the 17th i go to the broadway tabernacle to hear a lecture on astronomy from professor mitchell of cincinnatus no ordinary man although the admission fee be half-a-dollar upward of a thousand person be present without either diagram or note the accomplished lecturer keep he audience in breathless attention for upward of a hour he seem to be a devout unassuming man and throw a flood of light on every subject he touch he theme be the recent discovery of the leverrier planet and perhaps you will not be displeased if i give you a summary of he lucid observation in observe how the fluctuation of the planet herschel have ultimately lead to this discovery he say : for a long time no mind dare to touch the problem at length a young astronomer rise unknown to fame but with a mind capable of grasp all the difficulty involve in any of these question i refer of course to leverrier he begin by take up the movement of mercury he be dissatisfy with the old computation and the old table and he venture to begin anew and to compute a entirely new set of table with these new table he predict the _ precise instant _ when the planet mercury on the 18th of may 1845 would touch the sun and sweep across it the time roll round when the planet be to be see and he prediction verify or confute the day arrive but alas for the computer the cloud let down they dark curtain and veil the sun from he sight we own observatory have just be finish and if the audience will permit i will state briefly my own observation upon the planet i have ten long year be toiling i have commence what appear to be a hopeless enterprise but finally i see the building finish i see this mighty telescope erect -- i have adjust it with my own hand -- i have compute the precise time when the planet would come in contact with the sun 's disk and the precise point where the contact would take place but when it be remember that only about the thousandth part of the sun 's disk enter upon the field of the telescope the importance of direct the instrument to the right point will be realize five minute before the computed time of the contact i take my place at the instrument the beautiful machinery that carry the telescope with the sun be set in motion and the instrument direct to that part of the sun 's disk at which it be anticipate the contact would take place and there i sit with feeling which no one in this audience can realize it be my first effort all have be do by myself after remain there for what seem to be long hour i inquire of my assistant how much longer i would have to wait i be answer _ four minute _ i keep my place for what seem a age and again inquire as before he tell I that but one minute have roll by it seem as if time have fold he wing so slowly do the moment crawl on i watch on till i be tell that but one minute remain and within sixteen seconds of the time i have the almost bewildering gratification of see the planet break the contact and slowly move on till it bury itself round and deep and sharp in the sun i refer to this fact for two reason -- first to verify leverrier and second to impress upon you mind the desirableness of locate we observatory in different part of the earth no european astronomer could have make this observation because in they longitude the sun would have set previous to the contact of the planet with its disk i have the gratification of furnish these observation to leverrier himself who report upon they to the academy of science the triumph of leverrier be complete it be after this that arago see the characteristic of he mind say to he ` take up the movement of the planet herschel -- watch they analyze they and tell we what it be that cause they ' leverrier throw aside all other employment and give he mind to the investigation of this subject he begin entirely back he take up the movement of the planet jupiter and saturn and investigate they anew : he leave nothing untouched finally after have in the most absolute manner compute all the influence they exercise upon the planet herschel he say ' i now know positively all exist cause that disturb the planet but there be a outstanding power that disturb it not yet account for and now let I rise to a knowledge of that outstanding cause ' he do what no other man ever have attempt he clear up all difficulty -- he make all daylight before he gaze and now how shall i give to you a account of the train of reasoning by which he reach out into unknown space and evoke from its bosom a mighty world if you will give I the time i will attempt to give you a idea of he mighty workings in the field of science in the first place let it be remember that the planet circulate through the heaven in nearly the same plane if i be to locate the sun in the center of the floor in locate the planet around it i should place they upon the floor in the same plane the first thing that occur to leverrier in look for the planet be this -- he need not look out of the plane of the ecliptic here then be one quarter in which the unknown body be to be find the next thing be this -- where be it located and what be its distance from the sun the law of bode give to he the approximate distance he find the distance of saturn be about double that of jupiter and the distance of herschel twice that of saturn and the probability be that the new planet would be twice the distance of herschel -- and as herschel 's distance be 1800000 mile the new planet 's would be 3600000 have approximate its distance what be its periodic time -- for if he can once get its periodic time he can trace it out without difficulty accord to the third of kepler 's law as the square of the period of herschel be to the square of the period of the unknown planet so be the cube of the distance of herschel to the cube of the distance of the unknown planet there be only one term unknown the periodic time of herschel we will call 1 and its distance 1 and by resolve the equation we find the periodic time of the new planet to be a fraction less than three time that of herschel or about 220 year now if it be require to perform 360 degree in 220 year it will perform about a degree and a half in one year only one thing more remain to be accomplish if it be possible to get the position of the unknown body at _ any time _ we can trace it up to where it should be in 1847 first then let we suppose the sun herschel and the new planet in certain fixed position which we will represent as follow -- -lrb- illustration : a b c sun herschel unknown or leverrier planet -rrb- it will be observe that a line draw out from the sun to the right will pass through herschel and if continue will intersect the new planet it be very apparent that when these three orb occupy the position assign they above the influence of the unknown planet upon herschel will be exercise in the highest degree and consequently that herschel will be draw farther from the sun at that juncture than at any other and if we know where _ herschel _ be when this effect be produce by prolong the line through herschel outward it must pass through the new planet the delicate observation upon herschel give this result and show when it be that it be sway farthest from the sun by take the place occupy by the planet at that time and increase it onward one degree and a half per annum we can point out the place it must occupy at any given period in September last we find leverrier communicate these result to he friend in berlin they be provide with chart on which every observe star be map down and if any new object present itself in the heaven it be immediately subject to a rigid scrutiny on the very night on which leverrier 's letter have be receive we find the telescope direct to the designate point in the heaven a stranger appear but have only the aspect of a fix star long do the eye watch that night but no motion be find when twenty-four hour roll round and it be once more possible to fix the instrument upon this strange body it have move in the precise degree and direction compute the new planet be find the news spread with the utmost rapidity throughout the world -- all europe be electrify and soon the intelligence cross the water we telescope be direct to this object all have hitherto fail -- no eye have ever see it round and planet-like from its disk the evening finally come round for the examination time move on its leaden wing but twilight fade away at length and i take my seat with my assistant at the instrument i direct the telescope to that point of the heaven i find four star in the field of view the first be bring to the field of view of the instrument and pronounce to be a fix star and so with the second the third be bring forward and before it have reach the center of the field i hear the exclamation ` there it be ' and there it be as bright and beautiful as jupiter himself here be a result not attain by any other instrument in the world when we know that a body be a planet then and not till then do we find the disk the great rival of we instrument have see it but do not recognize it before five minute have elapse the micrometical wire pronounce its diameter to be 40000 mile here be result such as no previous one have attain i mention it because i think it be right that we own country which have but just commence its career in this science should know what be she due and i trust the day be not far distant when we shall become as distinguish for we proficiency for we learn for we research and for we effort in behalf of astronomy as we have hitherto be for we profound neglect of everything belong to this sublime science so much have be recently say in england about the negro pew in dr patton 's church that i naturally feel curious to see it for myself resolve -lrb- if possible -rrb- to sit in it on sabbath morning the 21st of march i set off with my wife on this errand take for we guide as to the precise position of the locality mr page 's letter of apology -- in which it be state that in that church they treat the color people well that they be elevated above the rest of the congregation and nearer heaven and finally that they occupy a position of honor be on the right hand of the minister as jesus christ be on the right hand of god we find two color people -- a old man and a old woman -- seat in the front pew close to the minister 's right hand and at once conclude that the section of pew at the end wall must be the favored spot the terrestrio-celestial elevation commonly call the negro pew we advance and install we white face in the pew immediately behind the sable couple the old lady seem really alarmed and with amusing earnestness motion we to take a seat elsewhere remonstrance be all in vain -- we be determine to sit among the happy favorite at this time but few person be present by-and-by the child of the sunday-school be march into the neighbouring pew on the other side of the aisle and one of the lady teacher make eager sign for we to come away from we strange position i nod a intimation that we be all right and perfectly comfortable after the lapse of a few moment another polite and compassionate lady actually rise and come to the pew-door to remonstrate with we in a serious yet coax tone she say will not you take a seat here on this side of the aisle no thank you madam i reply we be quite comfortable but she continue in a voice of deep commiseration this be the place allot to the color people thank you i rejoin we have make no mistake well just as you please sir -lrb- as though she have say _ de gustibus non disputandum _ -rrb- and with that she retreat the eye of all in the synagogue be upon we the little people whisper and the big people stare and all the people marvel the morning be dark and wet and yet -lrb- as usual -rrb- the venetian blind be all down the gallery be occupy by three class of person : the black people -- about a dozen in number -- on the right hand the singing people in front and the sunday-school child everywhere else the regular congregation amounting perhaps to 300 be all downstairs dr patton ascend the pulpit-stair with he cloak on place a manuscript fresh from the mint under the cushion sit down take out he pocket-handkerchief apply it vigorously and then gaze leisurely around the pulpit service commence with a short prayer then follow singing by the choir all else sit silent the tenth chapter of roman be read then come the long prayer in which the doctor pray for the abolition of slavery and for the spread of the gospel the text which succeed be rom x 3 4 have notice the context the preacher propose -- i to explain the text -lrb- here he examine very critically the meaning of the greek word -lrb- greek : dikai-osunous -rrb- quote mose stuart and other -rrb- ii to designate those who go about to establish they own righteousness iii to remonstrate against such conduct as be unnecessary criminal and dangerous the discourse be sound and good but every word read the disorderly conduct of the child in the gallery prove a great annoyance and for all the solicitude of the lady to get we away from the vicinity of color skin not one of they have the politeness to offer we either bible or hymn-book this visit of ours to the negro pew be immediately lay hold of by the abolitionist and make to go the whole round of they papers as a testimony against caste this provoke into action the prolix pen of the celebrated mr page who waste on the subject a immense quantity of ink and paper page after page do he pen continue to do so to my certain knowledge for about three month after and for aught i know to the contrary he may be _ paging _ away to this very day this commotion answer my purpose exceedingly well -- my object be to bear testimony against the impiousness of such a distinction and separation in the house of god it be however but justice to dr patton to observe that the case be not singular the peculiar celebrity of he negro pew arise entirely from the imbecile and somewhat profane apology volunteer by mr page in point of fact dr patton and he people as i ascertain in conversation with he on the subject be rather in advance of they neighbor in kind feeling towards the color people letter xxvii a presbyterian church in new york and its pastor -- the abbott and they institution -- union theological seminary -- dr skinner 's church -- new york university -- a threatening necessity -- prejudice against color -- a fact connect with mr ------ 's church -- another fact in pennsylvanium -- state of public opinion in new york -- a interview with dr spring -- a missionary meeting in dr adam 's church in the evening i preach by engagement for the rev ------ in the -- presbyterian church it be pour with rain and not more than 150 person be present the pastor who have visit I in a very fraternal manner kindly propose to devote part of the next day to show I some of the lion of the city the first place we visit be mount vernon the institution of the abbott it be a seminary for young lady with 200 pupil the first of the brother to whom we be introduce be john abbott the author of the mother at home he be apparently 40 year of age he introduce we to the room of the senior class which consist of 30 or 40 young lady from 14 to 25 year of age they be engage in a french exercise with jacob abbott the author of the young christian the corner stone the way for a child & c & c the exercise over we be introduce to mr jacob abbott and be request to accompany he to a private sitting-room i find he a exceedingly pleasant and unassuming man he be 43 year of age but look younger he write both the young christian and the corner stone when he be only 25 john be two year younger than jacob charle to whom also i be introduce be younger still and gorham whom i do not then see be the youngest of the four all be minister though not pastor -- all highly intellectual man and connect more or less with this seminary which be one of the best conduct i have ever see the pupil be not boarder but they pay from 10_l _ to 15_l _ a year for they tuition alone i subsequently make another visit to this institution in company with my wife upon whom mr jacob abbott have very politely call mr ------ intend to introduce I to dr spring but he be not at home he then take I to the union theological seminary in that institution about 120 young man be prepare for the christian ministry the library contain _ twenty thousand _ volume on theology alone -- musty and prosy tome what a punishment it would be to be compel to wade through the whole we see neither professor nor student my principal recollection of the place be that of feeling intensely hungry and smell at the same time the roast beef on which in some of the lower region of the building the young divine be regale themselves in vain i wish to join they in that exercise when we come out my guide propose to take I to see dr robinson much as i want to see the author of the greek lexicon and the traveller in palestine there be other claim that then more urgently press themselves i have breakfast at 7 and it be now near 1 i give my friend a hint to that effect but he overrule it by say it be close by and will not take we many minute we go but the doctor be not in we be now opposite dr skinner 's church and my friend insist on my go to see it it will hold about 1000 people all the pew be cushion and line and the place have a decide air of aristocracy about it the school-room the lecture-room the vestry & c be very complete and convenient how strange i observe to my friend that you should so far exceed we in the comfort of you place of worship and at the same time be so far behind we in domestic comfort _ that _ say he be the principle of the puritan -- the house of god first they own after i ventured to ask he what salary minister in new york generally receive he tell I from 1000 to 4000 dollar or from 200_l _ to 800_l _ my own he add be 2000 dollar we be now not far from the new york university you must go and see that say he i go but see nothing particular except the library empty lecture-room and chapel -- no professor my friendly guide point to a portrait of lord lyndhurst tell I with evident pride that he be a yankee and marvel at my ignorance of the fact from time to time i have give he hint that i be afraid of be too late for dinner at my lodgings and when the sight-seeing be at last end he very coolly and complacently say now if you really think you be too late for dinner at you place i shall be under the _ necessity _ of ask you to go and take a plate with I those be the _ ipsissima verba _ i could scarcely keep my gravity but i reply thank you sir i want to go to the center of the city and i can easily get a dinner at any eating-house he both nod and express a entire concurrence and seem to think it a _ admirable _ arrangement in parting he press I to preach for he on the follow Thursday but i decline the next day i be tell on unquestionable authority that two or three year ago one of the elder of this gentleman 's church meeting a man from south america whom he take to be a mixture of spaniard and indian request he company to church the stranger assent and sit with he in he pew he like the service become interested and go again and again at last it be whisper that he be a nigger -- _ ie _ have a slight mixture of african blood in he the next week a meeting of the session be hold at which it be unanimously resolve that the intruder 's entrance into the body of the church must be prohibit two man be station at the door for that purpose the stranger come he be stop and tell that he could not be allow to enter the body of the church there be a place up in the gallery for color people the man remonstrate and say he have be invite to take a seat in mr so-and-so 's pew yes they reply we be aware of that but public feeling be against it and it can not be allow the stranger turn round burst into tear and walk home mr johnson of the _ tribune _ tell I that two or three year ago he and thirty or forty more be return from a anti-slavery convention hold at harrisburgh in pennsylvanium they have leave by railway for philadelphium at 3 o'clock in the morning at a town call lancaster they stop to breakfast in the company be two color gentleman one of whom be a minister they all sit down together soon the waiter begin to whisper a nigger at table there be two the landlord quickly appear seize one of the color gentleman by the shoulder and ask he how he dare to sit down at table in he house the company remonstrate and assure he that those whose presence appear to be so offensive be very respectable man friend of theirs whom they have invite to sit down it be all in vain the landlord would hear nothing the nigger must go very well say the rest of the company then we shall all go away they go and leave the refine landlord to console himself for the loss of a large party to breakfast they have to travel all the way to philadelphium before they could break they fast the same gentleman tell I that he believe if a white man of any standing in society in new york be now to marry a color lady however intelligent and accomplished he life would be in danger -- he would be lynch for have commit such a outrage upon public opinion and yet the boast be ever ring in we ear this be a free country -- every one do as he please here on the 24th of march i call upon dr spring he be a old school presbyterian and a supporter of the colonization society in the course of conversation reference be make to state church _ myself _ -- you see doctor state church be the curse of the british empire just as slavery be the curse of you country _ the doctor _ -- ah so it be and yet we can do nothing to remove they here be we slavery -- we can not touch it and you can not touch you established church do you think you will ever get rid of it _ myself _ -- oh yes i hope so _ the doctor _ -- but it will be a _ very _ long time before it come to pass _ myself _ -- perhaps not so very long we be rapidly hasten towards some great change the old principle of a establishment be now be abandon by all party and we shall soon come either to the pay-all or to the pay-none principle i be much afraid it will be the former _ the doctor _ -- but be it to come to that and the state would pay you as well as all the rest you would have no further ground of complaint _ myself _ -- oh but we should : we dread that above all other evil it will be a dark day for evangelical religion in england if ever that principle be adopt _ the doctor _ -- why what harm can it do you to receive the money of the state provide it do not infringe upon you liberty _ myself _ -- in the first place it would be a departure from the law of jesus christ and every departure from he law be sure to be productive of evil _ the doctor _ -- very true that be a sound principle -- that every departure from he law will be productive of evil but then it remain to be prove that it _ be _ a departure from he law however i be glad to see you stick so firmly to you principle he then go on to ask if i would preach for he next sabbath now whether he be only try I on those point or whether he have not study the subject or whether he be anxious to keep I off from the subject of slavery i can not tell but i come away with my knowledge of dr spring less than it be when i enter he seem like a cold stiff formal state parson in the evening i attend a missionary meeting in dr adam 's church it be the anniversary of the new york and brooklyn auxiliary to the board of commissioner for foreign mission and embrace about thirty church i expect great thing when i enter they be sing the place be little more than half-full -- say 500 person three gentleman be sit in the pulpit these be dr adam dr cox and mr storrer i look around for the negro pew there it be on the left of the organ and five sable friend in it the first speaker be dr adam who deliver a well-prepared oration of half a hour long the rev mr storrer a young man the pastor of the church of the pilgrim in brooklyn be the next speaker he preparation and delivery be of the same character as those of dr adam but he possess great mental power he occupy exactly half a hour both speaker complain bitterly of diminish confidence and contribution i forget the exact amount announce as the contribution of this auxiliary but it be small dr cox of brooklyn be the third speaker he tell we that the last meeting he have attend in england a few month before be the missionary meeting in birmingham it be hold in the town-hall a magnificent building and well fill he pronounce a eloquent eulogy on john angell jame he describe the missionary breakfast in birmingham but in mention such a thing as a missionary breakfast he feel it necessary to make some apology he assure they it be not attend with the evil they might be apt to imagine would be inseparably connect with it the fact be that missionary breakfast be altogether unknown in america dr cox state that he have often be ask in england how they manage missionary meeting in america that the people of england hold they in high estimation that in england they depend chiefly for the support of the missionary cause upon legacy stock & c while they in america be content to say give we day by day we daily bread he also mention dr chalmer 's eulogy upon they while in england he -lrb- dr cox -rrb- and another have wait upon sir stratford canning to commend they mission at constantinople to he kind notice and sir stratford have speak in very high term of the american people thus even at the missionary meeting incense must be offer to national vanity letter xxviii a visit to mount vernon -- dr robinson -- welsh deputation -- queen anne and new york -- the sabbath -- preach at dr l 's -- afternoon service at mr c -- 's -- tea at dr l -- 's -- evening service at mr -- 's the next day my wife and i pay we promise visit to the institution of the abbott at mount vernon in its government there be neither reward nor punishment but each pupil at the close of the day have to present a brief report of she own conduct she good deed and she bad deed must be alike proclaim -- proclaim by herself -- and that in the presence of she fellow-pupil who be witness of the conduct to which she refer this compel she to be faithful if she try to conceal what be faulty she be surround by those who will detect that concealment : if she ostentatiously parade she own excellence she know she will sink in the estimation of she friend the encouragement of self-respect and of a regard for that which be good for its _ own _ sake be the great principle of government in this establishment mr abbott 's plan of teach a language be not at first to weary the pupil with the dry rule of grammar but to store they memory with word he read a word or a short sentence in french for instance and ask the pupil to translate it into english then with closed book he would give they the english in like manner to be turn into french i have since adopt the plan with latin pupil with pleasure and success mr abbott allow a recess of five minute at the close of every half-hour the hour of attendance be from 9 be to 2 pm but a rest of half a hour be allow in the midst of that period we happen to be there when the say half-hour arrive all the abbott the pupil and ourselves go out to the playground which be furnish with seat and swing and skipping-rope and swinging-boat and all sort of machine for exercise and amusement in these gymnastic performance the abbott themselves join the pupil with a beautiful combination of freedom and propriety a happier assemblage i never see we retire highly delighted with all we have witness in the afternoon i have the honor of be introduce to dr robinson whose greek lexicon i have often thumb with advantage he appear to be from 45 to 50 year of age he manners be exceedingly simple and unostentatious -- the constant characteristic of true greatness i look upon he with high respect and veneration he be a man of whom america may well be proud he press I to go and address the student at union college of which he be one of the professor but a opportunity of do so do not occur in the evening i be wait upon by two gentleman who announce themselves as the president and secretary of a welsh temperance society and wish I to attend and address one of they meeting at a give time this i could not do in conversation with they about slavery and the oppression of the color people i be surprised and grieve to find how soon the welsh people imbibe the feeling and ape the conduct of the american in those matter on they press I to attend a meeting of they society on some _ future _ occasion i tell they i be one of the most downright abolitionist that ever live and if i come would terrify they all with such a abolition speech as they have never hear this of course be cold water upon they love and we interview soon terminate the weather for the next two day be so unfavourable that we could not go out at all among the information i then derive from book be the follow precious morsel from the introduction to the natural history of new york : the governor be direct by queen anne to take especial care that the almighty should be devoutly and duly serve accord to the rite of the church of england and be at the _ same time _ desire by the queen to take especial care that the colony should have a constant and sufficient supply of merchantable negro at moderate rate just what we own west indium planter _ now _ want oh how they would hail the return of the palmy day of queen anne on sabbath the 28th of march i be invite to preach in the morning in the church of dr l -- a congregational place of worship capable of accommodate about 500 person the attendance be not more than 200 there i be delighted to find no negro pew a few colored child be intermingle with the white one in the gallery the doctor to whom i have not be introduce be already in the pulpit when i arrive the ceremony of introduction to each other have to be duly perform in the rostrum he be a fine tall clean and venerable-looking old gentleman he begin the service and before sermon announce that they would then take up the usual collection that place of worship be what they call a free church -- _ ie _ there be no pew-letting as a substitute for which they take up a weekly collection the doctor also make the follow announcement : a missionary of the london missionary society from guiana one of the south american possession of britain -- he name be mr davy -- will now preach and in the evening professor kellog from -- a _ long _ friend of mine will preach at the close i be introduce to the doctor 's _ long _ friend professor kellog and sure enough he be a long one there be present also professor whipple of the oberlin institute to whom i have before be introduce in the afternoon i preach for a mr c -- in a presbyterian church the place be beautiful commodious and nearly full the pastor introduce the service in he manner of do so i be very much strike with -- what i have before often observe in we transatlantic brethren -- a great apparent want of reverence and fervor the singing be very good -- in the choir in my address i urge they to give they legislator and they brethren in the south no rest till the guilt and disgrace of slavery be remove from they national character and institution i also besought they as man of intelligence and piety to frown upon the ridiculous and contemptible prejudice against color wherever it might appear to all which they listen with apparent kindness and interest we take tea by invitation with dr l -- for whom i have preach in the morning there we meet with he nice wife nice deacon nice little daughter and nice niece -- but a most intolerable nephew this man profess to be greatly oppose to slavery and yet be full of contempt for nigger he talk and _ laugh _ over division in certain church and tell the company how he use occasionally to go on Sunday night to hear a celebrated minister just for the sake of hear he _ talk _ -- ha -- ha -- ha and yet this be a professor of religion on the subject of slavery the follow conversation take place : -- _ nephew _ -- if i be in a slave state i would not hold slave _ aunt _ -- ah but you would _ nephew _ -- no that i would not _ aunt _ -- you could not live there without _

pastor of a church of color people in the city before you accompany I to he funeral listen to he voice though dead he yet speaketh he have feel this cruel prejudice against the color of he skin as iron enter he soul here be he touching testimony on the subject deliver in a speech at boston eleven year before he death : -- no man can really understand this prejudice unless he feel it crush he to the dust because it be a matter of feel it have bolt scourge and bar wherever the color man go it have bolt in all the school and college the color parent with the same soul as a white parent send he child to the seat of learning and he find the door bolt and he sit down to weep beside he boy prejudice stand at the door and bar he out do the child of the color man show a talent for mechanic the heart of the parent beat with hope he see the child of the white man engage in employment and he trust that there be a door open to he boy to get a honest living and become a useful member of society but when he come to the workshop with he child he find a bolt there but even suppose that he can get this first bolt remove he find other bar he can not work let he be ever so skilled in mechanic up start prejudice and say ' i will not work in the shop if you do ' here he be scourge by prejudice and have to go back and sink down to some of the employment which white man leave for the most degraded he hear of the death of a child from home and he go in a stage or a steam-boat he money be receive but he be scourge there by prejudice if he be sick he can have no bed he be drive on deck : money will not buy for he the comfort it get for all who have not he complexion he turn to some friend among the white man perhaps that white man have sit at he table at home but he do not resist prejudice here he say ` submit ` tis a ordinance of god -- you must be humble ' sir i have feel this as a minister i have be call to pass often up and down the north river in steam-boat many a night i have walk the deck and not be allow to lie down in a bed prejudice would even turn money to dross when it be offer for these comfort by a color man thus prejudice scourge we from the table it scourge we from the cabin from the stage-coach from the bed wherever we go it have for we bolt bar and rod and now let we attend the speaker 's funeral professor whipple will be we guide as we proceed crowd of color people be hasten in the same direction from all quarter we be at the house but so great be the throng that it be impossible to get in here however come dr cox make room for dr cox -- make room for dr cox be now hear on every hand a path be open for the great man and we little man slip in at he skirt on reach the room where the remains of the good man lie we find dr patton and the rev mr hatfield they and dr cox be there in a semi-official capacity as represent the presbytery with which mr wright be connect loui tappan the long-tried and faithful friend of the color race be there also i be ask to be a pall-bearer : without at all reflect on the duty and inconvenience of the office i good-naturedly consent a _ white _ cotton scarf be instantly throw over my shoulder there be the coffin and there be a lifelike portrait of mr wright hang up against the wall and look as it be down upon that coffin but you can see the face of mr wright himself the coffin-lid be screw down but there be a square of glass like a little window just over the face as be generally the case in america and you can have a view of the whole countenance a black man read a hymn and in connection with it begin a address in a very oracular style and with very solemn pause a hint be give he not to proceed they sing mr hatfield deliver a appropriate address a color minister pray sometimes use the first person singular and sometimes the first person plural also talk about the meanderings of life and a great deal of other nonsense we move down stair the immense procession start dr cox and patton mr hatfield and about half-a-dozen more white minister be in it as we pass on from street to street and from cross to cross all sort of people seem to regard the procession with the utmost respect the cabman ` busman and cartman behave exceedingly well but do you overhear what those three or four low dirty man say as we approach i be ashamed to tell because those man be not american but _ irishman _ -- here come the dead nigger the boy now and then be also overhear count how many _ white _ man there be in the procession we be now at the church after much delay and difficulty we enter the place which be not large be cram there must be about 600 people in dr cox urge they to make room for more and say there be not more than one-tenth in of those who wish to enter if so there must be a concourse of 6000 people and not more than twenty whites among they all a color man give out a hymn dr cox read the scripture and make a few remark dr patton deliver a oration in that oration while speaking of mr wright 's anti-slavery feeling as be very strong he add with very questionable taste but at the same time we brother have no sympathy with those who indulge in _ denunciation wrath and blackguardism _ he would never touch the missile which _ none but scoundrel use _ what a selection of word in a funeral oration in speaking of mr wright 's labor in connection with that church for fifteen year he say we brother have difficulty which other man have not two or three year ago he have to trudge about the city under the _ full muzzle _ of a July or August sun to beg money in order to extricate this place from pecuniary difficulty on one occasion after walk all the way to the upper part of the city to call upon a gentleman from whom he hope to receive a donation he find that he have just leave he residence for he office in the city we brother though greatly exhaust be compel to walk the same distance down again for -- to the shame the everlasting shame of we city be it speak -- we brother on account of he color could not avail himself of one of the public conveyance the next week disease lay hold of he and he never recover what a strong and unexpected testimony against that cruel prejudice accord to this testimony theodore sedgwick wright fall a _ victim _ to it but who would have think that dr patton who thus denounce the cabman and ` busman of new york have at the very time the negro pew in he own church while on this subject let I tell you another fact respect poor mr wright the life of he first wife be sacrifice to this heartless and unmanly feeling he be travel with she by steam-boat between new york and boston they have to be out all night and a bitter cold winter 's night it be be color people they only accommodation be the hurricane-deck mr wright be delicate she husband offer to pay any money if they would only let she be in the kitchen or the pantry no -- she be a nigger and could not be admit mr wright wrap she in he own cloak and place she against the chimney to try to obtain for she a little warmth but she take a severe cold and soon die _ he _ color it would seem hasten he own exit to rejoin she in that world where such absurd and inhuman distinction be unknown dr patton 's oration be now end but -- do you ever hear such a thing at a funeral -- that minister in the table pew be actually give out -- praise god from whom all blessing flow and they sing it to a funeral tune we start for the place of burial but it be a long way off and i have better spare you the journey the great man fall off one after another but my

the pastor of the first and second congregational church in this city honor we with a call this be brotherly and more than we could have expect dr bacon regret that he be go from home and can not have

-- a walk library he keep fully up with the literature and science of the day i have not meet a man either in the old world or in the new that so thoroughly understand the state of the british west indy at the present time as he do he might have spend year in that part of the world and devoted himself to its exclusive study he position at home be high and he influence great the estimation in which he be hold in new england may be judge of by the fact that when in August 1846 dr theodore dwight woolsey have to be install as president of yale college dr bacon living within a stone 's throw of that institution be the man choose to preach the inauguration sermon in the middle of the afternoon my friend mr sawyer press I to preach in he place of worship -- the howe-street church -- this

quarterly one the daily papers be i believe none of they more than 5 dollar -lrb- a guinea -rrb- a year or 2 cent -lrb- one penny -rrb- per number no paper duty and no stamp at the service in the evening several minister and student be present the next day snow to the depth of six inch cover the ground let _ we _ however turn out in the afternoon we will go and see the central square -- or the green as it be commonly call this be a large open space like a park surround on all side with row of stately elm and be consider one of the most beautiful spot in the united state and now we be in a position to take a full view three church arrange side by side on this open space at a few rod from each other stand before we the central one have the most impose aspect it be a large grecian building have a portico support by four massive column from which rise a lofty bell-tower end in a spire the combination of the belfry or spire with the grecian style be a violation of propriety but _ i like it _ this be the first congregational church -- that in which dr bacon minister that church -- not the building -- be coeval with the colony and can trace back its history for more than 200 year it be formerly a state church congregationalism be for age the standing order or the established religion in connecticut all the people be tax for its support and no man could have any share in the administration of the civil government or give he vote in any election unless he be a member of one of the church it be not till forty year after the separation of church and state in virginium where the establishment be episcopal that the example be follow in connecticut happily however in 1816 all party that differ from it -- episcopalian baptist methodist universalist & c combine together gain a majority in the legislature and sever the connection between congregationalism and the state there be old man now live who then anxiously and piously tremble for the ark of the lord they have however live to see that the dissolution of the union between church and state in connecticut as in virginium be to the favored sect as life from the dead the congregationalist of the one and the episcopalian of the other would alike deprecate be place in the same position again but this be a digression we be still look at these church the church on we right which be about the same size and of the same architectural character as the other though not quite so showy be the second congregational church commonly call the north church -- that in which mr button now minister this church originate in the great awakening in 1740 be form in 1742 and have a history of more than a century in duration it arise from dissatisfaction with the ministry of a mr noye a contemporary of jonathan edward but one who have no sympathy in edward 's view and spirit this man be indeed greatly oppose to the awakening and refuse george whitfield admission to he pulpit the originator of this second church therefore separate from the original parent avail themselves of the act of toleration and become congregational dissenter from a congregational establishment they have of course no state support nor be they free from taxation by the society from which they dissent the foundation of this church my brethren say its present gifted pastor in a sermon preach at the centenary of its formation be love of evangelical doctrine of ecclesiastical liberty of revival of religion such ever be its superstructure here for a quarter of a century live and labor jonathan edward the younger perhaps you have never before hear of he neither have i till i come to new haven if you will not think it too long to be detain here stand in front of the church i will tell you a few fact respect he he be the second son and ninth child of the celebrated jonathan edward of northampton he mother too be a extraordinary woman you will smile at the impression she make on the mind of good old george whitfield he have spend two day at mr edward 's house in northampton and he say i feel wonderful satisfaction in be at the house of mr edward he be a son himself and have a daughter of abraham for he wife a sweeter couple i have not yet see she be a woman adorn with a meek and quiet spirit and talk so feelingly and solidly of the thing of god and seem to be such a helpmeet to she husband that she cause I to renew those prayer which for some month i have put up to god that he would send I a daughter of abraham to be my wife i find upon many account it be my duty to marry lord i desire to have no choice of my own thou knowest my circumstance in quote this a american writer add he have not yet learn if he ever do that god be not please to make such ` sweet couple ' out of person who have no choice of they own mr edward junior or rather dr edward be -lrb- like he father -rrb- a great scholar and a profound divine he be frequently invite to assist at the examination in yale college on those occasion he use frequently to display he strictness and accuracy by call out _ haud recté _ -lrb- not right -rrb- this procure he the _ sobriquet _ of old haud recté by which he be afterwards know among the student some time after he resignation of the pastorate of this church he become the president of union college he work have recently be publish in two large octavo volume there be a striking parallel between the father and the son they be alike in the character of they mind and in they intellectual development the name education and early employment of the two be alike both be pious in they youth both be distinguish scholar both be tutor for equal period in the college where they be respectively educate both be settle in the ministry as successor to they maternal grandfather both be dismiss

inauguration the one in the 56th and the other in the 57th year of they age and each of they preach on the first sabbath of the year of he death from the same text -- this year thou shalt die but we

immediately in the rear of the center church be the state house complete in 1831 it be construct of stone and marble and form a prominent ornament of the city it present one of the best copy of a grecian temple i have see in the state in the rear of the north church quite at the remote corner of the green stand a plain barn-like methodist chapel and behind the whole peeping through the elm-tree you see the long range of building which constitute yale college take it all in all a view more interesting than that from the spot on which we now stand i have never beheld letter xxxi the spot on which whitfield preach -- judge daggett -- governor yale -- yale college -- the library -- elliot 's indian bible -- geological museum -- dr goodrich -- education and expense at yale college -- the grave of the regicide before i take you to yale let I show you the spot on the green on which in 1745 whitfield be refuse admission to the congregational church preach in the open air under a tree to a immense congregation -- so great at that time be the dislike to a fervid evangelical ministry but more than a century have roll away and how changed be the scene but observe you that feeble

vilify often have we hear the crown officer asperse and vilify they and some so late as 1775 visit and treat the grave with mark of indignity too indecent to be detail by those who can make a due allowance for difference of time and circumstance the grave of these exile will be visit with sentiment of veneration it would have be grand to spare the presumptuous monarch but we can not feel

-lrb- wax warm -rrb- what the devil do we want more in the afternoon we meet with dr hawe at the house of chief justice william to tea in the evening there be a united service in the fourth church -- that of which dr patton 's son be minister -- to hear from I a address on the subject of mission after which dr bushnell put to I publicly some very close and intelligent question with regard to the working of freedom in we west indium colony he be evidently anxious to elicit from I that kind of information which would enable they to contradict the statement of the pro-slavery party young patton be also a anti-slavery man and will not tolerate the distinction of color in he own church the next day mr gallaudet and mr patton call and accompany we to the historical room there we see carefully keep a old chest that have come over in the may flower and also the three-legged pot in which the pilgrim have first boil they food after landing on plymouth rock these and many other memorial of the father we be happy to find be very piously preserved then we go to a gallery of picture the admission fee be 25 cent or one shilling but from we be stranger they will accept of nothing in the collection there be much to admire but i could not help regret that the canvas be make to preserve the memory of so many conflict between england and she transatlantic son we dine at dr bushnell 's house the doctor be a very unassuming man and a very original but somewhat eccentric thinker he have lately publish a sermon on road a sermon on the moral use of the sea a sermon on stormy sabbath and a sermon on unconscious influence -- all treat in a very striking manner he have recently visit england and the continent of europe and have also contribute a article to the _ new englander _ a quarterly review on the evangelical alliance the view of a keen thinker from another land on that and kindred topic deserve to be ponder the church of god in england say the doctor can never be settle upon any proper basis whether of truth or of practical harmony until the established church as such be separate from the state he estimate of a large class of english christian be not very flattering they be good man but not think man they piety gurgle in a warm flood through they heart but it have not yet mount to they head \* \* \* in the ordinary _ ie _ in they preaching and piety they show a style of goodishness fitly represent by henry 's commentary in the extraordinary they rise into sublimity by inflation and the swell of the occasion towards slavery and slaveholder he manifest a tenderness of feeling at which we be surprised and pained the proposed exclusion of slaveholder from the alliance he characterize as absurd and fanatical speaking of the subject as have be so unhandsomely force upon the american brethren in london again there be too much good sense among the christian of this country -lrb- america -rrb- to think of constitute a alliance on the basis which deny christian character to all slaveholder at a future time when slavery have be discuss long enough we shall do so we can not do it now -- least of all can we do it at the dictation of brethren beyond the sea who do not understand the question & c and yet in the same article the doctor propose that the christian of england and america should unite they effort for the promotion of religious liberty in italy and say if we lift we testimony against all church dungeon and torture and against all suppression of argument by penalty as cruel absurd anti-christian and impious there be no prince or priesthood in italy or anywhere else that can long venture to perpetrate such enormity will they yield doctor to the dictation of brethren beyond the sea but this subject of american slavery be always represent by we transatlantic friend as a thing so _ profound _ that none but themselves can understand it and yet it be evident that they understand it least of all hear the doctor : -- we do not propose however in this movement for religious liberty to invite the effort of we english brethren here against slavery we have too little confidence in they knowledge of we condition and the correctness of they opinion generally on the subject of american slavery they must consent to let we manage the question in we own way & c how strikingly be it here see that this slavery be the weak point and the wicked point in the american character we like dr bushnell 's company he hospitality he wife he child he domestic discipline he church he other writings -- everything better than the article in question though even it contain much that we admire the next day we go to see the first congregational church in this place -- that in which dr hawe minister together with the old burying-ground attach to it this be the original church form by the first settler who in 1636 come from braintree in essex bring they pastor the rev tho hooker along with they of he it be say that he appear in the pulpit with such dignity and independence as if while engage in he master 's work he could put a king in he pocket here be he tomb date 1647 two eventful century have roll away during which this church have have only nine pastor all of whom except the last dr hawe who still survive die in they charge and be inter in this place interment here be no longer continue but a old bachelor of independent means a descendant of the pilgrim spend nearly the whole of he time among the tomb of the father and prophet and _ con amore _ keep the ground and the grave in the most beautiful order we host mr hosmer take we to see the new burying-ground outside of the city here the catholic and the color people have each a parcel of ground allot for themselves -- the former because they _ would _ not and the latter because they _ should _ not mingle they dust with that of other people on we way back i say to my friend how be it that neither mr pennington nor any of he people -lrb- color congregation -rrb- be at the meeting last night i should have think they would have come to hear about they own brethren in guiana why he reply the fact be i do not send a notice to they on Sunday : i know that in the ` fourth ' church they would have be scatter all over the place it would have be so unpleasant and talk of for month here then be a man of a large heart a friend of mission and of all that be good one who seem as if he could embrace the whole world in he sympathy under the dominion of a prejudice you would have expect he to scorn at hartford live mr sigourney the graceful american poetess she be a pious member of one of the congregational church mr hosmer kindly take we to call upon she and we be greatly please with we brief visit at 2 pm we leave with regret this delightful little city and shall always cherish a grateful remembrance of the christian kindness and hospitality with which we be treat in all the state we meet with nothing to be compare in all that be please to the two city of connecticut -- new haven and hartford in pass on we way to boston through worcester in massachusett i cast a hurry glance at every place that look like a smithy wonder whether it be there that elihu burritt have wield he forge-hammer and scatter he spark from the anvil we reach boston at 9 pm and stop at the united state hotel the next day i call to deliver note of introduction to several of the boston divine among they be one to the rev seth bliss at the tract depository have glance at the note he very hurriedly say to I ah how do you do -- very glad to see you -- where be you stop at -- at the united state hotel sir oh he reply all in a breath you have better come to my house -- it 'll be cheaper for you -- they 'll charge you 2 dollar a day at the united state hotel -- i only charge a dollar and a half -- i have a room at liberty now besides if you want to get acquaint with minister you can not do better than come to my house in fact the wag call my house the ` saint ' rest ' -- because i suppose they see i sell the book here the conjuncture of bliss and saint ' rest who could refuse we go but i will not tell how far the accommodation tend to realize we conception of those beatitude on the morrow we go to see faneuil hall the cradle of liberty a notice be up at the door to say the key be to be find at such a store in the neighborhood i ask for the key have it without a single question be put go open the door myself and staid as long as we please there be no hanger-on to try to squeeze a fee out of we as would have be the case in a country i know i then go and call without any introduction upon william lloyd garrison from whom i receive the most kind attention he accompany I to the celebrated bunker 's hill a scene of dreadful encounter between those who ought never to have be foe a column of 200 foot high now stand upon the spot it be unfortunate that the american have so many memento both natural and artificial of they struggle with we they tend to perpetuate a undesirable feeling letter xxxiv boston -lrb- continue -rrb- -- the old south -- unitarianism and connection between church and state -- a welsh service in a upper room -- laura bridgman and the wedding ring -- oliver caswell -- departure from boston -- john todd and he family -- he congregationalism -- albany and the delevan house -- journey to utica -- remsen and the welsh people -- dog make to churn and horse to saw wood on sabbath morning the 11th of April i preach for the rev mr blagden in the old south church this be a large old-fashioned square building have two gallery one above the other on three of its side it be rich in historical recollection here whitfield preach here patriotic meeting be hold even before faneuil hall be build and here the british troops be quarter at the time of the revolutionary war here too the lamp of truth be keep feebly burn when all around have sink into darkness and heresy at the commencement of this century the ministry in all the other congregational church in boston have become unitarian in the old south however there be a few people eight in number who form a society for religious improvement they could not at first _ pray _ together they only read the scripture and converse on religious subject but they grow in wisdom fervor and zeal and be eventually the means not only of revive religion in the old south but also of give a impulse in boston which be feel to this day church after church on orthodox principle have be institute till there be in boston more than a dozen large and vigorous church of the congregational order and the old south the honor mother of church have have she youth renew like the eagle but how come congregationalism to be so deteriorated it be owe to its have be make the state religion all be at first tax for its exclusive support this be feel to be unjust and oppressive and it bring the favored system into bad repute then a modification of the law be adopt and the citizen have they choice of system but be tax for the support of some system or other this provision likewise begin ere long to be feel as unjust towards those who do not wish to maintain _ any _ system or at least not by taxation this law moreover give a virtual support to unitarianism this say the rev mr button of new haven have be more fully illustrate in massachusett than in connecticut the repeal of the law for the compulsory support of religion in that commonwealth have prove a severe blow to unitarianism after the morning service at the old south we turn in to see park-street church another congregational place of worship which for the follow reason i be curious to enter a few year ago a color gentleman of respectability instruct a friend to purchase for he a pew in that church that no objection to the sale might arise from any neglect of decoration the new proprietor have it beautifully line and cushion it be make to look as handsome as any other pew in the church and when it be finish the gentleman and he family one sabbath morning take possession this give rise to great anxiety and alarm nigger in the body of the church what be to be do in the course of the follow week a meeting be hold and a deputation appoint to wait upon the gentleman and to tell he that it be against public feeling for he to occupy the pew in question the gentleman remonstrate and point out the injustice after he have purchase the pew and incur the expense of fitting it up of not be allow to enjoy it to this the deputation reply that they be sorry for any inconvenience or loss he might sustain but public feeling _ must _ be respect and the pew _ must _ be give up against this decision there be no appeal and the gentleman be oblige to let the pew be resell for such a price as the white aristocracy think fit to give on the principle that prevention be better than cure they have i be tell in boston introduce into every new trust-deed a clause that will effectually guard against the recurrence of such a calamity but so smartly have it be do that be you to examine those deed you would look in vain for a single syllable have the remotest apparent bearing on either black or colored people and you would be ready to suspect that the whole be a mere invention of the abolitionist indeed mr bliss at the saint ' rest assure I in the most positive manner that such be the case and that the whole of the story i have relate have not the shadow of a foundation in truth but she might as well have attempt to deny the existence of bunker 's hill or boston bay this be only a specimen of the manner in which the colour-hate party attempt to throw dust in the eye of stranger and deny the existence of the most palpable fact but how run the conservative clause which lead to this digression it be express in word to this effect -- that no sale of any pew be valid if two-third or three-fourth -lrb- i forget which -rrb- of the congregation should object to the purchaser this be quite enough those against whom it be direct need not be even mention it be well know that with this clause no color man could ever own a pew public feeling would piously take hold of this key and turn it against he in the afternoon i hear the rev en kirk the church be new and beautiful the congregation large and the sermon good in the evening i preach in welsh to about 70 people in a small upper room it be my first attempt for many year to deliver a _ sermon _ in that language nor should i have make it but for the peculiarity of the case the party be representative of four different denomination in wale have form themselves into a kind of evangelical alliance and have no state minister but gladly avail themselves of the occasional service of any minister of evangelical view who might be pass through poor and few as they be they insist upon my receive towards travel expense four dollar and a half this be not do at the old south though the pastor tell I they be burden with wealth nor be it do in any other instance in the _ american _ church the next day the rev mr blagden accompany we to see the massachusett asylum for the blind here we be introduce to laura bridgman who since she be about two year of age have be deaf dumb and blind she sens of taste and smell be also impaired she be 18 year of age and have be in the institution ten year every avenue of communication with the soul be close -- but one the sense of touch remain and by means of that they have contrived to reach the mind to inform it to instruct it to refine and elevate it we find she exactly correspond to the beautiful description give of she by dr howe who be at the head of the institution that description have so often be publish in england that i will not transcribe it she figure be genteel slender and well-proportioned she appear to be lively sensitive and benevolent the place where the bright blue eye once sparkle that be now quench in darkness be cover with a piece of green ribbon conversation with she be carry on by means of the speaker 's rapid finger on she right hand it be in this manner that we be introduce she shake hand with we very affectionately -- take hold of both hand of mr davy and feel all about she head she dress and she arm in do so she feel the wedding-ring and want to know by means of she interpreter -- she governess -- why the english lady wear a ring on that finger -lrb- the american lady do not observe the custom -rrb- on my wife tell she it be to show they be marry she seem very much amuse and astonish here it be very interesting to observe the progress of a think from ourselves to the governess and from she to that little white whispering loving listen hand that receive and communicate all idea until the brighten countenance and the lovely smile show it have reach the soul she feel a deep sympathy for ireland and wish to know what the english be do for the starve inhabitant we tell she and soon after we see by the public papers that subsequently to we visit she have do some needle-work which be sell and the proceeds appropriate at she request to purchase a barrel of flour for that unhappy land how exclaim elihu burritt she ply at morning noon and night those finger wonderful finger it seem that the very finger of god have touch they with miraculous susceptibility of fellowship with the spirit world and that around she she put they upon the face of he written word and feel they thrill to she heart with the pulsation of he great thought of love to man and then she _ feel _ for other 's woe poor child god bless she richly she reach out she short arm to feel after some more unhappy than she in the condition of this life some whose finger ' end have not read such sweet paragraph of heaven 's mercy as hers have do some who have not see hear and feel what she dumb silent deaf finger have bring into she heart of joy hope and love think of that ye young eye and ear that daily feast upon the beauty and melody of this outer world within the atmosphere of she quick sensibility she feel the presence of those whose cup be full of affliction she put she finger with they throbbing sympathy upon the lean bloodless face of the famishing child in ireland and she sightless eye fill with the tear that the blind may shed for grief they can not see and then she ply the needle and those finger and quicken they industry by place they anon upon the slow sickly pulse of want that waste she kind at noonday across the ocean day and night too -- for day and night be alike to she wakeful sympathy -- and week she work on with she needle and then the embroidery of those finger be sell to the merchant would it have be sell to england 's queen to be worn by the young princess on day of state it be sell and its purchase price be _ a barrel of flour _ instead of a country 's harvest which it be well worth and that barrel of flour be stow away without other private mark than that the recording angel put upon it among the thousand that freight the _ jamestown _ on she recent mission of brotherly love to ireland _ laura bridgman and she barrel of flour _ should teach the world a lesson worth the woe of one year 's famine laura favor we with she autograph on a slip of paper which we shall always carefully preserve as a memorial of a visit to one of the greatest wonder of the age in another room we be introduce to oliver caswell he be about the same age as laura and similarly afflict but have be in the institution only six year he teacher tell he in the same finger-language which be use with laura that we come from british guiana and desire he to find out the place on the large globe before he this globe be make for the use of the blind have upon it the country and they name in relievo oliver turn it round and feel with he finger until they soon rest on the require spot when he seem greatly delighted he attainment be not so remarkable as those of laura for he have not be so long under tuition but he progress be highly encouraging at 4 pm we leave boston by railway for albany -- fare 5 dollar each we rest however at springfield for the night and that in the most comfortable hotel we have meet with in the state the next day we move on to pittsfield where we arrive at half-past 11 finding that we might get off from that train and go by another in three or four hour ' time we avail ourselves of the opportunity of call upon the rev dr todd the author of lecture to child the student 's guide & c instead of the prim neat little man we have always imagine he to be we find he tall coarse slovenly and unshaven a man of 46 year of age hair of a iron-grey rough and uncombed feature large cheek-bone prominent and the strap of he trowser unbuttoned and flap about he slipper but under this unpromising exterior we discern a soul of great intelligence frankness and brotherly kindness mr todd have be a woman of great beauty and though she have bring up a large family of child be still fresh and comely they eldest daughter be 19 year of age and john to whom the lecture to child be dedicate be now 14 year of age the doctor 's insane mother for whose sake he be first lead to employ he pen have be dead for some year he desire to visit england be very strong he have be appoint by the church of massachusett to visit those of england last year in the character of a delegate but the means of meet the expense of such a delegation be not provide and consequently the visit be not pay it be worthy of observation that the doctor 's book have be sell in england far more extensively than in america but from the english edition he receive no profit and even from the american one very little as it may be the first time that english reader hear of john todd as _ doctor _ todd and as there be a impression that we american friend bestow they literary honor too freely and indiscriminately -- which indeed be true in reference to some score of institution -- nothing be easier than to obtain a dd -- i would just observe that this apply not to the new england college they be very chary of such honor and only confer that of dd on minister of long standing and high attainment in the case of mr todd it be most deservedly bestow pittsfield be but a small town of about 5000 inhabitant the governor of massachusett reside there and be a deacon of a baptist church dr todd preside over a congregational church to the principle of congregationalism he be devoutly attach while other regard presbyterianism and congregationalism as matter of mere geographical boundary todd could never be prevail upon even by the most advantageous offer to do the same he say he have nail he flag to the mast and would never abandon it i regard congregationalism say he to I as a sort of a working-jacket : with it on i can work with anybody in any place and in any way with this great and good man we exceedingly enjoy a homely dinner and a few hour ' converse

the scripture tempt to idolatry 3 if he be not truly god the account which the scripture give of he be self-contradictory 4 if he be not truly god there be no evidence from scripture that there be a god at all this be a massive and compact argument for the divinity of christ it occupy upward of a hour in the delivery and be read in the afternoon i take care to be in the pulpit five minute before the time the doctor shortly after come and take he seat behind I this to I be always a annoyance -- i would almost as soon have a man with I in bed as in the pulpit -- and in this instance it be

american the american may meeting hold in new york do not last a month as in england -- a week suffice that week be the second in the month on the sabbath precede sermon on behalf of many of the society be preach in various church on the morning of the sabbath in question we go to the tabernacle not know whom we should hear to we surprise and pleasure my friend dr baird be the preacher he text be let thy kingdom come and the object for which he have to plead be the foreign evangelical society of which he be the secretary he sermon be exceedingly simple and the delivery quite in a off-hand conversational style there be no reading in the evening we hear dr bushnell preach on behalf of the american home-missionary society at the church of the pilgrim in brooklyn this be a fine costly building name in honor of the pilgrim father and have a fragment of the plymouth rock imbed in the wall the sermon be a very ingenious one on judge xvii 13 : then say micah now know i that the lord will do I good see i have a levite to my priest the preacher observe that micah live in the time of the judge -- what might be call the emigrant age of israel -- that he be introduce on the stage of history as a thief -- that he afterwards become in he own way a saint and must have a priest first he consecrate he own son but he son not be a levite it be difficult for so pious a man to be satisfied fortunately a young levite -- a stroll mendicant probably -- come that way and he promptly engage the youth to remain and act the _ padre _ for he say dwell with I and be a _ father _ unto I have thus get up a religion the thief be content and he mental trouble be quiet become a romanist before rome be found he say now know i that the lord will do I good see i have a levite to my priest religion to he consist in a fine silver apparatus of god and a priest in regular succession in this story of micah it be see that _ emigration or a new settlement of the social state involve a tendency to social decline _ we first danger say the preacher be barbarism -- romanism next the tendency to barbarism be illustrate by historic reference the emigration head by abraham soon develop a mass of barbarism -- lot give rise to the moabite and the ammonite meanwhile abraham throw off upon the world in he son ishmael another stock of barbarian -- the arab -- a name which accord to some signify _ westerner _ one generation later and another ferocious race spring from the family of isaac -- the descendant of esau or the edomite then come down to the time of the judge we find that violence prevail that the road be destroy and that the art have perish : there be not even a smith leave in the land and they be oblige to go down to the philistine to get a axe or a mattock sharpen then the preacher come to the great american question itself it be often suppose that in new england there have always be a upward tendency it be not so it have be downward until the great revival about the year 1740 the danger to which society in the south and far west be now expose be powerfully describe the remedy be then point out first of all we must not despair and what next we must get rid if possible of slavery ` we must have peace ' also railway and telegraph education too we must favor and promote above all provide a talented and educate body of christian teacher and keep they press into the wilderness as far as emigration itself can go the conclusion of this great sermon be so remarkable that i can not but give it in the doctor 's own word and now jehovah god thou who by long age of watch and discipline didst make of thy servant abraham a people be thou the god also of this great nation remember still its holy beginning and for the father ' sake still cherish and sanctify it fill it with thy light and thy potent influence till the glory of thy son break out on the western sea as now upon the eastern and these uttermost part give to christ for he possession

the afternoon among the speaker be the rev mr patton from hartford son of dr patton who make a very effective speech the rev samuel ward also a black man of great muscular power and amazing command of language and of himself astonished and delighted I i could not but exclaim there speak a black demosthene this man strange to say be the pastor of a congregational church of white people in the state of new york as a public speaker he seem superior to frederick douglass it be please at those anti-slavery meeting to see how completely intermingle be the whites and the color i have be invite in the evening to speak at the public meeting of the foreign evangelical society and to take tea at dr baird 's house while i be there dr anderson one of the secretary of the american board of commissioner

have recently return from europe where he have converse on the subject of he mission with fourteen crown head read a most interesting report the writer have then to address the meeting after he three other gentleman speak there be no collection strange to say that with all they revival we friend in america seem to be morbidly afraid of do anything under the influence of excitement hence the address on occasion like this be generally stiff and study half-an-hour oration this feeling prevent they turn the voluntary principle in the support of they religious society to so good a account as they otherwise might at the close of this meeting there seem to be a fine state of feeling for make a collection and yet no collection be make this society be one of great value and importance it be design to tell in the promotion of evangelical truth on the catholic country of europe and south america in those country it employ a hundred colporteur in the sale and distribution of religious publication the next morning i address a breakfast meeting of about 400 people in a room connect with the tabernacle this be a new thing in the new world it be moreover a anti-slavery breakfast under

west and south-west in my own address i compliment the director on the ground they have recently take in reference to slavery and proceed to say that there be a important sense in which that society should be a anti-slavery society this elicit the cheer of the few which be immediately drown in the hiss of the many the interruption be but momentary and i proceed the next morning one of the secretary endeavor to persuade I that the hiss be not at myself but at those who interrupt I with they cheer i tell he he explanation be ingenious and kind nevertheless i think i might justly claim the honor of have be hiss for utter a anti-slavery sentiment at the tabernacle in new york this society have a herculean task to perform and in consideration of it we american friend might well be excuse for some year be it possible from all foreign operation westward the star of empire move ohio welcome its first permanent settler in 1788 and now it be occupy by nearly 2000000 of people michigan obtain its first immigrant but fourteen or fifteen year ago and now have a population of 300000 indiana admit into the union in 1816 have since then receive a population of more than half a

unbroken wilderness number even in 1846 87000 inhabitant and the emigration to the far west be now greater than ever a giant be therefore grow up there who will soon be able and disposed to rule the destiny of the united state the church of rome be strain every nerve to have that giant in she own keep and already shout the song of triumph say one of she sanguine son the church be now firmly establish in this country and persecution will but cause it to thrive we countryman may grieve that it be so but it be useless for they to kick against the decree of the almighty god they have a open field and fair play for protestantism here she have have free scope have reign without a rival and prove what she could do and that she best be evil for the very good she boast be not hers a new day be dawn on this chosen land and the church be about to assume she rightful position and influence ours shall yet become consecrated ground _ we hill and valley shall yet echo to the convent-bell _ the cross shall be plant throughout the length and breadth of we land and we happy son and daughter shall drive away fear shall drive away evil from we border with the echo of they matin and vesper hymn no matter who write who declaim who intrigue who be alarmed or what league be form this be to be a catholic country and from maine to georgia from the broad atlantic to broader pacific the ` clean sacrifice ' be to be offer daily for quick and dead the triumph may be premature but it convey a timely warn the next day the anniversary of the bible society be hold the hon theodore frelinghuysen preside at that meeting i have be request to speak but could not indeed we be detain all day on board a vessel by which we expect every hour to sail for jamaica though after all we have to wait until the follow day on that day the 14th of may just at the time the board of mission be hold they public meeting we sail and bid adieu to new york and all the delightful engagement of that memorable week but say you tell we in a few word what you think of america upon the whole i will try to do so there be a class of thing i greatly admire and there be a class of thing i greatly detest among the former i may mention -- 1 religious equality -- the absence of a state church 2 the workings of the voluntary principle in the abundant supply of place of worship and in the support of religious institution 3 general education with regard to they common school and also to they college they be far in advance of we in england the existence of universal suffrage have the effect of stimulate educational effort to a degree which would not otherwise be attain the more respectable and intelligent of the citizen be make to feel that with universal suffrage they dearest institution be all perill unless the mass be educate as education be the great question of the day i must not omit to make a few remark on the primary school of the united state there be no _ national _ system of education in america congress do not interfere in the matter except in the territory before they become state the state of the union be so many distinct republic and in the matter of education as in all they internal affair be leave entirely to take they own measure with regard to education no two state act precisely alike if we glance at the state of massachusett new york and ohio we shall however discover the three great type of what in this respect generally prevail throughout the state massachusett -- scarcely have the pilgrim be half-a-dozen year in they wilderness home before they begin to make what they deem a suitable provision for the instruction of they child they adopt the same principle in reference to education and religion -- that of taxation a general tax be not impose but the people in the various township be empower to tax themselves to a certain amount and to manage the whole affair by means of they own select man but although this law have continue for 200 year the people have always do far more than it require in boston for instance the law demand only 3000 dollar a year but not less than 60000 dollar be raise and apply so that here we have a noble proof not so much of the effect of government interference as of the efficiency of the voluntary principle in provide education for the young the people of massachusett and indeed of all the new england state be doubtless the best educate in the world not one in a thousand of those bear here grow up unable to read and write the calumniated pilgrim be thus early attentive to the importance of education and they system have be in full operation for between thirty and forty year when in 1670 sir william berkley governor of virginium the stronghold of the anglican church thus devoutly address the lord of plantation in england : -- i thank god _ there be no free school nor printing _ and i hope we shall not have they these hundred year for learning have bring _ disobedience and heresy and sect _ into the world and printing have divulge they and libel against the best government god keep we from both the system of massachusett may be regard as a type of what prevail in the six new england state except connecticut where there be a state fund of upward of 2000000 dollar yield a annual dividend of about 120000 dollar for school purpose new york -- in this state a large fund for school have be create by the sale of public land the proceeds of this fund be annually distribute in such a way as to secure the raising by local effort of at least three time the amount for the same object this fund be thus use as a gentle stimulant to local exertion the system describe will convey a notion of what exist in the _ middle _ state ohio -- in this and the western state every township be divide into so many section of a mile square and one of these section out of a give number be devote to the maintenance of school as a township increase in population the reserved section advance in value these school be not subject to any central control but be under the management of a committee choose by the township still education be not so general in all the state as might be wish miss beecher the daughter of dr beecher have devote to the subject much time and talent tell we that there be in the united state a million adult who can not read and write and more than two million of child utterly illiterate and entirely without school of the child in this condition 130000 be in ohio and 100000 in kentucky in the working of this system of education the absence of a state church afford advantage not enjoy in england of late however a objection to the use of the bible in these school have be raise by the roman catholic and the question in some state have be fiercely agitate in the city of st loui the bible have be exclude in cincinnatus the catholic fail to exclude it have establish school of they own this agitation be one of great interest it lead thoughtful and devout man to ask whether when the state assume to be the instructor of its subject establish school and put protestant bible or any other or none into they _ by law _ they have not thenceforth protestantism popery or infidelity so far _ by law establish _ and whether it be not better that the state should restrict itself to its proper function as the minister of justice leave secular instruction like religious to the spontaneous resource of the people to this i think it will come at last the common school economy be a remnant of the old church-and-state system which have not be entirely sweep away but for this impression i should feel some uneasiness lest it should prove the germ of a new order of thing lead back to state-churchism it appear to I quite natural to say here be a state provision for school -- why not have a similar provision for church it work well for the one -- why not for the other be it not as important that we church should rely not alone on the capricious and scanty effort of the voluntary principle but also on the more respectable and permanent support of the state as it be that we common school should adopt this course to I it seem that the argument which recommend the one support the other but when i have mention to intelligent man the possibility not to say probability of the one step lead to the other they have invariably be surprise at my apprehension and have assure I that nothing be more unlikely to take place but to show the jealousy with which on _ other _ grounds the system begin to be view i will close by a short quotation from a writer in the _ new englander _ a respectable _ quarterly _ to which i have before refer it will doubtless be think strange to say that the system of public common-school education now exist and seek to be establish throughout we country may yet while christian sleep become one of the greatest if not _ the _ greatest antagonism in the land to all evangelical instruction and piety but how long before they will be so -- when they shall have become the mere creature of the state and under the plea of no sectarianism mere naturalism shall be the substance of all the religious and the basis of all the secular teaching which they shall give and let it not be forget that strong current of influence in all part of the country act in no chance concert be do they utmost to bring about just this result 4 i admire they _ temperance _ i confess that i feel humble and ashamed for my own country when so soon as i trod on british ground or british _ plank _ the old absurd drinking usage again salute my eye in all the state i meet with nothing more truly ludicrous than some of these for instance when ab 's mouth happen to be well replenish with flesh fish or fowl potato pudding or pastry at one table cd from another table far away across the room at the top of he voice call out mr ab allow I the pleasure to take a glass of wine with you ab make a very polite bow fill he glass in a great hurry hold it up with he right hand cd do the same thing with he and then ab and cd make another polite bow to each other simultaneously swallow they glass of wine be we not _ accustomed _ to the sight it would appear as laughable as anything traveller tell we of the manners and custom of the least enlighten nation surely if this childish practice be still a rule in polite society it be one more honor in the breach than the observance in no city on the eastern side of the alleghany mountain do i meet a single drunken american in the street the few whom i do detect in that plight be manifestly recent importation from great britain and ireland 5 i also greatly admire they _ secular enterprise _ they afford a fine illustration of the idea convey in they own indigenous phrase go a-head letter xxxvii slavery -- responsibility of the north -- district of columbium -- preponderance of the slave power -- extermination of the indian -- president taylor and he blood-hound -- conclusion but there be a class of thing among they which man of well-regulated mind and habit can not but detest these as they have come under my notice i have point out the chief of all be _ slavery _ this stare I in the face the moment i enter the state and it press itself on my notice now that i have retire from the american shore it be the beginning and the ending of all that be vile and vicious in this confederation of republic in england you have be often tell by american visiter that the northern state of the union be not at all identify with slavery and be in fact no more responsible for its existence in the south than we be for the existence of a like system in the colony of some of we european ally than this representation nothing can be further from the truth there be really no analogy whatever between the two case each state it be true have its own distinct and independent legislature but all the state be unite in one federation which have a thoroughly pro-slavery government the constitution be pledge to maintain the execrable system and the northern state be pledge to maintain the hypocritical constitution that no preponderance of influence might be give to any one state over the rest by make it the seat of the central government a district of 10 mile square be partition out partly from virginium and partly from maryland for that purpose this district call the district of columbium have no government and no representation of its own but be under the absolute control and regulation of the united government or congress exclusive jurisdiction over it in all case whatsoever have be give by the constitution in this absolute government of the ten mile square embrace the site of washington the capital the northern state by they representative in congress have they full share now not merely do slavery exist in that district but it exist there under statute so barbarous and cruel that the neighbouring slave state have actually abolish the like within the bound of they separate jurisdiction leave to the _ free _ state the unenviable responsibility of enforce law too horrible for kidnapper take a specimen -- a slave convict of any petit treason or murder or wilful burning of a dwelling-house to have the right hand cut off to be hang in the usual manner the head sever from the body the body divide into four quarter and the head and quarter set up in the most public place of the county where such act be commit take another -- a _ free negro _ may be arrest and put in jail for 3 month on _ suspicion _ of be a runaway and if he be not able to _ prove _ he freedom in 12 month _ he be to be sell as a slave _ to pay he jail fee be there not hundred of free man both black and white who could not _ prove _ they freedom under such circumstance yet for this _ crime _ they be reduce to perpetual bondage _ by authority of congress _ and all this the north uphold washington the capital thus govern be but the great mart of the national man-trade from the adjoining port of alexandrium 7 mile off the victim be ship for the south listen to the _ gazette _ of that place -- here you may behold father and brother leave behind they the dearest object of affection and move slowly along in the mute agony of despair -- there the young mother sob over the infant whose innocent smile seem but to increase she misery from some you will hear the burst of bitter lamentation while from other the loud hysteric laugh break forth denote still deeper agony but you will be tell that it be not in the power of northern member to alter this state of thing why not in the house of representative the free state have a majority of about 50 and in the senate they have for some year be equal but have they try have they protest have they vote have they divide the house they _ have _ vote how _ eighty-two northern man _ a few year ago vote that congress ought not to interfere _ in any way _ with slavery in the district of columbium look at some of the provision of the federal government see what solemn guarantee it give to the accursed system of slavery in whatever state it may be find art i sect 2 say representative and direct tax shall be apportion among the several state which may be include within this union accord to they respective number which shall be determine by add to the whole number of free person include those bind to serve for a term of year and exclude indian not tax _ three-fifth of all other person _ -- that be to say _ slave _ for once call person here be a positive premium on slave-holding this constitute a aristocracy of the most monstrous character and introduce into the social fabric a element as absurd as it be perilous talk of the aristocracy of england and the undue influence of land proprietor you have nothing half so unjust and vicious as this suppose the southern state have two million and a half of slave : for that amount of property they have one million and a half of additional vote while in the free state there be no property representation whatever or look at the question in another aspect two citizen have each a capital of 5000_l _ to invest the one invest in shipping or commerce in new york and at the time of the election count _ one _ the other invest in slave in south carolina obtain for the sum mention a whole gang of 100 human being of both sex and of all age and at the time of the election he count _ sixty-one _ -- swamp with he 100 slave the vote of sixty-one respectable merchant in a free state this it be which have constitute a aristocracy of about 200000 slaveholder in the south the ruling power in the united state it have make the preservation and extension of slavery the vital and move principle of the national policy so that ever since 1830 slavery slave-holding slave-breeding and slave-trading have enjoy the special and foster care of the federal government as to the _ quid pro quo _ -- the taxation that be to be connect with the representation of three-fifths of all other person that have be almost entirely evade there have not be say a new england reviewer if we mistake not but in one instance and then in a very light degree a assessment of direct taxation art i sect 8 say congress shall have power -- among other thing -- to suppress _ insurrection _ and art iv sect 4 say the united state shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of they against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive -lrb- when the legislature can not be convene -rrb- against _ domestic violence _ these clause pledge the whole force of the united state ' army and navy too if need be to the maintenance of slavery in any or in all the state and district in which it may exist but for this the system could not stand a single day let the north say to the south we will not interfere with you ` peculiar institution ' but we will not defend it if you can not keep you slave in subjection you must expect no aid from we let they only say this and _ do _ nothing and the whole fabric of slavery would instantly crumble and fall the edifice be rotten and be prop up only by the buttress of the north the south retain the slave because the free state furnish the sentinel again art iv sect 2 say no person hold to service or labor in one state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be _ deliver up _ on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due this clause pledge the north not only to refuse a asylum to the fugitive slave but also to deliver he up to he unrighteous and cruel task-master -- a deed which the law of god expressly condemn and which the best impulse of we nature repudiate with loathing and contempt the article before we constitute all the free state of the union a slave-hunting ground for the southern aristocracy talk of the game law of england here be a game law infinitely more unjust and oppressive a free country this a noble government hail columbium see how this slave-holding aristocracy have always manage to oppress the north and to secure to themselves the lion 's share of the good thing of government the presidency -- out of the 16 presidential election since the origin of the confederation 13 have be in favor of slave-holder and only 3 in favor of northern man by hold the presidency slavery rule the cabinet the diplomacy the army and the navy of the union the power that control the presidency control the nation no northern president have ever be re-elect the vice-presidency -- the individual who hold this office be _ ex-officio _ president of the senate and as such have a casting vote in all question before that body during the last 20 year with one exception this functionary have always be a slave-holder the office of secretary of state -- this be second only in importance to the presidency it be the duty of this officer to direct correspondence with foreign court instruct the foreign minister negotiate treaty & c of the 16 who have hitherto fill that office 10 have be from the slave state and 6 from the free the speaker of the house of representative -- this officer have the appointment of all committee and exert a immense influence on the legislation of the country during 31 of the 34 year from 1811 to 1845 the speaker be all slave-holder the slave power have thus the whole machinery of government under its control can at any time bring all the resource of the nation to bear upon the preservation and extension of the peculiar institution while florida for instance belong to spain it furnish a asylum for runaway slave from the neighbouring state it must therefore be purchase by the union and five million of dollar be pay for it still the native indian those child of the forest afford a shelter to fugitive from slavery they must therefore be either exterminate or exile a war be wage against they they be drive from the home of they father and the negro among they hunt and shoot like wild beast at the urgent recommendation of zachary taylor -- the person who in march next will doubtless mount the presidential chair -- blood-hound be purchase as auxiliary to the army at a cost of five thousand dollar and blood-hound and soldier and officer march together under the star-spangled banner in pursuit of the panting fugitive from southern oppression in this expedition they capture 460 negro each one at the cost of the life of two white man and at a further expense of at least eighty thousand dollar per head the whole outlay of the war be _ forty million of dollar _ most of which be draw from the pocket of northern people the annexation of texa and the mexican war -- all for the perpetuation and extension of slavery -- be fresh in you remembrance and here i quit the land of the bond and the free nineveh babylon and ancient rome speak to the
