which concern itself with a hay-cart and a belligerent waggoner _ it be upon a certain August morning that george bellew shake the dust of london from he foot and leave chance or destiny to direct he follow a hap-hazard course careless alike of how or when or where sigh as often and as heavily as he consider he heart-broken condition require -- which be very often and very heavily -- yet heed for all that the glory of the sun and the stir and bustle of the street about he thus it be that be careless of he ultimate destination fortune condescend to take he under she wing -lrb- if she have one -rrb- and guide he step across the river into the lovely land of kent -- that county of gentle hill and broad pleasant valley of wind stream and shady wood of rich meadow and smile pasture of grassy lane and fragrant hedgerow -- that most delightful land which have be call and very rightly the garden of england it be thus as have be say upon a fair August morning that bellew set out on what he term a walk tour the reservation be necessary because bellew 's idea of a walking-tour be original and quaint he begin very well for bellew -- in the morning he walk very nearly five mile and in the afternoon before he be discover he accomplish ten more on a hay-cart that happen to be go in he direction he have swing himself up among the hay unobserved by the somnolent driver and have ride thus a hour or more in that delicious state between waking and sleep ere the waggoner discover he whereupon ensue the follow colloquy : the waggoner -lrb- _ indignantly _ -rrb- hallo there what might you be a do of in my hay bellew -lrb- _ drowsily _ -rrb- enjoy myself immensely the waggoner -lrb- _ growl _ -rrb- well you get out o ' that and sharp about it bellew -lrb- _ yawn _ -rrb- not on you life no sir -- ` not for cadwallader and all he goat ' the waggoner you jest get down out o ' my hay -- now come bellew -lrb- _ sleepily _ -rrb- enough good fellow -- go to -- thy voice offend mine ear the waggoner -lrb- _ threateningly _ -rrb- ear be blow if ye do not get down out o ' my hay -- i 'll come a ' throw ye out bellew -lrb- _ drowsily _ -rrb- ` twould be a act of wanton aggression that like I not the waggoner -lrb- _ dubiously _ -rrb- where be ye goin ' bellew wherever you like to take I thy way shall be my way and -- er -- thy people -- -lrb- yawn -rrb- so drive on my rustic jehu and heaven 's blessing prosper thee say which bellew close he eye again sigh plaintively and once more compose himself to slumber but to drive on the waggoner very evidently have no mind instead fling the rein upon the back of he horse he climb down from he seat and spit on he hand clench they into fist and shake they up at the yawn bellew one after the other it be enough say he to raise the ` old adam ' inside o ' I to ` ave a tramper o ' the road a-snoring in my hay -- but i be not a-going to be call name into the bargain ` rusty ' -- i may be but i reckon i be good enough for the likes o ' you -- so come on down and the waggoner shake he fist again he be a very square man be this waggoner square of head square of jaw and square of body with twinkling blue eye and a pleasant good-natured face but just now the eye gleam and the face be set grimly and altogether he look a very ugly opponent therefore bellew sigh again stretch himself and very reluctantly climb down out of the hay no sooner be he fairly in the road than the waggoner go for he with a rush and a whirl of knotted fist it be very dusty in that particular spot so that it presently rise in a cloud in the midst of which the battle rage fast and furious and in a while the waggoner rise out of the ditch grin to see bellew wipe blood from he face you be no -- fool pant the waggoner mop he face with the end of he neckerchief leastway -- not wus ' you fist why you be pretty good yourself if it come to that return bellew mop in he turn thus they stand a while stanch they wound and gaze upon each other with a mutual and grow respect well enquire bellew when he have recover he breath somewhat shall we begin again or do you think we have have enough to be sure i begin to feel much better for you effort you see exercise be what i most need just now on account of the -- er -- haunt spectre of the might have be -- to offset its effect you know but it be uncomfortably warm work here in the sun be not it ah nod the waggoner it be then suppose we -- er -- continue we journey say bellew with he dreamy gaze upon the tempting load of sweet-smelling hay ah nod the waggoner again begin to roll down he sleeve suppose we do i be not above give a lift to a chap as can use ` be fist -- not even if ' e be a vagrant and a uncommon dusty one at that -- so if you be in the same mind about it up you get -- but no more furrin curse mind with which admonition the waggoner nod grin and climb back to he seat while bellew swing himself up into the hay once more friend say he as the waggon creak upon its way do you smoke ah nod the waggoner then here be three cigar which you do not manage to smash just now cigar why it be not often as i get so far as a cigar unless it be squire or parson -- cigar eh say which the waggoner turn and accept the cigar which he proceed to stow away in the cavernous interior of he wide-eaved hat handle they with elaborate care rather as if they be explosive of a highly dangerous kind meanwhile george bellew american citizen and millionaire lay upon the broad of he back stare up at the cloudless blue above and despite heart break and a certain haunting shadow feel singularly content which feeling he be at some pain with himself to account for it be the exercise say he speak he thought aloud as he stretch luxuriously upon he soft and fragrant couch after all there be nothing like a little exercise that be what they all say nod the waggoner but i notice as they as say it be not over fond o ' do of it -- they mostly prefer to lie on they back a ' talk about it -- like yourself hum say bellew ha ` some be bear to exercise some achieve exercise and some like myself have exercise thrust upon they ' but anyway it be a very excellent thing -- more especially if one be affect with a -- er -- broken heart a w ` ot enquire the waggoner blighted affection then sigh bellew settle himself more comfortably in the hay you be not ` int at -- love be ye enquire the waggoner cock a somewhat sheepish eye at he i be but just at present and here bellew lower he voice it be a -- er -- rather painful subject with I -- let we therefore talk of something else you do not mean to say as you ` eart 's break do ye enquire the waggoner in a tone of such vast surprise and disbelief that bellew turn and prop himself on a indignant elbow and why the deuce not he retort my heart be no more impervious than anyone else 's -- confound it but say the waggoner you be not get the look of a ` eart-broke cove no more than squire cassili -- which the same i hear tell miss anthea as ` be ` eart be break no later than yesterday at two o'clock in the arternoon as ever be anthea repeat bellew blinking drowsily up at the sky again that be a very quaint name and very pretty pretty -- ah -- a ' so 's miss anthea -- as a pict ` er oh really yawn bellew ah nod the waggoner there be not a man in or out o ' the parish from squire down as do not think the very same but here the waggoner 's voice tail off into a meaningless drone that become merge with the creaking of the wheel the plodding hoof-stroke of the horse and bellew fall asleep he be awaken by feeling himself shake lustily and sit up saw that they have come to where a narrow lane branch off from the high road and wind away between great tree yon 's you way nod the waggoner point along the high road dapplemere village lie over yonder ` bout a mile thank you very much say bellew but i do not want the village no enquire the waggoner scratch he head certainly not answer bellew then -- what do ye want oh well i 'll just go on lie here and see what turn up -- so drive on like the good fellow you be can not be do say the waggoner why not why since you ax I -- because i do not have to drive no farther there be the farm-house -- over the up-land yonder you can not see it because o ' the tree but there it be so bellew sigh resignedly and perforce climb down into the road what do i owe you he enquire owe I say the waggoner stare for the ride and the -- er -- very necessary exercise you afford I lord cry the waggoner with a sudden great laugh you do not owe I nothin ' for that -- not nohow -- i owe you one for a knock of I into that ditch back yonder though to be sure i do give ye one or two good ` un do not i you certainly do answer bellew smile and he hold out he hand hey -- what be this cry the waggoner stare down at the bright five-shilling piece in he palm well i rather think it be five shilling say bellew it be big enough heaven know english money be all ok i suppose but it be confoundedly confusing and rather heavy to drag around if you happen to have enough of it -- ah nod the waggoner but then nobody never _ have _ enough of it -- leastway i never know nobody as have good-bye sir and thankee and -- good luck say which the waggoner chirrup to he horse slip the coin into he pocket nod and the waggon creak and rumble up the lane bellew stroll along the road breathe a air fragrant with honey-suckle from the hedge and full of the song of bird pause now and then to listen to the blythe carol of a sky-lark or the rich sweet note of a black-bird and feeling that it be indeed good to be alive so that what with all this -- the springy turf beneath he foot and the blue expanse over-head he begin to whistle for very joy of it until remember the haunting shadow of the might have be he check himself and sigh instead presently turn from the road he climb a stile and follow a narrow path that lead away across the meadow and as he go there meet he a gentle wind laden with the sweet warm scent of ripening hop and fruit on he go and on -- heedless of he direction until the sun grow low and he grow hungry wherefore look about he presently espy a nook sheltered from the sun 's level ray by a steep bank where flower bloom and fern grow here he sit down unsling he knap-sack and here it be also that he first encounter small porge chapter iv _ how small porge in look for a fortune

: -- on the flat of he back when he be aware of a crash in the hedge above and then of something that hurtle past he all arm and leg that roll over two or three time and eventually bring up in a sit posture and lift a lazy head bellew observe that it be a boy he be a very diminutive boy with a round head cover with coppery curl a boy who stare at bellew out of a pair of very round blue eye while he tenderly cherish a knee and a elbow he have be on the brink of tear for a moment but meeting bellew 's quizzical gaze he manfully repress the weakness and lift the small and somewhat weather-beaten cap that find a precarious perch at the back of he curly head he gravely wish bellew good afternoon well meet my lord chesterfield nod bellew return the salute be you hurt just a bit -- on the elbow but my name 's george why -- so be mine say bellew though they call I ` georgy-porgy ' of course they do nodded bellew they use to call I the same once upon a time -- georgy porgy pudding and pie kiss

thoughtfully to be sure for bellew dislike hurry often pause to listen to the music of run water or to stare away across the purple valley for the sun be get low and ever as they go they talk to one another whole-heartedly as good friend should and from the boy 's eager lip bellew hear much of auntie anthea and learn little by little something of the brave fight she have make lonely and unaided and burden with ancient debt to make the farm of dapplemere pay likewise small porge speak learnedly of the condition of the market and of the distressing fall in price in regard to hay and wheat old adam -- he be we man you know he say that farming be not what it be in he young day ` specially if you happen to be a woman like my auntie anthea a ' he tell I yesterday that if he be auntie he would

word perhaps suggest bellew smile down at he a ' wide too nodded small porge and from these two fact he seem to derive a deal of solid comfort and satisfaction for he stride on manfully once more leave the high-road he guide bellew by diver wind path through corn-field and over stile until at length they be come to a orchard such a orchard as surely may only be find in kent -- where great apple-tree gnarl and knot shoot out huge branch that seem to twist and writhe where be stately pear tree where peach and apricot ripen against time-worn wall whose red brick still glow rosily for all they year where the air be sweet with the scent of fruit and fragrant with thyme and sage and marjoram and where the black-bird bold marauder that they be pipe gloriously all day long in the midst of this orchard they stop and small porge rest one hand against the rugged bole of a great old apple tree this say he be my very own tree because he be so very big a ' so very very old -- adam say he be the oldest tree in the orchard i call he ` king arthur ' 'cause he be so big a ' strong -- just like a king should be you know -- a ' all the other tree be he knight of the round table but bellew be not look at king arthur just then he eye be turn to where one come towards they through the green -- one surely as tall and gracious as proud and beautiful as enid or guinevere or any of those lovely lady for all she simple gown of blue and the sunbonnet that shaded the beauty of she face yes as he gaze bellew be sure and certain that she who all unconscious of they presence come slowly towards they with the red glow of the sunset about she be handsomer lovelier statelier and altogether more desirable than all the beautiful lady of king arthur 's court -- or any other court so-ever but now small porge find he so silent and see where he look must need behold she too and give a sudden glad cry and run out from behind the great bulk of king arthur and she hear he voice turn and run to meet he and sink upon she knee before he and clasp he against she heart and rejoice and weep and scold he all in a breath wherefore bellew unobserved as yet in king arthur 's shadow watch the proud head with its wayward curl -lrb- for the sunbonnet have be toss back upon she shoulder -rrb- watch the quick passionate caress of those slender brown hand and listen to the thrilling tenderness of that low soft voice feel all at once strangely lonely and friendless and out of place very rough and awkward and very much aware of he dusty person -- feel indeed as any other ordinary human might who have tumble unexpectedly into arcadium therefore he turn think to steal quietly away you see auntie i go out to try a ' find a fortune for you small porge be explain a ' i look a ' look but i do not find a bit -- my dear dear brave georgy say anthea and would have kiss he again but he put she off : wait a minute please auntie he say excitedly 'cause i do find -- something -- just as i be grow very tire a ' disappointed i find uncle porge -- under a hedge you know uncle porge say anthea start oh that must be the man mr cassili mention -- so i bring he with I pursue small porge a ' there he be and he point triumphantly towards king arthur glance thither anthea behold a tall dusty figure move off among the tree oh -- wait please she call rise to she foot and with small porge ' hand in hers approach bellew who have stop with he dusty back to they i -- i want to thank you for -- take care of my nephew if you will come up to the house cook shall give you a good meal and if you be in need of work i -- i -- she voice falter uncertainly and she stop thank you say bellew turn and lift he hat oh -- i beg you pardon say anthea now as they eye meet it seem to bellew as though he have live all he life in expectation of this moment and he know that all he life he should never forget this moment but now even while he look at she he see she cheek flush painfully and she dark eye grow troubled i beg you pardon say she again i -- i think -- mr cassilis give I to understand that you be -- a very dusty hungry-looking fellow perhaps smile bellew and he be quite right you know the dust you can see for yourself but the hunger you must take my word for as for the work i assure you exercise be precisely what i be look for but -- say anthea and stop and tap the grass nervously with she foot and twist one of she bonnet-string and meeting bellew 's steady gaze flush again but you -- you be -- my uncle porge she nephew chime in a ' i bring he home with I 'cause he be go to help I to find a fortune a ' he have not get any place to go to 'cause he home 's far far beyond the ` bound billow ' -- so you will let he stay will not you auntie anthea why -- georgy -- she begin but see she distressed look bellew come to she rescue pray do miss anthea say he in he quiet easy manner my name be bellew he go on to explain i be a american without family or friend here there or anywhere and with nothing in the world to do but follow the path of the wind indeed i be rather a solitary fellow at least -- i be until i meet my nephew porge here since then i have be wonder if there would be -- er -- room for such as i at dapplemere oh there would be plenty of room say anthea hesitate and wrinkle she white brow for a lodger be something entirely new in she experience as to my character pursue bellew though something of a vagabond i be not a rogue -- at least i hope not and i could pay -- er -- four or five pound a week -- oh exclaim anthea with a little gasp if that would be sufficient -- it be -- a great deal too much say anthea who would have scarcely dare to ask three pardon I -- but i think not say bellew shake he head you see i be -- er -- rather extravagant in my eating -- egg you know lot of 'em and ham and beef and -- er -- -lrb- a duck quack loudly from the vicinity of a neighbouring pond -rrb- -- certainly -- a occasional duck indeed five pound a week would scarcely -- three would be ample say anthea with a little nod of finality very well say bellew we 'll make it four and have do with it anthea devine be absolute mistress of dapplemere be in the habit of exert she authority and have she own way in most thing therefore she glance up in some surprise at this tall dusty rather lazy look personage and she notice even as have small porge that he be indeed very big and wide she notice also that despite the easy courtesy of he manner and the quizzical light of he gray eye he chin be very square and that despite he gentle voice he have the air of one who mean exactly what he say nevertheless she be much inclined to take issue with he upon the matter plainly observe which bellew smile and shake he head pray be reasonable he say in he gentle voice if you send I away to some horrible inn or other it will cost I -- be a american -- more than that every week in tip and thing -- so let 's shake hand on it and call it settle and he hold out he hand to she four pound a week it would be a veritable god-send just at present while she be so hard put to it to make both end meet four pound a week so anthea stand lose in frown think until meet he frank smile she laugh you be dreadfully persistent she say and i know it be too much -- but -- we 'll try to make you as comfortable as we can and she lay she hand in he and thus it be that george bellew come to dapplemere in the glory of the after-glow of a August afternoon breathe the magic air of arcadium which be and always have be of that rare quality warrant to go to the head sooner or later and thus it be that small porge with he bundle on he shoulder view this tall dusty uncle with the eye of possession which be oft-time a eye of rapture and anthea she be busy calculate to a scrupulous nicety the very vexed question as to exactly how far four pound per week might be make to go to the best possible advantage of all concerned chapter vi _ of the sad condition of the haunting spectre of the might have be _ dapplemere farm house or the manor as it be still call by many have be build when henry the eighth be king as the carve inscription above the door testify the house of dapplemere be a place of many gable and latticed window and with tall slender chimney shape and work into thing of beauty and delight it possess a great old hall there be spacious chamber and broad stairway there be panelled corridor sudden flight of step that lead up or down again for no apparent reason there be broad and generous hearth and deep window-seat and everywhere within and without there lurk a indefinable old-world charm that be the heritage of year storm have buffet and tempest have beat upon it but all in vain for save that the brick glow a deeper red where they peep out beneath the clinging ivy the old house stand as it have upon that far day when it be fashion -- in the year of we lord one thousand five hundred and twenty-four in england many such house be yet to be find monument of the bad old time -- memorial of the dark age -- when lath and stucco exist not and the jerry-builder have no be but where among they all might be find such another parlor as this at dapplemere with its low raftered ceiling its great carve mantel its panelled wall whence old portrait look down at one like dream face from dim and nebulous background and where might be find two such bright-eyed rosy-cheeked quick-footed deft-handed phyllise as the two buxom maid who flit here and there obedient to they mistress 's word or gesture and lastly where in all this wide world could there ever be find just such another hostess as miss anthea herself something of all this be in bellew 's mind as he sit with small porge beside he watch miss anthea dispense tea -- brew as it should be in a earthen tea-pot milk and sugar mr bellew thank you this be blackberry a ' this be raspberry a ' red currant -- but the blackberry jam 's the best uncle porge thank you nephew now be not you awful ' glad i find you -- under that hedge uncle porge nephew -- i be nephew repeat anthea glance at he with raise brow oh yes nod bellew we adopt each other -- at about four o'clock this afternoon under a hedge you know add small porge be not it a very sudden and altogether -- unheard of proceed anthea enquire well it might have be if it have happen anywhere but in arcadium what do you mean by arcadium uncle porge a place i have be look for -- nearly all my life nephew i 'll trouble you for the blackberry jam my porge yes try the blackberry -- aunt priscillum make it she very own self you know it be perfectly -- ridiculous say anthea frowning and laugh both at the same time what be miss anthea why that you should be sit here call georgy you nephew and that i should be pour out tea for you quite as a matter of course it seem to I the most delightfully natural thing in the world say bellew in he slow grave manner but -- i have only know you -- half a hour -- but then friendship ripen quickly -- in arcadium i wonder what aunt priscillum will have to say about it aunt priscillum she be we housekeeper -- the dearest busiest gentlest little housekeeper in all the world but with -- very sharp eye mr bellew she will either like you very much -- or -- not at all there be no half measure about aunt priscillum now i wonder which it will be say bellew help himself to more jam oh she 'll like you a course nod small porge i know she 'll like you 'cause you be so different to mr cassili -- he be get black hair a ' a mestache you know a ' you hair 's gold like mine -- a ' you mestache -- be not there be it a ' i know she do not like mr cassilis a ' i do not either 'cause -- she will be back to-morrow say anthea silencing small porge with a gentle touch of she hand and we shall be glad sha 'n' t we georgy the house be not the same place without she you see i be off in the field all day as a rule a farm -- even such a small one as dapplemere be a great responsibility and take up all one 's time -- if it be to be make to pay -- a ' sometimes it do not pay at all you know add small porge a ' then auntie anthea worry a ' i worry too farm be not what it be in adam 's young day -- so that 's why i must find a fortune -- early tomorrow morning you know -- so my auntie will not have to worry any more -- now when he have get thus far anthea lean over and take he by surprise kiss small porge suddenly it be very good and brave of you dear say she in she soft thrilling voice to go out all alone into this big world to try and find a fortune for I and here she would have kiss he again but that he remind she that they be not alone but georgy dear -- fortune be very hard to find -- especially round dapplemere i be afraid say she with a rueful little laugh yes that be why i be go to africa you know africa she repeat africa oh yes nod bellew when i meet he he be on he way there to bring back gold for you -- in a sack only uncle porge say it be a goodish way off you know so i ` cide to stay a ' find the fortune nearer home and thus they talk unaffectedly together until tea be over anthea volunteer to show bellew over she small domain and they go out all three into a evening that breathe of rose and honeysuckle and as they go slow-foot through the deepen twilight small porge direct bellew 's attention to certain nook and corner that might be well calculate to conceal the fortune they be to find while anthea point out to he the beauty of shady wood of roll meadow and wind stream but there be other beauty that neither of they think to call to he attention but which bellew note with observe eye none the less : -- such for instance as the way anthea have of droop she shadowy lash at sudden and unexpected moment the wistful droop of she warm red lip and the sweet round column of she throat these and much beside bellew notice for himself as they walk on together through this midsummer evening and so betime bellew get he to bed and though the hour be ridiculously early yet he fall into a profound slumber and dream of -- nothing at all but far away upon the road forget and out of mind -- with futile writhe and grimace the haunting shadow of the might have be jibber in the shadow chapter vii _ which concern itself among other matter with the old adam _ bellew awaken early next morning which be a unusual thing for bellew to do under ordinary circumstance since he be one who hold with that poet who have write somewhere or other something to the following effect : god bless the man who first discover sleep but damn the man with curse loud and deep who first invent -- early rising nevertheless bellew -lrb- as have be say -rrb- awake early next morning to find the sun pour in at he window and make a glory all about he but it be not this that have rouse he he think as he lay blinking drowsily -- nor the black-bird piping so wonderfully in the apple-tree outside -- a very inquisitive apple-tree that have writhe and contorted itself most un-naturally in its effort to peep in at the window -- therefore bellew fall to wonder sleepily enough what it could have be presently it come again the sound -- a very peculiar sound the like of which bellew have never hear before which as he listen gradually evolve itself into a kind of monotonous chant intone by a voice deep and harsh yet withal not unmusical now the word of the chant be these : when i be dead diddle diddle as well may hap bury I deep diddle diddle under the tap under the tap diddle diddle i 'll tell you why that i may drink diddle diddle when i be dry hereupon bellew rise and cross to the open casement lean out into the golden freshness of the morning look about he presently espy the singer -- one who carry two pail suspend from a yoke upon he shoulder -- a very square man that be to say square of shoulder square of head and square of jaw be in fact none other than the waggoner with whom he have fight and ride on the previous afternoon see which bellew hail he in cheery greet the man glance up and break off he song in the middle of a note stand gaze at bellew open-mouthed what -- be that you sir he enquire at last and then -- lord a ' what be you a do of up theer why sleep of course answer bellew w ` ot -- again exclaim the waggoner with a grin you do be for ever a-sleepin ' i do believe not when you be anywhere about laugh bellew be it I as wake ye

this be a ' wus ' the black-bird a-piping away in the tree here oh i be singin ' i do not go for to deny it but it be sore ` earted i be a ' fill wus ' gloom sir notwithstanding you mean say bellew become suddenly thoughtful that you be haunt by the carking spectre of the -- er might have be lord bless you no sir this be not no spectre nor yet no skellington -- which arter all be only old bone a ' such -- no this be not nothin ' of that sort a ' no more it be not a thing as i can stand ` ere a maggin ' about wus ' a long day 's work afore I ax you pardon sir say which the waggoner nod suddenly and stride off with he pail clank cheerily very soon bellew be shave and dress and go down stair he let himself out into the early sunshine and stroll away towards the farm-yard where cock crew cow low duck quack turkey and goose gobble and hiss and where the waggoner move to and fro among they all like a preside genius i think say bellew as he come up i think you must be the adam i have hear of that be my name sir then adam fill you pipe and bellew extend he pouch whereupon adam thank he and fishing a small short black clay from he pocket proceed to fill and light it yes sir he

as it be a mercy i do not have no pitchfork ` andy bellew sit on the shaft of a cart with he back against a rick listen to this narration with a air of dreamy abstraction but adam 's quick eye notice that despite the unruffled serenity of he brow he chin seem rather more prominent than usual so that be why you be feel gloomy be it adam ah a ' enough to make any man feel gloomy i should think miss anthea 's brave enough but i reckon ` twill come nigh breakin ' ` er ` eart to see the old stuff sell the furnitur ' a ' that -- so she be goin ' to drive over to cranbrook to be out o ' the way while it be a-doin ' and when do the sale take place the Saturday arter next sir as ever be adam answer but -- hush -- mum 's the word sir he break off and wink violently with a side-ways motion of the head he take up he pitch-fork wherefore glance round bellew see anthea come towards they fresh and sweet as the morning she hand be full of flower and she carry she sun-bonnet upon she arm here and there a rebellious curl have escape from its fastening as though desirous -lrb- and very naturally -rrb- of kiss the soft oval of she cheek or the white curve of she neck and among they bellew notice one in particular -- a roguish curl that glow in the sun with a coppery light and peep at he wantonly above she ear good morning say he rise and to all appearance address the curl in question you be early abroad this morning early mr bellew -- why i have be up hour i be generally out at four o'clock on market day we work hard and long at dapplemere she answer give he she hand with she grave sweet smile aye for sure nodded adam but farmin ' be not what it be in my young day but i think we shall do well with the hop adam ` op miss anthea -- lord love you -- there be not no ` op nowhere so good as ourn

at it right arter breakfast -- i 'll ` ave it do trust I miss anthea i do adam -- you know that and with a smile nod she turn away now as bellew walk on beside she he feel a strange constraint upon he such as he have never experienced towards any woman before and the which he be at great pain with himself to account for indeed so rapt be he that he start suddenly to find that she be ask he a question : do you -- like dapplemere mr bellew like it he repeat like it yes indeed i be so glad she answer she eye glowing with pleasure it be a much larger property once -- look and she point away across corn-field and roll meadow to the distant wood in my grandfather 's time it be all he -- as far as you can see and farther but it have dwindle since then and to-day my dapplemere be very small indeed you must be very fond of such a beautiful place oh i love it she cry passionately if ever i have to -- give it up -- i think i should -- die she stop suddenly and as though somewhat abashed by this sudden outburst add in a lighter tone : if i seem rather tragic it be because this be the only home i have ever know well say bellew appear rather more dreamy than usual just then i have journey here and there in this world of ours i have wander up and down and to and fro in it -- like a certain celebrated personage who shall be nameless -- yet i never see or dream of any such place as this dapplemere of yours it be like arcadium itself and only i be out of place i seem somehow to be too common-place and altogether matter-of-fact i be sure i be matter-of-fact enough she say with she low sweet laugh that bellew thought be all too rare you say he and shake he head well she enquire glance at he through she wind-tossed curl you be like some fair and stately lady out of the old romance he say gravely in a print gown and with a sun-bonnet even so he nod here for no apparent reason happen to meet he glance the color deepen in she cheek and she be silent wherefore bellew go on in he slow placid tone you surely be the princess ruling this fair land of arcadium and i be the stranger within you gate it behove you therefore to be merciful to this stranger if only for the sake of -- er -- we mutual nephew whatever anthea might have say in answer be cut short by small porge himself who come gallop towards they with the sun bright in he curl oh uncle porge he pant as he come up i be ` fraid you would go away a ' leave I -- i have be hunting a ' hunting for you ever since i get up no i have not go away yet my porge you see a ' you will not go -- ever or ever will you that say bellew take the small hand in he that be a question that we have better leave to the -- er -- future nephew but -- why well you see it do not rest with I -- altogether my porge then who -- he be begin but anthea 's soft voice interrupt he georgy dear do not prudence send you to tell we that breakfast be ready oh yes i be forget -- awfull ' silly of I be not it but you be go to stay -- oh a long long time be not you uncle porge i sincerely hope so answer bellew now as he speak he eye -- by the merest chance in the world of course -- happen to meet anthea 's whereupon she turn and slip on she sunbonnet which be very natural for the sun be grow hot already i be awful ' glad sigh small porge a ' auntie 's glad too -- be not you auntie why -- of course from the depths of the sunbonnet 'cause now you see there 'll be two of we to take care of you uncle porge be so nice a ' big and -- wide be not he auntie y-e-s -- oh georgy -- what be you talk about why i mean i be rather small to take care of you all by myself alone auntie though i do my best of course but now that i have find myself a big tall uncle porge -- under the hedge you know -- we can take care of you together can not we auntie anthea but anthea only hurry on without speak whereupon small porge continue all unheed : you ` member the other night auntie when you be cry you say you wish you have some one very big and strong to take care of you -- oh -- georgy bellew heartily wish that sunbonnet have never be think of but you do you know auntie a ' so that be why i go out a ' find my uncle porge for you -- so that he -- but here mistress anthea for all she pride and stateliness catch she gown about she fairly run on down the path and never pause until she have reach the cool dim parlor be there she toss aside she sunbonnet and look at herself in the long old mirror and -- though surely no mirror make by man ever reflect a fairer vision of dark-eyed witchery and loveliness nevertheless anthea stamp she foot and frown at it oh she exclaim and then again oh georgy and cover she burning cheek meanwhile big porge and small porge walk along hand in hand shake they head solemnly wonder much upon the capriciousness of aunt and the waywardness thereof i wonder why she run away uncle porge ah i wonder ` speck she be a bit angry with I you know 'cause i tell you she be cry hum say bellew a auntie take a awful lot of look after sigh small porge yes nod bellew i suppose so -- especially if she happen to be young and -- er -- a ' what uncle porge beautiful nephew oh do you think she be -- really beautiful demand small porge i be afraid i do bellew confess so do mr cassili -- i hear he tell she so once -- in the orchard hum say bellew ah but you ought to see she when she come to tuck I up at night with she hair all down a ' hang all about she -- like a shiny cloak you know hum say bellew please uncle porge say georgy turn to look up at he what make you hum so much this morning i be think my porge ` bout my auntie anthea i do admit the soft impeachment sir well i be think too what be it old chap i be think we ought to begin to find that fortune for she after breakfast why it be not quite the right season for fortune hunting yet -- at least not in arcadium answer bellew shake he head oh -- but why not well the moon be not right for one thing the moon echo small porge oh yes -- we must wait for a -- er -- a money moon you know -- surely you have hear of a money moon ` fraid not sigh small porge regretfully but -- i have hear of a honey-moon -- they be often much the same nod bellew but when will the money moon come a ' -- how i can not exactly say my porge but come it will one of these fine night and when it do we shall know that the fortune be close by and wait to be find so do not worry you small head about it -- just keep you eye on you uncle betime they come in to breakfast where anthea await they at the head of the table then who so demure so gracious and self-possessed so sweetly sedate as she but the cavalier in the picture above the carve mantel verse in the way of the world and the pretty trick and wiles of the beau sex feminine smile down at bellew with a expression of such roguish waggery as say plain as word : we know and bellew remember a certain pair of slender ankle that have reveal themselves in they hurry flight smile back at the cavalier and it be all he could do to refrain from wink outright chapter viii _ which tell of miss priscillum of peach and of sergeant appleby late of the 19th hussar _ small porge be at he lesson he

basket so you see -- he -- have lose a arm -- he right one and i -- be lame in my foot perhaps that be why -- heigho how beautifully the black bird be sing this morning to be sure chapter ix _ in which may be find some description of arcadium and gooseberry _ anthea lean on she rake in a shady corner of the five-acre field turn to watch bellew who strip to he shirt-sleeve bare of neck and arm and pitch-fork in hand be busy toss up great mound of sweet-smelling hay to adam who stand upon a waggon to receive it with small porge perch up beside he a week have elapse since bellew have find he way to dapplemere a week which have only serve to strengthen the bond of affection between he and he nephew and to win over sharp-eyed shrewd little miss priscillum to the extent of declare he to be : first a gentleman anthea my dear and secondly -- what be much rarer now-a-day -- a true man a week and already he be hail-fellow-well-met with everyone about the place for who be proof against he unaffected gaiety he simple easy good-fellowship so he laugh and joke as he swing he pitch-fork -lrb- awkwardly enough to be sure -rrb- and receive all hint and direction as to its use in the kindly spirit they be tender and anthea watch he from she shady corner sigh once or twice and catch herself so do stamped she foot at herself and pull she sunbonnet closer about she face no adam he be say depend upon it there be nothing like exercise and of all exercise -- give I a pitch-fork why as to that mr belloo sir adam retort i say -- so be it so long as i be not near the wrong end of it for the way you do ` ave of flourishin ' a ' a whirlin ' that theer fork be fair as-tonishin ' i do declare it be why you see adam there be some bear with a lean towards pitch-fork as there be other bear to the pen and the -- er -- palette and thing but for I adam the pitch-fork every time say bellew mop he brow if you be to try a ' ` andle it more as if it _ be _ a pitchfork now mr belloo sir -- suggest adam and not wait for bellew 's laughing rejoinder he chirrup to the horse and the great waggon creak away with its mountainous load surmount by adam 's grin visage and small porge ' golden curl and follow by the rest of the merry-voiced hay-maker now it be that turn he head bellew espy anthea watch he whereupon he shoulder he fork and come to where she sit upon a throne of hay he sink down at she foot with a luxurious sigh she have never see he without a collar before and now she could not but notice how round and white and powerful he neck be and how the muscle bulge upon arm and shoulder and how he hair curl in small damp ring upon he brow it be good say he look up into the witching face above he yes it be very good to see you idle -- just for once and i be think it be good to see you work -- just for once work he exclaim my dear miss anthea i assure you i have become a positive glutton for work it have become my earnest desire to plant thing and grow thing and chop thing with axis to mow thing with scythe i dream of pasture and plough of pail and pitchfork by night and by day reaping-hook hoe and rake be in my thought continually -- which all go to show the effect of this wonderful air of arcadium indeed i be as full of suppress energy these day as adam be of the ` old adam ' and talk of adam remind I that he have solemnly pledge himself to initiate I into the mystery of swing a scythe to-morrow morning at -- five o'clock yes indeed my heart bound responsive to the swish of a scythe in thick grass and my soul sit enrapture upon a pitch-fork how ridiculous you be she laugh and how perfectly content he add be anyone ever quite content she sigh glance down at he wistful-eyed not unless they have find arcadium he answer have you then yes he nod complacently oh yes i have find it be you -- sure quite sure arcadium she repeat wrinkle she brow what be arcadium and -- where arcadium answer bellew watch the smoke rise up from he pipe with a dreamy eye arcadium be the -- promised land -- the land that everyone try to find sometime or other and may be -- anywhere and how come you to -- find it by the most fortunate chance in the world tell I say anthea take a wisp of hay and begin to plait it in dexterous brown finger tell I how you find it why then you must know in the first place he begin in he slow even voice that it be a place i have seek for in all my wanderings and i have be pretty far afield -- but i seek it so long and so vainly that i begin to think it be like the el dorado of the old adventurer and have never exist at all yes say anthea busy with she plaiting but one day -- fate or chance or destiny -- or they benevolent spirit send a certain square-shouldered waggoner to show I the way and after he a very small porge -- bless he -- to lead I into this wonderful arcadium oh i see nodded anthea very intent upon she plaiting but there be something more say bellew oh say anthea shall i tell you if -- it be -- very interesting well then in this delightful land there be a castle grim embattled and very strong a castle say anthea glance up suddenly the castle of heart 's desire oh say she and give all she attention to she plaiting again and so continued bellew i be wait very patiently until in she own good time she who rule within shall open the gate to I or -- bid I go away into bellew 's voice have creep a thrill no one have ever hear there before he lean nearer to she and he dreamy eye be keen now and eager and she though she see nothing of all this yet be a woman know it be there of course and for that very reason look resolutely away wherefore once again bellew heartily wish that sunbonnet have never be invent so there be silence while anthea stare away across the golden corn-field yet see nothing of they and bellew look upon those slender capable finger that have falter in they plaiting and stop and thus upon the silence there break a sudden voice shrill with interest : go on uncle porge -- what about the dragon oh please go on -- there be always dragon in ` chant castle you know to guard the lovely princess -- be not you go to have any dragon that hiss you know a ' spit out smoke a ' flame oh -- do please have a dragon and small porge appear from the other side of the hay-mow flush and eager certainly my porge nod bellew draw the small figure down beside he i be forget the dragon but there they be with scaly back and iron claw spit out spark and flame just as self-respecting dragon should and roar away like thunder ah exclaim small porge nestle closer to bellew and reach out a hand to auntie anthea that be fine let 's have plenty of dragon do you think a -- er -- dozen would be enough my porge oh yes but s ` pose the beautiful princess do not open the door -- what would you do if you be really a wander knight who be wait patiently for it to open -- what would you do then shin up a tree my porge oh but that would not be a bit right -- would it auntie of course not laugh anthea it would be most un-knight-like and very undignified ` side add small porge you could not climb up a tree in you armor you know then i would make a awful ' good try at it nod bellew no say small porge shake he head shall i tell you what you ought to do well then you would draw you two-edged sword a ' dress you shield -- like gareth the kitchen knave do -- he be always dress he shield a ' so be lancelot -- a ' you would fight all those dragon a ' kill they a ' cut they head off and then what would happen enquire bellew why then the lovely princess would open the gate a ' marry you of course a ' live happy ever after a ' all would be revelry a ' joy ah sigh bellew if she would do that i think i would fight all the dragon that ever roar -- and kill they too but suppose she -- er -- would not open the gate why then say small porge wrinkle he brow why then -- you would have to storm the castle of course a ' break open the gate a ' run off with the princess on you charger -- if she be very beautiful you know a most excellent idea my porge if i should happen to find myself in like circumstance i 'll surely take you advice now as he speak bellew glance at anthea and she at he and straightway she blush and then she laugh and then she blush again and still blush rise to she foot and turn to find mr cassili within a yard of they ah miss anthea say he lift he hat i send georgy to find you but it seem he forget to mention that i be wait i be awful ' sorry mr cassili -- but uncle porge be tell we ` bout dragon you know small porge hasten to explain dragon repeat mr cassili with he supercilious smile ah indeed dragon should be interesting especially in such a very quiet shady nook as this -- quite a idyllic place for story-telling it be a positive shame to disturb you and he sharp white tooth gleam beneath he moustache as he speak and he tap he riding-boot lightly with he hunting-crop as he front bellew who have rise and stand bare-armed lean upon he pitch-fork and as in they first meeting there be a mute antagonism in they look let I introduce you to each other say anthea conscious of this attitude -- mr cassili of brampton court -- mr bellew of nowhere in particular sir add bellew and pray say mr cassili perfunctorily as they stroll on across the meadow how do you like dapplemere mr bellew immensely sir -- beyond all expression yes it be consider rather pretty i believe lovely sir nod bellew though it be not so much the beauty of the place itself that appeal to I so much as what it -- contain oh indeed say mr cassili with a sudden sharp glance to what do you refer goose-berry sir i -- ah -- beg you pardon sir say bellew gravely all my life i have foster a secret passion for goose-berry -- raw or cook -- in pie pudding or jam they be equally alluring unhappily the american goose-berry be but a hollow mockery at best -- ha say mr cassili dubiously now in goose-berry as in everything else sir there be to be find the superlative the quintessence -- the ideal consequently i have roam east and west and north and south in quest of it really say mr cassili stifle a yawn and turn towards miss anthea with the very slightest shrug of he shoulder and in dapplemere conclude bellew solemnly i have at last find my ideal -- goose-berry add anthea with a laugh in she eye arcadia be a land of ideal nod bellew ideal say mr cassili caress he moustache ideal and -- ah -- goose-berry -- though probably excellent thing in themselves be apt to pall upon one in time personally i find they equally insipid -- of course it be all a matter of taste sigh bellew but mr cassili go on fairly turn he back upon he the subject i wish to discuss with you miss anthea be the -- er -- approach sale the sale she repeat all the brightness die out of she face i wish say cassili lean nearer to she and lower he voice confidentially to try to convince you how -- unnecessary it would be -- if -- and he pause significantly anthea turn quickly aside as though to hide she mortification from bellew 's keen eye whereupon he see it all become straightway more dreamy than ever and lay a hand upon small porge ' shoulder point with he pitch-fork to where at the other end of the five-acre the hay-maker work away as merrily as ever : come my porge say he let we away and join yon happy throng and -- er -- ` with daphni and clo and blowsabel we 'll list to the -- er -- cuckoo in the dell ' so hand in hand the two porge set off together but when they have go some distance bellew look back and then he see that anthea walk with she head avert yet cassilis walk close beside she and stoop now and then until the black moustache come very near the curl -- that curl of wanton witchery that peep above she ear uncle porge -- why do you frown so frown my porge -- do i well i be think well i be think too only i do not frown you know but i be think just the same and what might you be think nephew why i be think that although you be so awful fond of goose-berry a ' though there be lot of ripe one on the bush i have never see you eat a single one chapter x _ how bellew and adam enter into a solemn league and covenant _ look at the moon to-night uncle porge i see it it be awfull ' big a ' round be not it yes it be very big and very round a ' -- rather -- yellow be not it very yellow just like a great big golden sovereign be not it very much like a sovereign my porge well do you know i be wonder -- if there be any chance that it be a -- money moon they be lean out at the lattice small porge and big porge anthea and miss priscillum be busy upon household matter wholly feminine wherefore small porge have draw bellew to the window and there they lean the small body enfold by bellew 's long arm and the two face turn up to the silvery splendor of the moon but now anthea come up behind they and not notice the position of bellew 's arm as she lean on the other side of small porge it befall that she hand touch and for a moment rest upon bellew 's hand hide as it be in the shadow and this probably begin it the air of arcadium as have be say before be a intoxicating air but it be more it be a air charge with a subtle magic whereby the commonest object lose they prosaic matter-of-fact shape become transfigure into thing of wonder and delight little thing that pass as mere ordinary common-place -- thing insignificant and wholly beneath notice in the every day world become fraught with such infinite meaning and may hold such sublime such undreamed of possibility -- here in arcadium thus when it be record that anthea 's hand accidentally touch and rest upon bellew 's -- the significance of it will become at once apparent and pray say anthea lay that same hand in the most natural manner in the world upon the small porge ' curl pray what might you two be discuss so very solemnly the moon answer small porge i be wonder if it be a money moon a ' uncle porge have not say if it be yet why no old chap answer bellew i be afraid not and pray say anthea again what might a money moon be well explain small porge when the moon 's just -- just so then you go out a ' -- a ' find a fortune you know but the moon 's get to be a money moon and you have get to know you know else you 'll find nothing of course ah georgy dear sigh anthea stoop she dark head down to he golden curl do not you know that fortune be very hard to get and that they have to be work for and that no one ever find one without a great deal of labor and sorrow ` course -- everyone can not find fortune auntie anthea i know that but we shall -- my uncle porge know all about it you see a ' i know that we shall i be sure as sure we shall find one some day 'cause you see i put it in my prayer now -- at the end you know i say : ` a ' please help I a ' my uncle porge to find a fortune when the money moon come -- a big one world without end -- aman ' so you see it be all right a ' we be just wait till the money moon come be not we uncle porge yes old chap yes nod bellew until the money moon come and so there fall a silence between they yet a silence that hold a wondrous charm of its own a silence that last so long that the coppery curl droop lower and lower upon bellew 's arm until anthea sighing rise and in a very tender voice bid small porge say ` goodnight ' the which he do forthwith slumberous of voice and sleepy eyed and so with he hand in anthea 's go drowsily up to bed wherefore see that miss priscillum have bustle away into the kitchen bellew saunter out into the rose-garden to look upon the beauty of the night the warm air be fragrant with dewy scent and the moon already high above the tree-top pour down she gentle radiance upon the quaint old garden with its wind walk and clip yew hedge while upon the quiet from the dim shadow of the distant wood steal the soft sweet song of a nightingale bellew walk a path border with flower and checker with silver patch of moon-light drinking in the thousand beauty about he stare up at the glory of the moon the indigo of the sky and listen to the voice of the lonely singer in the wood and yet it be of none of these he be think as he pause under the shadow of king arthur -- nor of small porge nor of any one or anything in this world but only of the sudden light touch of a warm soft hand upon he be that you sir bellew start and now he find that he have be sit all this while with a empty pipe between he tooth yet content therewith wherefore he shake he head and wonder be that you mr beloo sir yes adam it be i ah a ' how might you be feelin ' now -- arter you exercise wus ' the pitch-fork sir very fit i thank you adam sit down and smoke and let we converse together why thankee sir answer adam produce the small black clay pipe from he waistcoat pocket and accept bellew 's proffer pouch i have be up to the ` ouse a visitin ' prudence the cook -- a ' a rare cook she be too mr beloo sir and a rare buxom girl into the bargain adam oh ah -- she be well enough sir i will not

gift for yorkshire puddin ' likewise jam-roller and seed-cake -- -lrb- which though mention last be not by no manner o ' mean least -rrb- -- when you come to think of she brew o ' ale a ' cider a ' ginger wine -- why then -- i be take sir i be take altogether a ' the ` old adam ' inside o ' I work hisself into such a state that if another chap -- ` specially that there job jagway get lookin '

b-l-i-t-e-d -- blighted mr belloo sir which say adam laugh once nod he head several time and relapse into puff silence mr cassili be over to-day adam say bellew after a while pursue a train of think ah sir -- i see he -- ' e also see I ' e tell I as job jagway be up and about again -- likewise job jagway will be over ` ere to-morrow along wus ' the rest of 'em for the sale sir ah yes -- the sale

mr belloo sir if that there job cross my path to-morrer -- well -- let ` im -- look out that be all say which adam double up a huge knotted fist and shake it at a imaginary job adam say bellew in the same thoughtful tone i wonder if you would do something for I anything you ax I sir so long as you do not want I to -- i want you to buy some of that furniture for I what exclaim adam and vent he great laugh again well if that be not a good ` un sir why that be just w ` ot i be a go to do ye see i be not w ` ot you might call a rich cove nor yet a millionaire but i have get a bit put by a ' i

while i have get a pound or two ' i sez to myself adam say bellew turn suddenly that sentiment do you credit that sentiment make I proud to have knock you into a ditch -- shake hand adam and there beneath the great apple tree while the moon look on they very solemnly shake hand and now adam pursued bellew i want you to put back you ten pound keep it for prudence -- because i happen to have rather more than we shall want -- see here and with the word bellew take out a leathern wallet and from this wallet money and bank-note -- more money and more bank-note than adam have ever behold in all he thirty odd year at sight of which he eye open and he square jaw relax to the imminent danger of he cherish clay pipe i want you to take this bellew go on count a sum into adam 's nerveless hand and to-morrow when the sale begin if any one make a bid for anything i want you to bid higher and no matter what you must always buy -- always you understand but sir -- that there old drorin ' - room

say nothing -- but to think of old adam wus ' a hundred pound in he pocket e ` cod it do seem that comical say which adam button the money into a capacious pocket slap it nod and rise well sir i 'll be go -- there be miss anthea in the garden yonder and if she be to see I now there be no sayin ' but i should be take a laughin ' to think o ' this ` ere hundred pound miss anthea -- where comin ' through the rose-gardin she be off to see old mother dibbin they call mother dibbin a witch a ' now as she be down wus ' the rheumatic there be not nobody to look arter ` er -- ` cept miss anthea -- she would ha ' starve afore now if it ` ad not be for miss anthea but lord love you eye a ' limb mr belloo sir miss anthea do not care if she be a witch or fifty witch not she so good-night mr belloo sir a ' mum 's the word say which adam slap he pocket again nod wink and go upon he way chapter xi _ of the man with the tiger mark _ it be a moot question as to whether a curl can be more alluring when it glow beneath the fiery kiss of the sun or shine demurely in the tender radiance of the moon as bellew look at it now -- that same small curl that nod and beckon to he above anthea 's left ear -- he strongly incline to the latter opinion adam tell I that you be go out miss anthea only as far as mr dibbin 's cottage -- just across the meadow adam also inform I that mr dibbin be a witch people call she so never in all my day have i see a genuine old witch -- so i 'll come with you if i may oh this be a very gentle old witch and she be neither humpbacked nor do she ride a broom-stick -- so i be afraid you 'll be disappointed mr bellew then at least i can carry you basket -- allow I and so in he quiet masterful fashion he take the basket from she arm and walk on beside she through the orchard what a glorious night it be exclaim anthea suddenly draw a deep breath of the fragrant air -- oh it be good to be alive in spite of all the care and worry life be very sweet after this they walk on some distance in silence she gaze wistfully upon the beauty of the familiar world about she while he watch the curl above she ear until she become aware of it all at once promptly send it back into retirement with a quick deft little pat of she finger i hope say bellew at last i do sincerely hope that you ` tuck up ' my nephew safe in bed -- you see -- you nephew indeed we nephew then i ask because he tell I that he can not possibly sleep unless you go to ` tuck he up ' -- and i can quite believe it do you know mr bellew i be grow quite jealous of you he can not move a step without you and he be for ever talk and laud you numberless virtue but then -- i be only a uncle after all and if he talk of I to you he talk of you to I all day long oh do he and among other thing he tell I that i ought to see you when you hair be down and all about you oh exclaim anthea indeed we nephew be much luckier than i because i never have a aunt of my own to come and ` tuck I up ' at night with she hair hang all about she -- like a beautiful cloak so you see i have no boyish recollection to go upon but i think i can imagine -- and what do you think of the sergeant anthea enquire change the subject abruptly i like he so much that i be go to take he at he word and call upon he at the first opportunity do aunt priscillum tell you that he come march along regularly every day at exactly the same hour yes -- to see how the peach be get on nodded bellew for such a very brave soldier he be a dreadful coward say anthea smile it have take he five year to screw up courage enough to tell she that she be uncommonly young for she age and yet i think it be just that diffidence that make he so lovable and he be so simple and so gentle -- in spite of all he war medal when i be moody and cross the very sight of he be enough to put I in humor again have he never -- speak to miss priscillum -- never -- though of course she know and have do from the very first i ask he once why he have never tell she what it be bring he so regularly -- to look at the peach -- and he say in he quick sharp way : ` miss anthea -- can not be do mam -- a poor battered old soldier -- only one arm -- no mam ' i wonder if one could find just such another sergeant outside arcadium say bellew i wonder now they be approach a stile towards which bellew have direct he eye from time to time as for that matter curiously enough have anthea but to he it seem that it never would be reach while to she it seem that it would be reach much too soon therefore she begin to rack she mind try to remember some gate or any gap in the hedge that should obviate the necessity of climb it but before she could recall any such gate or gap they be at the stile and bellew leap over have set down the basket and stretch out he hand to aid she over but anthea tall and lithe active and vigorous with she outdoor life and use to such thing from she infancy stand a moment hesitate to be sure the stile be rather high yet she could have vault it nearly if not quite as easily as bellew himself have she be alone but then she be not alone moreover be it remember this be in arcadium of a mid-summer night thus she hesitate only a moment it be true for see the quizzical look in he eye that always make she vaguely rebellious -- with a quick light movement she mount the stile and there pause to shake she head in laugh disdain of he out-stretched hand then -- there be the sound of rend cambric she trip and next moment he have catch she in he arm it be for but a very brief instant that she lay soft and yield in he embrace yet she be conscious of how strong be the arm that hold she so easily ere they set she down i beg you pardon -- how awkward i be she exclaim in hot mortification no say bellew shake he head it be a nail you know a bent and rusty nail -- here under the top bar be you dress much tear oh that be nothing thank you so they go on again but now they be silent once more and very naturally for anthea be mightily angry -- with herself the stile bellew and everything concern while he be think of the sudden warm clasp of she arm of the alluring fragrance of she hair and of the shy droop of she lash as she lay in he embrace therefore as he walk on beside she say nothing within he secret soul he pour benediction upon the head of that bent and rusty nail and presently have turn down a grassy lane and cross a small but very noisy brook that chatter impertinence among the stone and chuckle at they slyly from the shadow they eventually come upon a small and very lonely little cottage bower in rose and honeysuckle -- as be all the cottage hereabouts but now anthea pause look at bellew with a dubious brow i ought to warn you that mr dibbin be very old and sometimes a little queer and sometimes

they stem that they might have be asleep and fill the air with the perfume of they dream and here they pause perhaps because of the witchery of the moon perhaps to listen to the voice of the nightingale who sing on more gloriously than ever yet though they stand so close together they glance seldom meet and they be very silent but at last as though make up she mind anthea speak : what do you mean when you say old nannie 's dream be so wonderful she ask i 'll show you he answer and while he speak slip off he coat and draw up he shirt-sleeve hold out a muscular white arm towards she he

brighter and rosier than ever and here be comely prudence hither come from she kitchen to bear a hand and here as have be say be adam and here also be bellew he pipe lay aside with he coat push and tug in he effort to get the great side-board back into its customary position and all as have also be say be laughter and bustle and a eager haste to have all thing as they be -- and should be henceforth -- before anthea 's return lord exclaim adam again balanced now upon a ladder and pause to wipe he brow with one hand and with a picture swinging in the other lord what ever will miss

of which he depart with he load i rise this morning -- very early mr bellew -- oh very early say miss priscillum follow adam 's laden figure with watchful eye could not possibly sleep you see so i get up -- ridiculously early -- but bless you she be before I ah oh dear yes -- have be up -- hour and what -- what do you suppose she be do bellew shake he head she be rub and polish that old side-board that you pay such a dreadful price for -- down on she knee before it -- yes she be and polish and rub and -- cry all the while oh dear heart such great big tear -- and so very quiet when she hear my

take the trouble to pick up a ball of worst for a poor old lame woman -- in a orchard -- first impression you know and secondly i tell you all this to explain to you why i -- hum -- throw a kiss -- from a minstrel 's gallery to a most unworthy individual aunt priscillum throw you a kiss mr bellew -- i have to -- the side-board you know -- on she knee -- you understand i understand you see mr belloo sir say adam at this juncture speaking from beneath a inlay table which he hold balanced upon he head -- it be not as if this be jest ordinary furnitur ' sir -- ye see she kind-er feel as it be all part o ' dapplemere manor as it use to be call it be all be here so long that they cheer a ' table have come to be part o ' the ` ouse sir so when she come a ' find as it be not all be take -- or as you might say -- vanish away -- why the question as i ax 's you be -- w ` ot will she say oh lord and here adam give vent to he great laugh which necessitate a almost superhuman exertion of strength to keep the table from slip from its precarious perch whereupon miss priscillum scream -lrb- a very small scream like herself -rrb- and prudence scold and the two rosy-cheeked maid titter and adam go chuckle upon he way and when the hall be once more its old familiar comfortable self when the floor have be sweep of its litter and every trace of the sale remove -- then miss priscillum sigh and bellew put on he coat when do you expect -- she will come home he enquire glance at the grandfather clock in the corner well if she drive straight back from cranbrook she would be here now -- but i fancy she will not be so very anxious to get home to-day -- and may come the longest way round yes it be in my mind she will keep away from dapplemere as long as ever she can and i think say bellew yes i think i 'll take a walk i 'll go and call upon the sergeant the sergeant say miss priscillum let I see -- it be now a quarter to six it should take you about fifteen minute to the village that will make it exactly six o'clock you will find the sergeant just sit down in the chair on the left hand side of the fire-place -- in the corner -- at the ` king 's head ' you know not that i have ever see he there -- good gracious no but i -- happen to be -- acquaint with he habit and he be as regular and precise as he great big silver watch and that be the most precise and regular thing in all the world i be glad you be go she go on because to-day be -- well a day apart mr bellew you will find the sergeant at the ` king 's head ' -- until half past seven then i will go to the ` king 's head ' say bellew and what message do you send he none say miss priscillum laughing and shake she head -- at least -- you can tell he if you wish -- that -- the peach be riper than ever they be this evening i will not forget say bellew smile and go out into the sunshine but cross the yard he be meet by adam who chuckle still pause to touch he hat to look at that theer ` all sir you would not never know as there would ever be any sale at all -- not no'ow now the only question as worrit I and as i be a-axin ' of myself constant be -- what will miss anthea ` ave to say about it yes say bellew i wonder and so he turn and go away slowly across the field miss priscillum have be right -- anthea _ be _ come back the longest way round -- also she be anxious to keep away from dapplemere as long as possible therefore despite small porge ' exhortation and bess 's champ impatience she hold the mare in permit she only the slowest of pace which be a most unusual thing for anthea to do for the most part too she drive in silence seemingly deaf to small porge ' flow of talk which be also very unlike in she but before she eye be vision of she dismantle home in she ear be the roar of voice clamour for she cherish possession -- a sickening roar break now and then by the hollow tap of the auctioneer 's cruel hammer and each time the clamour voice rise she shiver and every blow of the cruel hammer seem to fall upon she quivering heart thus she be unwontedly deaf and unresponsive to small porge who presently fall into a profound gloom in consequence and thus she hold in the eager mare who therefore shy and fidget and toss she head indignantly but slowly as they go they come within sight of the house at last with its quaint gable and many latticed window and the blue smoke curl up from its twisted chimney -- smile and placid as though in all this great world there be no such thing to be find as -- a auctioneer 's hammer and presently they swing into the drive and draw up in the courtyard and there be adam wait to take the mare 's head -- adam as good-natured and stolid as though there be no abomination call for want of a worse name -- sale very slowly for she anthea climb down from the high dog-cart aid small porge to earth and with he hand clasp tight in hers and with lip set firm she turn and enter the hall but upon the threshold she stop and stand there utterly still gaze and gaze upon the trim orderliness of everything then see every well remembered thing in its appoint place -- all become suddenly blur and dim and snatch she hand from small porge ' clasp she utter a great choke sob and cover she face but small porge have see and stand aghast and miss priscillum have see and now hurry forward with a quick tap tap of she stick as she come anthea raise she head and look for one who should have be there but be not and in that moment instinctively she know how thing come to be as they be -- and because of this knowledge she cheek flame with a swift burning color and with a soft cry she hide she face in miss priscillum 's gentle bosom then while she face be yet hide there she whisper : tell I -- tell I -- all about it but meanwhile bellew stride far away across the meadow seem to watch the glory of the sun-set and to hearken to a blackbird piping from the dim seclusion of the copse a melodious good-bye to the die day yet see and hear it not at all for he mind be still occupy with adam 's question : -- what would miss anthea say chapter xiv _ which among other thing have to do with shrimp muffin and tin whistle _ a typical kentish village be dapplemere with its row of scattered cottage bower in rose and honeysuckle -- white walled cottage with steep-pitched roof and small latticed window that seem to stare at all and sundry like so many wink eye there be a air redolent of ripening fruit and hop for dapplemere be a place of orchard and hop-garden and rick-yard while here and there the sharp-pointed red-tiled roof of some oast-house pierce the green though dapplemere village be but a very small place indeed now-a-days -- yet it possess a church gray and ancient whose massive norman tower look down upon gable and chimney upon roof of thatch and roof of tile like some benignant giant keep watch above they all near-by of course be the inn a great rambling comfortable place with time-worn settle beside the door and with a mighty sign a-swinging before it upon which plainly to be see -lrb- when the sun catch it fairly -rrb- be that which purport to be a likeness of he majesty king william the fourth of glorious memory but alas the color have long since fade so that now -lrb- upon a dull day -rrb- it be a moot question whether he majesty 's nose be of the greek or roman order or indeed whether he be bless with any nose at all thus time and circumstance have unite to make a ghost of the likeness -lrb- as they have do of the original long since -rrb- which fading yet more and more will doubtless eventually vanish altogether -- like king william himself and leave but a vague memory behind now before the inn be a small crowd gather about a trap in which sit two man one of whom bellew recognize as the rednecked corn-chandler grime and the other the rat-eyed parson the corn-chandler be mop violently at he face and neck down which run and to which cling a foamy substance suspiciously like the froth of beer and as he mop he loud brassy voice shake and quaver with passion i tell ye -- you shall get out o ' my cottage he be say i say you shall quit my cottage at the end o ' the month -- and when i say a thing i mean it -- i say you shall get off of my property -- you -- and that beggarly cobbler i say you shall be throw out o ' my cottage -- lock stock and barrel i say -- i would not mr grime -- leastway not if i be you another voice break in calm and deliberate no i would not go for to say another word sir because if ye do say another word i know a man as will drag you down out o ' that cart sir -- i know a man as will break you whip over you very own back sir -- i know a man as will then take and heave you into the horse-pond sir -- and that man be I -- sergeant appleby late of the nineteenth hussar sir the corn-chandler have remove most of the froth from he head and face stare down at the straight alert figure of the big sergeant hesitate glance at the sergeant 's fist which though solitary be large and powerful scowl at the sergeant from he polished boot to the crown of he well-brushed hat -lrb- which perch upon he close-cropped gray hair at a ridiculous angle totally impossible to any but a ex-cavalry-man -rrb- mutter a furious oath and snatch he whip cut viciously at he horse very much as if that animal have be the sergeant himself and as the trap lurch forward he shake he fist and nod he head out ye go -- at the end o ' the month -- mind that he snarl and so rattle away down the road still mop at he head and neck until he have fairly mop himself out of sight well sergeant say bellew extend he hand how be you hearty sir -- hearty i thank you though at this precise moment just a leetle put out sir none the less i know a man as be happy to see you mr bellew sir -- and that be I -- sergeant appleby at you service sir my cottage lie down the road yonder a easy march -- if you will step that far -- speak for my comrade and myself -- we shall be proud for you to take tea with we -- muffin sir -- shrimp mr bellew -- also a pikelet or two -- not a great feast -- but tolerable good ration sir -- and plenty of 'em -- what do you say i say -- do and thank you very much so without further parley the sergeant salute diver of the little crowd and wheeling sharply stride along beside bellew rather more stiff in the back and fix of eye than be he wont and jingle he imaginary spur rather more loudly than usual you will be wonder at the tantrum of the man grime sir -- of he order I and my comrade peterday out of he cottage sir -- i 'll tell you -- in two word it be all owe to the sale -- up at the farm sir you see grime be a great hand at buy thing uncommonly cheap and sell 'em -- uncommonly dear to-day it seem -- he be disappoint -- ah say bellew at exactly -- twenty-three minute to six sir say the sergeant consult he large silver watch i be sit in my usual corner -- beside the chimley sir -- when in come grime -- like a thunder-cloud -- call for a pint of ale -- in a tankard tom draw pint -- which tom be the landlord sir ` buy anything at the sale mr grime ' say tom -- ` sale ' say grime ` sale indeed ' and fall a cursing -- folk up at the farm -- shocking -- outrageous end by threaten to foreclose mortgage -- within the month upon which -- i raise a protest -- upon which he grow abusive -- upon which i be force to pour he ale over he -- after which i run he out into the road -- and there it be you see and -- he threaten to foreclose the mortgage on dapplemere farm do he sergeant within the month sir -- upon which i warn he -- inn parlor no place -- lady 's private money trouble -- gaping crowd -- dammit and so he be turn you out of he cottage within the week sir -- but then -- beer down the neck -- be rather unpleasant and here the sergeant utter a short laugh and be immediately grave again it be not he go on it be not as _ i _ mind the inconvenience of move sir -- though i shall be mighty sorry to leave the old place still it be not that so much as the small corner cup-board and my bookshelf by the chimley there never be such a cup-board -- no sir -- there never be a cup-board so well calculate to hold a pair o ' jack boot not to mention spur highlow burnisher shoulder-chain polish brush and -- a boot-jack as that same small corner cup-board as for the book-shelf beside the chimley sir -- exactly three foot three -- sink in a recess -- height the third button o ' my coat -- capacity fourteen book you could not get another book on that shelf -- no not if you try with a sledge-hammer or a hydraulic engine which be highly surprising when you consider that fourteen book be the true and exact number of book as i possess very remarkable say bellew then again -- there be my comrade -- peter day -lrb- the sergeant pronounce it as though it be all one word -rrb- sir my comrade peterday be a very remarkable man -- most cobbler be when he be not cobble he be reading -- when not read he be cobble or mend clock and watch and betwixt this and that my comrade have pick up a power of information -- though he lose he leg a do of it -- in a gale of wind -- off the cape of good hope for my comrade be a sailor sir consequently he be a handy man most sailor be and make he own wooden leg sir he be also a musician -- the tin whistle sir -- and here we be say which the sergeant halt wheel open a very small gate and usher bellew into a very small garden bright with flower beyond which be a very small cottage indeed through the open door of which there issue a most appetizing odour accompany by a whistle wonderfully clear and sweet that be render tom bowling with many shake trill and astonishing run peterday be busy at the fire with a long toasting-fork in he hand but on they entrance break off he whistle in the very middle of a note he spring nimbly to he foot -lrb- or rather he foot -rrb- and stand reveal as a short yet strongly build man with a face that in one way resemble a island in that it be completely surround by hair and whisker but it be in all respects a vastly pleasant island to behold despite the somewhat craggy prominence of chin and nose and brow in other word it be a pleasing face notwithstanding the fierce thick eye-brow which be more than offset by the merry blue eye and the broad humourous mouth below peterday say the sergeant mr bel-lew glad to see you sir say the mariner salute the visitor with a quick bob of the head and a backward scrape of the wooden leg you could not make port at a better time sir -- and because why -- because the kettle 's a bile sir the muffin be pipe hot and the shrimp be a-laying hove to wait to be take aboard sir say which peterday bob he head again shake he wooden leg again and turn away to reach another cup and saucer it be a large room for so small a cottage and comfortably furnish with a floor of red tile and with a grate at one end well raise up from the hearth upon the hob a kettle sing murmurously and on a trivet stand a plate whereon rise a tower of toast muffin a round table occupy the middle of the floor and be spread with a snowy cloth whereon cup and saucer be arrange while in the midst stand a great bowl of shrimp now above the mantel-piece that be to say to the left of it and fasten to the wall be a length of rope cunningly tie into what be call a run bowline above this on a shelf specially contrived to hold it be the model of a full-rigged ship that be -- to all appearance -- make excellent way of it with every stitch of canvas set and draw alow and aloft above this again be a sextant and a telescope opposite all these upon the other side of the mantel be a pair of stirrup three pair of spur two cavalry sabre and a carbine while between these object in the very middle of the chimney unite as it be the army and the navy be a portrait of queen victorium bellew also notice that each side of the room partook of the same characteristic one be devote to thing nautical the other to object military all this bellew notice while the soldier be brew the tea and the sailor be bestow the last finishing touch to the muffin it be not often as we be honor wus ' company sir say peterday as they sit down be it dick no answer the sergeant hand bellew the shrimp we be not have company to tea say peterday pass bellew the muffin no we be not have company to tea since the last time miss anthea and miss priscillum honor we have we dick honor we say the sergeant nod he head approvingly be the one and only word for it peterday and the last time be this day twelve month sir -- because why -- because this day twelve month ` appen to be miss priscillum 's birthday -- consequently to-day be she birthday likewise -- wherefore the muffin and wherefore the shrimp sir for they be this day to have once more grace we board mr bellew ` grace we board ' say the sergeant nod he head again ` grace we board ' be the only expression for it peterday but they disappoint we mr bellew sir -- on account of the sale messmate say peterday with a note of concern in he voice how 's the wind tolerable comrade tolerable then -- why forget the tea tea say the sergeant with a guilty start why -- so i be -- mr bellew sir -- you pardon and forthwith he begin to pour out the tea very solemnly but with less precision of movement than usual and with abstracted gaze the sergeant tell I you be a musician say bellew as peterday hand he another muffin a musician -- I think o ' that now to be sure i do toot on the tin whistle now and then sir such thing as ` the british grenadier ' and the ` girl i leave behind I ' for my shipmate and ` the bay o ' biscay ' and ' a life on the ocean wave ' for myself -- but a musician lord ye see sir say peterday take advantage of the sergeant 's abstraction and whisper confidentially behind he muffin that messmate o ' mine have such a high opinion o ' my gift as be fair over-powering and a tin whistle be only a tin whistle after all and it be about the only instrument i could ever get the hang of say bellew why -- do you mean as you play sir hardly that but i make a good bluff at it why then -- i have get a couple o ' very good whistle -- if you be so mind we might try a doo-et sir arter tea with pleasure nod bellew but hereupon peterday notice that the sergeant eat nothing lean over and touch he upon the shoulder how 's the wind now shipmate he enquire why so so peterday fairish fairish say the sergeant stir he tea round and round and with he gaze fix upon the opposite wall then messmate -- why not a muffin or even a occasional shrimp -- where be you appetite peterday say the sergeant begin to stir he tea faster than ever and with he eye still fix consequent upon disparage remark have be pass by one grime -- we landlord -- concern they as should not be mention in a inn parlor -- or anywhere else -- by such as say grime -- i be compel to pour -- a tankard of beer -- over say grime we landlord -- this arternoon peterday at exactly -- twelve and a half minute past six by my watch -- which do -- i run we landlord -- out into the road peterday say -- half a minute later which would make it precisely thirteen minute after the hour consequent upon which comrade -- we have receive we march order what messmate be it heave we anchor you mean i mean comrade -- that on Saturday next be the twenty-fifth instant -- we march out -- bag and baggage -- horse foot and artillery -- we evacuate we position -- in face of superior force -- for good and all comrade be that so shipmate it be rough on you peterday -- it be hard on you i 'll admit but thing be say comrade -- relative to -- business trouble of one as we both respect peterday -- thing be say as call for -- beer down the neck -- and run out into the road comrade but it be rough on you peterday see as you -- like the hussar at assuan -- be never engage so to speak aye aye shipmate that do ketch I -- all aback shipmate why lord i would give a pound -- two pound -- ah ten -- just to have be astarn of he wi ' a rope 's end -- though -- come to think of it i would ha ' prefer a capstan-bar peterday say the sergeant remove he gaze from the wall with a jerk on the twenty-fifth instant we shall be -- without a roof to cover we and -- all my do peterday -- what have you to say about it say messmate -- why that you and I honor and respect two lady as deserve to be honor and respect be not go to let such a small thing as this here cottage come betwixt we and we honor and respect of they two lady if therefore we be due to quit this anchorage why then it be all hand to the windlass with a heave yo ho and merrily say i messmate -- my fist hereupon with a very jerky movement indeed the sergeant reach out he remain arm and the soldier and the sailor shake hand very solemnly over the muffin -lrb- already vastly diminish in number -rrb- with a grip that speak much peterday -- you have lift a load off my heart -- i thank ye comrade -- and speak like a true soldier peterday -- the muffin so now the sergeant himself once more fall to in turn and they eat and drink and laugh and talk until the shrimp be all go and the muffin be thing of the past and now decline all bellew 's offer of assistance the soldier and the sailor begin wash and dry and put away they crockery each in he characteristic manner -- the sergeant very careful and exact while the sailor juggle cup and saucer with the sure-handed deftness that seem peculiar to nautical finger yes peterday say the sergeant hang each cup upon its appoint nail and set each saucer solicitously in the space reserve for it on the small dresser since you have take we march order as you have take 'em i be quite reconcile to parting with these here snug quarter bar only -- a book-shelf and a cup-board cupboard return peterday with a snort of disdain why there never be such a ill-contrived lubberly cupboard as that in all the world you can not get at it unless you lay over to port -- on account o ' the clothes-press and then hard a starboard -- on account o ' the dresser -- and then it be in the darkest corner -- true peterday but then i be use to it and use be everything as you know -- i can lay my hand upon anything -- in a minute -- watch I say which the sergeant squeeze himself between the press and the dresser open the cupboard and take thence several article which he name each in order a pair o ' jack-boot -- two brush -- black -- and a burnisher have set these down one by one upon the dresser he wheel and address himself to bellew as follow : mr bellew sir -- this evening be the anniversary of a certain -- event sir i will ask you -- to excuse I -- while i make the necessary preparation -- to honor this anniversary -- as be ever my custom as he end he drop the two brush the blacking and the burnisher inside the leg of the boot pick they up with a sweep of the arm and turn short round stride out into the little garden a fine fellow be dick sir nod peterday begin to fill a long clay pipe lord -- what a sailor he have ha ' make to be sure -- fail which he be as fine a soldier as ever be or will be with enough war-medal to fill my Sunday hat sir when he lose he arm they give he the vc and he discharge sir -- because why -- because a soldier wus ' one arm be not any more good than a sailor wus ' one leg d'ye see so they try to discharge dick but -- lord love you -- they could not sir -- because why -- because dick be a soldier breed and bear and be as much a soldier to-day as ever he be -- ah and always will be -- until he go march aloft -- like poor tom bowling -- until one as be general of all the army and admiral of all the fleet as ever sail shall call the last muster roll sir at this present moment sir continue the sailor light he pipe with a live coal from the fire my messmate be a-sitting to the leeward o ' the plum tree outside a polishing of he jack-boot -- as do not need polish and a burnish of he spur -- as do not need burnish and because why -- because he go on guard to-night accord to custom on guard repeat bellew i be afraid i do not understand of course you do not sir chuckle peterday well then to-night he march away -- in full regimental sir -- to mount guard and -- where do you suppose -- why i 'll tell you -- under miss priscillum 's window he get there as the clock be striking eleven and there he stay a march to and fro until twelve o'clock which do he a world o ' good sir and noway displease miss priscillum -- because why -- because she do not know nothing whatever about it hereupon peterday rise and cross to a battered sea-man 's chest in the corner come back with three or four tin whistle which he hand to bellew who lay aside he pipe and have select one run tentatively up and down the scale while peterday listen attentive of ear and beam of face sir say he what do you say to ` annie laurie ' as a start -- shall we give 'em ` annie laurie ' -- very good -- ready -- go thus george bellew american citizen and millionaire pipe away on a tin whistle with all the gusto in the world -- introduce little trill and flourish here and there that fairly win the one-legged sailor 's heart they have already give 'em three or four selection each of which have be vociferously encore by peterday or bellew -- and have just finish a impassioned rendering of the suwanee river when the sergeant appear with he boot beneath he arm shipmate cry peterday flourish he whistle do ye ever hear a tin whistle better play or mellerer in tone meller -- be the only word for it comrade -- and you playing sir be -- artistic -- though doleful p ` rap you would not mind give we something brighter -- a rattle quick-step p ` rap you might remember one as begin : ` some talk of alexander and some of hercule ' if it would not be trouble you too much forthwith they burst forth into the british grenadier and never do tin whistle render the famous old tune with more fire and dash as the stir note ring out the sergeant standing upon the hearth seem to grow taller he broad chest expand he eye glow a flush creep up into he cheek and the whole man thrill to the music as he have do many a time and oft in year go by as the last note die away he glance down at the empty sleeve pin across he breast shake he head and thank they in a very gruff voice indeed turn on he heel and busy himself at he little cupboard peterday now rise and set a jug together with three glass upon the table also spoon and a lemon keep he weather-eye meanwhile upon the kettle -- which last condescending to boil obligingly he rap three time with he wooden leg right o shipmate he cry very much as though he have be hail the main-top whereupon the sergeant emerge from between the clothes-press and the dresser with a black bottle in he hand which he pass over to peterday who set about brewing what he call a jorum o ' grog the savor of which fill the place with a right pleasant fragrance and when the glass brim each with a slice of lemon a-top -- the sergeant solemnly rise mr bellew and comrade say he lift he glass i give you -- miss priscillum god bless she say peterday aman add bellew so the toast be drunk -- the glass be empty re-filled and empty again -- this time more slowly and the clock striking nine bellew rise to take he leave see which the sergeant fetch he hat and stick and volunteer to accompany he a little way so when bellew have shake the sailor 's honest hand they set out together sergeant say bellew after they have walk some distance i have a message for you for I sir from miss priscillum from -- indeed sir she bid I tell you that -- the peach be riper to-night than ever they be the sergeant seem to find in this a subject for profound thought and he stride on beside bellew very silently and with he eye straight before he ` that the peach be riper -- to-night -- than ever they be ' say he at last yes sergeant riper say the sergeant as though turn this over in he mind riper than ever they be nodded bellew the -- peach i think sir the peach yes bellew hear the sergeant 's finger rasp to and fro across he shaven chin mr bellew sir -- she be a -- very remarkable woman sir yes sergeant a -- wonderful woman yes sergeant the kind of woman that -- improve with age sir yes sergeant talking of -- peach sir i have often think -- she be -- very like a peach -- herself sir very sergeant but -- well sir peach do -- _ not _ improve with age sergeant -- ` and the peach be -- riper than ever they be -- to-night ' the sergeant stop short and stare at bellew wide-eyed why -- sir say he very slowly you do not mean to say you -- think as she -- mean -- that -- but i do nodded bellew and now just as suddenly as he have stop the sergeant turn and go on again lord he whisper -- lord lord the moon be rise and look at the sergeant bellew see that there be a wonderful light in he face yet a light that be not of the moon sergeant say bellew lay a hand upon he shoulder why do not you speak to she speak to she -- what I no no mr bellew say the sergeant hastily no no -- can not be do sir -- not to be mention or think of sir the light be all go out of he face now and he walk with he chin on he breast the surprising thing to I sergeant be that you have never think of put you fortune to the test and -- speak you mind to she before now think of it sir repeat the sergeant bitterly think of it -- lord sir i have think of it -- these five year -- and more i have think of it -- day and night i have think of it so very much that i know -- i never can -- speak my mind to she look at I he cry suddenly wheeling and confront bellew but not at all like he bold erect soldierly self -- yes look at I -- a poor battered old soldier -- with he -- best arm go -- leave behind he in indium and with nothing in the world but he old uniform -- get very fray and worn -- like himself sir -- a pair o ' jack boot likewise very much worn though wonderfully patch here and there by my good comrade peterday -- a handful of medal and a very modest pension look at I with the best o ' my day behind I and wus ' only one arm leave -- and i be a deal more awkward and helpless with that one arm than you would think sir -- look at I and then tell I how could such a man dare to speak he mind to -- such a woman what right have -- such a man to even think of speak he mind to -- such a woman when there be part o ' that man already in the grave why no right sir -- none in the world poverty and one arm be fact as make it impossible for that man to -- ever speak he mind and sir -- that man -- never will sir -- good night to you -- and a pleasant walk -- i turn back here which the sergeant do then and there wheeling sharp right about face yet as bellew watch he go he notice that the soldier 's step be heavy and slow and it seem that for once the sergeant have even forget to put on he imaginary spur chapter xv _ in which adam explain _ adam yes miss anthea how much money do mr bellew give you to -- buy the furniture miss anthea be sit in she great elbow chair lean forward with she chin in she hand look at he in the way which always seem

everything then good-night sir good-night adam so this good well-meaning adam stride away proud on the whole of he night 's work leave bellew to frown up at the moon with tooth clench tight upon he pipe-stem chapter xvii _ how bellew begin the game _ now in this life of ours there be game of many and diver sort and all be calculate to try the nerve courage or skill of the player as the case may be bellew have play many kind of game in he day and among other have once be famous as a eight tackle on the harvard eleven upon he he yet bear certain scar receive upon a memorable day when yale flush with success see they hitherto invincible line rent and burst asunder see a figure tear bruised and bleeding flash out and away down the field to turn defeat into victory and then to be bear off honourably to hospital and bed if bellew thought of this by any chance as he sit there stare up at the moon it be very sure that have the choice be give he he would joyfully have choose the game of tear flesh and broken bone or any other game no matter how desperate rather than this particular game that adam have invent and thrust upon he presently bellew knock the ash from he pipe and rise walk on slowly toward the house as he approach he hear someone play the piano and the music accord well with he mood or he mood with the music for it be haunt and very sweet and with a recur melody in a minor key that seem to voice all the sorrow of humanity past present and to come draw by the music he cross the rise garden and reach the terrace pause there for the long french window be open and from where he stand he could see anthea seat at the piano she be dress in a white gown of some soft cling material and among the heavy braid of she hair be a single great red rose and as he watch he think she have never look more beautiful than now with the soft glow of the candle upon she for she face reflect the tender sadness of the music it be in the mournful droop of she scarlet lip and the sombre depths of she eye close beside she sit little miss priscillum busy with she needle as usual but now she pause and lift she head in she quick bird-like way look up at anthea long and fixedly anthea my dear say she suddenly i be fond of music and i love to hear you play as you know -- but i never hear you play quite so -- dolefully dear I no -- that be not the right word -- nor dismal -- but i mean something between the two i think you be fond of grieg aunt priscillum so i be but then even in he gayest moment poor mr grieg be always break he heart over something or other and -- gracious -- there be mr bellew at the window pray come in mr bellew and tell we how you like peterday and the muffin thank you say bellew step in through the long french window but i should like to hear miss anthea play again first if she will but anthea who have already rise from the piano shake she head : i only play when i feel like it -- to please myself -- and aunt priscillum say she cross to the broad low window-seat and lean out into the fragrant night why then say bellew sink into the easy-chair that miss priscillum indicate with a little stab of she needle why then the muffin be delicious aunt priscillum and peterday be just exactly what a one-legged mariner ought to be and the shrimp mr bellew enquire miss priscillum busy at she sewing again out-shrimped all other shrimp so ever he answer glance to where anthea sit with she chin prop in she hand gaze up at the wane moon seemingly quite oblivious of he and do -- _ he _ -- pour out the tea enquired miss priscillum from the china pot with the blue flower and the chinese mandarin fan himself -- and very awkward of course with he one hand -- i do not mean the mandarin mr bellew -- and very full of apology he do just as usual yes he always do -- and every year he give I three lump of sugar -- and i only take one you know it be a pity sigh miss priscillum that it be he right arm -- a great pity and here she sigh again and catch herself glance up quickly at bellew and smile to see how completely absorb he be in contemplation of the silent figure in the window-seat but after all better a right arm -- than a leg she pursue -- at least i think so certainly murmur bellew a man with only one leg you see would be almost as helpless as a -- old woman with a cripple foot -- who grow younger and brighter every year add bellew turn to she with he pleasant smile yes and i think -- prettier oh mr bellew exclaim miss priscillum shake she head at he reprovingly yet look pleased none the less -- how can you be so ridiculous -- good gracious I why it be the sergeant who put it into my head -- the sergeant yes -- it be after i have give he you message about peach aunt priscillum and -- oh dear heart exclaim miss priscillum at this juncture prudence be out to-night and i promise to bake the bread for she and here i sit chat and gossip while that bread go rise and rise all over the kitchen and miss priscillum lay aside she sewing and catch up she stick hurry to the door and i be almost forget to wish you ` many happy return of the day aunt priscillum ' say bellew rise at this familiar appellation anthea turn sharply in time to see he stoop and kiss miss priscillum 's small white hand whereupon anthea must need curl she lip at he broad back then he open the door and miss priscillum tap away even more quickly than usual anthea be half-sitting half-kneeling among the cushion in the corner of the deep window apparently still lose in contemplation of the moon so much so that she do not stir or even lower she up-ward gaze when bellew come and stand beside she therefore take advantage of the fixity of she regard he once more become absorb in she loveliness surely a most unwise proceeding -- in arcadium by the light of a midsummer moon and he mentally contrast the dark proud beauty of she face with that of all the woman he have ever know -- to they utter and complete disparagement well enquire anthea at last perfectly conscious of he look and find the silence grow irksome yet still with she eye avert -- well mr bellew on the contrary he answer the moon be on the wane the moon she repeat suppose it be -- what then true happiness can only come ride astride the full moon you know -- you remember old nannie tell we so and you -- believe it she enquire scornfully why of course he answer in he quiet way anthea do not speak but once again the curl of she lip be eloquent and so he go on quite unabashed when i behold happiness ride astride the full moon i shall just reach up in the most natural manner in the world and -- take it down that it may abide with I world without end do you think you will be tall enough we shall see -- when the time come i think it be all very ridiculous say anthea why then -- suppose you play for I that same plaintive piece you be play as i come in -- something of grieg 's i think it be -- will you miss anthea she be on the point of refuse then as if move by some capricious whim she cross to the piano and dash into the riotous music of a polish dance as the wild note leap beneath she quick brown finger bellew seat near-by keep he eye upon the great red rose in she hair that nod slyly at he with she every movement and surely in all the world there have never bloom a more tantalizing more wantonly provoke rise than this wherefore bellew very wisely turn he eye from its glowing temptation doubtless observe which the rose in evident desperation nod and sway until it have fairly nodded itself from its sweet resting-place and fall to the floor lay within bellew 's reach whereupon he promptly stoop and pick it up and -- even as with a last crash chord anthea cease playing and turn in that same moment he drop it deftly into he coat pocket oh by the way mr bellew she say speaking as if the idea have but just enter she mind what do you intend to do about -- all you furniture do about it he repeat settle the rose carefully in a corner of he pocket where it would not be crush by he pipe i mean -- where would you like it -- store until you can send and have it -- take away well -- i -- er -- rather thought of keep it -- where it be if you do not mind i be afraid that will be -- impossible mr bellew why then the barn will be a excellent place for it i do not suppose the rat and mouse will do it any real harm and as for the damp and the dust -- oh you know what i mean exclaimed anthea begin to tap the floor impatiently with she foot of course we can not go on use the thing now that they be you property it -- would not be -- right very well he nod he finger questing anxiously after the rose again i 'll get adam to help I to shift it all into the barn to-morrow morning will you please be serious mr bellew as a owl he nod why then -- of course you will be leave dapplemere soon and i should like to know exactly when so that i can -- make the necessary arrangement but you see i be not leave dapplemere soon or even think of it not she repeat glance up at he in swift surprise not until -- you bid I i you but i -- i understand that you -- intend to -- settle down certainly nod bellew transfer he pipe to another pocket altogether lest it should damage the rose 's tender petal to settle down have lately become the -- er -- ambition of my life then pray say anthea take up a sheet of music and begin to study it with attentive eye be so good as to tell I -- what you mean that necessarily bring we back to the moon again answer bellew the moon the moon but what in the world have the moon to do with you furniture she demand she foot begin to tap again everything -- i buy that furniture with -- er -- with one eye on the moon as it be -- consequently the furniture the moon and i be bind indissolubly together you be pleased to talk in riddle to-night and really mr bellew i have no time to waste over they so if you will excuse I -- thank you for play to I he say as he hold the door open for she i play because i -- i feel like it mr bellew nevertheless i thank you when you make up you mind about -- the furniture -- please let I know when the moon be at the full yes can it be possible that you be still harp on the wild word of poor old nannie she exclaim and once more she curl she lip at he nannie be very old i 'll admit he nod but surely you remember that we prove she right in one particular -- i mean about the tiger mark you know now when he say this for no apparent reason the eye that have hitherto be look into he proud and scornful -- waver and be hide under they long thick lash the color flame in she cheek and without another word she be go chapter xviii _ how the sergeant go upon he guard _ the arcadian one and all generally follow that excellent maxim which run : early to bed and early to rise make a man healthy and wealthy and wise healthy they be beyond a doubt and in they quaint simple fashion profoundly wise if they be not extraordinarily wealthy yet be they generally bless with contented mind which after all be better than money and far more to be desire than fine gold now whether they general health happiness and wisdom be to be attribute altogether to they early to bed proclivity be perhaps a moot question howbeit to-night long after these weary arcadian have forget they various care and trouble in the bless oblivion of sleep -lrb- for even arcadium have its trouble -rrb- bellew sit beneath the shade of king arthur alone with he thought presently however he be surprise to hear the house-door open and close very softly and to behold -- not the object of he meditation but miss priscillum come towards he as she catch sight of he in the shadow of the tree she stop and stand lean upon she stick as though she be rather disconcerted aunt priscillum say he rise oh -- it be you she exclaim just as though she have not know it all along dear I mr bellew -- how lonely you look and dreadfully thoughtful -- good gracious and she glance up at he with she quick girlish smile i suppose you be wonder what i be do out here at this unhallowed time of night -- it must be nearly eleven o'clock oh dear I -- yes you be -- well sit down and i 'll tell you let we sit here -- in the darkest corner -- there dear heart -- how bright the moon be to be sure so say miss priscillum ensconce herself at the very end of the rustic bench where the deepest shadow lay well mr bellew she begin as you know to-day be my birthday as to my age i be -- let we say -- just turn twenty-one and be young and foolish mr bellew i have come out here to watch another very foolish person -- a ridiculous old sergeant of hussar who will come march along very soon to mount guard in full regimental mr bellew -- with he busby on he head with he braided tunic and dolman and he great big boot and with he spur jingle and he sabre bright under the moon so then -- you know he come why of course i do and i love to hear the jingle of he spur and to watch the glitter of he sabre so every year i come here and sit among the shadow where he can not see I and watch he go march march march up and down and to and fro until the clock strike twelve and he go march home again oh dear I -- it be all very foolish of course -- but i love to hear the jingle of he spur and -- have you sit here watch he every year every year and he have never guess you be watch he good gracious I -- of course not do not you think aunt priscillum that you be -- just a little -- cruel cruel -- why -- what do you mean i give he you message aunt priscillum what message that ` to-night the peach be riper than ever they be ' oh say miss priscillum and wait expectantly for bellew to continue but as he be silent she glance at he and see he stare at the moon she look at it also and after she have gaze for perhaps half a minute as bellew be still silent she speak though in a very small voice indeed and -- what do -- he say who enquire bellew why the -- the sergeant to be sure well he give I to understand that a poor old soldier with only one arm leave he must be content to stand aside always and -- hold he peace just because he be a poor maimed old soldier do not you think that you have be -- just a little cruel -- all these year aunt priscillum sometimes -- one be cruel -- only to be -- kind she answer be not the peach ripe enough after all aunt priscillum over-ripe she say bitterly oh -- they be over-ripe be that all aunt priscillum no she answer no there be -- this and she hold up she little crutch stick be that all aunt priscillum oh -- be not -- that enough bellew rise where be you go -- what be you go to do she demand wait say he smile down at she perplexity and so he turn and cross to a certain corner of the orchard when he come back he hold out a great glowing peach towards she you be quite right he nod it be so ripe that it fall at a touch but as he speak she draw he down beside she in the shadow : hush she whisper listen now as they sit there very silent -- faint and far-away upon the still night air they hear a sound a silvery rhythmic sound it be -- like the musical clash of fairy cymbal which draw rapidly nearer and nearer and bellew feel that miss priscillum 's hand be tremble upon he arm as she lean forward listen with a smile upon she parted lip and a light in she eye that be ineffably tender nearer come the sound and nearer until presently now in moonlight now in shadow there stride a tall martial figure in all the glory of braided tunic and furred dolman the three chevron upon he sleeve and many shine medal upon he breast -- a stalwart soldierly figure despite the one empty sleeve who move with the long swinging stride that only the cavalry-man can possess be come beneath a certain latticed window the sergeant halted and next moment he glittering sabre flash up to the salute then with it upon he shoulder he wheel and begin to march up and down he spur jingle he sabre gleam he dolman swing he sabre glitter each time he wheel while miss priscillum lean forward watch he wide-eyed and with hand tight clasped then all at once -- with a little flutter sigh she rise thus the sergeant as he march to and fro be suddenly aware of one who stand in the full radiance of the moon -- and with one hand outstretch towards he and now as he pause disbelieve he very eye he see that in she extended hand she hold a great ripe peach sergeant she say speak almost in a whisper oh sergeant -- will not you -- take it the heavy sabre thud down into the grass and he take a sudden step towards she but even now he hesitate until come nearer yet he could look down into she eye then he speak and he voice be very hoarse and uneven : miss priscillum he say priscillum -- oh priscillum and with the word he have fall on he knee at she foot and he strong solitary arm be fold close about she chapter xix _ in which porge big and porge small discuss the subject of matrimony _ what be it my

can sit or sit if i can lie down i should like you to define exactly you position -- here at dapplemere mr bellew bellew 's sleepy glance miss nothing of the other 's challenging attitude and he ear

particularly as regard yorkshire pudding gentle little miss priscillum be the most -- er aunt-like and perfect of housekeeper and miss anthea be we sovereign lady before whose radiant beauty small

least you know and will perhaps explain what prompt you to buy all that furniture you be the only buyer at the sale i understand who -- buy anything yes nod bellew and pray -- what be you object -- you -- a stranger well reply bellew slowly as he begin to fill he pipe i buy it because it be there to buy you know i buy it because furniture be apt to be rather useful now and then -- i acquire the chair to -- er -- sit in the table to -- er -- put thing on and -- do not quibble with I mr bellew i beg you pardon mr cassili when i ask a question sir i be in the habit of receive a direct reply -- and when i be ask a question mr cassilis i be in the habit of answer it precisely as i please -- or not at all mr bellew let I impress upon you once and for all that miss devine have friend -- old and try friend to whom she can always turn for aid in any financial difficulty she may have to encounter -- friend who can more than tide over all she difficulty without the -- interference of stranger and as one of she oldest friend i demand to know by what right you force you wholly unnecessary assistance upon she my very good sir return bellew shake he head in gentle reproof really you seem to forget that you be not address one of you groom or footman -- consequently you force I to remind you of the fact furthermore -- that be no answer say mr cassilis he gloved hand tight-clenched upon he hunting-crop -- he whole attitude one of menace furthermore pursue bellew placidly settle the tobacco in he pipe with he thumb you can continue to -- er demand until all be blue and i shall continue to lie here and smoke and gaze up at the smile serenity of heaven the black brow of mr cassili meet in a sudden frown he toss he whip aside and take a sudden quick stride towards the recumbent bellew with so evident a intention that small porge shrink instinctively further within the encircle arm but at that psychic moment very fortunately for all concerned there come the sound of a quick light step and anthea stand between they mr cassili -- mr bellew she exclaim she cheek flush and she bosom heave with the haste she have make pray whatever do this mean bellew rise to he foot and see cassili be silent shake he head and smile : upon my word i hardly know miss anthea we friend mr cassili seem to have get himself all work up over the -- er -- sale i fancy -- the furniture exclaim anthea and stamp she foot with vexation that wretch furniture of course you explain you object in buy it mr bellew well no -- we have not get as far as that now when he say this anthea 's eye flash sudden scorn at he and she curl she lip at he and turn she back upon he : mr bellew buy my furniture because he intend to set up house-keeping -- he be to be marry -- soon i believe when the moon be at the full nod bellew married exclaimed mr cassili he frown vanish as if by magic oh indeed -- i be on my way to the hop-garden if you care to walk with I mr cassili and with the word anthea turn and as he watch they walk away together -- bellew notice upon the face of mr cassilis a expression very like triumph and in he general air a suggestion of proprietorship that jar upon he most unpleasantly why do you frown so uncle porge i -- er -- be think nephew well i be think too nodded small porge he brow knit portentously and thus they sit big and little porge frown in unison at space for quite a while be you quite sure you never tell my auntie anthea that you be go to marry she enquired small porge at last quite sure comrade -- why then how do she know you be go to marry she a ' settle down marry -- she and settle down yes -- at the full o ' the moon you know why really -- i do not know my porge -- unless she guess it i specks she do -- she be awful ' clever at guess thing but do you know -- well i be think i do not just like the way she smile at mr cassilis i never see she look at he like that before -- as if she be awful ' glad to see he you know so i do not think i would wait till the full o ' the moon if i be you i think you would better marry she -- this afternoon that say bellew clap he on the shoulder be a very admirable idea -- i 'll mention it to she on the first available opportunity my porge but the opportunity do not come that day nor the next nor the next after that for it seem that with the approach of the hop-picking anthea have no thought or time for anything else wherefore bellew smoke many pipe and as the day wear on possess he soul in patience which be a most excellent precept to follow -- in all thing but love chapter xx _ which relate a most extraordinary conversation _ in the day which now ensue while anthea be busy out of door and miss priscillum be busy indoors and small porge be diligently occupy with he lesson -- at such time bellew would take he pipe and go to sit and smoke in company with the cavalier in the great picture above the carve chimney-piece a right jovial companion at all time be this cavalier a optimist he from the curl feather in he broad-brimmed beaver hat to the spur at he heel handsome gay and debonair be he with lip up-curve to a smile beneath he moustachio and a quizzical light in he gray eye very like that in bellew 's own moreover he wear the know waggish air of one well verse in all the way of the world and mankind in general and -lrb- what be infinitely more -rrb- -- of the sex feminine in particular experienced be he beyond all doubt in they pretty trick and foible since he have ever be a diligent student of feminine capriciousness when the merry monarch rule the land hence it become customary for bellew to sit with he and smoke and take counsel of this preux chevalier upon the unfortunate turn of affair whereof ensue many remarkable conversation of which the follow be one : bellew : no sir -- emphatically i do not agree with you to be sure you may have have more experience than i in such affair -- but then it be such a very long time ago the cavalier : -lrb- interrupt or seem to -rrb- bellew : again i beg to differ from you woman be not the same to-day as they ever be judge by what i have read of the lady of you day and king charle 's court at whitehall -- i should say -- not at least if they be they act differently and consequently must be -- er -- woo differently the method employ in you day would be wholly inadequate and quite out of place in this the cavalier : -lrb- shake he head and smirk -- or seem to -rrb- bellew : well i be willing to bet you anything you like that if you be to step down out of you frame change you velvet and lace for trousers and coat leave off you great peruke and wear a derby hat instead of that picturesque floppy affair and try you fortune with some twentieth century damsel you high-sounding gallantry and flattering phrase would fall singularly flat and you would be promptly -- turn down sir the cavalier : -lrb- toss he love-lock -- or seem to -rrb- bellew : the strong hand you say hum history tell we that william the conqueror woo he lady with a club or a battle-axe or something of the sort and she consequently like he the better for it which be all very natural and proper of course in she case see that hers be the day of battle-axis and thing but then as i say before sir -- the time be sadly change -- woman may still admire strength of body and even -- occasionally -- of mind but the theory of dog woman and walnut tree be quite obsolete the cavalier : -lrb- frown and shake he head -- or seem to -rrb- bellew : ha -- you do not believe I well that be because you be obsolete too -- yes sir as obsolete as you hat or you boot or you long rapier now for instance suppose i be to ask you advice in my own case you know precisely how the matter stand at present between miss anthea and myself you also know miss anthea personally since you have see she much and often and have watch she grow from childhood into -- er -- glorious womanhood -- i repeat sir glorious womanhood thus you ought to know and understand she far better than i -- for i do confess she be a constant source of bewilderment to I now since you do know she so well -- what course should you adopt be you in my place the cavalier : -lrb- smirk more knowingly than ever -- or seem to -rrb- bellew : preposterous quite absurd -- and just what i might have expect carry she off indeed no no we be not live in you bad old glorious day when a maid 's no be generally take to mean yes -- or when a lover might swing he reluctant mistress up to he saddle-bow and ride off with she leave the world far behind to-day it be all change -- sadly change you age be a wild age a violent age but in some respects perhaps a rather glorious age you advice be singularly characteristic and of course quite impossible alas -- carry she off indeed hereupon bellew sigh and turn away light he pipe which have go out and bury himself in the newspaper chapter xxi _ of shoe and ship and seal wax and the third finger of the left hand _ so bellew take up the paper the house be very quiet for small porge be deep in the vexatious rule of the multiplication table and something he call jogafrey anthea be out as usual and miss priscillum be busy with she numerous household duty thus the brooding silence be unbroken save for the occasional murmur of a voice the jingle of the housekeeping key and the quick light tap tap of miss priscillum 's stick therefore bellew read the paper and let it be understand that he regard the daily news-sheet as the last resource of the utterly bore now presently as he glance over the paper with a negative interest he eye be attract by a long paragraph beginning : at st george 's hanover square by the right reverend the bishop of -- silvium cecile marchmont to he grace the duke of ryde kg kcb below follow a full true and particular account of the ceremony which it seem have be grace by royalty george bellew read it half way through and -- yawn -- positively and actually yawn and thereafter laugh and so i have be in arcadium -- only three week i have know anthea only twenty-one day a ridiculously short time as time go -- in any other place but arcadium -- and yet sufficient to lay for ever the -- er -- haunt spectre of the might have be lord what a preposterous ass i be baxter be quite right -- utterly and completely right now let we suppose that this paragraph have read : ` to-day at st george 's hanover square anthea devine to -- ' no no -- confound it and bellew crumple up the paper and toss it into a distant corner i wonder what baxter would think of I now -- good old faithful john the haunting spectre of the might have be -- what a preposterous ass -- what a monumental idiot i be posterous ass be not a very pretty word uncle porge -- or continental idiot say a voice behind he and turn he behold small porge somewhat stain and bespatter with ink who shake a reprove head at he true nephew he answer but they be sometimes very apt and in this instance particularly so small porge draw near and seat himself upon the arm of bellew 's chair look at he adopt uncle long and steadfastly uncle porge say he at last you never tell story do you -- i mean -- lie you know indeed i hope not porge -- why do you ask well -- 'cause my auntie anthea 's ` fraid you do be she -- hum -- why when she come to ` tuck I up ' last night she sit down on my bed a ' talk to I a long time a ' she sigh a lot a ' say she be ` fraid i do not care for she any more -- which be awful ' silly you know yes of course nod bellew a ' then she ask I why i be so fond of you a ' i say 'cause you be my uncle porge that i find under a hedge a ' then she get more angrier than ever a ' say she wish i would leave you under the hedge -- do she my porge yes she say she wish she would never see you a ' she

go away to marry a lady in london a ' that she be very glad 'cause then we should all be happy again she s ` pose so she kiss I again a ' tuck I up a ' go away but it be a long long time before i

eye do you mean you would take I to sea with you -- a ' my auntie anthea of course you do not suppose i would leave either of you behind if i could help it do you we would all sail away together -- wherever you wish do you mean say small porge in a suddenly awed voice that it be -- you ship -- you very own oh yes - but -- do you know uncle porge you do not look as though you have a ship -- for you very own somehow do not i you see a ship be such a very big thing for one man to have for he very own self a ' have it get mast a ' funnel a ' anchor lot of 'em then please when will you take I a

in book -- shall we aye aye shipmate nod bellew again then please uncle por -- i mean captain -- what shall we name we ship -- i mean the new name well my porge -- i mean of course shipmate -- i rather think of call she -- hallo -- why here be the sergeant sure enough there be sergeant appleby sit under the shade of king arthur -- but who rise and stand at attention as they come up why sergeant how be you say bellew grip the veteran 's hand you be half a hour before you usual time to-day -- nothing wrong i hope nothing wrong mr bellew sir -- i thank you no nothing wrong but this -- be a -- memorable occasion sir may i trouble you to -- step behind the tree with I -- for half a moment sir suit the action to the word the sergeant lead bellew to the other side of the tree and there screen from view of the house he with a sudden jerky movement produce a very small leather case from he pocket which he hand to bellew not good enough -- for such a woman -- i know but the best i could afford sir say the sergeant appear profoundly interested in the leaf overhead while bellew open the very small box why -- it be very handsome sergeant say bellew make the jewel sparkle in the sun -- anyone might be proud of such a ring why it do look pretty tidy -- in the shop sir -- to I and peterday my comrade have a sharp eye and a sound judgment in most thing sir -- and we take -- a deal of trouble in select it but now -- when it come to -- give it to _ she _ -- why it look -- uncommon small and mean sir a ruby and two diamond and very fine stone too sergeant so i make so bold as to -- come here sir pursue the sergeant still interested in the foliage above half a hour afore my usual time -- to ask you sir -- if you would so far oblige I -- as to -- hand it to she -- when i be go sir lord no say bellew smile and shake he head not on you life sergeant why man it would lose half its value in she eye if any other than you give it to she no sergeant you must hand it to she yourself and what be more you must slip it upon she finger good lord sir exclaim the sergeant i could never do that oh yes you could not unless you -- stand by I -- a force in reserve as it be sir i 'll do that willingly sergeant then -- p ` rap sir -- you might happen to know -- which finger the third finger of the left hand i believe sergeant here 's aunt priscillum now say small porge at this juncture lord exclaim the sergeant and sixteen minute afore she usual time yes -- there be miss priscillum she basket of sew upon she arm as gentle as unruffled as placid as usual and yet it be probable that she divine something from they very attitude for there be a light in she eye and she cheek seem more delicately pink than be they wont thus as she come toward they under the ancient apple-tree despite she stick and she white hair she look even younger and more girlish than ever at least the sergeant seem to think so for as he meet she look he face grow suddenly radiant while a slow flush creep up under the tan of he cheek and the solitary hand he hold out to she tremble a little for all its size and strength miss priscillum mam -- he say and stop miss priscillum he begin again and pause once more why -- sergeant she exclaim though it be a very soft little exclamation indeed -- for she hand still rest in he and so she could feel the quiver of the strong finger why -- sergeant miss priscillum -- say he begin all over again but with no better success goodness I exclaim miss priscillum i do believe he be go to forget to enquire about the peach peach repeat the sergeant yes priscillum and -- why 'cause he be bring you a ring small porge break in a very handsome ring you know aunt priscillum -- all diamond a ' jewel a ' he want you to please let he put it on you finger -- if you do not mind and -- here it be say the sergeant and give it into she hand miss priscillum stand very silent and very still look down at the glittering gem then all at once she eye fill and a slow wave of color dye she cheek : oh sergeant she say very softly oh sergeant i be only a poor old woman -- with a lame foot and i be a poor old soldier -- with only one arm priscillum you be the strongest and gentlest and bravest soldier in all the world i think she answer and you priscillum be the sweetest and most beautiful _ woman _ in the world i _ know _ and so -- i have love you all these year and -- never dare to tell you so because of my -- one arm why then say miss priscillum smile up at he through she tear if you do -- really -- think that -- why -- it be this finger sergeant so the sergeant very clumsily perhaps because he have but the one hand slip the ring upon the finger in question and porge big and small turn to glance back as they go upon they way see that he still hold that small white hand press close to he lip chapter xxii _ come event cast they shadow before _ i s ` pose they 'll be marry each other one of these fine day say small porge as they cross the meadow side by side yes i expect so shipmate nod bellew and may they live long and die happy say i aye aye captain -- a ' amen return small porge now as they go conversing of marriage and ship and the wonder and marvel of foreign land -- they meet with adam who stare up at the sky and mutter to himself and frowned and shake he head good arternoon mr belloo sir -- a ' master georgy well adam how be the hop ` op sir -- there never be such ` op -- no not in all kent sir all i be wishin ' be that they be all safe pick a ' gather w ` ot do you make o ' they cloud sir -- over there -- jest over the p ` int o ' the oast-house bellew turn and cast a comprehensive sailor-like glance in the direction indicate rain adam and wind -- and plenty of it say he ah so i think sir -- drive storm and thrashing tempest well adam well sir -- p ` rap you have never see w ` ot driving rain a ' rage wind can do among the ` op-bines sir all i wish be that they ` op be all safe pick a ' gather sir and adam stride off with he eye still turn heaven-ward and shake he head like some great bird of ill-omen so the afternoon wear away to evening and with evening come anthea but a very grave-eyed troubled anthea who sit at the tea-table silent and preoccupy -- in so much that small porge openly wonder while miss priscillum watch over she wistful and tender thus tea which be wont to be the merriest meal of the day be but the pale ghost of what it should have be despite small porge ' flow of conversation -lrb- when not impede by bread and jam -rrb- and bellew 's tactful effort now while he talk light-heartedly keep carefully to generality he notice two thing -- one be that anthea make but a pretence at eating and the second that though she utter a word now and then yet she eye persistently avoid he thus he for one be relieve when tea be over and as he rise from the table he determine despite the unpropitious look of thing to end the suspense one way or another and speak to anthea just so soon as she should be alone but here again he be balk and disappoint for when small porge come to bid he good-night as usual he learn that auntie anthea have already go to bed she say it be a head-ache say small porge but i ` speck it be the hop really you know the hop my porge she be worry about they -- she be ` fraid of a storm like adam be a ' when she worry -- i worry oh uncle porge -- if only my prayer can bring the money moon -- soon you know -- very soon if they do not bring it in a day or two -- ` fraid i shall wake up one fine morning a ' find i have worry a ' worried myself into a old man never fear shipmate say bellew in he most nautical manner ` all 's well that end well ' -- a-low and aloft all 's a-taunto so just take a turn at the lee brace and keep you weather eye lift for you may be sure of this -- if the storm do come -- it will bring the money moon with it then have bid small porge a cheery good-night -- bellew go out to walk among the rose and as he walk he watch the fly wrack of cloud above he head and listen to the wind that moan in fitful gust wherefore have learn in he many travels to read and interpret such natural sign and omen he shake he head and mutter to himself -- even as adam have do before he presently he wander back into the house and fill he pipe go to hold communion with he friend -- the cavalier and thus it be that have ensconce himself in the great elbow-chair and raise he eye to the picture he espy a letter tuck into the frame thereof look closer he see that it be direct to himself he take it down and after a momentary hesitation break the seal and read : miss devine present she compliment to mr bellew and regret to say that owe to unforeseen circumstance she beg that he will provide himself with other quarter at the expiration of the month be the twenty-third inst bellew read the line slowly twice over then folding the note very carefully put it into he pocket and stand for a long time stare at nothing in particular at length he lift he head and look up into the smile eye of the cavalier above the mantel sir say he very gravely it would almost seem that you be in the right of it -- that yours be the best method after all then he knock the ash from he pipe and go slowly and heavily up-stair to bed it be a long time before he fall asleep but he do so at last for insomnia be a demon who rarely find he way into arcadium but all at once he be awake again -- broad awake and stare into the dark for a thousand voice seem to be scream in he ear and eager hand be shake and pluck at window and lattice he start up and then he know that the storm be upon they at last in all its fury -- rain and a mighty wind -- a howling rage tempest yes a great and mighty wind be abroad -- it shriek under the eaves it boom and bellow in the chimney and roar away to carry destruction among the distant wood while the rain beat hiss against the window-panes surely in all its many year the old house of dapplemere have seldom bear the brunt of such a storm so wild -- so fierce and pitiless and lie there upon he bed listen to the uproar and tumult bellew must need think of she who have once say : we be place all we hope this year upon the hop chapter xxiii _ how small porge in he hour of need be desert by he uncle _ ruin sir -- do for -- lord love I they be not worth the trouble o gatherin '

together they enter the stable and together they harness the mare which do stay not for breakfast bellew mount the driver 's seat and with adam beside he drive rapidly away but small porge have see these preparation and now come run all eagerness but ere he could reach the yard bellew be out of ear-shot so there stand small porge a desolate little figure watch the rapid course of the dogcart until it have vanish over the brow of the hill and then all at once the tear well up into he eye hot and scalding and a great sob burst from he for it seem to he that he beloved uncle porge have fail he at the crucial moment -- have leave he solitary just when he need he most thus small porge give way to he grief hide in the very darkest corner of the stable whither he have retire lest any should observe he weakness until have once more gain command of himself and wipe away he tear with he small and dingy pocket-handkerchief he slowly re-cross the yard and enter the house go to look for he

once more baxter depart and while he be go bellew begin to pack -- that be to say he bundle coat and trousers shirt and boot into a portmanteau in a way that would have wring baxter 's heart could he have see which do bellew open the black bag glance inside shut it again and light he pipe stretch himself out upon a ottoman and immediately become plunge in think so lose be he indeed that baxter upon he return be necessitate to emit three distinct cough -- -lrb- the most perfectly proper and gentleman-like cough in the world -rrb- ere bellew be aware of he presence oh -- that you baxter say he sit up back so soon the car be at the door sir the car -- ah yes to be sure -- baxter sir what should you say if i tell you -- bellew pause to strike a match break it try another break that and finally put he pipe back into he pocket very conscious the while of baxter 's steady though perfectly respectful regard baxter say he again sir say baxter what should you say if i tell you that i be in love -- at last baxter -- head over ear -- hopelessly -- irretrievably say sir -- why i should say -- indeed sir what should you say pursued bellew stare thoughtfully down at the rug under he foot if i tell you that i be so very much in love that i be positively afraid to -- tell she so i should say -- very remarkable sir bellew take out he pipe again look at it very much as if he have never see such a thing before and lay it down upon the mantelpiece baxter say he kindly understand that i be speak to you as -- er -- man to man -- as my father 's old and trust servant and my early boy-hood 's only friend sit down john thank you master george sir i wish to -- confess to you john that -- er -- regard the -- er -- haunt spectre of the might have be -- you be entirely in the right at that time i know no more the meaning of the -- er -- the word john -- mean the word -- love master george precisely i know no more about it than -- that table but during these latter day i have begin to understand and -- er -- the fact of the matter be -- i be -- i be fairly -- up against it john here baxter who have be watch he with he quick sharp eye nod he head solemnly : master george say he speak as you father 's old servant and you boyhood 's friend -- i be afraid you be bellew take a turn up and down the room and then pause in front of baxter -lrb- who have rise also as a matter of course -rrb- he suddenly lay he two hand upon he valet 's shoulder baxter say he you 'll remember that after my mother die my father be always too busy pile up he million to give much time or think to I and i should have be a very lonely small boy if it have not be for you john baxter i be often ` up against it ' in those day john and you be always ready to help and advise I -- but now -- well from the look of thing i be rather afraid that i must stay ` up against it ' -- that the game be lose already john but which ever way fate decide -- win or lose -- i be glad -- yes very glad to have learn the true meaning of -- the word john master george sir -- there be a poet once -- tennyson i think who say -- ` tis better to have love and lose than never to have love at all ' and i know -- that he be -- right many year ago -- before you be bear master george i loved -- and lose and that be how i know but i hope that fortune will be kinder to you indeed i do thank you john -- though i do not see why she should be and bellew stand stare down at the rug again till arouse by baxter 's cough : pray sir what be you order the car be wait downstairs order -- why -- er -- pack you grip baxter i shall take you with I this time into arcadium baxter for how long sir probably a week very good sir it be now half-past three i must be back in dapplemere at eight take you time -- i 'll go down to look at the machine just lock the place up and -- er -- do not forget the black bag some ten minute later the great racing car set out on its journey with bellew at the wheel and baxter beside he with the black bag hold firmly upon he knee they process be necessarily slow at first on account of the crowded thoroughfare but every now and then the long low car would shoot forward through some gap in the traffic grazing the hub of bus-wheel dodge hansom shave sudden corner in a apparently reckless manner but baxter with he hand always upon the black leather bag sit calm and unruffled since he know by long experience that bellew 's eye be quick and true and he hand firm and sure upon the wheel over westminster bridge and along the old kent road they speed now fast now slow -- thread a tortuous and difficult way amid the myriad vehicle and so betime they reach blackheath and now the powerful machine hum over that ancient road that have aforetime shake to the tread of stalwart roman legionary -- up shooter 's hill and down -- and so into the open country and ever as they go they talk and not as master and servant but as between man and man -- wherefore baxter the valet become merged and lose in baxter the human -- the honest john of the old day -- a gray haired kindly-eyed middle-aged cosmopolitan who listen to and look at young alcide beside he as if he have indeed be the master george of year ago so you see john if all thing _ do _ go well with I we should probably take a trip to the mediterranean in the -- ` silvium ' of course master george yes though -- er -- i have decide to change she name john ah -- very natural -- under the circumstance master george say honest john he eye twinkle slyly as he speak now if i might suggest a new name it would be hard to find a more original one than ` the haunting spectre of the -- bosh john -- there never be such a thing you be quite right as i say before and -- by heaven -- potato sack eh -- what -- potato sack master george they have be climb a long wind ascent but now have reach the top of the hill they overtake a great lumbering market cart or wain pile high with sack of potato and drive by a extremely surly-faced man in a smock-frock hallo there cry bellew slow up how much for one of you potato-sack get out now growl the surly-faced man in a tone as surly as he look can not ye see as they be all occipied well -- empty one get out now repeat the man scowling blacker than ever i 'll give you a sovereign for one now do not ye try to come none o ' you joke wus ' I young feller growl the carter sovereign -- bah -- show we here it be say bellew hold up the coin in question catch and with the word he toss it up to the carter who catch it very dexterously look at it bite it rub it on he sleeve ring it upon the foot-board of he waggon bit it again and finally pocket it it be a go sir he nod he scowl vanish as by magic and as he speak he turn seize the nearest sack and forthwith send a cascade of potato roll and bound all over the road which do he fold up the sack and hand it down to bellew who thrust it under the seat nod and throw in the clutch set off down the road but long after the car have hum itself out of sight and the dust of its go have subside the carter sit stare after it -- open-mouthed if baxter wonder at this purchase he say nothing only he bent he gaze thoughtfully upon the black leather bag that he hold upon he knee on they speed between fragrant hedge under whisper tree past lonely cottage and farm-house past gate and field and wood until the sun grow low at last bellew stop the automobile at a place where a narrow lane or cart track branch off from the high road and wind away between great tree i leave you here say he as he spring from the car this be dapplemere -- the farmhouse lie over the up-land yonder though you can not see it because of the tree be it far master george about half a mile here be the bag sir but -- do you think it be -- quite safe -- safe john under the circumstance master george i think it would be advisable to -- to take this with you and he hold out a small revolver bellew laugh and shake he head such thing be not necessary -- here in arcadium john -- besides i have my stick so good-bye for the present you 'll stay at the ` king 's head ' -- remember good-night master george sir goodnight and good fortune go with you thank you say bellew and reach out he hand i think we 'll shake on that john so they clasp hand and bellew turn and set off along the grassy lane and presently as he go he hear the hum of the car grow rapidly fainter and fainter until it be lose in the quiet of the evening chapter xxv _ the conspirator _ the shadow be creep down and evening be approach as bellew take he way along that wind lane that lead to the house of dapplemere have there be anyone to see -lrb- which there be not -rrb- they might have notice something almost furtive in he manner of approach for he walk always under the tree where the shadow lay thickest and pause once or twice to look about he warily be come within sight of the house he turn aside and force he way through a gap in the hedge come by a roundabout course to the farm-yard here after some search he discover a spade the which -lrb- have discard he stick -rrb- he take upon he shoulder and with the black leather bag tuck under he arm cross the paddock with the same degree of caution and so at last reach the orchard on he go always in the shadow until at length he pause beneath the mighty knotted branch of king arthur never do conspirator glance about he with sharper eye or hearken with keener ear than do george bellew -- or conspirator no one where he now stand beneath the protect shadow of king arthur -- or conspirator no two as have unfold the potato sack he open the black leather bag the moon be rise broad and yellow but it be low as yet and king arthur stand in impenetrable gloom -- as any other thorough-going self-respecting conspirator should and now all at once from this particular patch of shadow there come a sudden sound -- a rush sound -- a chink clinking metallic sound and thereafter a crisp rustling that be not the rustling of ordinary paper and now conspirator no one rise and tie the mouth of the sack with string he have bring with he for the purpose and set down the sack bulky now and heavy by conspirator no two take up the spade and begin to dig and in a while have make a excavation not very deep to be sure but sufficient to he purpose he deposit the sack within cover it with soil tread it down and replace the tear sod carefully pat it down with the flat of he spade which thing accomplish conspirator no one wipe he brow and step forth of the shadow consult he watch with anxious eye and thereupon smile -- surely a singularly please smile for the lip of a arch-conspirator to wear thereafter he take up the black bag empty now shoulder the spade and set off keep once more in the shadow leave conspirator no two to guard they guilty secret now as conspirator no one go he shady way he keep he look direct towards the rise moon and thus he almost run into one who also stand amid the shadow and whose gaze be likewise fix upon the moon ah -- mr bellew exclaim a drawling voice and squire cassili turn to regard he with he usual supercilious smile indeed squire cassili seem to be even more self-satisfied and smile than ordinary to-night -- or at least bellew imagine so you be still agriculturally inclined i see say mr cassili nod towards the spade though it be rather a queer time to choose for digging be not it not at all sir -- not at all return bellew solemnly the moon be very nearly at the full you will perceive well sir -- and what of that when the moon be at the full or nearly so i generally dig sir -- that be to say circumstance permit really say mr cassili begin to caress he moustache it seem to I that you have very -- ah -- peculiar taste mr bellew that be because you have probably never experience the fierce joy of moon-light digging sir no mr bellew -- digging -- as a recreation have never appeal to I at any time then sir say bellew shake he head permit I to tell you that you have miss a great deal have i the time i should be delighted to explain to you exactly how much as it be -- allow I to wish you a very good evening mr cassili smile and he tooth seem to gleam whiter and sharper than ever in the moon-light : would not it be rather more apropo if you say -- ` good-bye ' mr bellew he enquire you be leave dapplemere shortly i understand -- be not you why sir return bellew grave and imperturbable as ever -- it all depend depend -- upon what may i ask the moon sir the moon precisely and pray -- what can the moon have to do with you departure a great deal more than you would think -- sir have i the time i should be delighted to explain to you exactly how much as it be -- permit I to wish you a very -- good evening say which bellew nod affably and shoulder he spade go upon he way and still he walk in the shadow and still he gaze upon the moon but now he thick brow be gather in a frown and he be wonder just why cassilis should chance to be here to-night and what he confident air and the general assurance of he manner might portend above all he be wonder how mr cassili come to be aware of he own impending departure and so at last he come to the rick-yard -- full of increase doubt and misgiving chapter xxvi _ how the money moon rise _ evening have deepen into night -- a night of ineffable calm a night of a all pervade quietude a horse snort in the stable nearby a dog bark in the distance but these sound serve only to render the silence the more profound by contrast it be indeed a night wherein pixie and elf and goblin and fairy might weave they magic spell a night wherein tired humanity dream those dream that seem so hopelessly impossible by day and over all the moon rise high and higher in solemn majesty fill the world with she pale loveliness and brooding over it like the gentle goddess she be even the distant dog seem to feel something of all this for after a futile bark or two he give it up altogether and be hear no more and bellew gaze up at luna 's pale serenity smile and nod -- as much as to say you 'll do and so stand lean upon he spade listen to : that deep hush which seem a sigh breathe by earth to listen sky now all at once upon this quietude there rise a voice up-raised in fervent supplication wherefore tread very softly bellew come and peep round the hay-rick behold small porge upon he knee he be equip for travel and the peril of the road for beside he lay a stick and tie to this stick be a bundle that bulge with he most cherish possession he cheek be wet with great tear that glisten in the moon-beam but he weep with eye tight shut and with he small hand clasp close together and thus he speak -- albeit much shake and hinder by sob : i s ` pose you think i bother you a awful lot dear lord -- a ' so i do but you have not send the money moon yet you see a ' now my auntie anthea 's get to leave dapplemere -- if i do not find the fortune for she soon i know i be cry a lot a ' real man do

sometimes i be ` fraid my prayer can not quite manage to get up to you 'cause of the cloud a ' wind but to-night there be not any so if they do reach you please -- oh please let I find the fortune and if you do not mind let -- _ he _ come back to I dear lord -- i mean my uncle porge you know a ' now -- that be all dear lord so amen as the prayer end bellew steal back and come to the gate of the rick-yard lean there wait and presently as he watch he see a small figure emerge from behind the big hay-stack and come stride manfully toward he he bundle upon he shoulder and with the moon bright in he curl but all at once small porge see he and stop and the stick and bundle fall to the ground and lay neglect why -- my porge say bellew a trifle huskily perhaps why shipmate and he hold out he hand then small porge utter a cry and come run and next moment big porge have he in he arm oh uncle porge -- then you -- have come back to I aye aye shipmate why then -- my prayer _ do _ reach why of course -- prayer always reach my porge then oh -- do you s ` pose i shall find the fortune too not a doubt of it -- just look at the moon the -- moon why have not you notice how -- er -- peculiar it

-- it be -- the -- but here small porge choke suddenly and could only look he question the money moon -- oh yes -- there she be at last my porge take a good look at she i do not suppose we shall ever see another small porge stand very still and gaze up at the moon 's broad yellow disc and as he look the tear well up in he eye again and a great sob break from he i be so -- glad he whisper so -- awful -- glad then suddenly he dash away he tear and slip he small tremble hand into bellew 's quick uncle porge say he mr grime be come to-night you know -- a ' we must find the money in time where shall we look first well i guess the orchard will do -- to start with then let 's go -- now but we shall need a couple of spade shipmate oh -- must we dig yes -- i fancy that be a -- er -- digging

and i 'll just -- er -- prod you know ready -- then heave ahead shipmate so they set out hand in hand spade and pitch-fork on shoulder and presently be come to the orchard it be a awful big place to dig up a fortune in say small porge glance about where do you s ` pose we would better begin well shipmate between you and I and the pitch-fork here i rather fancy ` king arthur ' know more than most people would think any way we 'll try he you dig on that side and i 'll prod on this say which bellew point to a certain spot where the grass look somewhat uneven and peculiarly bumpy and bidding small porge get to work go round to the other side of the great tree be there he take out he pipe purely from force of habit and stand with it clench in he tooth listen to the scrape of small porge ' spade presently he hear a cry a panting breathless cry but full of a joy unspeakable : i have get it -- oh uncle porge -- i have find it small porge be down upon he knee pull and tug at a sack he have partially unearth and which with bellew 's aid he drag forth into the moonlight in the twinkling of a eye the string be cut and plunge in a hand small porge bring up a fistful of shine sovereign and among they a crumpled banknote it be all right uncle porge he nod he voice all of a quaver it be all right now -- i have find the fortune i have pray for -- gold you know a ' banknote -- in a sack everything will be all right again now and while he speak he rise to he foot and lift the sack with a effort swing it across he shoulder and set off toward the house be it heavy shipmate awful heavy he pant but i do not mind that -- it be gold you see but as they cross the rose-garden bellew lay a restrain hand upon he shoulder porge say he where be you auntie anthea in the drawing-room wait for mr grime then come this way and turn bellew lead small porge up and along the terrace now my porge he admonish he when we come to the drawing-room window -- they be open you see -- i want you to hide with I in the shadow and wait until i give you the word -- aye aye captain pant small porge when i say ` heave ahead shipmate ' -- why then you will take you treasure upon you back and march straight into the room -- you understand aye aye captain why then -- come on and -- mum 's the word very cautiously they approach the long french window and pause in the shadow of a great rose-bush near-by from where he stand bellew could see anthea and miss priscillum and between they sprawl in a easy chair be grime while adam hat in hand scowl in the background all i can say be -- as i be very sorry for ye miss anthea grime be say ah that i be but glad as you have take it so well -- no cry nor nonsense here he turn to look at miss priscillum whose everlasting sewing have fall to she foot and lay there all unnoticed while she tearful eye be fix upon anthea standing white-faced beside she and when -- when shall ye be ready to -- leave to -- vacate dapplemere miss anthea grime go on not as i mean to ` urry you mind -- only i should like you to -- name a day now as bellew watch he see anthea 's lip move but no sound come miss priscillum saw also and catch the nerveless hand draw it to she

the fortune for you -- i have find the money i prayed for -- here it be oh -- here it be the sack fall jingle to the floor and next moment he have pour a heap of shine gold and crumpled banknote at anthea 's foot for a moment no one move then with a strange hoarse cry adam have fling himself down upon he knee and catch up a great handful of the gold then while miss priscillum sob with she arm about small porge and anthea stare down at the treasure wide-eyed and with she hand press down upon she heart adam give a sudden great laugh and spring up come run out through the window never spy

turn away and tread a familiar path find himself beneath the shadow of king arthur therefore he sit down and light he pipe stare up at the glory of the full-orbed moon happiness say he speak he thought aloud ` happiness shall come ride astride the full moon ' now -- i wonder chapter xxvii _ in which be verify the adage of the cup and the lip _ now as he sit thus plunge in thought he hear the voice of one who approach intone a familiar chant or refrain -- the voice be harsh albeit not unmusical and the word of the chant be these : when i be dead diddle diddle as well may hap bury I deep

the house mr bellew he start and turn saw anthea standing amid she rose for a moment they look upon each other in silence as though each dread to speak then suddenly she turn and break a great rise from its stem and stand twist it between she finger why do you -- do it she ask do it he repeat i mean the -- fortune georgy tell I -- how you -- help he to find it and i -- _ know _ how it come there

have never find it say bellew and i could not let that happen could i anthea do not answer and he see that she eye be very bright in the shadow of she lash though she keep they lower to the rose in she finger anthea say he suddenly and reach out he hand to she but she start and draw from he touch do not she say speak almost in a whisper do not touch I oh i know you have pay off the mortgage -- you have buy back my home for I as you buy back my furniture why -- why i be nothing to you or you to I -- why have you lay I under this obligation -- you know i can never hope to return you money --

repeat but bellew only shake he head and he chin seem rather more prominent than usual as he answer : tell I that you love I or that you hate I -- whichever it be but until you do -- you -- hurt I say she and then as he finger relax -- with a sudden passionate cry she have break free but even so he have catch and sweep she up in he arm and hold she close against he breast and now feel the hopelessness of further struggle she lay passive while she eye flame up into he and he eye look down into hers she long thick hair have come loose and now with a sudden quick gesture she draw it across she face veil it from he wherefore he stoop he head above those lustrous tress anthea he murmur and the masterful voice be strangely hesitating and the masterful arm about she be wonderfully gentle anthea -- do you -- love I lower he bent and lower until he lip touch she hair until beneath that fragrant veil he mouth seek and find hers and in that breathless moment he feel they quiver responsive to he caress and then he have set she down she be free and he be look at she with a new-found radiance in he eye anthea he say wonderingly why then -- you do -- but as he speak she hide she face in she hand anthea he repeat oh she whisper i -- hate you -- despise you oh you shall be pay back -- every penny -- every farthing and -- very soon next week -- i marry mr cassili and so she turn and flee away and leave he stand there amid the rose chapter xxviii _ which tell how bellew leave dapplemere in the dawn _ far in the east a gray streak mark the advent of another day and upon all thing be a solemn hush a great and awful stillness that be like the stillness of death the earth be a place of gloom and mist where spectral shadow writhe and twist and flit under a frown heaven and out of the gloom there come a breath sharp and damp and exceed chill therefore as bellew gaze down from the frown heaven to the gloom of earth below with its ever-moving misty shape he shiver involuntarily in another hour it would be day and with the day the gate of arcadium would open for he departure and he must go forth to become once more a wanderer go up and down and to and fro in the world until he course be run and yet it be worth have live for this one golden month and in all he wanderings need must he carry with he the memory of she who have teach he how deep and high how wide and infinitely far-reaching that thing call love may really be and -- porge -- dear quaint small porge where under heaven could he ever find again such utter faith such pure unaffected loyalty and devotion as throbbed within that small warm heart how could he ever bid good-bye to loving eager little small porge and then there be miss priscillum and the strong gentle sergeant and peterday and sturdy adam and prudence and the rosy-cheeked maid how well they all suit this wonderful arcadium yes indeed he and he only have be out of place and so -- he must go -- back to the every-day matter-of-fact world but how could he ever say good-bye to faithful loving small porge far in the east the gray streak have brighten and broaden and be already tinge with a faint pink that deepen and deepen as he watch bellew have see the glory of many a sun-rise in diver wild place of the earth and hitherto have always feel deep within he the responsive thrill the exhilaration of hope new bear and joyful expectation of the great unknown future but now he watch the vary hue of pink and scarlet and saffron and gold with gloomy brow and sombre eye now presently the black-bird who live in the apple-tree beneath he window -lrb- the tree of the inquisitive turn of mind -rrb- this black-bird fellow open a drowsy eye must need give vent to a croak very hoarse and feeble then -lrb- apparently have yawn prodigiously and stretch himself wing and leg -rrb- he try a couple of note -- in a hesitate tentative sort of fashion shake himself -- repeat the two note -- try three find they mellower and more what the wait world very justly expect of he grow more confident try four try five -- grow perfectly assure and so burst forth into the full golden melody of he morning song then bellew lean out from he casement as the first bright beam of the rise sun gilded the top-most leaf of the tree thus apostrophise the unseen singer : i suppose you will be pipe away down in you tree there old fellow long after arcadium have fade out of my life well it will be only natural and perfectly right of course -- she will be here and may perhaps stop to listen to you now if somehow you could manage to compose for I a song of memory some evening when i be go -- some evening when she happen to be sit idle and watch the moon rise over the upland yonder if at such a time you could just manage to remind she of -- I why -- i would thank you and so -- good-bye old fellow say which bellew turn from the window and take up a certain bulge be-strapped portmanteau while the black-bird -lrb- have evidently hearken to he request with much grave attention -rrb- fall a singing more gloriously than ever meanwhile bellew descend the great wide stair soft of foot and cautious of step yet pause once to look towards a certain closed door and so presently let himself quietly out into the dawn the dew sparkle in the grass it hang in glitter jewel from every leaf and twig while now and then a shine drop would fall upon he as he pass like a great tear now as he reach the orchard up rise the sun in all he majesty fill the world with the splendor of he come -- before whose kindly beam the skulk mist and shadow shrink affrighted and flee utterly away this morning king arthur wear he grandest robe of state for he mantle of green be thick sewn with a myriad flaming gem very different he look from that dark shroud giant who have so lately be conspirator no two yet perhaps for this very reason bellew pause to lay a hand upon he mighty rugged hole and do so turn and look back at the house of dapplemere and truly never have the old house seem so beautiful so quaint and peaceful as now it be every stone and beam have become familiar and as he look seem to find a individuality of its own the very lattices seem to look back at he like so many wistful eye therefore george bellew american citizen millionaire traveller explorer and -- lover sigh as he turn away -- sigh as he stride on through the green and golden morning and resolutely -- look back no more chapter xxix _ of the moon 's message to small porge and how he tell it to bellew -- in a whisper _ bellew walk on at a good pace with he back turn resolutely towards the house of dapplemere and thus as he swing into that narrow grassy lane that wind away between tree he be much surprised to hear a distant hail face sharp about he espy a diminutive figure whose small leg trot very fast and whose small fist wave a weather-beaten cap bellew 's first impulse be to turn and run but bellew rarely act on impulse therefore he set down the bulge portmanteau seat himself upon it and take out pipe and tobacco wait for he pursuer to come up oh uncle porge pant a voice you do walk so awful fast a ' i call a ' call but you never hear a ' now please -- where be you go go say bellew search through he pocket for a match go my porge why -- er -- for a stroll to be sure -- just a walk before breakfast you know but then -- why have you bring you bag bag repeat bellew stoop down to look at it why -- so -- i have please -- why persist small porge suddenly anxious why do you -- bring it well i expect it be to -- er -- to bear I company but how be it you be out so very early my porge why i could not sleep last night you know 'cause i keep on thinking and think ` bout the fortune so i get up -- in the middle of the night a ' dress myself a ' sit in the big chair by the window a ' look at the money moon a ' i stare at it a ' stare at it till a wonderful thing happen -- a ' what do you s ` pose i do not know well -- all at once while i stare up at it the moon change itself into a great big face but i do not mind a bit 'cause it be a very nice sort of face -- rather like a gnome 's face only without the beard you know a ' while i look at it it talk to I a ' it tell I a lot of thing -- a ' that be how i know that you be -- go away 'cause you be you know -- be not you why my porge say bellew fumble with he pipe why shipmate i -- since you ask I -- i be yes i be ` fraid the moon be right say small porge and turn away but bellew have see the stricken look in he eye therefore he take small porge in the circle of he big arm and hold he thus explain to he how that in this great world each of we must walk he appointed way and that there must and always will be parting but that also there must and always shall be meeting : and so my porge if we have to say ` good-bye ' now -- the sooner we shall meet again -- some day -- somewhere but small porge only sigh and shake he head in hopeless dejection do -- she -- know you be go -- i mean my auntie anthea oh yes she know porge then i s ` pose that be why she be cry so in the night -- cry yes -- she be cry a awful lot lately have not she last night -- when i

say she would never marry you if you be the last man in the world -- 'cause she ` spise you so -- and that would seem to -- settle it nod bellew gloomily so it be ` good-bye ' my porge we may as well shake hand now and get it over and bellew rise from the portmanteau and sighing hold out he hand oh -- but wait a minute cry small porge eagerly i have not tell you what the moon say to I last night -- ah -- to be sure we be forget that say bellew with a absent look and a trifle wearily why then -- please sit down again so i can speak into you ear 'cause what the moon tell I to tell you be a secret you know so perforce bellew re-seated himself upon he portmanteau and draw small porge close bent he head down to the anxious little face and so small porge tell he exactly what the moon have say and the moon 's message -lrb- whatever it be -rrb- seem to be very short and concise -lrb- as all really important message should be -rrb- but these few word have a wondrous and magical effect upon george bellew for a moment he stare wide-eyed at small porge like one awake from a dream then the gloom vanish from he brow and he spring to he foot and be upon he foot he smite he clenched fist down into the palm of he hand with a resounding smack by heaven he exclaim and take a turn to and fro across the width of the lane and see small porge watch he catch he suddenly up in he arm and hug he and the moon will be at the full tonight say he thereafter he sit he down upon he portmanteau again with small porge upon he knee and they talk confidentially together with they head very close together and in muffle tone when at last bellew rise he eye be bright and eager and he square chin prominent and grimly resolute so -- you quite understand my porge yes yes -- oh i understand where the little bridge span the brook -- the tree be thicker there aye aye captain then -- fare thee well shipmate goodbye my porge -- and remember so they clasp hand very solemnly big porge and small porge and turn each he appointed way the one up the other down the lane but lo as they go small porge ' tear be banish quite and bellew stride upon he way he head hold high he shoulder square like one in whom hope have be newborn chapter xxx _ how anthea give she promise _ and so -- he -- have really go miss priscillum sigh as she speak and look up from she needle-work to watch anthea who sit bite

touch he forehead with a square-ended finger and trudge away but anthea sit there very still with droop head and vacant eye and so it be do the irrevocable step have be take she have give she promise so now have choose she course she must follow it -- to the end for in arcadium it would seem that a promise be still a sacred thing now in a while lift she eye they encounter those of the smile cavalier above the mantel then as she look she stretch out she arm with a sudden yearning gesture : oh she whisper if i be only -- just a picture like you chapter xxxi _ which be the last be very properly the longest in the book _ in those benighted day when man go abroad case in steel and upon very slight provocation be wont to smite each other with axis and club to buffet and skewer each other with spear lance sword and diver other barbarous engine yet in that dark and doughty age ignorant though they be of all those smug maxim and excellent morality with which we be so happily bless -- even in that unhallowed day when the solemn tread of the policeman 's foot be all unknown -- they have evolve for themselves a code of rule whereby to govern they life and conduct amongst these it be tacitly agree upon and understand that a speak promise be a pledge and hold to be a very sacred thing and he who break faith commit all the cardinal sin indeed they law be very few and simple easily understand and well calculate to govern man 's conduct to he fellow in this day of ours ablaze with learning and culture -- veneer with a fine civilization we law be complex beyond all know and expression man regulate he conduct -- to they -- and be as virtuous and honest as the law compel he to be this be the age of money and therefore a irreverent age it be also the age of respectability -lrb- with a very large r -rrb- -- and the policeman 's bludgeon but in arcadium -- because it be a old-world place where life follow a even simple course where money be as scarce as roguery the old law still hold a promise once give be a sacred obligation and not to be set aside even the black-bird who live in the inquisitive apple tree understand and be aware of this it have be bear in he and have grow with he feather therefore -- though to be sure he have speak no promise sign no bond nor affix he mark to any agreement still he have nevertheless bear in mind a certain request prefer to he when the day be very young thus with a constancy of purpose worthy of all imitation he have give all he mind and think to the composition of a song with a new theme he have apply himself to it most industriously all day long and now as the sun begin to set he have at last corked it all out -- every note every quaver and trill and perch upon a look-out branch he keep he bold bright eye turn toward a certain rustic seat hard by utter a melodious note or two every now and then from pure impatience and presently sure enough he spy she for whom he wait -- the tall long limbed supple-waisted creature -- whose skin be pink and gold like the peach and apricot in the garden and with soft little ring of hair that would have make such a excellent lining to a nest from this strictly utilitarian point of view he have often admire she hair -lrb- have this black-bird fellow -rrb- as she pass to and fro among she flower or pause to look up at he and listen to he song or even sometimes to speak to he in she sweet low voice but to-day she seem to have forget he altogether she do not even glance he way indeed she walk with bent head and seem to keep she eye always upon the ground therefore the black-bird hop a little further along the branch and peer over to look down at she with first one round eye and then the other as she sink upon the seat near by and lean she head wearily against the great tree behind and thus he see upon the pint and gold of she cheek something that shine and twinkle like a drop of dew if the black-bird wonder at this and be incline to be curious he sturdily repress the weakness -- for here be the audience -- seat and wait -- all expectation for he to begin so without more ado he settle himself upon the bough lift he head stretch he throat and from he yellow bill pour forth a flood of golden melody as he burst forth into he song of memory and what a song it be -- so full of passionate entreaty of tender plead of haunting sweetness that as she listen the bright drop quiver upon she lash fall and be succeed by another and another nor do she attempt to check they or wipe they away only she sit and listen with she heavy head pillow against the great tree while the blackbird glance down at she every now and then with critical eye to mark the effect of some particularly difficult passage pipe surely as he have never do before until the listener 's proud face sink lower and lower and be at last hide in she hand see which the black-bird like the true artist he be fear a anti-climax very presently end he song with a long-drawn plaintive note but anthea sit there with she proud head bow low long after he have retire for the night and the sun go down and the shadow come creep stealthily about she and the moon begin to rise big and yellow over the up-land but anthea still sit there with she head once more rest wearily against king arthur watch the deepen shadow until she be rouse by small porge ' hand upon hers and he voice say : why -- i do believe you be cry auntie anthea a ' why be you here -- all alone a ' by yourself i be listen to the black-bird dear -- i never hear he sing quite so -- beautifully before but black-bird do not make people cry -- a ' i know you have be cry -- 'cause you sound -- all quivery you know do i georgy yes -- be it 'cause you feel -- lonely yes dear you have cry a awful lot lately auntie anthea have i dear yes -- a ' it -- worry I you know i be afraid i have be a great responsibility to you georgy dear say she with a rueful little laugh ` fraid you have but i don ' mind the ` sponsibility -- ` i 'll always take care of you you know nodded small porge sit down the better to get he arm protectingly about she while anthea stoop to kiss the top of he curly head i promise my uncle porge i would always take care of you a ' so i will yes dear uncle porge tell I -- never mind dear -- don ' let 's talk of -- he do you still -- hate he then auntie anthea hush dear -- it be very wrong to -- hate people yes a course it be then -- perhaps if you do not hate he any more -- you like he a bit -- jest a -- teeny bit you know why -- there be the clock striking half-past eight georgy yes i hear it -- but -- do you -- the teeniest bit oh can not you like he jest a bit -- for my sake auntie anthea i be always try to please you -- a ' i find you the fortune you know so now i want you to please I -- a ' tell I you like he -- for my sake but -- oh georgy dear -- you do not understand -- 'cause you see small porge continue after all i find he for you -- under a hedge you know -- ah -- why do you georgy dear we be so happy -- before -- he come -- but you could not have be you know you be not marry -- even then so you could not have be really happy you know say small porge shake he head why georgy -- what do you mean well uncle porge tell I that nobody can live happy -- ever after unless they be marry -- first so that be why i ` range for he to marry you so you could _ both _ be happy a ' all revelry a ' joy -- like the fairy tale you know but you see we be not in a fairy tale dear so i be afraid we must make the best of thing as they be and here she sigh again and rise come georgy it be much later than i think and quite time you be in bed dear all right auntie anthea -- only -- do not you think it be jest a bit -- cruel to send a boy to bed so very early a ' when the moon 's so big a ' everything look so -- frightfully fine ` side -- well what now she ask a little wearily as obedient to he plead gesture she sit down again why you have not answer my question yet you know what question say she not look at he ` bout my -- uncle porge but georgy -- i -- you do like he -- jest a bit -- do not you -- please small porge be stand before she as he wait for she answer but now see how she hesitate and avoid he eye he put one small hand beneath the dimple in she chin so that she be force to look at he you do please -- do not you he plead anthea hesitate but after all -- _ he _ be go and nobody could hear and small porge be so very small and who could resist the entreaty in he big wistful eye surely not anthea therefore with a sudden gesture of abandonment she lean forward in he embrace and rest she weary head against he manly small shoulder : yes she whisper jest as much as you like -- mr cassilis he whisper back yes a -- bit more -- jest a teeny bit more yes a -- lot more -- lot a ' lot -- ocean more yes the word be speak and have utter it anthea grow suddenly hot with shame and mightily angry with herself and would straightway have give the world to have it unsaid the more so as she feel small porge ' clasp tighten joyfully and look up fancy she read something like triumph in he look she draw away from he rather hastily and rise to she foot come say she speak now in a vastly different tone it must be get very late -- yes i s ` peck it 'll soon be nine o'clock now he nod then you ought to be in bed fast asleep instead of talk such -- nonsense out here so -- come along -- at once sir but can not i stay up -- jest a little while you see -- no you see it be such a -- magnif ` cent night it feel as though -- thing might happen do not be so silly well but it do you know what do you mean -- what thing well it feel -- gnomy to I i s ` peck there be lot of elf about -- hide in the shadow you know a ' peep at we there be not any elf -- or gnome say anthea petulantly for she be still furiously angry with herself but my uncle porge tell I -- oh cry anthea stamp she foot suddenly can not you talk of anyone or anything but -- he i be tired to death of he and he very name but i think you like he -- a awful lot a ' -- well i do not but you say -- never mind what i say it be time you be in bed asleep -- so come along -- at once sir so they go on through the orchard together very silently for small porge be incline to be indignant but much more inclined to be hurt thus they have not go so very far when he speak in a voice that he would have describe as -- quivery do not you think that you be -- just the teeniest bit -- cruel to I auntie anthea he enquire wistfully after i pray a ' pray till i find a fortune for you -- do not you please surely anthea be a creature of mood to-night for even while he speak she stop and turn and fall on she knee and catch he in she arm kiss he many time : yes -- yes dear i be hateful to you -- horrid to you but i do not mean to be there -- forgive I oh -- it be all right again now auntie anthea thank you i only think you be jest a bit -- hard 'cause it be such a -- magnif ` cent night be not it yes dear and perhaps there be gnome and pixie about anyhow we can pretend there be if you like as we use to -- oh will you that would be fine then please may i go with you -- as far as the brook we 'll wander you know -- i have never wander with you in the moonlight -- a ' i do love to hear the brook talk to itself -- so -- will you wander -- jest this once well say anthea hesitate it be very late -- nearly nine o ` clock yes but oh -- please do not forget that i find a fortune for you -- very well she smile just this once now as they go together hand in hand through the moonlight small porge talk very fast and very much at random while he eye bright and eager glance expectantly towards every patch of shadow -- doubtless in search of gnome and pixie but anthea see nothing of this hear nothing of the suppress excitement in he voice for she be think that by now mr cassili have read she letter -- that he might even then be on he way to dapplemere she even fancy once or twice that she could hear the gallop of he horse 's hoof and when he come he would want to -- kiss she why do you shiver so auntie anthea be you cold no dear well then why be you so quiet to I -- i have ask you a question -- three time have you dear i -- i be think what be the question i be ask you if you would be awful frightened s ` pose we do find a pixie -- or a gnome in the shadow a ' would you be so very awfully frighten if a gnome -- a great big one you know -- come jump out a ' -- run off with you -- should you no say anthea with another shiver no dear -- i think i should be -- rather glad of it should you auntie i be -- so awful glad you would not be frighten a course i do not s ` pose there be gnome -- i mean great big one -- really you know -- but there might be on a magnif ` cent night like this if you shiver again auntie you 'll have to take my coat i think i hear a horse gallop -- hush they have reach the stile by now the stile with the crooked lurk nail and she lean there a while to listen i be sure i hear something -- away there -- on the road i do not say small porge stoutly -- so take my hand please a ' let I ` sist you over the stile so they cross the stile and presently come to the brook that be the most impertinent brook in the world and here upon the little rustic bridge they stop to look down at the sparkle of the water and to listen to its merry voice yes indeed to-night it be as impertinent as ever laugh and chuckle to itself among the hollow and whisper scandalously in the shadow it seem to anthea that it be laugh at she -- mock and taunt she with -- the future and now amid the laughter be sob and tearful murmur and now again it seem to be the prophetic voice of old nannie : ` by force ye shall be woo and by force ye shall be wed and there be no man strong enough to do it but he as bear the tiger mark upon he ' the tiger mark alas how very far from the truth be poor old nannie 's dream after all the dream which anthea have very nearly believe in -- once or twice how foolish it have all be and yet even now -- anthea have be lean over the gurgle water while all this pass through she mind but now -- she start at the sound of a heavy foot-fall on the planking of the bridge behind she and -- in that same instant she be encircle by a powerful arm catch up in a strong embrace -- swing from she foot and bear away through the shadow of the little copse it be very dark in the wood but she know instinctively whose arm these be that hold she so close and carry she so easily -- away through the shadow of the wood -- away from the haunting hopeless dread of the future from which there have seem no chance or hope of escape and know all this she make no struggle and utter no word and now the tree thin out and from under she lash she see the face above she the thick black brow draw together -- the close set of the lip -- the grim prominence of the strong square chin and now they be in the road and now he have lift she into a automobile have spring in beside she and -- they be off glide swift and ever swifter under the shadow of the tree and still neither speak nor look at each other only she lean away from he against the cushion while he keep he frowning eye fix upon the road a-head and ever the great car fly onward faster and faster yet not so fast as the beating of she heart wherein shame and anger and fear and -- another feeling strove and fight for mastery but at last finding he so silent and impassive she must need steal a look at he beneath she lash he wear no hat and as she look upon he -- with he yellow hair he length of limb and he massive shoulder he might have be some fierce viking and she he captive take by strength of arm -- bear away by force -- by force and hereupon as the car hum over the smooth road it seem to find a voice -- a subtle mocking voice very like the voice of the brook -- that murmur to she over and over again : by force ye shall be woo and by force ye shall be wed the very tree whisper it as they pass and she heart throb in time to it : by force ye shall be woo and by force ye shall be wed so she lean as far from he as she might watch he with frightened eye while he frown ever upon the road in front and the car rock and sway with they go as they whirl onward through moonlight and through shadow faster and faster -- yet not so fast as the beating of she heart wherein be fear and shame and anger and -- another feeling but greatest of all now be fear could this be the placid soft-spoken gentleman she have know -- this man with the implacable eye and the brutal jaw who neither speak to nor look at she but frowned always at the road in front and so the fear grow and grow within she -- fear of the man whom she know -- and know not at all she clasp she hand nervously together watch he with dilate eye as the car slow down -- for the road make a sudden turn hereabouts and still he neither look at nor speak to she and therefore because she could bear the silence no longer she speak -- in a voice that sound strangely faint and far-away and that shake and tremble in spite of she where be you -- take I to be marry he answer never look at she you -- would not -- dare wait and see he nod oh -- but what do -- you mean the fear in she voice be more manifest than ever i mean that you be mine -- you always be you always must and shall be so i be go to marry you -- in about half-an-hour by special license still he do not even glance towards she and she look away over the country side all lonely and desolate under the moon i want you you see he go on i want you more than i ever want anything in this world i need you because without you my life will be utterly purposeless and empty so i have take you -- because you be mine i know it -- ah yes and deep down in you woman 's heart you know it too and so i be go to marry you -- yes i be unless -- and here he bring the car to a standstill and turn look at she for the first time and now before the look in he eye she own waver and fall lest he should read within they that which she would fain hide from he -- and which she know they must reveal -- that which be neither shame nor anger nor fear but the other feeling for which she dare find no name and thus for a long moment there be silence at last she speak though with she eye still hide : unless she repeat breathlessly anthea -- look at I but anthea only droop she head the lower wherefore he lean forward and -- even as small porge have do -- set he hand beneath the dimple in she chin and lift the proud un-willing face : anthea -- look at I and now what could anthea do but obey unless say he as she glance at last meet he unless you can tell I -- now as you eye look into mine -- that you love cassilis tell I that and i will take
