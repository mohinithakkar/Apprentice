information have thus be accumulate from which it will be my task to select such a portion as shall seem sufficient to give a faithful representation of he fortune and character without weary the attention of the reader that any important addition should be make to what have be already tell of he will scarcely be expect samuel johnson the elder of two son of michael johnson who be of a obscure family and keep a bookseller 's shop at lichfield be bear in that city on the 18th of September 1709 he mother sarah ford be spring of a respectable race of yeomanry in worcestershire and be a woman of great piety early instil into the mind of she son those principle of devotion for which he be afterwards so eminently distinguish at the end of ten month from he birth he be take from he nurse

he be the best scholar she academy have ever produce he next instructor in he own language be a man whom he use to call tom browne and who he say publish a spelling book and dedicate it to the universe he be then place with mr hunter the head master of the grammar school in he native city but for two year before he come under he immediate tuition be teach latin by mr hawkin the usher it be just that one who in write the life of man less eminent than himself be always careful to record the name of they instructor should obtain a tribute of similar respect for he own by mr price who be afterwards head master of the same school and whose name i can not mention without reverence and affection i have be tell that johnson when late in life he visit the place of he education shew he a nook in the school-room where it be usual for the boy to secrete the translation of the book they be read and at the same time speaking of he old master hunter say to he he be not severe sir a master ought to be severe sir he be cruel johnson however be always ready to acknowledge how much he be indebted to hunter for he classical proficiency at the age of fifteen by the advice of he mother 's nephew cornelius ford a clergyman of considerable ability but disgrace by the licentiousness of he life and who be speak of in the life of fenton he be remove to the grammar-school of stourbridge of which mr wentworth be master here he do not remain much more than a twelvemonth and as he tell dr percy learn much in the school but little from the master whereas with hunter he have learn much from the master and little in the school the progress he make be perhaps gain in teach the other boy for wentworth be say to have employ he as a assistant he composition in english verse indicate that command of language which he afterwards attain the two follow year he accuse himself of waste in idleness at home but we must doubt whether he have much occasion for self-reproach when we learn that hesiod anacreon the latin work of petrarch and a great many other book not commonly know in the university be among he study he father though a man of strong understanding and much respect in he line of life be not successful in business he must therefore have have a firm reliance on the capacity of he son for while he chide he for he want of steady application he resolve on make so great a effort as to send he to the university and accompany he thither place he on the 31st of October 1728 a commoner at pembroke college oxford some assistance be indeed promise he from other quarter but this assistance be never give nor be he industry quicken by he necessity he be sometimes to be see linger about the gate of he college and at other seek for relief from the oppression of he mind in affect mirth and turbulent gaiety so extreme be he poverty that he be prevent by the want of shoe from resort to the room of he schoolfellow taylor at the neighbouring college of christ church and such be he pride that he fling away with indignation a new pair that he find leave at he door he scholarship be attest by a translation into latin verse of pope 's messiah which be say to have gain the approbation of that poet but he independent spirit and he irregular habit be both likely to obstruct he interest in the university and at the end of three year increase debt together with the failure of remittance occasion by he father 's insolvency force he to leave it without a degree of pembroke college in he life of shenstone and of sir thoma browne he have speak with filial gratitude from he tutor mr jorden whom he describe as a worthy man but a heavy one he do not learn much what he read solidly he say be greek and that greek homer and euripide but he favorite study be metaphysics which we must suppose he to have investigate by the light of he own meditation for he do not read much in it with dr adam then a junior fellow and afterwards master of the college he friendship continue till he death soon after he return to lichfield he father die and the follow memorandum extract from the little register which he keep in latin of the more remarkable occurrence that befel he prove at once the small pittance that be leave he and the integrity of he mind : 1732 julius 15 undecim aureo deposuus : quo die quicquid ante matri funus -lrb- quod serum sit precor -rrb- de paternis bonis sperare licet vigintus scilicet libras accepi usque adeo mihi fortuna fingenda est interea ne paupertate vire animus languescant nec in flagitium egesta abigat cavendum -- 1732 July 15 i lay down eleven guinea on which day i receive the whole of what it be allow I to expect from my father 's property before the decease of my mother -lrb- which i pray may be yet far distant -rrb- namely twenty pound my fortune therefore must be of my own make meanwhile let I beware lest the power of my mind grow languid through poverty or want drive I to evil on the follow day we find he set out on foot for market bosworth in leicestershire where he have engage himself as a usher to the school of which mr crompton be master here he describe to he old school-fellow hector the dull sameness of he life in the word of the poet : vitam continct una die : that it be as unvaried as the note of the cuckoo and that he do not know whether it be more disagreeable for he to teach or for the boy to learn the grammar rule to add to he misery he have to endure the petty despotism of sir wolstan dixie one of the patron of the school the trial of a few month disgust he so much with he employment that he relinquish it and remove to birmingham become the guest of he friend mr hector who be a chirurgeon in that town and lodge in the house of a bookseller have remain with he about six month he hire lodgings for himself by mr hector he be stimulate not without some difficulty to make a translation from the french of lobo 's voyage to abyssinia for which he receive no more than five guinea from the bookseller who by a artifice not uncommon print it at birmingham with the date of london in the title-page to mr hector therefore be due the impulse which first make johnson a author the motion be once give do not cease for have return to lichfield in 1735 he send forth in August proposal for printing by subscription politian 's latin poem with a life of the author note and a history of latin poetry from the age of petrarch to that of politian he reason for fix on this era it be not easy to determine mussato precede petrarch the interval between petrarch and politian be not particularly illustrate by excellence in latin poetry and politian be much surpass in correctness and elegance if not in genius by those who come after he -- by flaminio navagero and fracastorio yet in the hand of johnson such a subject would not have be want in instruction or entertainment such as be willing to subscribe be refer to he brother nathaniel johnson who have succeed to he father 's business in lichfield but the design be drop for want of a sufficient number of name to encourage it a deficiency not much to be wonder at unless the inhabitant of provincial town be more learn in those day than at present in this year he make another effort to obtain the means of subsistence by a offer of he pen to cave the editor of the gentleman 's magazine but the immediate result of the application be not know nor in what manner he support himself till July 1736 when he marry elizabeth porter the widow of a mercer at birmingham and daughter of william jervis esq of great peatling in leicestershire this woman who be twenty year older than himself and to whose daughter he have be a unsuccessful suitor bring he eight hundred pound but accord to garrick 's report of she be neither amiable nor handsome though that she be both in johnson 's estimation appear from the epithet formosae cultae ingeniosa which he inscribe on she tombstone they nuptials be celebrate at derby and to that town they go together on horseback from birmingham but the bride assume some air of caprice on the road like another petruchio he give she such effectual proof of resolution as reduce she to the abjectness of shed tear he first project after he marriage be to set up a school and with this intention he hire a very commodious house at the distance of about two mile from lichfield call edial hall which have lately be take down and of which a representation be to be see in the history of lichfield by mr harwood one of my friend who inhabit it for the same purpose have tell I that a old countryman who live near it and remember johnson and he pupil garrick say to he that johnson be not much of a scholar to look at but that master garrick be a strange one for leap over a stile it be amusing to observe the impression which such man make on common mind unfortunately the prejudice occasion by johnson 's unsightly exterior be not confine to the vulgar insomuch that it have be think to be the reason why so few parent commit they child to he care for he have only three pupil this unscholarlike appearance it must have be that make the bookseller in the strand to whom he apply for literary employment eye he archly and recommend it to he rather to purchase a porter 's knot but as a old philosopher have say every thing have two handle it be perhaps the contrast between the body and the mind between the incultum corpus and the ingenium which afterwards be one cause of he be receive so willingly in those circle of what be call high life where any thing that be exceedingly strange and unusual be apt to carry its own recommendation with it fail in he attempt at edial he be disposed once more to engage in the drudgery of a usher and offer himself in that capacity to the rev william budworth master of the grammar-school at brewood in staffordshire celebrate for have be the place in which bishop hurd receive he education under that master but here again nature stand in he way for budworth be fearful lest a strange motion with the head the effect probably of disease to which johnson be habitually subject might excite the derision of he scholar and for that reason decline employ he he now resolve on try he fortune in the capital among the many respectable family in lichfield into whose society johnson have be admit none afford so great encouragement to he literary talent as that of mr walmsley who live in the bishop 's palace and be registrar of the ecclesiastical court and whom he have so eloquently commemorate in he life of the poet by this gentleman he be introduce in a letter to the rev mr colson lucasian professor of mathematics in the university of cambridge and the master of a academy as a very good scholar and one who he have great hope would turn out a fine dramatic writer who intend to try he fate with a tragedy and to get himself employ in some translation either from the latin or the french the tragedy on which mr walmsley found he expectation of johnson 's future eminence as a dramatic poet be the irene a shrewd sally of humor to which the reading of this piece give rise evince the term of familiarity on which he be with he patron for on walmsley 's observe when some part of it have be read that the poet have already involve he heroine in such distress that he do not see what further he could do to excite the commiseration of the audience johnson reply that he could put she into the ecclesiastical court garrick who be to be place at colson 's academy accompany he former instructor on this expedition to london at the beginning of march 1737 it do not appear that mr walmsley 's recommendation of he to colson whom he have describe under the character of gelidus -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the twenty-fourth paper of the rambler be of much use he first take lodgings in exeter-street in the strand but soon retire to greenwich for the sake of complete he tragedy which he use to compose walk in the park from greenwich he address another letter to cave with proposal for translate paul sarpus 's history of the council of trent with the note of le courayer before the summer be expire he return for mr johnson whom he have leave at lichfield and remain there three month at length finish irene on he second visit to london he lodgings be first in woodstock-street near hanover square and then in castle-street near cavendish square he tragedy which be bring on the stage twelve year after by garrick have be at this time reject by the manager of the playhouse he be force to relinquish he hope of become a dramatic writer and engage himself to write for the gentleman 's magazine the debate in parliament be not then allow to be give to the public with the same unrestricted and generous freedom with which it be now permit to report they to elude this prohibition and gratify the just curiosity of the country the several member be designate by fictitious name under which they be easily discoverable and they speech in both house of parliament which be entitle the senate of lilliput be in this manner impart to the nation in the periodical work above-mentioned at first johnson only revise these report but he become so dexterous in the execution of he task that he require only to be tell the name of the speaker and the side of the question to be espouse in order to frame the speech himself a artifice not wholly excusable which afterwards occasion he some self-reproach and even at the time pleased he so little that he do not consent to continue it the whole extent of he assistance to cave be not know the life of paul sarpus boerhaave admiral drake and blake barretier burman sydenham and roscommon with the essay on epitaph and a essay on the account of the conduct of the duchess of marlborough be certainly contribute to he miscellany by johnson two tract the one a vindication of the licenser of the stage from the aspersion of brooke author of gustavus vas the other marmor norfolciense a pamphlet level against sir robert walpole and the hanoverian succession be publish by he separately in 1739 for he version of sarpus 's history he have receive from cave before the 21st of April in this year fifty pound and some sheet of it have be commit to the press when unfortunately the design be stop in consequence of proposal appear for a translation of the same book by another person of the same name as we author who be curate of st martin 's in the field and patronize by dr pearce the editor of longinus warburton -lrb- 3 -rrb- afterwards express a wish that johnson would give the original on one side and he translation on the other he next engagement be to draw up a account of the print book in the earl of oxford 's library for osborne the bookseller who have purchase they for thirteen thousand pound such be the petulant impatience of osborne during the progress of this irksome task that johnson be once irritated so far as to beat he in may 1738 appear he london imitate from the third satire of juvenal for which he get ten guinea from dodsley the excellence of this poem be so immediately perceive that it reach a second edition in the course of a week pope have make some ineffectual inquiry

folly as malignity he should have have reason to be offend with in 1747 he furnish garrick who have become joint-patentee and manager of drury lane with a prologue on the opening of the house this address have be commend quite as much as it deserve the character of shakspeare and ben jonson be indeed discriminate with much skill but surely something might have be say if not of massinger and

arduous a dictionary of the english language he plan of this work be at the desire of dodsley inscribe to the earl of chesterfield then one of the secretary of state dodsley in conjunction with six other book-seller stipulate fifteen hundred and seventy-five pound as the price of he labor a sum from which when the expense of paper and transcription be deduct a small portion only remain for the compiler in other country this national desideratum have be supply by the unite exertion of the learn have the project for such a combination in queen anne 's reign be carry into execution the result might have be fewer defect and less excellence : the explanation of technical term would probably have be more exact the derivation more copious and a greater number of significant word now omit -lrb- 7 -rrb- have be collect from we earliest writer but the citation would often have be make with less judgment and the definition lay down with less acuteness of discrimination from he new patron whom he court without the aid of those grace so devoutly worship by that nobleman he reap but small advantage and be much exasperated at he neglect johnson address to he a very cut but it must be own a intemperate letter renounce he protection though when the dictionary be complete chesterfield have usher its appearance before the public in two complimentary papers in the world but the homage of the client be not to be recall or even he resentment to be appease he great work be thus speak of at its first appearance in a letter from thoma warton to he brother -lrb- 8 -rrb- the dictionary be arrive the preface be noble there be a grammar prefix and the history of the language be pretty full but you may plainly perceive stroke of laxity and indolence they be two most unwieldy volume i have write to he a invitation i fear he preface will disgust by the expression of he consciousness of superiority and of he contempt of patronage in 1773 when he give a second edition with addition and correction he announce in a few prefatory line that he have expunge some superfluity and correct some fault and here and there have scatter a remark but that the main fabric continue the same i have look into it he observe in a letter to boswell very little since i write it and i think i find it full as often better as worse than i expect to trace in order of time the various change in johnson 's place of residence in the metropolis if it be worth the trouble would not be possible a list of they which he give to boswell amounting to seventeen but without the correspondent date be preserve by that writer for the sake of be near he printer while the dictionary be on the anvil he take a convenient house in gough square near fleet-street and fit up one room in it as a office where six amanuensis be employ in transcribe for he of whom boswell recount in triumph that five be scotchmen in 1748 he write for dodsley 's preceptor the preface and the vision of theodore the hermit to which johnson have be hear to give the preference over all he other writings in the January of the ensue year appear the vanity of human wish be the tenth satire of juvenal imitate which he sell for fifteen guinea and in the next month he irene be bring on the stage not without a previous altercation between the poet and he former pupil concern some change which garrick 's superior knowledge of the stage make he consider to be necessary but which johnson say the fellow desire only that they might afford he more opportunity of toss he hand and kick he heel he always treat the art of a player with illiberal contempt but be at length by the intervention of dr taylor prevail on to give way to the suggestion of garrick yet garrick have not make he alter all that need alter for the first exhibition of irene shock the spectator with the novel sight of a heroine who be to utter two verse with the bow-string about she neck this horror be remove from a second representation but after the usual course of ten night the tragedy be no longer in request johnson think it requisite on this occasion to depart from the usual homeliness of he habit and to appear behind the scene and in the side box with the decoration of a gold-laced hat and waistcoat he observe that he find himself unable to behave with the same ease in he finery as when dress in he plain clothes in the winter of this year he establish a weekly club at the king 's head in ivy lane near st paul 's of which the other member be dr salter a cambridge divine hawkesworth mr ryland a merchant mr john payne the bookseller mr john dyer a man of considerable erudition and a friend of burke 's doctor macghie baker and bathurst three physician and sir john hawkin he next become a candidate for public favor as the writer of a periodical work in the manner of the spectator and in march 1750 publish the first number of the rambler which be continue for nearly two year but want variety of matter and familiarity of style fail to attract many reader so that the largest number of copy that be sell of any one paper do not exceed five hundred the topic be select without sufficient regard to the popular taste the grievance and distress of author particularly be dwell on to satiety and the tone of eloquence be more swell and stately than he have hitherto adopt the papers allot to criticism be mark by he usual acumen but the justice of he opinion be often questionable in the humourous piece when we laughter be excite i doubt the author himself who be always discoverable under the masque of whatever character he assume be as much the object as the cause of we merriment and however moral and devout he more serious view of life they be often defective in that most engaging feature of sound religion a cheerful spirit the only assistance he receive be from richardson mr chapone miss talbot and mr carter the first of whom contribute the 97th number the second four billet in the 10th the next the 30th and the last the 44th and 100th number three day after the completion of the rambler -lrb- march 17 1752 -rrb- he be deprive of he wife whom notwithstanding the disparity in they age and some occasional bickering he have tenderly love those who be dispose to scrutinize narrowly and severely into the human heart may question the sincerity of he sorrow because he be collect enough to write she funeral sermon but the shape which grief put on in different mind be as dissimilar as the constitution of those mind milton in whom the power of imagination be predominant soothe he anguish for the loss of he youthful friend in a irregular but most beautiful assemblage of those poetic object which present themselves to he thought and consecrate they to the memory of the deceased and johnson who love to act the moralizer and the rhetorician alleviate he suffering by declaim on the instability of human happiness during this interval he also write the prologue to comus speak by garrick for the benefit of mr elizabeth foster grand-daughter to milton the prologue and postscript to lander 's impudent forgery concern that poet by which johnson be impose on as well as the rest of the world a letter to dr dougla for the same impostor after he have be detect acknowledge and express contrition for the fraud and the life of cheynel in the student soon after he wife 's death he become intimate with beauclerk and langton two young man of family and distinction who be fellow collegian at oxford and much attach to each other and the latter of whom admiration of the rambler have bring to london with the express view of be introduce to the author they society be very agreeable to he and he be perhaps glad to forget himself by join at time in they sally of juvenile gaiety one night when he have lodgings in the temple he be rouse by they knock at he door and appear in he shirt and nightcap he find they have come together from the tavern where they have sup to prevail on he to accompany they in a nocturnal ramble he readily enter into they proposal and have indulge themselves till morning in such frolic as come in they way johnson and beauclerk be so well pleased with they diversion that they continue it through the rest of the day while they less sprightly companion leave they to keep a engagement with some lady at breakfast not without reproach from johnson for desert he friend for a set of unidea would girl in 1753 he give to dr bathurst the physician whom he regard with much affection and whose practice be very limited several essay for the adventurer which hawkesworth be then

of draught and a introduction to the newspaper call the london chronicle for the last of which he receive a single guinea yet either conscientious scruple or he unwillingness to relinquish a london life induce he to decline the offer of a valuable benefice in lincolnshire which be make he by the father of he friend langton provide he could prevail on himself to take holy order a measure that would have deliver he from literary toil for the remainder of he day but literary toil be the occupation for which nature have design he in the April of 1758 he commence the idler and continue to

marvellous as the character of the philosopher who have persuade himself that he be entrust with the management of the element johnson 's dread of insanity be perhaps relieve by embody this mighty conception he have see the shadowy form in the twilight and might have dissipate or ease he apprehension by come up to it more closely and examine into the occasion of he fear in this tale the censure which he have elsewhere pass on milton that he be a lion who have no skill in dandle the kid recoil upon himself he delineation of the female character be want in delicacy in this year he supply mr newbery with a introduction to the world display a collection of voyage and travels : till the publication of he shakspeare in 1765 the only writings acknowledge by himself be a review of tytler 's vindication of mary queen of scot in the gentleman 's magazine a introduction to the proceedings of the committee for clothing the french prisoner the preface to bolt 's dictionary of trade and commerce a dedication to the king of kennedy 's complete system of astronomical chronology unfold the scripture and a dedication to the queen of hoole 's tasso in the course of this period he make a short visit to lichfield and thus communicate he feeling on the occasion in a letter date July 20 1762 to baretti he italian friend who be then at milan last winter i go down to my native town where i find the street much narrower and shorter than i think i have leave they inhabit by a new race of people to whom i be very little known my play-fellow be grow old and force I to suspect that i be no longer young my only remain friend have change he principle and be become the tool of the predominant faction my daughter-in-law from whom i expect most and whom i meet with sincere benevolence have lose the beauty and gaiety of youth without have gain much of the wisdom of age i wander about for five day and take the first convenient opportunity of return to a place where if there be not much happiness there be at least such a diversity of good and evil that slight vexation do not fix upon the heart i think in a few week to try another excursion though to what end let I know my barettus what have be the result of you return to you own country whether time have make any alteration for the better and whether when the first rapture of salutation be over you do not find you thought confess they disappointment henceforward johnson have no longer to struggle with the evil of extreme poverty a pension of # 300 be grant to he in 1762 by he majesty before he acceptance of it in answer to a question put by he to the earl of bute in these word pray my lord what be i to do for the pension he be assure by that nobleman that it be not give he for any thing he be to do but for what he have do the definition he have give of the word pension in he dictionary that in england it be generally understand to mean pay give to a state hirele for treason to he country raise some further scruple whether he ought himself to become a pensioner but they be remove by the argument or the persuasion of mr reynold to whom he have recourse for advice in this dilemma what advice reynold would give he he must have know pretty well before-hand but this be one of the many instance in which man have first determine how to act be willing to imagine that they be go for clearer information where they in truth expect nothing but a confirmation of they own resolve the liberality of the nation could not have be extend to one who have better deserve it but he have a calamity yet more dreadful than poverty to encounter the depression of he spirit be now become almost intolerable i would have a limb amputate say he to dr adam to recover my spirit he be constantly torment by harass reflection on he inability to keep the many resolution he have form of lead a better life and complain that a kind of strange oblivion have overspread he so that he do not know what be become of the past year and that incident and intelligence pass over he without leave any impression neither change of place nor the society of friend avail to prevent or to dissipate this melancholy in 1762 he make a excursion into devonshire with sir joshua reynold the next year he go to harwich with boswell in the follow when he malady be most troublesome the meeting which acquire the name of the literary club be institute and he pass a considerable time in lincolnshire with the father of langton and in the year after visit cambridge in the company of beauclerk of the literary club first propose by reynold the other member at its first establishment be burke dr nugent beauclerk langton goldsmith chamier and sir john hawkin they meet at the turk 's head in gerrard-street soho one evening in the week and usually remain together till a late hour the society be afterwards extend so as to comprise a large number of those who be most eminent either for they learning or they station in life and the place of meeting have be since at different time change to other part of the town nearer to the parliament house or to the usual resort of gaiety a club be the delight of johnson we lose some of we awe for he when we contemplate he as mimic by he old scholar garrick in the act of squeeze a lemon into the punch-bowl and ask as he look round the company in he provincial accent of which he never get entirely rid who be for _ poonch _ if there be any thing likely to gratify he more than a new club it be the public testimony of respect from a learn body and this he receive from trinity college dublin in a diploma for the degree of doctor of law a honor the more flattering as it come without solicitation at the beginning of 1766 he faithful biographer jame boswell who have know he for three year find he in a good house in johnson 's court fleet-street to which he have remove from lodgings in the temple by the advice of he physician he have now begin to abstain from wine and drink only water or lemonade he have bring two companion into he new dwelling such as few other man would have choose to enliven they solitude on the ground floor be miss anna william daughter of zechariah william a man who have practice physic in wale and have come to england to seek the reward propose by parliament for the discovery of the longitude have be assist by johnson in draw up a account of the method he have devise this plan be print with a italian translation which be suppose to be barettus 's on the opposite page and a copy of the pamphlet present by johnson to the bodleian be deposit in that library miss william have be a frequent visitor at johnson 's before the death of he wife and have after that event come under he roof to undergo a operation for a cataract on she eye with more convenience than could have be have in she own lodgings continue to occupy a apartment in he house whenever he have one till the time of she death she disease end in total blindness which give she a additional claim on he benevolence when he live in the temple it be he custom however late the hour not to retire to rest until he have drunk tea with she in she lodgings in bolt-court one night when goldsmith and boswell be with he goldsmith strut off in the company of johnson exclaim with a air of superiority i go to miss william while boswell slink away in silent disappointment but it be not long as boswell add before he himself obtain the same mark of distinction johnson prevail on garrick to get she a benefit at the playhouse and assist she in prepare some poem she have write for the press by both which mean she obtain the sum of about # 300 the interest of this add to some small annual benefaction probably hinder she from be any pecuniary burden to johnson and though she be apt to be peevish and impatient she curiosity the retentiveness of she memory and the strength of she intellect make she on the whole a agreeable companion to he the other inmate whose place be in one of he garret be robert levett a practiser of physic among the lower people grotesque in he appearance formal in he manners and silent before company : though little thought of by other this man be so highly esteem for he ability by johnson that he be hear to say he should not be satisfied though attend by all the college of physician unless he have levett with he he must have be a useful assistant in the chemical process with which johnson be fond of amusing himself and at one of which murphy on he first visit find he in a little room cover with soot like a chimney-sweeper make aether beauclerk with he lively exaggeration use to describe johnson at breakfast throw he crust to levett after he have eat the crumb the pathetic verse write by johnson on he death which happen suddenly three year before he own shew with what tenderness of affection he regard levett some time after -lrb- 1778 -rrb- to this couple who do not live in much harmony together be add mr desmoulin the daughter of dr swinfen he god-father and widow of a writing-master miss carmichael and as boswell think a daughter also of mr desmoulin all of whom be lodge in he house to the widow he allow half-a-guinea a week the twelfth part as boswell observe of he pension it be sometimes more than he could do to reconcile so many jarring interest william say he in a letter to mr thrale hate every body : levett hate desmoulin and do not love william : desmoulin hate they both poll love none of they poll be miss carmichael of whom i do not find that any thing else be record boswell venture to call this groupe the seraglio of johnson and escape without a rebuke from these domestic feud he would sometimes withdraw himself to the house of mr thrale at streatham a opulent brewer with whom he acquaintance have begin in 1765 with this open-hearted man he be always sure of a welcome reception for as long a time as he choose and the mistress of the house though after the death of she first husband and she subsequent marriage to a italian she somewhat ungraciously remember the petty annoyance which johnson 's untoward habit have occasion she be evidently please by he hearty expression of regard and flatter by he conversation on subject of literature in which she be herself well able to take a part in this year he long promise edition of shakspeare make its appearance in eight volume octavo that by steeven be publish the following year and a coalition between the editor have be effect a edition be put forth under they joint name in ten volume 8vo 1773 for the first johnson receive # 375 and for the second # 100 -lrb- 11 -rrb- at the beginning of the preface he have mark out the character of we great dramatist with such a power of criticism as there be perhaps no example of in the english language towards the conclusion he have i think successfully defend he from the neglect of what be call the unity the observation that a quibble be the cleopatra for which he lose the world and be content to lose it be more pointed than just shakspeare can not be say to have lose the world for he fame have not only embrace the circle of he own country but be continually spread over new portion of the globe nor be there any reason to conclude that he would have acquiesce in such a loss like most other writer he indulge himself in a favorite propensity aware probably that if it offend some it would win he the applause of other one avenue of knowledge that be open to shakspeare in common with the rest of mankind none of he commentator appear to have sufficiently consider we can not conceive he to have associate frequently with man of larger acquirement than himself and not to have make much of they treasure he own the conversation of such a man as ben jonson alone suppose he to have make no more display of he learning than chance or vanity would occasionally produce must have supply ample source of information to a mind so curious watchful and retentive that it do not suffer the slightest thing to escape its grasp johnson be distinguish in he note from the other commentator chiefly by the acute remark on many of the character and on the conduct of some of the fable which he have subjoin to the different play in other respects he be not superior to the rest in some particularly in illustrate he author from antecedent or contemporary writer he be inferior to they a german critic of we own day schlegel have surpass he even in that which he have do best from boswell i have collect a account of the little journey with which he from time to time relieve the uniformity of he life they will be tell in order as they occur and i hope will not weary the reader the day of a scholar be frequently not distinguish by variety even as unimportant as these johnson find he mind grow stagnant by a constant residence in the neighborhood of charing-cross itself where he think human happiness at its flood : and once when move rapidly along the road in a carriage with boswell cry out to he fellow-traveller sir life have few thing better than this in the winter of 1766 he go to oxford where he reside for a month and form a intimacy with chamber afterwards one of the judge in indium during this period no publication appear under he own name but he furnish miss william with a preface to she poem and adam with another for he treatise on the globe and write the dedication to the king prefix to gough 's london and westminster improve he seem to have be always ready to supply a dedication for a friend a task which he execute with more than ordinary courtliness in this way he tell boswell that he believe he have dedicate to all the royal family round but in he own case either pride hinder he from prefix to he work what he perhaps consider as a token of servility or he better judgment restrain he from appropriate by a particular inscription to one individual that which be intend for the use of mankind of johnson 's interview with george iii i shall transcribe the account as give by boswell with which such pain be take to make it accurate that it be submit before publication for the inspection of the king by one of he principal secretary of state in February 1767 there happen one of the most remarkable incident in johnson 's life which gratify he monarchical enthusiasm and which he love to relate with all its circumstance when request by he friend this be he be honor by a private conversation with he majesty in the library at the queen 's house he have frequently visit those splendid room and noble collection of book which he use to say be more numerous and curious than he suppose any person could have make in the time which the king have employ mr barnard the librarian take care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to he ease and convenience while indulge he literary taste in that place : so that he have here a very agreeable resource at leisure hour he majesty have be inform of he occasional visit be please to signify a desire that he should be tell when dr johnson come next to the library accordingly the next time that johnson do come as soon as he be fairly engage with a book on which while he sit by the fire he seem quite intent mr barnard steal round to the apartment where the king be and in obedience to he majesty 's command mention that dr johnson be then in the library he majesty say he be at leisure and would go to he : upon which mr barnard take one of the candle that stand on the king 's table and light he majesty through a suite of room till they come to a private door into the library of which he majesty have the key be enter mr barnard step forward hastily to dr johnson who be still in a profound study and whisper he sir here be the king johnson start up and stand still he majesty approach he and at once be courteously easy he majesty begin by observe that he understand he come sometimes to the library and then mention he have hear that the doctor have be lately at oxford ask he if he be not fond of go thither to which johnson answer that he be indeed fond of go to oxford sometimes but be likewise glad to come back again the king then ask he what they be do at oxford johnson answer he could not much commend they diligence but that in some respects they be mend for they have put they press under better regulation and be at that time print polybius he be then ask whether there be better library at oxford or cambridge he answer he believe the bodleian be larger than any they have at cambridge at the same time add i hope whether we have more book or not than they have at cambridge we shall make as good use of they as they do be ask whether all-soul or christ-church library be the largest he answer all-souls library be the largest we have except the bodleian ay -lrb- say the king -rrb- that be the public library he majesty inquire if he be then write any thing he answer he be not for he have pretty well tell the world what he know and must now read to acquire more knowledge the king as it should seem with a view to urge he to rely on he own store as a original writer and to continue he labor then say i do not think you borrow much from any body johnson say he think he have already do he part as a writer i should have think so too -lrb- say the king -rrb- if you have not write so well -- johnson observe to I upon this that no man could have pay a handsomer compliment and it be fit for a king to pay it be decisive when ask by another friend at sir joshua reynold 's whether he make any reply to this high compliment he answer no sir when the king have say it it be to be so it be not for I to bandy civility with my sovereign perhaps no man who have spend he whole life in court could have shew a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness than johnson do in this instance he majesty have observe to he that he suppose he must have read a great deal johnson answer that he think more than he read that he have read a great deal in the early part of he life but have fall into ill health he have not be able to read much compare with other : for instance he say he have not read much compare with dr warburton upon which the king say that he hear dr warburton be a man of such general knowledge that you could scarce talk with he on any subject on which he be not qualify to speak and that he learn resemble garrick 's act in its universality he majesty then talk of the controversy between warburton and lowth which he seem to have read and ask johnson what he think of it johnson answer warburton have most general most scholastic learning lowth be the more correct scholar i do not know which of they call name best the king be please to say he be of the same opinion add you do not think then dr johnson that there be much argument in the case johnson say he do not think there be why truly -lrb- say the king -rrb- when once it come to call name argument be pretty well at a end he majesty then ask he what he think of lord lyttelton 's history which be then just publish johnson say he think he style pretty good but that he have blame henry the second rather too much why -lrb- say the king -rrb- they seldom do these thing by half no sir -lrb- answer johnson -rrb- not to king but fear to be misunderstand he proceed to explain himself : and immediately subjoin that for those who speak worse of king than they deserve he could find no excuse but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of they than they deserve without any ill intention for as king have much in they power to give those who be favor by they would frequently from gratitude exaggerate they praise : and as this proceed from a good motive it be certainly excusable as far as error could be excusable the king then ask he what he think of dr hill johnson answer that he be a ingenious man but have no veracity and immediately mention as a instance of it a assertion of that writer that he have see object magnify to a much greater degree by use three or four microscope at a time than by use one now -lrb- add johnson -rrb- every one acquaint with microscope know that the more of they he look through the less the object will appear why -lrb- reply the king -rrb- this be not only tell a untruth but tell it clumsily for if that be the case every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect he i now -lrb- say johnson to he friend when relate what have pass -rrb- begin to consider that i be depreciate this man in the estimation of he sovereign and think it be time for I to say something that might be more favourable he add therefore that dr hill be notwithstanding a very curious observer and if he would have be contented to tell the world no more than he know he might have be a very considerable man and need not to have recourse to such mean expedient to raise he reputation the king then talk of literary journal mention particularly the journal des savans and ask johnson if it be well do johnson say it be formerly very well do and give some account of the person who begin it and carry it on for some year : enlarge at the same time on the nature and use of such work the king ask he if it be well do now johnson answer he have no reason to think that it be the king then ask he if there be any other literary journal publish in this kingdom except the monthly and critical review and on be answer there be no other he majesty ask which of they be the best : johnson answer that the monthly review be do with most care the critical upon the best principle add that the author of the monthly review be enemy to the church this the king say he be sorry to hear the conversation next turn on the philosophical transaction when johnson observe that they have now a better method of arrange they material than formerly ay -lrb- say the king -rrb- they be oblige to dr johnson for that for he majesty have hear and remember the circumstance which johnson himself have forget he majesty express a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably execute and propose to dr johnson to undertake it johnson signify he readiness to comply with he majesty 's wish during the whole of this interview johnson talk to he majesty with profound respect but still in he firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and never in that subdue tone which be commonly use at the levee and in the drawing-room after the king withdraw johnson shew himself highly pleased with he majesty 's conversation and gracious behavior he say to mr barnard sir they may talk of the king as they will but he be the finest gentleman i have ever see and he afterwards observe to mr langton sir he manners be those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose lewi the fourteenth or charle the second nothing in this conversation betray symptom of that state which he complain of in he devotional record -lrb- on the 2nd of August 1767 -rrb- when he say that he have be disturb and unsettle for a long time and have be without resolution to apply to study or to business half of this year he pass at a distance from the metropolis and chiefly at lichfield where he pray fervently by the death-bed of the old servant of he family catherine chamber leave she with a fond farewell and many tear there be no greater proof of the goodness of johnson 's nature than he attachment to he domestic soon after this he place franci barber a negro boy who wait on he at a school at hertfordshire and during he education there encourage he to good behavior by frequent and very kind letter it be on such occasion that we be ready to allow the justice of goldsmith 's vindication of he friend that he have nothing of the bear but the skin in the two succeed year he continue to labor under the same restlessness and anxiety again seek for relief in a long visit to oxford and another to brighthelmstone with the thrale and produce nothing but a prologue to one of goldsmith 's comedy the repeat expulsion of wilke from he seat by a vote of the house of common have -lrb- in 1770 -rrb- throw the nation into a ferment johnson be rouse to take the side of the ministry and endeavor in a pamphlet call the false alarm as much by ridicule as by argument to support a violent and arbitrary measure it appear both from he conversation and he writings that he think there be a point at which resistance might become justifiable and surely it be more advisable to check the encroachment of power at they beginning than to delay opposition till it can not be resort to without greater hazard to the public safety the ministry be happily compel to give way they be however glad to have so powerful a arm to fight they battle and in the next year -lrb- 1771 -rrb- employ he in a worthier cause in he tract on the falkland island the material for which be furnish he by government he appear to have much the better of the argument for he have to shew the folly of involve the nation in a war for a questionable right and a possession of doubtful advantage but he invective against he opponent be very coarse he do not perform the work of dissection neatly : he mangle rather than cut when he apply the word gabble to the elocution of chatham we be tempt to compare he to one of the baser fowl speak of by a ancient poet that clamor against the bird of jove not many copy of this pamphlet have be disperse when lord north stop the sale and cause some alteration to be make for reason which the author do not himself distinctly comprehend johnson 's own opinion of these two political essay be that there be a subtlety of disquisition in the first that be worth all the fire of the second when question by boswell as to the truth of a report that they have obtain for he a addition to he pension of 200_l _ a year he answer that except what have be pay he by the bookseller he have not get a farthing for they about this time there be a project for enable he to take a more distinguished part in politics the proposition for bring he into the house of common come from strahan the printer who be himself one of the member boswell have preserve the letter in which this zealous friend to johnson represent to one of the secretary of state the service which might reasonably be expect from he eloquence and fidelity the reason which render the application ineffectual have not be disclose to we but it may be question whether he power of reasoning could have be readily call forth on a stage so different from any to which he have be hitherto accustomed whether so late in life he could have obtain the habit of attend to speaker sometimes dull and sometimes perplexed or whether that dictatorial manner which easily conquer opposition in a small circle might not have be bear down by resentment or scorn in a large and mixed assembly johnson would most willingly have make the experiment and when reynold repeat what burke have say of he that if he have come early into parliament he would certainly have be the greatest speaker that ever be there exclaim i should like to try my hand now that we may proceed without interruption to the end of johnson 's political career it should here he tell that he publish -lrb- in 1774 -rrb- a short pamphlet in support of he friend mr thrale who at that time be one of the candidate in a contest election and a zealous supporter of the government but he devotion to the power that be never lead he to so great length as in the following year -lrb- 1775 -rrb- when he write taxation no tyranny : a answer to the resolution and address of the american congress now that we look back with impartiality and coolness to the subject of dispute between the mother country and she colony there be few i believe who do not acknowledge the american to have be drive into resistance by claim which if they be not palpably unlawful be at least highly inexpedient and unjust but johnson be no statist with the nature of man take individually and in the detail he be well acquaint but of man as incorporate into society of the relation between the governor and the govern and of all the complicated interest of polity and of civil life he knowledge be very limited biography be he favorite study history he aversion sooner than hear of the punic war -lrb- say murphy -rrb- he would be rude to the person that introduce the subject and as he tell mr thrale when a gentleman one day speak to he at the club of catiline 's conspiracy he withdraw he attention and think about tom thumb in he taxation no tyranny have occasion to notice a reference make by the american congress to a passage in montesquieu he call he in contempt the fanciful montesquieu yet this be the man of whom burke when he just horror of every thing fanciful in politics be at its height have pass the noblest eulogium that one modern have ever make on another and which the reader will pardon I if in my veneration for a great name i place here as a antidote to the detraction of johnson place before you eye such a man as montesquieu think of a genius not bear in every country or every time a man gifted by nature with a penetrate aquiline eye with a judgment prepare with the most extensive erudition with a herculean robustness of mind and nerve not to be break with labor a man who could spend twenty year in one pursuit think of a man like the universal patriarch of milton -lrb- who have draw up before he in he prophetic vision the whole series of the generation which be to issue from he loin -rrb- a man capable of place in review after have bring together from the east the west the north and the south from the coarseness of the rudest barbarism to the most refined and subtle civilization all the scheme of government which have ever prevail amongst mankind weigh measure collate and compare they all join fact with theory and call into council upon all this infinite assemblage of thing all the speculation which have fatigue the understanding of profound reasoner in all time let we then consider that all these be but so many preparatory step to qualify a man and such a man tincture with no national prejudice with no domestic affection to admire and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the constitution of england -- _ appeal from the nero to the old institute at the end _ it be to be fear that the diploma of doctor of law which be send to johnson in the same year -lrb- 1775 -rrb- at the recommendation of lord north at that time chancellor of the university and prime minister be in some measure intend to be the reward of he obsequiousness in this instrument he be call with a hyperbole of praise which the university would perhaps now he more cautious of apply to any individual in literarum republica princep jam et primarius he have long meditate a visit to scotland in the company of boswell and be at length -lrb- in 1773 -rrb- prevail on to set out where he go and what he see and hear be sufficiently know by the relation which he give the world next year in he journey to the western island of scotland and in he letter to mr thrale it can not be say of he as he have say of gray that whoever read he narrative wish that to travel and to tell he travels have be more of he employment he seem to have proceed on he way with the view of find something at every turn on which to exercise he power of argument or of raillery he mind be scarcely ever passive to the object it encounter but shape they to he own mood after we lay down he book little impression be leave of the place through which he have pass and a strong one of he own character with he fellow-traveller though kindness sometimes make he over-officious he be so well pleased as to project a voyage up the baltic and a visit to the northern country of europe in he society he have before indulge himself with a visionary scheme of sailing to iceland with he friend bathurst in 1774 he go with the thrale to the extremity of north wale a few trifling memorandum of this journey which be find among he papers have be lately publish but as he write to boswell he find the country so little different from england that it offer nothing to the speculation of a traveller such be he apathy in a land where each old poetic mountain inspiration breathe around every shade and hallow would fountain murmur deep a solemn sound in the following year -lrb- 1775 -rrb- he make he usual visit to the midland county and accompany the thrale in a tour to pari from whence they return by way of rouen this be the only time he be on the continent it be to be regret that he leave only some imperfect note of he journey for there could scarcely have fail to be something that would have gratify we curiosity in he observation on the manners of a foreign country we find he in the next year -lrb- 1776 -rrb- remove from johnson 's court no 7 to bolt court fleet-street no 8 from whence at different time he make excursion to lichfield and ashbourne to bath with the thrale and in the autumn to brighthelmstone where mr thrale have a house this gentleman have for some time feed he expectation with the prospect of a journey to italy a man say johnson who have not be in italy be always conscious of a inferiority from he not have see what it be expect a man should see the grand object of travel be to see the shore of the mediterranean all we religion almost all we law almost all we art almost all that set we above savage have come to we from the shore of the mediterranean much as he have set he heart on this journey and magnificent as he conception be of the promised land he be employ with more advantage to he own country at home for at the solicitation of the bookseller he now -lrb- 1777 -rrb- undertake to write the life of the english poet the judicious selection of the fact which he relate the vivacity of the narrative the profoundness of the observation and the terseness of the style render this the most entertaining as it be perhaps the most instructive of he work he criticism indeed often betray either the want of a natural perception for the higher beauty of poetry or a taste unimproved by the diligent study of the most perfect model yet they be always acute lucid and original that he judgment be often warped by a political bias can scarcely be doubt but there be no good reason to suspect that it be ever pervert by malevolence or envy the bookseller leave it to he to name he price which he modestly fix at 200 guinea though as mr malone say 1000 or 1500 would have be readily give if he have ask it as he proceed the work grow on he hand in 1781 it be complete and another 100_l _ be voluntarily add to the sum which have be at first agree on in the third edition which be call for in 1783 he make several alteration and addition of which to shew the unreasonableness of murmur respect improve edition it be relate in the biographical dictionary -lrb- 12 -rrb- on the information of mr nichol that though they be print separately and offer grati to the purchaser of the former edition scarcely a single copy be demand this be the last of he literary labor nor do we hear of he write any thing for the press in the meanwhile except such slight composition as a prologue for a comedy by mr hugh kelly and a dedication to the king of the posthumous work of pearce bishop of rochester he body be weigh down with disease and he mind cloud with apprehension of death he seek for respite from these suffering in the usual means -- in short visit to he native place or to brighthelmstone and in the establishment of new club in 1781 another of these society be by he desire form in the city it be to meet at the queen 's arm in st paul 's churchyard and he wish be that no patriot should be admit he now return to the use of wine which when he do take it he swallow greedily about this time mr thrale die leave johnson one of he executor with a legacy of 200_l _ the death of levett in the same year and of miss william in 1783 leave he yet more lonely a few month before the last of these deprivation befel he he have a warning of he own dissolution which he could not easily mistake the night of the 16th of June on which day he have be sit for he picture he perceive himself soon after go to bed to be seize with a sudden confusion and indistinctness in he head which seem to he to last about half a minute he first fear be lest he intellect should be affect of this he make experiment by turn into latin verse a short prayer which he have breathe out for the avert of that calamity the line be not good but he know that they be not so and conclude he faculty to be unimpaired soon after he be conscious of have suffer a paralytic stroke which have take away he speech i have no pain he observe afterwards and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wonder at my own apathy and consider that perhaps death itself when it should come would excite less horror than seem now to attend it in hope of stimulate the vocal organ he swallow two dram and agitate he body into violent motion but it be to no purpose whereupon he return to he bed and as he think fall asleep in the morning finding that he have the use of he hand he be in the act of write a note to he servant when the man enter he then write a card to he friend and neighbor mr allen the printer but not without difficulty he hand sometimes he know not why make a different letter from that which he intend he next care be to acquaint dr taylor he old schoolfellow and now a prebendary of westminster with he condition and to desire he would come and bring dr heberden with he at the same time he send in for dr brocklesby who be he near neighbor the next day he speech be restore and he perceive no deterioration either in he memory or understanding in the follow month he be well enough to pass a week at rochester with mr langton and to appear again at the literary club and at the end of August to make a visit to mr bowle at heale near salisbury where he continue about three week on he return to london he be confine to the house by a fit of the gout a disorder which have once attack he but with less violence ten year before and to which he be now reconcile by be teach to consider it as a antagonist to the palsy to this be add a sarcocele which as it threaten to render excision necessary cause he more uneasiness though he look forward to the operation with sufficient courage but the complaint subside of itself when he be able to go about again that society might be insure to he at least three day in the week another club be found at the essex head in essex street where a old servant of mr thrale 's be the landlord its principle -lrb- he say -rrb- be to be lay in frequency and frugality and he draw up a set of rule which he preface with two line from a sonnet of milton to-day resolve deep thought with I to drench in mirth that after no repenting draw the number be limit to twenty-four each member present engage himself to spend at least sixpence and to pay a forfeit of three-pence if he do not attend but even here in the club-room after he sixpence be duly lay down and the arm chair take there be no security for he against the intrusion of those malady which have so often assail he on the first night of meeting -lrb- 13th of December 1783 -rrb- he be seize with a spasmodic asthma and hardly make he way home to he own house where the dropsy combine with asthma to hold he a prisoner for more than four month a occurrence during he illness which he mention to boswell deserve notice from the insight which it give into he peculiar frame of mind he have shut himself up and employ a day in particular exercise of religion -- fast humiliation and prayer on a sudden he obtain extraordinary relief for which he look up to heaven with grateful devotion he make no direct inference from the fact but from he manner of tell it add boswell i could perceive that it appear to he as something more than a incident in the common course of event yet at this time with all he aspiration after a state of greater perfectness he be not able to bear the candor of langton who when johnson he desire to tell he sincerely wherein he have observe he life to be faulty bring he a sheet of paper on which be write many text of scripture recommendatory of christian meekness at the beginning of June he have sufficiently rally he strength to set out with boswell for oxford where he remain about a fortnight with dr adam the master of pembroke he old college in he discourse there be the same alternation of gloominess and gaiety the same promptness of repartee and keenness of sarcasm as there have ever be several of he friend be now anxious that he should escape the rigor of a english winter by repair to italy a measure which he physician recommend not very earnestly indeed and more i think in compliance with he known wish than in expectation of much benefit to he health it be think requisite however that some addition should previously be make to he income in order to he maintain a appearance somewhat suitable to the character which he have establish throughout europe by he writings for this purpose boswell address a application to the ministry through lord thurlow who be then chancellor after some accidental delay and some unsuccessful negotiation on the part of lord thurlow who be well disposed to befriend he during which time johnson be again buoy up with the prospect of visit italy a answer be return which leave he no reason to expect from government any further assistance than that which he be then receive in the pension already grant he this refusal the chancellor accompany with a munificent offer of supply out of he own purse which he endeavor to convey in such a manner as should least alarm the independent spirit of johnson it would be a reflection on we all -lrb- say thurlow -rrb- if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of he health the ability of thurlow have always be hold in high estimation by johnson who have be hear to say of he i would prepare myself for no man in england but lord thurlow when i be to meet with he i should wish to know a day before one day while this scheme be pend johnson be at the house of sir joshua reynold be overcome by the tenderness of he friend and by the near view as he think of this long-hoped italian tour be effect and exclaim with much emotion god bless you all and then after a short silence again repeat the word in a form yet more solemn be no longer able to command he feeling but hurry away to regain he composure in solitude after all these effort johnson be fate to disappointment and the author of he disappointment have incur the sentence denounce on they by the humanity of thurlow in this dr brocklesby the physician have no share for by he a noble offer of # 100 a year be make to johnson during he life in the meantime he have pay the summer visit which have now become almost a annual one to he daughter-in-law at lichfield from whence he make a excursion to dr taylor 's at ashbourne and to chatsworth still labor under he asthma but willing to believe that as floyer the celebrated physician of he native city have be allow to pant on till near ninety so he might also yet pant on a little longer whilst he be on this journey he translate a ode of horace and compose several prayer as he pass through birmingham and oxford he once more hail he old schoolfellow hector and he fellow collegian adam it be delightful to see early intimacy thus endure through all the accident of life local attachment unsevered by time and the old age and childhood of man bind together by these natural charity the same willow tree which johnson have know when a boy be still he favorite and still flourish in the meadow near lichfield hector -lrb- whom i can remember several year after a man of erect form and grave deportment -rrb- still meet he with the same or perhaps more cordiality than in they first day and the virtue of adam which he have see opening in they early promise have now grow up to full maturity to london he return only to prove that death be not the terrible thing which he have fancy it he arrive there on the 15th of November in little more than a fortnight after when dr brocklesby -lrb- with whom three other eminent physician and a chirurgeon be in the habit of attend he gratuitously -rrb- be pay he a morning visit he say that he have be as a die man all night and then with much emphasis repeat the word of macbeth : canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the write trouble of the brain and with _ some _ sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff which weigh upon the heart to which brocklesby promptly return the answer which be make by the doctor in that play -- therein the patient must minister unto himself he now commit to the flame a large mass of papers among which be two 4to volume contain a particular account of he life from he earliest recollection he few remain day be occasionally cheer by the presence of such man as have be collect about a death-bed in few age and country of the world -- langton reynold windham and burke of these none be more attentive to he than mr langton of whom he have be hear to say i could almost wish anima mea sit cum langtono and whom he now address in the tender word of tibullus te teneam morien deficiente manu at another time burke who be sit with he in the company of four or five other express he fear that so large a number might be oppressive to he no sir say johnson it be not so and i must be in a wretched state indeed when you company would not be a delight to I burke 's voice tremble when he reply my dear sir you have always be too good to I these be the last word that pass between they mr windham have settle a pillow for he he thank he for he kindness this will

use he pencil on a Sunday the church service be frequently read to he by some clergyman of he acquaintance on one of these occasion when mr nichol be present he cry out to mr hoole who be read the litany louder my dear sir louder i entreat you or you pray in vain and when the service be do he turn to a lady who have come to pray with he and say to she with much earnestness i thank you madam very heartily for you kindness in join I in this solemn service live well i conjure you and you will not feel the compunction at the last which i now feel he entreat dr brocklesby to dismiss any vain speculative opinion that he might entertain and to settle he mind on the great truth of christianity he then insist on he write down the purport of they conversation and when he have do make he affix he signature to the paper and urge he to keep it for the remainder of he life the follow be the account communicate to boswell by this affectionate physician who be very free from any suspicion of fanaticism as indeed be well shewn by johnson 's discourse with he for some time before he death all he fear be calm and absorb by the prevalence of he faith and he trust in the merit and propitiation of jesus christ he talk often to I about the necessity of faith in the sacrifice of jesus as necessary beyond all good work whatever for the salvation of mankind he press I to study dr clarke and to read he sermon i ask he why he press dr clarke a arian ` because -lrb- say he -rrb- he be fullest on the propitiatory sacrifice ' this be the more remarkable because he prejudice against clarke on account of the arianism imputed to he have formerly be so strong that he make it a rule not to admit he name into he dictionary he desire dr brocklesby to tell he whether he could recover charge he to give a direct answer the doctor have first ask whether he could bear to hear the whole truth tell he that without a miracle he could not recover then say johnson i will take no more physic or even opiate for i have pray that i may render up my soul to god uncloud he not only keep this resolution but abstain from all food except such as be of the weakest kind when mr windham press he to take something more generous lest too poor a diet should produce the effect which he dread i will take any thing say he but inebriate sustenance mr strahan the clergyman who administer to he the comfort of

of that poet he reply that he would readily do it if he could obtain any new material he stature be unusually high and he person large and well proportioned but he be render uncouth in he appearance by the scar which he scrophulous disease have impress upon he by convulsive motion and by the slovenliness of he garb he eye of which the sight be very imperfect be of a light gray color yet have withal a wildness and penetration and at time a fierceness of expression that could not be encounter without a sensation of fear he have a strange way of make inarticulate sound or of mutter to himself in a voice loud enough to be overhear what be pass in he thought when in company thus one day when he be on a visit to davy the bookseller whose pretty wife be speak of by churchill he be hear repeat part of the lord 's prayer and on he say lead we not into temptation davy turn round and whisper he wife you be the occasion of this my dear it be say by boswell that he temperament be so morbid that he never know the natural joy of a free and vigorous use of he limb : when he walk it be the struggle gait of one in fetter when he ride he have no command or direction of he horse but be carry as if in a balloon he daily habit be exceedingly irregular he take he meal at unusual hour and either eat voraciously or abstain rigorously he study by fit and start but when he do read it be with such rapidity and eagerness that as some one say it seem as if he would tear out the heart of the book he be upon he could with difficulty believe any one who speak of have read any book from the begin to the end he mode of composition be in like manner vigorous and hasty though he sentence have all the appearance of be measure but it be he custom to speak no less than to write with a studious attention to the numerousness of he phrase so that he be enable to do that by habit which other usually accomplish by a particular effort in matter of fact he regard to truth be so punctilious that it be observe he always talk as if he be talk upon oath and he be desirous of exact the same preciseness from those over whom he have authority or influence he have however a practice that be not entirely consistent with this love of veracity for he would sometimes defend that side of a question which he think wrong because it afford he a more favourable opportunity of exhibit he reasoning or he wit thus when he begin why sir as to the good or evil of card-playing garrick would make this arch comment on he proem now he be consider which side he shall take it may he urge that he hearer be aware of this propensity which he have -- to make the worse appear the better argument and be therefore in no danger of be mislead by it but a excuse of the same kind will serve for the common liar that he be know and therefore disbelieve it behove he to be the more scrupulous in this particular because he know that boswell take minute of he ordinary conversation some of he idle sophism which thus become current have i fear lead to serious mischief such as the opinion that a author may be at liberty to deny he have write a book to which he have not affix he name he extenuation of incontinence in the master of a family and the gloss he put on the crime of covetousness which last error be not confine to he conversation but mingle itself with he writings though no one could well be freer from any taint of the vice in he own life many a man may have indulge he inclination to evil with much less compunction while he have imagine himself sheltered under the sanction of the moralist who watch one side of the entrance into the nave of st paul 's there be in he mind a strange mixture of credulity and doubtfulness he do not disbelieve either in the existence of ghost or in the possibility of commute other metal into gold but be very slow to credit any fact that be at all extraordinary he would tell of cave 's have see a apparition without much apparent doubt and with more certainty of he have be himself address by the voice of he absent mother the deception practice by the girl in cock lane who be a ventriloquist be well know to have work on he so successfully as to make he go and watch in the church where she pretend the spirit of a young woman to be which have disclose to she the manner of its have be violently separate from the body on this occasion boswell endeavor in vain to clear he from the imputation of a weakness which be but too agreeable to the rest of he character yet on hume 's argument against miracle that it be more probable witness should lie or be mistaken than that they should happen he remark as i think very judiciously that hume take the proposition simply be right but that the christian revelation be not prove by the miracle alone but as they be connect with prophecy and with the doctrine in confirmation of which the miracle be work he be devout moral and humane frequent and earnest in he petition for the divine succor anxious to sublime he nature by disengage it from worldly soil and prompt to sympathise with the sorrow and out of he scanty means to relieve the necessity of other but such be the imperfection of man that he piety be apt to degenerate into superstition he abstinence yield to slight temptation and he charity be often not proof against a discrepancy of opinion either in politics or literature among he friend beauclerk seem most to have engage he love langton he respect and burke he admiration the first be conspicuous for wit liveliness of feeling and gaiety the next for rectitude of conduct piety and learn the last for knowledge sagacity and eloquence he praise of reynold that he be the most invulnerable of man one of whom if he have a quarrel with he he should find it the most difficult to say any ill be praise rather of the negative kind the younger warton he contrived to alienate from he as be related in the life of that poet there be indeed a entire harmony in they political principle but question of literature touch a author yet more sensibly than those of state and the idem sentire de republica be a imperfect bond of amity between man who appreciate so differently the comus and lycida of milton and the bucolic of theocritus to savage and goldsmith he be attach by similarity of fortune and pursuit a yet closer bond of sympathy unite he with collin as the reader will see in the following extract from letter which he write to dr warton how little can we exult in any intellectual power or literary entertainment when we see the fate of poor collin i know he a few year ago full of hope and full of project verse in many language high in fancy and strong in retention this busy and forcible mind be now under the government of those who lately would not have be able to comprehend the least and most narrow of its design -- march 8 1754 poor dear collin let I know whether you think it would give he pleasure that i should write to he i have often be near he state and therefore have it in great commisseration \* \* \* what become of poor dear collin i write he a letter which he never answer i suppose write be very troublesome to he that man be no common loss the moralist all talk of the uncertainty of fortune and the transitoriness of beauty but it be yet more dreadful to consider that the power of the mind be equally liable to change that understanding may make its appearance and depart that it may blaze and expire -- April 15 1756 -lrb- 14 -rrb- difference of opinion respect the american war do not separate he from burke and fox and when the nation be afterwards divide by the struggle between the court and populace on one side and the aristocracy on the other though he principle determine he to that party in which he find the person though perhaps not the interest of he sovereign yet he affection continue with the great leader in the house of common who be oppose to it i be say he for the king against fox but i be for fox against pitt the king be my master but i do not know pitt and fox be my friend and to burke when he be a candidate for a seat in the new parliament he wish as he tell he with a smile all the success that a honest man could wish he even towards wilke he asperity be soften down into good humor by they meeting together over a plentiful table at the house of dilly the bookseller when he have offend any by contradiction or rudeness it be seldom long before he seek to be reconcile and forgive but though he private enmity be easily appease yet where he consider the cause of truth to be concern he resentment be vehement and unrelenting that imposture particularly which he with good reason suppose macpherson to have practice on the world with respect to the poem of ossian provoke he to vengeance such as the occasion seem hardly to demand of he dry pleasantry in conversation there be many instance record when one of he acquaintance have introduce he to he brother at the same time tell he that he would find he become very agreeable after he have be some time in he company he reply sir i can wait to a stupid justice of the peace who have weary he with a long account of he have cause four convict to be condemn to transportation he answer i heartily wish i be a fifth a repartee that call to we mind horace 's answer to the impertinent fellow : omne composui felice mine ego resto a physician endeavor to bring to he recollection that he have be in he company once before mention among other circumstance he have that day worn so fine a coat that it could not but have attract he notice sir say johnson have you be dip in pactolus i should not have notice you he could on occasion be more polite and complimentary when mr siddon with whom in a letter to mr thrale he express himself highly pleased pay he a visit there happen not to be any chair ready for she madam say he you who so often occasion the want of seat to other will the more readily excuse the want of one yourself he scholarship be rather various than accurate or profound yet dr burney the younger suppose he capable of give a greek word for almost every english one romance be always a favorite kind of read with he felixmarte of hircanium be he regular study during part of a summer which he spend in the country at the parsonage-house of dr percy on a journey to derbyshire when he have in view he italian expedition he take with he il palermino d'inghilterra to refresh he knowledge of the language to this taste he have be hear to impute he unsettled disposition and he averseness from the choice of any profession one of the most singular quality of he mind be the rapidity with which it be able to seize and master almost any subject however abstruse or novel that be offer to its speculation to this quickness of apprehension be join a extraordinary power of memory so that he be able to recall at pleasure most passage of a book which have once strongly impressed he in he sixty-fourth year he attempt to acquire the low dutch language he have a perpetual thirst of knowledge and six month before he death request dr burney to teach he the scale of music teach I say johnson to he at least the alphabet of you language what he know he love to communicate accord to that description of the stu - -lrb- \*\* possibly student -- rest of word -lrb- s -rrb- miss in original -rrb- in chaucer gladly would he teach and gladly learn these endowment be accompany with a copiousness of word in which it would be difficult to name any writer except barrow that have surpass he yet he prose style be very far from afford a model that can safely be propose for we imitation he seem to exert he power of intellect and of language indiscriminately and with equal effort on the smallest and the most important occasion and the effect be something similar to that of a chinese painting in which though all the object separately take be accurately describe yet the whole be entirely want in a proper relief of perspective what be observe by milton of the conduct of life may be apply to composition that there be a scale of higher and lower duty and he who confuse it will infallibly fall short of that proportion which be necessary to excellence no less in matter of taste than of moral he be more intent in balance the period than in develop the thought or image that be present to he mind sometimes we find that he multiply word without amplify the sense and that the ear be gratify at the expense of the understanding this be more particularly the case in the rambler which be call for at short and stated interval be sometimes compose in such haste that he have not leasure even to read they before they be print nor can we wonder at the dissatisfaction he express some year afterwards when he exclaim that he think they have be better in the idler there be more brevity and consequently more compression when johnson trust to he own strong understanding in a matter of which he have the full command and do not aim at set it off by futile decoration he be always respectable and sometimes great but when he attempt the ornamental he be heavy and inelegant and the awkwardness of he effort be more perceptible from the hugeness of the body that be put in motion to produce they he be like the animal whom milton describe as make sport for we first parent in paradise -- -- th ' unwieldy elephant to make they mirth use all he might it be a good beast for carry a burden or trample down a foe but a very indifferent one at a lavolta or a coranto he swell style be readily counterfeit we common advertisement have amply revenge themselves for he ridicule of they large promise in the idler by clothing those promise in language as magnificent as he own it be much less easy to catch the subtle grace of addison at the conclusion of the rambler he boast that he have labor to refine we language to grammatical purity and to clear it from colloquial barbarism licentious idiom and irregular combination the result of he labor be awkward stateliness and irksome uniformity in he dread of incongruous idiom he write almost without any idiom at all he have sometimes be consider as have innovate on we tongue by introduce big word into it from the latin : but he commonly do no more than revive term which have be employ by we old writer and afterwards fall into disuse nor do he like they employ even these term in sens which scholar only would be likely to understand at the time of write the dictionary he have a notion that we language for almost a century have be depart from its original teutonic character and deviate towards a gallic structure and phraseology from which it ought to be we endeavor to recall it by make we ancient volume the ground-work of style admit among the addition of later time only such as may supply real deficiency such as be readily adopt by the genius of we tongue and incorporate easily with we native idiom but a little reflection will shew we the vanity of this attempt since the age of chaucer at least that be for more than 400 year we language have be increase by continual transfusion from the french to these have be add from time to time similar accession from other language both ancient and modern thus a copiousness and a flexibility which in the instance of the greek seem to have arise out of that subtilty of intellect which give birth to endless subdivision and distinction have be in some measure compensate in we own by the influx which it have receive from the language of many other people and have be yet further improve by that liberty which it be to be hope we shall always retain each man of speak he thought after he own guise without too much regard to any set mode or fashion he have before say in this same preface that we knowledge of the northern literature be so scanty that of word undoubtedly teutonic the original be not always to be find in any ancient language and i have therefore he add insert dutch or german substitute which i consider not as radical but parallel not as the parent but sister of the english and in he history of the english language speaking of we saxon ancestor to whom we must i suppose go for that teutonic original which he so strongly recommend he observe that they speech have be always cursory and extemporaneous must have be artless and unconnected without any mode of transition or involution of clause which abruptness and inconnection may be find even in they later writings of the addition which have be make to this we original poverty who shall say what ought to be reject and what retain who shall say what deficiency be real and what imaginary what the genius of we tongue may admit of and what it must refuse and in a word what that native idiom be a coalition with which be to be thus studiously consult throughout he life of the poet he constantly betray a want of relish for the more abstracted grace of the art when strong sense and reasoning be to be judge of these he be able to appreciate justly when the passion or character be describe he could to a certain extent decide whether they be describe truly or no but as far as poetry have relation to the kindred art of music and painting to both of which he be confessedly insensible it could not be expect that he should have much perception of its excellence of statuary he say that its value be owe to its difficulty and that a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that nearly resemble a man what shall be think of he assertion that before the time of dryden there be no poetical diction no system of word at once refine from the grossness of domestic use and free from the harshness of term appropriate to particular art and that word too familiar or too remote defeat the purpose of a poet it might with more show of reason be affirm that in proportion as we writer have adopt such a system as he speak of and have reject word for no other cause than that they be either too familiar or too remote we have be recede from the proper language of poetry one of the chief ornament or more properly speak the constituent of poetical language be the use of metaphor and metaphor never find they way to the mind more readily or affect it more powerfully than when they be clothe in familiar word even a naked sentiment will lose none of its force from be convey in the most homely term which we mother tongue can afford they be the sound which we have be use to from we infancy which have be early connect with we hope and fear and still continue to meet we in we own home and by we fireside that will most certainly awaken those feeling with which the poet be chiefly concern as for the term which johnson call remote if i understand he rightly they too may be employ occasionally either when the attention be to be rouse by something unusual or for the sake of harmony or it may be for no other reason than because the poet choose thus to diversify he diction so as to give a stronger relief to that which be familiar and common by the juxtaposition of its contrary of this there can be no doubt that whoever lay down such arbitrary rule as johnson have here prescribe will find himself mock at every turn by the power of genius which meet with nothing in art or nature that it can not convert to its own use and which delight to produce the greatest effect by means apparently the most inadequate he particularly value himself on the life of cowley for the sake of those observation which he have introduce into it on the metaphysical poet here he have mistake the character of marino whom he suppose to be at the head of they marino abound in puerile conceit but they be not far-fetched like those of donne and cowley they generally lie on the surface and often consist of nothing more than a mere play upon word so that if to be a punster be to be a metaphysician marino be a poetical heraclitus but johnson have catch the cant of the age in which it be usual to designate almost any thing absurd or extravagant by the name of metaphysical it be difficult to suppose that he have read some of the work on which he pass a summary sentence the comedy of love 's riddle which he say add little to the wonder of cowley 's minority deserve to be commend at least for the style which be a specimen of pure and unaffected english of congreve 's novel he tell we that he have rather praise it than read it judge from the letter of congreve he only writings in prose which it have be my good fortune to meet with and which as i remember contain some admirable remark on the distinction between wit and humor i should conclude that one part of he character as a writer have yet to make its way to the public notice i have hear it observe by a lady that johnson in he life of milton be like a dog incensed and terrify at the presence of some superior creature at whom he snarl then run away and then return to snarl again if the comparison be a just one it may be add in extenuation of johnson 's malignity that he be at least a dog who think himself to be attack the inveterate foe of he master for milton 's hostility to a kingly government be the crime which he could not forgive the mention of milton and of he politics bring to my mind two saying of johnson 's that be relate to I by mr price of lichfield after pass a evening together at mr seward 's the father of the poetess where in the course of conversation the word I miserable in paradise lose have be commend as highly pathetic they have walk some way along the street in silence which the good man be not likely first to break when johnson suddenly stop and turn round to he exclaim sir do not you think that ` I miserable ' be miserable stuff on another occasion he thus whimsically describe the different manner in which he feel himself disposed towards a whig and a tory if say he i see a whig and a tory drowning i would first save the tory and when i see that he be safe not till then i would go and help the whig but the dog should duck first the dog should duck laugh with pleasure at the thought of the whig 's duck the principal charm of the life of the poet be in the store of information which they contain he have be as he say somewhere of he own father no careless observer of the passage of the time in the course of a long life he have hear and read and see much and this he communicate with such force and vivacity and illustrate by observation so pertinent and striking that we recur again and again to he page as we would to so many portrait trace by the hand of a great master in spite of we belief that the original be often misrepresent that some be flatter and the defect of other still more overcharge in he very error as a critic there be often shewn more ability than in the right judgment of most other when he be most wrong he give we some good reason for he be so he be often mistaken but never trivial and insipid it be more safe to trust to he when he commend than when he dispraise when he enlarge the boundary of criticism which he predecessor have contract than when he set up new fence of he own the higher station we can take the more those petty limit will disappear which confine excellence to particular form and system the critic who condemn that which the generality of mankind or even the few of those more refine in they taste have long agree in admiring may naturally conclude the fault to be in himself that there be in he mind or he organ some want of capacity for the reception of a certain species of pleasure when johnson reject pastoral comedy as be representative of _ scene _ adapt chiefly to please barbarian and child he might have suspect that he own eye-sight rather than pastoral comedy be to blame when he characterize blank verse as verse only to the eye he might reasonably have question the power of he own hearing but this and more than this we may forgive he for he successful vindication of shakspeare from the fault object to he by the french critic it be in he biographical work that johnson be most please and most instructive he querulousness take away much both from the agreeableness and the use of he moral writings addison have represent we nature in its most attractive form but swift make we turn with loathing from its deformity and johnson cause we to shudder at its misery like most of the writer of that time he make use of he poetry only as the means of introduce himself to the public we can not regret as in the case of goldsmith that he put it to no further service he take little delight in those appearance either of nature or art for which the poet ought to have the eye of a painter nor have he much more sense of the elegant in number and in sound there be indeed certain round of metrical arrangement which he love to repeat but he could not go beyond they how very limited he perception of this kind be we may be convince by read he stricture on dionysius the halicarnassian in the rambler and the opinion on milton 's versification which in the idler he have put into the mouth of a minute critic only to ridicule they though they be indeed found in truth johnson be not one of those whom plato call the -lrb- greek : philaekoous kai philotheamones -rrb- who gladly acknowledge the beautiful wherever it be meet with in sound and color and figure and all that be by art compound from these much less have he ascend to that abstract notion of beauty which the same philosopher consider it so much more difficult to attain -lrb- 15 -rrb- in he tragedy the dramati persona be like so many statue stept from they pedestal to take the air they come on the stage only to utter pompous sentiment of morality turgid declamation and frigid simile yet there be throughout that strength of language that heavy mace of word with which as with the flail of talus johnson lay every thing prostrate before he this style be better suit to he imitation of the two satire of juvenal of the first of these the london gray in a letter to horace walpole say that to he it be one of those few imitation that have all the ease and all the spirit of a original the other be not at all inferior to it johnson be not insensible to such praise and could he have know how favourably gray have speak of he would i doubt not have be more just to that poet whom besides the petulant criticism on he in he life he presume in conversation to call a heavy fellow in he shorter poem it appear as if nature could now and then thrust herself even into the bosom of johnson himself

favourable opinion of the taste which we countryman have form for the most perfect production of the roman muse we should send they not to the page of johnson but rather to those of milton gray warton

closely he friend describe he to dr wharton as have much fancy little judgment and a good deal of modesty i take he continue gray for a good and well-meaning creature but then he be really in simplicity a child and love every body he meet with : he read little or nothing write abundance and that with a design to make he fortune by it on review this character of himself twenty-five year after he confess what can not be matter of surprise that this interval have make a considerable abatement in he general philanthropy but deny have look for more emolument from he publication than a few guinea to take he to a play or a opera gray 's next report of he after a year 's farther acquaintance be that he grow apace into he good grace as he know he more that he be very ingenious with great good nature and simplicity a little vain but in so harmless and so comical a way that it do not offend one at all a little ambitious but withal so ignorant in the world and its way that this do not hurt he in one 's opinion so sincere and so undisguised that no mind with a spark of generosity would ever think of hurt he he lie so open to injury but so indolent that if he can not overcome this habit all he good quality will signify nothing at all at this time he publish a ode on the installation of the duke of newcastle which he friend who be a laughing spectator of the ceremony consider the only entertainment that have any tolerable elegance and think it with some little abatement uncommonly well on such a occasion : it be however very inferior to that which he himself compose when the duke of grafton be install he next production -lrb- in 1751 -rrb- be elfrida write on the model of the ancient greek tragedy a delicate exotic not make to thrive in we cold

stage in 1752 we find he recommend to lord rockingham by mr charle yorke who think he say warburton likely to attach that lord 's liking to he as he be a young nobleman of elegance and love painting and music in the following year he lose he father in the disposition of whose affair he be less consider than he think himself entitle to expect what the reason for this partiality be it would be vain to conjecture nor have we any means of know whether the disappointment determine he to the choice of a profession which he make soon after -lrb- in 1754 -rrb- when he enter into the church from the following passage in a letter of warburton 's it appear that the step be not take without some hesitation mr mason have call on I i find he yet unresolved whether he would take the living i say be the question about a mere secular employment i should blame he without reserve if he refuse the offer but as i regard go into order in another light i frankly own to he he ought not to go unless he have a call by which i mean i tell he nothing fanatical or superstitious but a inclination and on that a resolution to dedicate all he study to the science of religion and totally to abandon he poetry : he entirely agree with I in think that decency reputation and religion all require this sacrifice of he and that if he go into order he intend to give it this be surely a absurd squeamishness in one of the same profession as warburton be who have begin he career by translation in prose and verse from latin writer have then mingle in the literary cabal of the day and afterwards do not think he time misemploy in editing and comment on shakspeare and pope yet he be unreasonable enough to continue he expectation that mason should do what he have without any apparent compunction omit to do himself for after speaking of brown the unfortunate author of barbarossa who be also a ecclesiastic he add : how much shall i honor one who have a stronger propensity to poetry and have get a greater name in it if he perform he promise to I of put away these idle baggage after he sacred espousal after all this prove to be one of the vow at which jove laugh the sacred espousal do not lessen he devotion to the idle baggage and it be very doubtful whether he discharge he duty as king 's chaplain or rector of aston -lrb- for both which appointment he be indebted to the kindness of lord holdernesse -rrb- at all the worse for this attachment which he be indeed barefaced enough to avow two year after by the publication of some of he ode at he rectory of aston in yorkshire he continue to live for great part of he remain life with occasional absence in the metropolis at cambridge or at york where he be make precentor and canon of the cathedral and where he residence be therefore sometimes require i have not learn whether he have any other preferment hurd in a letter write in 1768 mention that the death of a dr atwell throw a good living into he hand be this as it might he be rich enough and have a annual income of about fifteen hundred pound at he death lord orford say of he somewhere in he letter that he intend to have refuse a bishopric if it have be offer he he might have spare himself the pain of come to this resolution for mitre though they fall on many a critic 's head and on that of he friend hurd among the rest do not seem adapt to the brow of a poet when the death of cibber have make the laurel vacant he be inform that be in order he be think merely on that account less eligible for the office than a layman a reason say he so politely put i be glad to hear assign and if i have think it a weak one they who know I will readily believe that i be the last man in the world who would have attempt to controvert it of the laurel he probably be not more ambitious than of the mitre though he be still so obstinate as to believe that he might unite the character of a clerk and a poet to which he would fain have superad that of a statist also caractacus another tragedy on the ancient plan but which make a better figure on the stage appear in 1759 and in 1762 three elegy in 1769 harri hear he preach at st jame 's early prayer and give a fling at the french for the invasion

the british government in praise we religious toleration he be careful to justify we exception of the church of rome from the general indulgence nor be it in the pulpit only that he act the politician he be one of those as we be tell in the biographical dictionary who think the decision of parliament on the middlesex election a violation of the rights of the people and when the county begin in 1779 to associate for parliamentary reform he take a active part in assist they deliberation and write several patriotic manifesto in the same year appear he ode to the naval officer of great britain on the trial of admiral keppel in which the poetry be strangle by the politics he harp be in better tune when in 1782 a ode to mr pitt declare the hope he have conceive of the son of chatham for like many other who espouse the cause of freedom he have range himself among the partisan of the youthful statesman who be then do all he could to persuade other as he have no doubt persuade himself that he be one of the number in the mean time gray who if he have live longer might perhaps have restrain he from mix in this turmoil be no more the office which he perform of biographer or rather of editor for he deceased friend have give we one of the most delightful book in its kind that we language can boast it be just that this acknowledgment should be make to mason although mr mathia have recently add many other of gray 's most valuable papers which he former editor be scarcely scholar enough to estimate as they deserve and mr mitford have shew we that some omission and perhaps some alteration be unnecessarily make by he in the letter themselves as to the task which the latter of these gentleman impose on himself few will think that every passage which he have admit though there be nothing in any to detract from the real worth of gray could have be make public consistently with those sacred feeling of regard for he memory by which the mind of mason be impressed and that reluctance which he must have have to conquer before he resolve on the publication at all the follow extract from a letter write by the rev edward jone bring we into the presence of mason and almost to a acquaintance with he thought at this time and on this occasion be at york in September 1771 -lrb- gray die on the thirtieth of July precede -rrb- i be introduce to mr mason then in residence on

first book of the english garden the other three follow separately in 1777 1779 and 1782 the very title of this poem be enough to induce a suspicion that the art which it teach -lrb- if art it can be call -rrb- be not found on general and permanent principle it be rather a mode which the taste of the time and country have render prevalent and which the love of novelty be already supplant in the neighborhood of those building which man construct for use or magnificence there be no reason why he should prefer irregularity to order or dispose he path in curved line rather than in straight homer when he describe the cavern of calypso cover it with a vine and scatter the alder the poplar and the cypress without any symmetry about it but near the palace of alcinous he lay out the garden by the

time walk by hedge-row elm on hillock green and at another in trim garden when we be willing to escape from the tedium of uniformity nature and accident supply numberless variety which we shall for the most part vainly strive to heighten and improve it be too much to say that we will use the face of the country as the painter do he canvas take thy plastic spade it be thy pencil take thy seed thy plant they be thy color the analogy can scarcely hold farther than in a parterre and even there very imperfectly mason could not hear to see he own system push to that excess into which it naturally lead and bitterly resent the attempt make by the advocate of the picturesque to introduce into he landscape more factitious wildness than he intend in 1783 he publish a translation from the latin of

which have be teach he by zachary mudge from the writings of plato and which enable he to rise above the mere mechanism of he predecessor that mason 's version surpass the original be not say much in its praise in some prefatory line address to reynold he have describe the character of dryden with much happiness the last poem which he publish separately be a secular ode on the revolution in 1688 it be formal and vapid but suffice to shew that time though it have check the lyric rapture have leave he he ardor in the cause of freedom like the two leader of the opposite party pitt and fox he hail with glad voice the dawn of french liberty it be only for the gifted eye of burke to foresee the storm that be impend at the same time he recommend the cause of the enslaved negro from the pulpit the abolition of the slave trade be one of the few political subject the introduction of which seem to be allowable in that place in 1788 appear also he memoirs of william whitehead attach to the posthumous work of that writer a piece of biography as little to be compare in interest to the former as whitehead himself can be compare to gray he old age glide on in solitude and peace amid he favorite pursuit at he rectory of aston where he have teach he two acre of garden to command the inequality of hill and dale and to combine use with beauty the sonnet in which he dedicate he poem to he patron the earl of holdernesse describe in he best manner the happiness he enjoy in this retreat he be not long permit to add to he other pleasure the comfort of a connubial life in 1765 he have marry mary daughter of william shermon esq of kingston-upon-hull who in two year leave he a widower she epitaph be one of those little poem to which we can always return with a melancholy pleasure i have hear that this lady have so little regard for the art in which she husband excel that on he present she with a copy of verse after the wedding be over she crumple they up and put they into she pocket unread when he have enter he seventieth year hurd who have be he first friend and the faithful monitor of he study from youth confine he to a sonnet once a year or so warn he that age like infancy should forbear to play with pointed tool he have more latitude allow in prose for in 1795 he publish essay historical and critical on english church music in the former part of he subject he be say by those who have the best means of know to be well inform and accurate but in the latter to err on the side of a dry simplicity which in the present refined state of the art it would not answer any good purpose to introduce into the music of we church in speaking of a wind instrument which william of malmsbury seem to describe as be act on by the vapor arise from hot water he have unfortunately go out of he way to ridicule the project invention of the steam-boat by lord stanhope the atrocity commit during the fury of the french revolution have so entirely cure he of he predilection for the popular part of we government that he could not resist the opportunity however ill-timed of cast a slur on this nobleman who be accuse of be over-partial to it in the third essay on parochial psalmody he give the preference to merrick 's weak and affected version over the two other translation that be use in we church the late bishop horsley in he commentary on the psalm be i believe the first who be hardy enough to claim that palm for sternhold to which with all its awkwardness he rude vigor entitle he when he come to speak of _ christianize _ we hymn the apprehension which he express of deviate from the present practice of we establishment seem to have restrain he from say something which he would otherwise have say the question surely be not so much what the practice of we present establishment be as what that of the first christian be there be perhaps no alteration in we service that could be make with better effect than this provide it be make with as great caution as its importance demand he death which be at last sudden be cause by a hurt on he shin that happen when he be step out of he carriage on the Sunday -lrb- two day after -rrb- he feel so little inconvenience from the accident as to officiate in he church at aston but on the next Wednesday the 7th of April 1797 a rapid mortification bring he to he grave he monument of which bacon be the sculptor be place in westminster abbey near that of gray with the follow inscription : -- optimo viro gulielmo mason be poetae si quis alius culto casto pio sacrum ob 7 apr 1797 aet 72 mason be report to have be ugly in he person he portrait by reynold give to feature ill-formed and gross a expression of intelligence and benignity in the latter part of life he character appear to have undergo a greater change from its primitive openness and good nature than mere time and experience of the world should have work in it perhaps this be nothing more than a slight perversion which he have contract in the school of warburton what be a coarse arrogance in the master himself assume the form of nicety and superciliousness in the less confident and better regulate temper of mason and hurd he harmless vanity cleave to he longer as a proof of this it be related that several year after the publication of isis when he be travel through oxford and happen to pass over magdalen bridge at a late hour of the evening he turn round to a friend who be ride with he and remark that it be luckily grow dusk for they should enter the university unobserved when he friend with some surprise inquire into the reason of this caution : what -lrb- say he -rrb- do you not remember my isis he be very sensible to the annoyance of the periodical critic which gray be too philosophical or too proud to regard otherwise than as matter of amusement he be the butt for a long line of satirist or lampooner churchill lloyd colman the author of the probationary ode and if i remember right paul whitehead and wolcot all level they shaft at he in turn in the probationary ode he peculiarity be well catch : when the writer of these page repeat some of the line in which he be imitate to anna seward whose admiration of mason be record in she letter she observe that what be mean for a burlesque be in itself excellent there be reason to suppose that he sometimes indulge himself in the same license under which he suffer from other if he be indeed the author of the heroic epistle to sir william chamber and of some other anonymous satire which have be imputed to he he must have feel hayley 's intended compliment as a severe reproach : sublimer mason not to thee belong the reptile beauty of invenom would song of the epistle when it be remark in the hearing of thoma warton that it have more energy than could have be expect from walpole to whom other ascribe it warton remark that it might have be write by walpole and buckram by mason indeed it be not unlikely that one supply the venom and the other spot the snake in a letter of expostulation to warton mason do not go the length of disclaim the satire though he be angry enough that it should be lay at he door i have hear that he receive with much apathy the praise offer he by hayley in the essay on epic poetry he have remark that if rhyme do not condense the sense which pass through its vehicle it cease to be good either as verse or rhyme -lrb- 2 -rrb- this rule be lay down too broadly he own practice be not always consonant with it as hayley 's never be with darwin 's poetry it be say that he be much pleased he way of compose as we learn from gray 's remark upon he poem be to cast down he first thought carelessly and at large and then clip they here and there at leisure this method as he friend observe will leave behind it a laxity a diffuseness the force of a thought -lrb- otherwise well-invented well-turned and well-placed -rrb- be often weaken by it he might have add that it be apt to give to poetry the air of declamation mason wish to join what he consider the correctness of pope with the high imaginative power of milton and the lavish coloring of spenser in the attempt to unite quality so heterogeneous the effect of each be in a great measure lose and little better than a caput mortuum remain with all he praise of simplicity he be generally much afraid of say any thing in a plain and natural manner he often express the commonest thought in a study periphrasis he be like a man who be admit into better company than he birth and education have fit he for be under continual apprehension lest he attitude and motion should betray he origin even he negligence be study he muse resemble the prioresse in chaucer that pained she to counterfete chere of court and be stateliche of manere and to be holden digne of reverence yet there be happier moment in which he deliver himself up to the ruling inspiration so it be when he compose the chorus in the caractacus begin mona on snowdon call -- hail thou harp of phrygian frame -- and hark hear ye not yon footstep dread -- of which it be scarcely too much to say that in some part they remind we of the ancient tragedian in each of he two tragedy the incident be conduct with so much skill and there be so much power of move the affection that one be tempt to wish he have pursue this line though he perhaps would never have do any thing much better in it one great fault be that the dramati persona be too much employ in point out the claude and salvator rosa with which they be surround they seem to want nothing but long pole in they hand to make they very good conductor over a gallery of picture when earl orgar on see the habitation of he daughter begin -- how nobly do this venerable wood gilt with the glory of the orient sun embosom yon fair mansion the soft air salute I with most cool and temperate breath and as i tread the flower-besprinkled lawn send up a cloud of fragance -- and aulus didius open the other play with a description somewhat more appropriate : this be the secret center of the isle : here roman pause and let the eye of wonder gaze on the solemn scene behold yon oak how stern he frown and with he broad brown arm chill the pale plain beneath he : mark yon altar the dark stream brawl round its rugged base these cliff these yawning cavern this wide circus skirt with unhewn stone : they awe my soul as if the very genius of the place himself appear would and with terrific tread stalk would through he drear domain -- we could fancy that both these personage have come fresh from the study of the english garden the distress of elfrida and the heroism of caractacus be in danger of become object of secondary consideration while we be admire the shades of harewood and the rock of mona he have attempt to shelter himself under the authority of sophocle but though there be some exquisite touch of landscape painting in that drama the poet have introduce they with a much more spare hand it be say that hurd prune away a great deal more luxuriance of this kind with which the first draught of the elfrida be overrun and we learn from gray in he admirable letter of criticism on the caractacus that the opening of that tragedy be as it at first stand even much more objectionable than at present such description be better suit to the masque a species of drama found on some wild and romantic adventure and of which the interest do not depend on the manners or the passion it be therefore more in its place in argentile and curan which he call a legendary drama write on the old english model he compose it after the other two and during the short time that he wife live but like several of he poem it be not publish till the year of he decease the beginning promise well : and the language of

be more closely connect with science in the one we must often rest contented with probability in the other we know that truth be generally to be attain and therefore expect to find it goldsmith have

prominent than be usual and he face almost round pallid and marked with the small-pox the simpleness almost approach to fatuity of he outward deportment combine with the power which there be within bring to we recollection some part of the character of la fontaine whom a french lady wittily call the fable tree from he apparent unconsciousness or rather want of mental responsibility for the admirable production which he be continually supply he propriety and clearness when he express he thought with he pen and he confusion and inability to impart they in conversation well illustrate the

adulation and imposture he complaint of the envy by which he find he mind torment and especially on the occasion of johnson 's be honor by a interview with the king must have make those who hear he lose all sense of the evil passion in they amusement at a confession so novel and so pleasant one day we be tell he complain in a mixed company of lord camden i meet he say he at lord clare 's house in the country and he take no more notice of I than if i have be a ordinary man the story of he peach-coloured coat will not soon be forget if -- -- in some man they grace serve they but as enemy goldsmith be one of those in whom they frailty be more likely to serve they as friend for they be such as could scarcely fail to assist in appease malevolence and conciliate kindness be this as it will he must with all he weakness be consider as one of the chief ornament of the age in which he live comparison have be make between the situation of the man eminent for literature in queen anne 's time and at the commencement of the reign of george the third in the former begin to be disengage from the court where they be more at home during the reign of the charlese they be fall under the influence of the nobility amongst whom they generally find they patron and often they associate in the latter they have be insensibly shake off alike by the court and the noble and be come into the hand of the people and the bookseller i know not whether they be much the worse for this change if in the one instance they be render more studious of elegance and smartness in the other they attain more freedom and force in the former they be oftener imitator of the french in the latter they follow the dictate of a better sense and trust more to they own resource they lose indeed the character of wit but they aspire to that of instructor yet in one respect and that a material one it must be own that they be sufferer by this alteration in affair for the quantity of they labor have become more important under they new master than it be under they old one they have less care of selection and they originality be weaken by diffusiveness they indulge themselves but sparingly in the luxury of compose verse which be too thriftless a occupation to be continue long they use it perhaps as the means of attract notice to themselves at they first entrance on the world but not as the staple on which they be afterwards to depend when the song have draw a band of hearer around they it have do its duty the crowd be to be detain and increase by expectation of advantage rather than of pleasure a writer consult goldsmith on what subject he might employ he pen with most profit to himself it will be better say the author of the traveller and the desert village laugh indeed but in good earnest to relinquish the draggle-tail muse for my part i have find production in prose more seek after and better pay for this be no doubt the reason that he verse bear so small a proportion to he other writings yet it be by the former add to the few work of imagination which he have leave besides that he will be know to posterity he history will probably be supersede by more skilful or more accurate compilation as they be now read by few who can obtain information nearer to its original source in the natural manner of tell a short and humorous story he be perhaps surpass by no writer of prose except addison in he essay the style preserve a middle way between the gravity of johnson and the lightness of chesterfield but it may often be object to they as to the moral writings of johnson that they present life to we under a gloomy aspect and leave a impression of despondence on the mind of the reader in he poetry there be nothing ideal it please chiefly by a exhibition of nature in she most homely and familiar view but from these he select he object with due discretion and omit to represent whatever would occasion unmingled pain or disgust he couplet have the same slow and stately march as johnson 's and if we can suppose similar image of rural and domestic life to have arrest the attention of that writer we can scarcely conceive that he would have express they in different language some of the line in the desert village be say to be closely copy from a poem by welsted call the _ -lrb- greek : oikographium -rrb- _ but i do not think he will be find to have levy larger contribution on it than most poet have suppose themselves justified in make on the neglect work of they predecessor the following particulars relate to this poem which i have extract from the letter of dr strean before refer to can not fail to gratify that numerous class of reader with whom it have be a favorite from they earliest year the poem of the desert village take its origin from the circumstance of general robert napper -lrb- the grandfather of the gentleman who now live in the house within half a mile of lissoy and build by the general -rrb- have purchase a extensive tract of the country surround lissoy or _ auburn _ in consequence of which many family here call _ cottier _ be remove to make room for the intended improvement of what be now to become the wide domain of a rich man warm with the idea of change the face of he new acquisition and be force _ with faint step _ to go in search of _ torrid tract _ and _ distant clime _ this fact alone might be sufficient to establish the seat of the poem but there can not remain a doubt in any unprejudiced mind when the follow be add viz that the character of the village-preacher the above-named henry -lrb- the brother of the poet -rrb- be copy from nature he be describe exactly as he live and he modest mansion as it exist burn the name of the village-master and the site of he school-house and _ catherine giraghty _ a lonely widow the wretched matron force in age for bread to strip the brook with mantle cress spread -lrb- and to this day the brook and ditch near the spot where she cabin stand abound with cress -rrb- still remain in the memory of the inhabitant and _ catherine 's _ child live in the neighborhood the pool the busy mill the house where _ nut-brown draught inspire _ be still visit as the poetic scene and the _ hawthorn-bush _ grow in a open space in front of the house which i know to have three trunk be now reduce to one the other two have be cut from time to time by person carry away piece of it to be make into toy & c in honor of the bard and of the celebrity of he poem all these contribute to the same proof and the _ decent church _ which i attend for upward of eighteen year and which _ top the neighbouring hill _ be exactly describe as see from lissoy the residence of the preacher i should have observe that elizabeth delap who be a parishioner of mine and die at the age of about ninety often tell I she be the first who put a book into goldsmith 's hand by which she mean that she teach he he letter : she be ally to he and keep a little school the hermit be a please little tale tell with that simplicity which appear so easy and be in fact so difficult to be obtain it be imitate in the ballad of a friar of order gray in percy 's relique of english poetry he traveller be it be say pronounce by mr fox to be one of the finest piece in the english language perhaps this sentence be deliver by that great man with some qualification which be either forget or omit by the reporter of it otherwise such praise be surely disproportion to its object in this poem he profess to compare the good and evil which fall to the share of those different nation whose lot he contemplate he design at set out be to shew that whether we consider the blessing to be derive from art or from nature we shall discover a equal portion deal to all mankind and the conclusion which he draw at the end of the poem would be perfectly just if these premise be allow he in every government though terror reign though tyrant king or tyrant law restrain how small of all that human heart endure that part which law or king can cause or cure still to ourselves in every place consign would we own felicity we make or find : with secret course which no loud stream annoy glide the smooth current of domestic joy the lift axe the agonizing wheel luke 's iron crown and damien 's bed of steel to man remote from power but rarely know leave reason faith and conscience all we own that it matter little or nothing to the happiness of man whether they be govern well or ill whether they live under fix and know law or at the will of a arbitrary tyrant be a paradox the fallacy of which be happily too apparent to need any refutation nor be he inference warrant by those particular observation which he make for the purpose of establish it when of italy he tell we that sensual bliss be all this nation know how be italy to be compare either with itself when it be prompt by those noble aim of which he speak or with that country where he see the lord of human kind pass by intent on high design a thoughtful band by form unfashion would fresh from nature 's hand fierce in they native hardiness of soul true to imagine right above controul while e ` en the peasant learn these rights to scan and learn to venerate himself as man that good be every where balance by some evil none will deny but that no effort of human courage or prudence can make one scale preponderate over the other and that a decree of fate have fix they in eternal equipoise be a opinion which if it be seriously entertain must bind man to a tame and spiritless acquiescence in whatever disadvantage or inconvenience they may chance to find themselves involve and leave to they the exercise of no other public virtue than that of a blind submission he poetry be happily better than he argument he discriminate with much skill the manners of the several country that pass in review before he the illustration with which he relieve and vary he main subject be judiciously intersperse and as he never raise he tone too far beyond he pitch at the first start so he seldom sink much below it the think at the beginning appear to have pleased he for he have repeat it in the citizen of the world : where'er i roam whatever realm to see my heart untravel would fondly turn to thee still to my brother turn with ceaseless pain and drag at each remove a lengthen chain the further i travel i feel the pain of separation with stronger force those tie that bind I to my native country and you be still unbroken by every remove i only drag a greater length of chain to the poetical composition of goldsmith in general may be apply with justice that temperate commendation which he have give to the work of parnell in he life of that poet at the end of he course the reader regret that he way have be so short he wonder that it give he so little trouble and so resolve to go the journey over again there be much to solace fatigue and even to excite pleasure but nothing to call forth rapture we stay to contemplate and enjoy the object on we road but we feel that it be on this earth we have be travel and that the author be either not willing or not able to raise we above it no writer in the english language have combine such various

venture to intimate the sensuality of one part of it to its author he himself immediately refer to the passage which be likely to have raise the objection and on another occasion as if to counteract this prejudice in the mind of one whose confidence he might be desirous of obtain he recommend to he the study of paley 's moral philosophy in 1781 he marry he second wife the widow of colonel pole of

mechanism in spite of the trouble of ireland the use of turn aside or downwards the claw of a table i do not see as it must be rear against a wall for it will not stand alone if the use be for carriage the foot may shut up like the usual brass foot of a reflect telescope we have all be now remove from derby about a fortnight to the priory and all of we like we change of situation we have a pleasant home a good garden pond full of fish and a please valley somewhat like shenstone 's -- deep umbrageous and with a talkative stream run down it we home be near the top of the valley well screen by hill from the east and north and open to the south where at four mile ' distance we see derby tower four or more strong spring rise near the house and have form the valley which like that of petrarch may be call valchiusa as it begin or be shut at the situation of the house i hope you like the description and hope farther that yourself or any part of you family will sometime do I the pleasure of a visit pray tell the authoress that the water-nymph of we valley will be happy to assist she next novel my bookseller mr johnson will not begin to print the temple of nature till the price of paper be fix by parliament i suppose the present duty be pay \* \* \* \* \* to this imperfect sentence be add on the opposite side by another hand sir -- this family be in the greatest affliction i be truly grieve to inform you of the death of the invaluable dr darwin dr darwin get up apparently in good health about eight o'clock he ring the library bell the servant who go say he appear faint he revive again mr darwin be immediately call the doctor speak often but soon appear fainting and die about one o'clock we dear mrs darwin and family be inconsolable : they affliction be great indeed there be few such husband or father he will be most deservedly lament by all who have the honor of be know to he i remain sir you obedient humble servant sm p this letter be begin this morning by dr darwin himself the complaint which thus suddenly terminate he life in he seventy-first year be the angina pectori the temple of nature be print in the year after he death but the public have either read enough of he writings or be occupy with other thing for little attention be pay to this poetical bequest that ingenious burlesque of he manner the love of the triangle probably contribute to loosen the spell by which he have for a while take the general ear he person be well describe by he biographer miss seward as be above the middle size he form athletic and he limb too heavy for exact proportion he countenance mark by the trace of a severe small-pox and when not animated by social pleasure rather saturnine than sprightly in youth he exterior be render agreeable by florid health and a smile that indicate good-humour he portrait by wright of derby give a very exact but inanimate representation of he form and feature in justice to the painter it must be tell that i believe the likeness to have be take after death in he medical practice he be by some accuse of empiricism from this charge both miss seward and mr edgeworth have i think justly vindicate he the former have record a project which he suggest on the suppose authority of some old practitioner but which he do not execute for cure one of he consumptive patient by the transfusing of blood from the vein of a person in health i have be tell that when a mother who seem to be in the paroxysm of a delirium express a earnest wish to take she infant into she arm and she attendant be fearful of indulge she lest she should do some violence to the object of she affection he desire they to commit it to she without apprehension and that the result be a immediate abatement of she disorder this be a instance rather of strong sagacity than of extraordinary boldness for nothing less than a well-founded confidence in the safety of the experiment could have induce he to hazard it i know not whether it be worth relate that when send for to a nobleman at buxton who conceive he health to have suffer by the use of tea to which he be immoderately addict darwin ring the bell and order a pot of strong green tea to be bring up and fill both he patient 's cup and he own encourage he to frequent and lavish draught i have hear that he be impatient of inquiry which related to diet thinking i suppose that after the age of childhood in ordinary case each person might regulate it best for himself but from a almost entire abstinence from fermented liquor he be both by precept and example a strenuous adviser he believe say miss edgeworth in she memoirs of she father that almost all the distemper of the higher class of people arise from drinking in some form or other too much vinous spirit to this he attribute the aristocratic disease of gout the jaundice and all bilious or liver complaint in short all the family of pain this opinion he support in he writings with the force of he eloquence and reason and still more in conversation by all those power of wit satire and peculiar humor which never appear fully to the public in he work but which gain he strong ascendancy in private society during he lifetime he almost banish wine from the table of the rich of he acquaintance and persuade most of the gentry in he own and the neighbouring county to become water-drinker here i doubt miss edgeworth have a little over-rated the extent of he influence partly in jest and partly in earnest he express he suspicion and carry he inference on this subject to a preposterous excess when he hear that my father be bilious he suspect that this must be the consequence of he have since he residence in ireland and in compliance with the fashion of the country indulge too freely in drink he letter i remember conclude with -- farewell my dear friend god keep you from whiskey -- if he can he opinion respect the safety of inoculate for the small-pox at a proper age as it be express in the follow letter to the writer of these page will be satisfactory to such parent as be yet unconvinced of the efficacy of vaccination and he opinion be the more valuable because it be give at a time when there be neither prejudice nor prepossession on the subject _ derby oct _ 9 1797 dear sir -- on the best inquiry i have be able to make to-day i can not hear that the small-pox be in derby i can only add that all those who have die by inoculation whom i have hear of these last twenty year have be child at the breast on which account it may be safer to defer inoculation till four or five year old if there be otherwise no hazard of take the disease naturally i be & c e darwin on the account which he patient give he of they own malady he place so little dependence that he think it necessary to wring the truth from they as a lawyer would do from a unwilling witness he general distrust of other in all that related to themselves be well exemplify by a casual remark that have be lately repeat to I by a respectable dignitary of the church to whom when he be apologize for he want of skill in the game of chess at which they be go to play darwin answer that he make it a rule not to believe either the good or the harm that man speak of themselves this want of reliance in the sincerity of those with whom he converse have be attribute with some color of reason to he habitual scepticism on matter of higher moment mr fellowe have observe of he that he dwell so much and so exclusively on second cause that he seem to have forget that there be a first there be no solution of natural effect to which he be not ready to listen provide it would assist he in get rid of what he consider a unnecessary intervention of the supreme be a fiber capable of irritability be with he enough to account not only for the origin of animal life but for its progress through all its stage he have thus involve himself in the grossest materialism but be endue with a active fancy he engender on it theory so wild and chimerical that they might be regard with the same kind of wonder as the fiction of romance if we pleasure be not continually check by remember the error in which they originate what more prodigious transformation shall we read of in ovid than that which he suppose the organ of he strange en to have undergo during the change of we globe from moist to dry as in dry air the sea-born stranger rove each muscle quicken and each sense improve cold gill aquatic form respire lung and sound aerial flow from slimy tongue _ temple of nature _ c 1 the peculiarity of the shape of animal

they come in afterwards as matter of course and in a manner so easy and natural that the only wonder be what have keep they wait so long he mention with something like approbation the hypothesis of buffon and helvetius who as he tell we seem to imagine that mankind arise from one family of monkey on the bank of the mediterranean who accidentally have learn to use the adductor pollici or that strong muscle which constitute the ball of the thumb and draw the point of it to meet the point of the finger which common monkey do not and that this muscle gradually increase in size strength and activity in successive generation and that by this improve use of the sense of the touch monkey acquire clear idea and gradually become man to this he gravely add that perhaps all the production of nature be in they progress to greater perfection a idea countenance by modern discovery and deduction concern the progressive formation of the solid part of this terraqueous globe and consonant of the dignity of the creator he description of the way in which clear idea be acquire be not much improve when he put it into verse nerve with fine touch above the bestial throng the hand first gift of

darwin : cowper who certainly be as firm a believer as johnson think it no disparagement to he orthodoxy to address some complimentary verse to he on the publication of he botanic garden this poem ought not to be consider more than as a capriccio or sport of the fancy on which he have expend much labor to little purpose it do not pretend to anything like correctness of design or continuity of action it be like a picture of breughel 's where every thing be highly color and every thing out of order in the first part call the economy of vegetation the goddess of botany appear with she attendant the power of the four element for no other purpose than to describe to they they several function in carry on the operation of nature in the second which have no necessary connection with the first the botanic muse describe the love of the plant here the fiction be puerile and build on a system which be itself in danger of vanish into air at the end of the second canto the muse take a dish of tea which i think be the only thing of any consequence that be do throughout the second part have be charge with a immoral tendency but miss seward have observe with much truth that it be a burlesque upon morality to make the amours of the plant responsible at its tribunal and that the impurity be in the imagination of the reader not in the page of the poet for these amours he might have find a better motto than that which he have prefix from claudian in the follow stanza of marinus ne ' fior ne ' fiori istessi amor ha loco ama il giglio il ligustro e l'amaranto e narciso e giacinto ajace e croco e con la bellum clitium il vago acanto arde la rosa di vermiglio foco l'odor sospiro e la rugiada e pianto : ride la calta e pallida e essangue vinta d'amor la violetta langue _ adone _

shower in which there should be represent a red-breast hold up a expand umbrella in its claw a italian critic follow a division make by plotinus have distribute the poet into three class which he call the musical the amatorial and the philosophic in the first he place those who be studious of softness and harmony in they number in the second such as content themselves with describe accurately the outward appearance of real or fanciful object and in the third those who penetrate to the quality of thing draw out they hidden beauty and separate what be really and truly fair from that which have only its exterior semblance among the second of these darwin might claim for himself no mean station it be indeed a notion he have take up that as the idea derive from visible object -lrb- to use he own word -rrb- be more distinct than those derive from any other source the word expressive of those idea belong to vision make up the principal part of poetic language so entirely be he engross by this persuasion as too frequently to forget that the admirer of poetry have not only eye but ear and heart also and that therefore harmony and pathos be require of the poet no less than a faithful delineation of visible object yet there be something in he versification also that may be consider as he own he number have less resemblance to pope 's than pope 's to those of dryden whether the novelty be such as to reflect much credit on the inventor be another question he secret be i think to take those line in pope which seem to he the most diligently elaborate and to model he own upon they but with those form of verse which he borrow more particularly from pope in which one part be equally balance by the other and of which each be complete in itself without reference to those which precede or follow it he have mingle one or two other that have be use by we elder poet but almost entirely reject by the refiner of the couplet measure till the time of langhorne as where the

little apparent effort what he have himself feel or conceive as in he ballad and song he be at time eminently happy he have generally err on the side of the too much rather than of the too little he defect be not so much want of genius as of taste he thought be forcible and vivid but the word in which he clothe they be sometimes ill-chosen and sometimes awkwardly dispose he degenerate occasionally into mere turgidness and verbosity as in the follow line : oh partner of my infant grief and joy big with the scene now past my heart o'erflow bid each endearment fair at once to rise and dwell luxurious on she melting woe when he stanza force he to lop off this vain superfluity of word that the sense might be bring within a narrower compass he succeed better who would suppose that

to meet and join it a little beyond the limit of this world yet in this tale incongruous and disjointed as the dream of a sick man velut aegrus somnium he have intersperse some line and even whole

on mary queen of scot be also a vision but it be better manage at once mournful and sweet he have throw a pall of gorgeous embroidery over the bloody hearse of mary wolfwold and ellum of which the story be suggest by a picture of mortimer 's be itself a picture in which the fine coloring and spirited attitude reconcile we to its horror he tragedy be a tissue of love and intrigue with sudden start of passion and unprepared and improbable turn of resolution and temper towards the conclusion one of the female character put a end to herself for little apparent reason except that it be the fifth act and some blood must therefore be shed garrick 's refusal in all likelihood spare he the worse mortification of see it reject on the stage yet there be here and there in it a masterly touch like the following : either my mind have lose its energy or the unbodied spirit of my father beneath the night 's dark wing pass to and fro in doleful agitation hover round I methought my father with a mournful look behold I sudden from unconscious pause i wak would and but he marble bust be here almada hill have some just sentiment and some please imagery but both be involve in the maze of a unskilful or ambitious phraseology from which it be a work of trouble to extricate they it be about this time that the labored style in poetry have reach its height not to loiter into prose of which lyttelton bid he beware be the grand aim and in they eagerness to leave prose as far behind they as possible the poet be in danger of outstrip the understanding and feeling of they reader it be this want of ease and perspicuity in he longer piece which prevent mickle from be as much a favorite with the public as many who be far he inferior in the other quality of a poet when a writer be obscure only because he reasoning be too abstruse he fancy too lively or he allusion too learn for the vulgar it be more just that we should complain of ourselves for not be able to rise to he level than of he for not descend to we 's but let the difficulty arise from mere imperfection of language and the consciousness of have solve a involuntary enigma be scarcely sufficient to reward we pain the translation of the lusiad be that by which he be best know in this as in he original poem the expression be sometimes very faulty but he be never flat or insipid in the number there be much sweetness and freedom : and though they have somewhat of the masculine melody of dryden yet they have something also that be peculiarly he own he have in a few instance enrich the language of poetry by combination unborrowed from any of he predecessor it be doubtful whether as much can be say for pope 's translation of homer almost all who have write much in the couplet measure since waller clip it into uniformity have be at time reduce to the necessity of eke out they line in some way or other so as to make the sense reach its prescribe bind most have do it by means of epithet which be always find to be friend in need mickle either break the line with a freedom and spirit which be then unusual or repeat something of what have go before a contrivance that ought to be employ sparingly and use chiefly when it be desirable to produce the effect of sweetness the preference which he sometimes claim in the note for he author above the other epic poet of ancient and modern time be less likely to conciliate the good opinion than to excite the disgust of he reader there be no artifice that a translator can resort to with less chance of success than this blowing of the showman 's trumpet as he go on exhibit the wonder of he original there be some puerile hyperbole for which i know not whether he or camoen be responsible such as -- the mountain echo catch the big swoln sigh the yellow sand with tear be silver would o'er johnson tell he that he have once intend to translate the lusiad the version would have have fewer fault but it may be question whether the general result

the poet at the age of fourteen he be send to marischal college aberdeen where he attend the greek class teach by dr blackwell author of the memoirs of the court of augustus and be by he single out as the most promising of he scholar the slender pittance spare he by he mother would scarcely have suffice for he support if he have not add to it one of the bursary or pension that be bestow on the most deserving candidate of a discourse which he be call on to deliver at the divinity hall it be observe that he speak poetry in prose thomson be censure for a similar impropriety in one of he youthful

village of fordoun about six mile distant from laurencekirk here he attract the notice of mr garden at that time sheriff of the county and afterwards one of the scotch judge with the appellation of lord gardenstown in a romantic glen near he house he chance to find beattie with pencil and paper in he hand and on question he discover that he be engage in the composition of a poem mr garden desire to see some of he other poem and doubt whether they be he own production request he to translate the invocation to venus at the opening of lucretius which beattie do in such a manner as to remove he incredulity in this retirement he also become know to lord monboddo whose family seat be in the parish and a friendly intercourse ensue which do not terminate till the death of that learn but visionary man in 1758 he be remove from he employment at fordoun to that of usher in the grammar school at aberdeen for which he have be a unsuccessful competitor in the preceding year but be now nominate without the form of a trial at aberdeen he heart seem to have take up its rest for no temptation could afterwards seduce he for any length of time to quit it the professorship of natural philosophy in the marischal college where he have lately be a student be vacant in 1760 mr arbuthnot one of he friend exert himself with so much zeal in the behalf of beattie that he obtain that appointment although the promotion be such as he most sanguine wish do not aspire to soon after he be further gratify by be permit to exchange it for the professorship of moral philosophy and logic for which he think himself better fit in discharge of the duty belong to he new function he immediately enter on a course of lecture which as appear from he diary in the possession of sir william forbe he repeat with much diligence for more than thirty year this occupation could not have be very favourable to he poetical propensity he have since he twentieth year be occasionally a contributor of verse to the scot magazine and in 1760 he publish a collection of poem inscribe to the earl of erroll to whose intervention he have be partly indebted for the office he hold in the college though the number of these piece be not considerable he omit several of they in subsequent edition and among other a translation of virgil 's eclogue some specimen of which adduce in a letter write by lord woodhouselee author of the principle of translation will stand a comparison with the parallel passage in dryden and warton in the summer of 1763 he curiosity lead he for the first time to london where andrew millar the bookseller be almost he only acquaintance of this journey no particular be record but that he visit pope 's house at twickenham in 1765 have send a letter of compliment to gray then on a visit to the earl of strathmore he be invite to glammi castle the residence of that nobleman to meet the english poet in whom he find such a combination of excellence as he have hitherto be a stranger to this appear from a letter write to sir william forbe he faithful friend and biographer with whom he intimacy commence about the same time i be sorry you do not see mr gray on he return you would have be much pleased with he set aside he merit as a poet which however in my opinion be greater than any of he contemporary can boast in this or in any other nation i find he possess of the most exact taste the soundest judgment and the most extensive learn he be happy in a singular facility of expression he conversation abound in original observation deliver with no appearance of sententious formality and seem to arise spontaneously without study or premeditation i pass two very agreeable day with he at glammi and find he as easy in he manners and as communicative and frank as i could have wish gray could not have requite he with such excess of admiration but continue during the rest of he life to regard beattie with affection and esteem it be not till the spring of this year when he judgment of pari be print that he again appear before the public as a author this piece he insert in the next edition of he poem in 1766 but he more mature judgment afterwards induce he to reject it some satirical verse on the death of churchill at first publish without he name undergo the same fate the wolf and the shepherd a fable and a epistle to the rev mr thoma blacklock which appear in the second edition he also discard from those subsequently publish he now project and begin the minstrel the most popular of he poem have the original plan be adhere to it would have embrace a much wider scope in 1767 he marry mary the daughter of dr dun rector of the grammar school at aberdeen this union be not productive of the happiness which a long course of previous intimacy have entitle he to expect the object of he choice inherit from she mother a constitutional malady which at first shewed itself in capricious waywardness and at length break out into insanity from this misery he seek refuge in the exercise of he mind he residence at aberdeen have bring he into the society of several among he countryman who be engage in research well suit to employ he attention to its utmost stretch of these the name of reid author of a inquiry into the human mind on the principle of common sense -- and campbell principal of marischal college author of a essay on miracle be the most distinguished he own correspondence with he friend about this time evince deep concern at the progress of the sceptical philosophy diffuse by the writings of hobbe hume mandeville and even in he opinion of locke and berkeley conceive the study of metaphysics itself to be the origin of this mischief in order that the evil might be intercept at its source he propose to demonstrate the futility of that science and to appeal to the common sense and unsophisticated feeling of mankind as the only infallible criterion on subject in which it have formerly be make the standard that he meaning be excellent no one can doubt whether he discover the right remedy for the harm which he be desirous of remove be much more questionable to magnify any branch of human knowledge beyond its just importance may indeed tend to weaken the force of religious faith but many acute metaphysican have be good christian and before the question thus agitate can be set at rest we must suppose a certain proficiency in those inquiry which he would proscribe as dangerous after all we can discover no more reason why sciolist in metaphysics should bring that study into discredit than that religion itself should be disparage through the extravagance of fanaticism to have meet the subject fully he ought to have shewn that not only those opinion which he controvert be erroneous but that all the system of former metaphysician be so likewise the essay on truth in which he endeavor to establish he own hypothesis be finish in 1769 he employ sir william forbe and mr arbuthnot to negotiate its sale with the bookseller they however refuse to purchase it on any term and the work would have remain unpublished if he two friend make use of a little pious fraud have not inform he that the manuscript be sell for fifty guinea a sum which they at the same time remit he and that they have stipulate with the bookseller to be partaker in the profit the book accordingly appear in the following year and have gain many admirer be quickly follow by a second impression which he revise and correct with much pain in the autumn of 1771 he again visit london where the reputation obtain by the essay and by the first book of the minstrel then recently publish open for he a introduction into the circle most respectable for rank and literature lord lyttelton declare that it seem to he he once most beloved minstrel thomson be come down from heaven refine by the converse of purer spirit than those he live with here to let he hear he sing again the beauty of nature and the finest feeling of virtue not with human but with angelic strain he add he wish that it be in he power to do beattie any service from mr montagu he on different occasion receive more substantial token of regard except the trifling emolument derive from he writings he have hitherto be support merely by the small income append to he professorship but the earl of dartmouth a nobleman to whom nothing that concern the interest of religion be indifferent represent he as a fit object of the royal bounty a pension of two hundred pound a year be now grant he previously to he obtain this favor he be first present to the king and be then honor by a interview with both they majesty the particulars of this visit be minutely record in he diary after much commendation of he essay the sovereign pleasantly tell he that he have never steal but one book and that be he i steal it from the queen say he majesty to give it to lord hertford to read in the course of the conversation many question be put to he concern the scotch university the revenue of the scotch clergy and they mode of preach and pray when beattie reply that they clergy sometimes pray a quarter or even half a hour without interruption the king observe that this practice must lead into repetition and that even we own liturgy excellent as it be be faulty in this respect while the subject of he pension be under consideration the queen make a tender of some present to he through dr majendie but he decline to encroach on she majesty 's munificence unless the application make to the crown in he behalf should prove unsuccessful a mercenary spirit indeed be not one of he weakness be on a visit at bulstrode he noble hostess the duchess of portland would have have he take a present of a hundred pound to defray the expense of he journey into england but he excuse himself as well as he be able for not accept she grace 's bounty with he pension he wish appear to have be bound temptation to enter into order in we church be thrice offer he and as often reject once in the shape of a general promise of patronage from dr drummond archbishop of york next of a small living in dorsetshire in the gift of mr john pitt : and the third time of a much more valuable benefice which be at the disposal of dr thoma bishop of winchester in answer to dr porteus through whom the last of these offer come and whose friendship he enjoy during the remainder of he life he represent in addition to other reason for he refusal that he be apprehensive lest he acceptance of preferment might render the motive for he write the essay on truth suspect he at the same time avowed that if he be to have become a clergyman the church of england would certainly have be he choice as he think that in regard to church-government and church-service it have many great and peculiar advantage unwillingness to part from aberdeen be perhaps at the bottom of these stout resolution it be confessedly one of the reason for which he decline a proposition make to he in the year 1773 to remove to the chair of moral philosophy in edinburgh though he be urge by he friend not to neglect this opportunity of extend the sphere of he usefulness and the change would have bring he much pecuniary advantage he reluctance to comply be increase by the belief that there be certain person at edinburgh to whom he principle have give offence and in whose neighborhood he do not expect to live so quietly as he wish in the same year he be compliment with the honorary degree of doctor of law by the university of oxford at the installation of lord north in the chancellorship he now therefore live on at aberdeen make occasionally brief visit to england where he be always welcome both at the court and by those many individual of eminence to whom he talent and virtue have recommend he in the summer he usually indulge himself with pass some time at peterhead a town situate on the most easterly promontory of scotland and resort to for its medicinal water which he think beneficial to he health for he have early in life be subject to a vertiginous disorder the recurrence of which at time incapacitate he for any serious application the second book of the minstrel appear in 1774 in 1776 he be prevail on to publish by subscription in a more splendid form he essay on truth which be now accompany by two other essay on poetry and music and on laughter and ludicrous composition and by remark on the utility of classical learning this be succeed in 1783 by dissertation moral and critical on memory and imagination on dream on the theory of language on fable and romance on the attachment of kindred and on illustration of sublimity be as he state in the preface part of a course of prelection read to those young gentleman whom it be he business to initiate in the element of moral science in 1786 he publish a small treatise entitle evidence of the christian religion at the suggestion of porteus who be now a bishop and in 1790 and 1793 two volume of element of moral science contain a abridgment of he public lecture on moral philosophy and logic he only remain publication be a edition of the juvenile work of the elder of he two son who be take off by a consumption -lrb- November 1790 -rrb- at the age of twenty-two to the education of this boy he have attend with such care and discernment as the anxiety of a parent only could dictate and have watch he unfold excellence with fondness such as none but a parent could feel at the risque of tell my reader what he may perhaps well remember i can not but relate the method which he have take to impress on he mind when a child the sense of he dependence on a supreme being of which porteus well observe that it have all the imagination of rousseau without he folly and extravagance the doctrine of religion say beattie i have wish to impress on he mind as soon as it might be prepare to receive they but i do not see the propriety of make he commit to memory theological sentence or any sentence which it be not possible for he to understand and i be desirous to make a trial how far he own reason could go in trace out with a little direction the great and first principle of all religion the being of god the follow fact be mention not as a proof of superior sagacity in he -lrb- for i have no doubt that most child would in like circumstance think as he do -rrb- but merely as a moral or logical experiment he have reach he fifth or sixth year know the alphabet and could read a little but have receive no particular information with respect to the author of he be : because i think he could not yet understand such information and because i have learn from my own experience that to be make to repeat word not understand be extremely detrimental to the faculty of a young mind in a corner of a little garden without inform any person of the circumstance i write in the mould with my finger the three initial letter of he name and sowing garden cress in the furrow cover up the seed and smooth the ground ten day after he come run to I and with astonishment in he countenance tell I that he name be grow in the garden i smile at the report and seem incline to disregard it but he insist on my go to see what have happen ` yes ' say i carelessly on come to the place ' i see it be so but there be nothing in this worth notice it be mere chance ' and i go away he follow I and take hold of my coat say with some earnestness ` it could not be mere chance for that somebody must have contrived matter so as to produce it ' i pretend not to give he word or my own for i have forget both but i give the substance of what pass between we in such language as we both understand -- ` so you think ' i say ` that what appear so regular as the letter of you name can not be by chance ' ` yes ' say he with firmness ' i think so ' ` look at yourself ' i reply ` and consider you hand and finger you leg and foot and other limb be they not regular in they appearance and useful to you ' he say ` they be ' ` come you then hither ' say i ` by chance ' ` no ' he answer ` that can not be something must have make I ' ` and who be that something ' i ask he say ` he do not know ' -lrb- i take particular notice that he do not say as rousseau fancy a child in like circumstance would say that he parent make he -rrb- i have now gain the point i aim at and see that he reason teach he -lrb- though he could not so express it -rrb- that what begin to be must have a intelligent cause i therefore tell he the name of the great be who make he and all the world concern whose adorable nature i give he such information as i think he could in some measure comprehend the lesson affect he greatly and he never forget either it or the circumstance that introduce it so great be the docility of this boy that before he have reach he twentieth year he have be think capable of succeed he father in he office of public professor when death have extinguish those hope the comfort and expectation of the parent be direct to he only survive child who with less application and patience have yet a quickness of perception that promise to supply the place of those quality but this prospect do not continue to cheer he long in march 1796 the youth be attack by a fever which in seven day lay he by the side of he brother he be in he eighteenth year the sole consolation with which this world could now supply beattie be that if he son have live he might have see they a prey to that miserable distemper under which they mother whose state have render a separation from she family unavoidable be still labor from this total bereavement he sometimes find a short relief in the estrangement of he own mind which refuse to support the recollection of such a load of sorrow many time say sir william forbe he could not recollect what have become of he son and after search in every room of the house he would say to he niece ` mr glennie you may think it strange but i must ask you if i have a son and where he be ' that man must be a stern moralist who would censure he very severely for have seek as he sometimes do a renewal of this oblivion in he cup he be unable any longer to apply himself to study and leave most of the letter he receive from he friend unanswered music in which he have formerly delighted he could not endure to hear from other after the loss of he first son though a few month before the death of the second he have begin to accompany he when he sing on he own favorite instrument which be the violoncello afterwards as may be suppose the sound of it be painful to he he still take some pleasure in book and in the company of a very few amongst he oldest friend this be he condition till the beginning of April 1799 when he be seize with a paralytic stroke which render he speech imperfect for several day during the rest of he life he have repeat attack of the same malady : the last which happen on the 5th of October 1802 entirely deprive he of motion he languish however till the 18th of August in the following year when nature be exhaust he expire without a struggle he be inter accord to he own desire by the side of he two son in the churchyard of st nichola at aberdeen with the follow inscription from the pen of dr jame gregory professor of physic at edinburgh memoria sacrum jacobus beattie lld ethice in academia marescallana hujus urbi per xliii anno professori

aetati xxiii geo et mar glennie hmp in he person say sir william forbes doctor beattie be of the middle size though not elegantly yet not awkwardly form but with something of a slouch in he gait he eye be black and pierce with a expression of sensibility somewhat border on melancholy except when engage in cheerful and social intercourse with he friend when they be exceedingly animated in a portrait of he take in middle life by reynold and give to he as a mark of he regard by the painter he be represent with he essay on truth under he arm at a little distance be introduce the allegorical figure of truth as a angel holding in one hand a balance and with the other thrust back the visage of prejudice scepticism and folly he be i believe the solitary instance of a poet have receive so much countenance at the court of george the third and this favor he owe less to any other cause than to the zeal and ability with which he have be think to oppose the enemy of religion the respect with which he be treat both at home and abroad be no more than a just tribute to those merit and the excellence of he private character he probity and disinterestedness the extreme tenderness with which he acquit himself of all he domestic duty he attention to the improvement of he pupil for whose welfare he solicitude do not cease with they removal from the college he unassuming deportment which have not be alter by prosperity or by the caress of the learn and the powerful he gratitude to those from whom he have receive favor he beneficence to the poor the ardor of he devotion be dwell on by he biographer with a earnestness which leave we no room to doubt the sincerity of the encomium he chief defect be a irritability of temper in the latter part of he life which shew itself principally towards those who differ from he on speculative question in he writings he be to be consider as a philosopher a critic and a poet he pretension in philosophy be found on he essay on truth this book be of much use at its first appearance as it contain a popular answer to some of the infidel writer who be then in better odour among the more educate class of society than happily they now be if -lrb- as i suspect to have be the case -rrb- it have prevent man whose rank and influence make it most desirable that they mind should be raise above the common pitch from pursue those study by which they be most likely so to raise they the good which it may have do have be balance by no inconsiderable evil one can scarcely examine it with much attention and not perceive that the writer have not ascend to the source of that science which notwithstanding any thing he may say to the contrary it be evidently he aim to depreciate through great part of it he have the appearance of one who be struggle with some unknown power which he would fain comprehend and at which in the failure to comprehend it he terror be change into anger the word metaphysics or as he oftener term it metaphysic cross he like a ghost call it pneumatology the philosophy of the mind the philosophy of human nature or what you will and he can bear it take any shape but that and he firm nerve shall never tremble once indeed -lrb- but it be not till he have reach the third and last division of the essay -rrb- he screw up he courage so high as to question it concern its name and the result of he inquiry be this : he find that to fourteen of the book attribute to aristotle which it seem have no general title andronicus rhodius who edit they prefix the word ta meta ta physica that be the book place posterior to the physics either because in the order of the former arrangement they happen to be so place or because the editor mean that they should be study next after the physics and this he conclude be say to be the origin of the word metaphysic this be not very satisfactory and if the reader think so he will perhaps be glad to hear those who have deal longer in the black art be more likely to be conjuror in it harri who have give so many year of he life to the study of aristotle tell we that metaphysics be properly conversant about primary and internal cause -lrb- 1 -rrb- those thing which be first to nature be not first to man nature begin from cause and thence descend to effect human perception first open upon effect and thence by slow degree ascend to cause -lrb- 2 -rrb- he own definition might have be enough to satisfy he that it be something very harmless about which he have so much alarmed himself still he proceed to impute to it i know not what mischief till at last in a paroxysm of indignation he exclaim exult o metaphysic at the consummation of thy glory more thou canst not hope more thou canst not desire fall down ye mortal and acknowledge the stupendous blessing about aristotle himself he be scarce in less perplexity he set out by define truth accord to aristotle 's description of it in these fourteen dreaded book of he metaphysics again he tell we he be most admire by those who best understand he and once more refer we to these fourteen book but afterwards it would seem as if he have not himself read they for speaking of _ metaphysics _ he call it that which aristotle be say to have call theology and the first philosophy : whereas aristotle have explicitly call it so in these fourteen book -lrb- 3 -rrb- and when he be recommend the study of the ancient he add of aristotle i say nothing we be assure by those who have read he work that no one ever understand human nature better than he what be we to infer from this but that he have not himself read they for he distinction between common sense and reason on which all he theory depend he send the reader to the fourth book of aristotle 's metaphysics and to the first of he latter analytic and yet somewhere else he speak of these as the most worthless of aristotle 's writings as for plato who on such a subject might have come in for some consideration we be tell that he be as much a rhetorician as a philosopher and this i think be nearly all we hear of he beattie be among the philosopher what the quaker be among religious sectary the -lrb- greek : koino nous -rrb- or common sense be the spirit whose illaps he sit down and wait for and by whose whisper alone he expect to be make wise it have sometimes prompt he well for there be admirable passage in the essay the whole train of he argument or rather he invective in the second part against the sceptic be irresistible scalda ognus fredda lingua ardente voglium e di sterili fa l'alme feconde ne mai deriva altronde soave finme d'eloquenza rara -- _ celio magno _ what come from the heart that alone go to the heart say a great writer of we own day -lrb- 4 -rrb- and there be few instance of this more convincing than the vehemence with which beattie dissipate the reverie of berkeley and refute the absurdity of hume in the second edition -lrb- 1771 -rrb- speaking of those writer of genius to whom he would send the student away from the metaphysician he confine himself to shakespeare bacon montesquieu and rousseau few will think that other name might not well have replace the last of these in the fourth edition we find johnson add to the list this compliment meet with a handsome requital for johnson soon after have occasion to speak of beattie in he life of gray call he a poet a philosopher and a good man in he essay he comfort himself with the belief that he have enable every person of common sense to defeat the more important fallacy of the sceptical metaphysician even though he should not possess acuteness or metaphysical knowledge sufficient to qualify he for a logical refutation of they it be lamentable to see at how great a cost to himself he have furnish every person of common sense with these weapon of proof in a letter to sir william forbe write not long after he make the follow remarkable confession how much my mind have be injure by certain speculation you will partly guess when i tell you a fact that be now unknown to all the world that since the essay on truth be print in quarto in the summer of 1776 i have never dare to read it over i durst not even read the sheet and see whether there be any error in the print and be oblige to get a friend to do that office for I as he proceed he seem to have become more afraid of the faculty of reason in the second edition he have say do not we moral feeling in concert with what we reason discover of the deity evidence the _ necessity _ of a future state _ in vain should we pretend _ to judge rationally of that revelation by which life and immortality have be bring to light in the edition of 1776 he soften down this assertion so much as almost to deprive it of meaning do not we moral feeling in concert with what reason discover of the deity evidence the _ probability _ of a future state and that it be necessary to the full vindication of the divine government _ we should be much less qualified _ than we now be to judge rationally of that revelation by which life and immortality have be bring to light there be surely nothing except perhaps the word _ necessity _ that be objectionable in the proposition as it first stand it may be remark of he prose style in general that it be not free from that constraint which he with much candor admit be to be find in the writings of he countryman of he critical work i have see only those append to the edition of he essay in 1776 though not deficient in acuteness they have not learn or elegance enough to make one desirous of see more he remark on the character in homer be i think the best part of they he sometimes talk of what he probably know little about as when he tell we that he have never be able to discover anything in aristophane that might not he consign to eternal oblivion without the least detriment to literature that he wit and humor be now become almost invisible and seem never to have be very conspicuous with more that be equally absurd to the same purpose the few of he poem which he think worthy of be select from the rest and of be deliver to posterity have many reader to whom perhaps one recommendation of they be that they be few they have however and deservedly some admirer of a better stamp they soothe the mind with indistinct conception of something better than be meet with in ordinary life the first book of the minstrel the most considerable amongst they describe with much fervor the enthusiasm of a boy smit with the love of song and waken to a sense of rapture by all that be most grand or lovely in the external appearance of nature it be evident that the poet have feel much of what he describe and he therefore make he hearer feel it yet at time it must be own he seem as if he be lash himself into a state of artificial emotion as in the follow line : o nature how in every charm supreme whose votary feast on rapture ever new o for the voice and fire of seraph to sing thy glory with devotion due we hear indeed too often of nature 's charm even here he can not let the metaphysician rest they be in he mind the grievance that be most to be complain of in this vale of tear there be one other thing that beattie detest nearly as much as metaphysic lore it be the crowing of a cock this antipathy he contrived to express in the minstrel and the reader be startle by the expression of it as by something out of its place of the stanza begin o how canst thou renounce gray tell he that it be of all other he favorite that it be true poetry that it be inspiration and if i be not mistake it be related of bishop porteus that when he be once with beattie look down on a magnificent country that lay in prospect before they he break out with much delight into the repetition of it gray object to one word _ garniture _ as suggest a idea of dress and what be worse of french dress and the author try but try in vain to substitute another it would perhaps be impossible to find a better for the place in which it stand there be no ground of censure which a writer should admit with more caution than that a particular word or phrase happen to suggest a ludicrous or unsuitable image to the mind of another person few probably would have think of french dress on this occasion : and to some a passage in we translation of the bible might have occur where it be say that the lord _ garnish _ the heaven another of gray 's criticism fall on the word infuriate as be a new one although as sir william forbes remark it be find not only in thomson 's season but in the paradise lose the second book of the minstrel be not so pleasant as it be good the striple wander to the habitation of a hermit who have a harp not a very usual companion for a hermit to amuse he solitude and who direct he what study to pursue the youth be please with no historian except plutarch he read homer and virgil and learn to mend he song and the poet would have tell we how he learn to sing still better if sorrow for the death of a friend have not put a period to he own labor the poem thus come abruptly to a end and we be not much concerned that there be no more of it he first intention be to have engage the minstrel in some adventure of importance through which it may be doubt whether he could well have conduct he for he have not shewn much skill in the narrative part of the poem the other little piece call the hermit begin with a sweet strain which always dwell on the ear and which make we expect that something equally sweet be to follow this hermit too have he harp symphonious he make the same complaint and find the same comfort for it as edwin have do in the first book of the minstrel both be the christian 's comment on a well-known passage in the idyllium of moschus on the death of bion of he ode on lord hay 's birth-day gray 's opinion however favourable be not much beyond the truth that the diction be easy and noble the texture of the thought lyric and the versification harmonious to which he add that the panegyric have nothing mean in it the ode to hope look like one of blair 's sermon cast into a lyrical mould there be i believe no allusion to any particular place that be familiar to he throughout he poem the description of the owl in the line entitle retirement he use to say be draw from nature it have more that appearance than any thing else he have write and please accordingly between he system in poetry and philosophy some exchange might have be make with advantage to each in the former he count general idea for nearly all in all -lrb- _ see he essay on poetry and music _

in 1811 yet he still continue to secure to himself some share of attention by several work in prose in the essay on old maid publish in 1785 there be a agreeable combination of learn sprightliness and arch humor he now and then approach to irreverence on sacred subject but as i be persuade without any ill intention the dedication of the book to mr carter give much offence to that lady he dialogue on johnson and chesterfield in 1787 contrast the character of these writer in a lively manner and with some power of discrimination but the partiality of the author be very evident he have himself sacrifice too successfully to the grace to be a fair umpire between the rough scholar and the polished nobleman the young widow or the history of cornelium sedley a novel be publish without he name -lrb- as the last-mentioned two book have also be -rrb- in 1789 for this he receive 200_l _ from mr nichol the purchaser find he bargain a hard one : for the novel have little to recommend it be deficient in probability of incident and character he make up for the loss by present he bookseller with another anonymous work entitle the eulogy of howard a vision in prose -lrb- 1 -rrb- he life of milton be intend for a edition of the poet to be publish by nichol the king 's printer but a abridgement of it only be employ in 1794 for the purpose some passage be not think courtly enough for the royal eye he afterwards publish it without mutilation the design of this work to which he devote two year of diligent application be to vindicate milton from the asperity of johnson -- a task which accord to the general opinion have since be more ably execute by doctor symmon he have however reason to be satisfy with this undertaking as it lead to a acquaintance and friendship with cowper who be at the same time engage in write note to milton eight year after it fall to he lot to write a life of cowper himself this prove to he the most lucrative of all he literary engagement but its success be owe principally not to the narrative but to the private letter of cowper which accompany they of the life and letter he add another volume in 1804 and in 1809 write the life of romney which have no such attraction do not recommend itself to the public notice from the time that he leave london in 1774 till he death a period of 46 year he be seldom long absent from he home first at eartham and afterwards at felpham a pleasant village on the sea-shore distant only a few mile from he former residence cowper who visit he at eartham in 1792 speak of the house as the most elegant mansion he have ever inhabit surround by the most delightful pleasure grounds he have ever see and observe he have no conception that a poet could be the owner of such a paradise the house be build and the pleasure grounds lay out by himself here i see he in the next summer but one after cowper 's visit he habit appear to I such as they be long afterwards describe by mr opie -- those of extreme retirement of abstemiousness and of family devotion he be at that time employ on he life of milton and in educate he son a promising boy who under the age of fourteen have begin to translate the epistle of horace into tolerable blank verse on accompany I the next morning out of paradise the lad speak to I with some sorrow of he father 's refusal to let he join a pack of hound in the neighborhood he die in he 20th year a victim probably to the secluded life and the studious habit to which he parent have so early devoted he he mother a servant in the family as i be tell by anna seward declare he to be the son of a young orphan name howell who have be benevolently receive by hayley into he house and through he means promote in the military service of the east indium company soon after perish by shipwreck but the feature of the boy tell a different story and one more consonant to that of the poet by whom he be always acknowledge for he son he be for some time the pupil of mr flaxman who augur highly of he ability and who if the young man have live would certainly have do all that could be do by example and instruction to render he illustrious in he art and respectable as a man consider he independence on any profession the ease of he manners he talent for conversation and he knowledge of modern language it may be wonder that hayley do not mix more in society or visit other country besides he own once indeed when a young man he make a excursion to scotland and in the summer of 1790 pass three week at pari with he friend carwardine and romney from whence much to the scandal of the neighborhood he bring back a french governess for he son mr hayley have then leave he or rather have be gently force out of he house and afterwards when she beg for leave to return be deny it from he own account of the matter and from the letter that pass between they some of which he have publish in he memoirs it be difficult to acquit he of blame and not to wish that he have endure with more patience the foible of a woman who though irreproachable in she own conduct be more indulgent than she need have be to he frailty he appear however to have be anxious for she happiness after they be separate she die in london in 1797 and receive from she husband the empty honor of a funeral sermon and a epitaph he be loth to quit he home except on some errand of friendship when he be ever ready to run to the land 's end i remember he quote to I the follow line out of aeschylus on the advantage of a master 's presence in he own family -lrb- greek : omma gar domon nomixo despton paronsian -rrb- he seem to have take delight in the instruction of youth besides he own boy he undertake to educate gratuitously two son of he friend mr carwardine and one of he neighbor lord egremont on the death of warton he decline some advance that be make he through he friend towards a offer of the laureatship nothing but a high sense of independence could have prompt this refusal for though no courtier he be not want in loyalty and the stipend would have be a welcome addition to a income which barely suffice he own moderate want and he liberal contribution to the necessity of other he be not more fortunate in a second marriage than he have be in he first the vain confidence which he place in he good star on this occasion shall be tell in he own word which be as follow : while he be deeply engage in he biographical composition he use to say ' i have not leisure to wander from my hermitage and look into the world in quest of a wife but i feel a strong persuasion that if it be really good for I to venture once more on marriage that step of deepest hazard and of highest hope my kind star will conduct to my cell some compassionate fair one fond of book and retirement who may be willing to enliven with the song of tenderness the solitude of a poetical hermit ' such be the frame of mind in the recluse when a incident occur that gradually seem to accomplish a completion of he prophecy this incident be a visit from a old ecclesiastical acquaintance attend by two young lady mary and harriet welford daughter of a aged and retired merchant on blackheath the countenance and musical talent of the elder sister make a strong impression on the sequestered poet they accidental visit gradually lead to he second marriage on the 23d of march 1809 a event attend with much general exultation and delight though evidently like the usual step of poet in the world rather a step of hasty affection than of deliberate prudence in three year they be separate i know not for what reason on shew I some gap in he library he say that they have be make by proceedings in doctor common to felpham where he pass the last twenty year of he life there retire also to end he day in privacy and quiet doctor cyril jackson who have be many year dean of christ church and in that time have refuse some of the highest honor in the church it be say that when hayley wait on he the doctor decline enter upon a interchange of visit but say that he should be happy to establish a intercourse of a different kind and to send he occasionally book or anything else which he might happen to have and which hayley might be without and to receive from he the same neighbourly accommodation in return accordingly when the poet take a wife in he old age he send the doctor a piece of the wedding cake with a message that he hope at some future time to receive a neighbourly communication of the same sort in return in 1818 he tell I that he medical attendant be apprehensive of he become dropsical and have prescribe he a glass of port wine after he dinner he usual drink before this have be water in the October of the following year he write to I that he have be assail by two of the most formidable enemy of the human frame and have be almost demolish by a fit of apoplexy and a fit of the stone : the blow from the former he add be so violent that my physician despair of my revival but by the mercy of heaven i be so far revive that i can again enjoy a social and literary intercourse with my friend and even dabble again in rhyme but as i suspect that my rhyme like the homily of gil bla ' archbishop may savor of apoplexy i think it right to keep they in utter privacy he other complaint the stone terminate he life on the 12th of November 1820 under all he suffering -lrb- say he early friend mr sargent -rrb- he be never hear to express a querulous word and if i have not see it i could not have think it possible for so much constant patience and resignation to have be exhibit under so many year of grievous pain of he severe disease he speak with great calmness and when there seem to be some doubt among he medical friend as to the existence of a stone in the bladder he say to I in a gentle tone i can settle the controversy between they i be sure there be for i distinctly feel it a very large stone be find after he decease a accidental fall from the slip of he foot bring on he last illness and death when i come to he the day before he die he mention this circumstance and express a strong hope that god be in mercy about to put a period to he suffering he have receive the sacrament about a fortnight before from the rev mr hardy a minister in the neighborhood towards whom he always express a most friendly regard to this satisfactory account of hayley 's latter day let I be allow to add that which be give by the son of he friend the rev john sargent more perfect patience than hayley manifest under he excruciating torture it never be my lot to witness he be not only submission but cheerfulness so far could he abstract himself from he intense suffering as to be solicitous in a way that affect I tenderly respect my comfort and accommodation as he guest a circumstance that might appear trivial to many but which to my mind be illustrative of that disinterestedness and affection which be so habitual to he in life as not to desert he in death that he patience emanate from principle far superior to those of manly and philosophical fortitude i feel a comfortable and confirm persuasion not merely from the sentiment he express when he end be approach but from the more satisfactory testimony of he declaration to he confidential servant in the season of comparative health again and again before he last seizure do he read over a little book i have give he corbett 's self-examination in secret and repeatedly do he make he servant read to he that most valuable little work of which surely no proud and insincere man can cordially approve and to she do he avow when recommend it for private perusal in the principle of that book i wish to die he also mention to she at the same time he approbation of the rev daniel wilson 's sermon which have be kindly send to he he permit I frequently to pray with he as a friend and minister and when i use the confessional in the communion service of we church and some of the verse of the fifty-first psalm he appear to unite devoutly in those act of penitence and afterwards add i thank you heartily with emphasis do i hear he utter the memorable word i know that my redeemer liveth & c and on my remind he that job exclaim also behold i be vile he assent to the excellence of that language of repentance and humility indeed i well remember he heartily agree with I in a observation i make some month before that a progress in religion be to be discern by a progressive knowledge of we own misery and sinfulness the last word almost i hear fall from he contain a sentiment i should wish living and die to be my own -- christ have mercy upon I o my savior look down upon I forsake I not of he habit during the latter part of he life mr opie who have the art of confer a interest on whatever she relate have give this very please account in a letter address to the editor of he memoirs in consequence of a previous correspondence with mr hayley the result of he flattering mention of I in the twelfth edition of the triumph of temper i go to he house on a visit in the year 1814 nothing could exceed the regularity and temperance of mr hayley 's habit we do not breakfast till a little before eight out of compliment to I i believe but as he always rise at six -lrb- 2 -rrb- he breakfast at half-past seven when he be alone and as soon as he return from he usual walk in the garden you remember how rapidly he walk spite of he lameness bearing on he stick on one side and he umbrella on the other -lrb- 3 -rrb- during breakfast at which he drink cocoa only he always read and while i be with he he read aloud to I we then adjourn to he sit room the upper library and he read to I or i to he till coffee be serve in the dining room which be i think at eleven o'clock that repast over we walk in the garden and then return to we book or i sing to he till it be time for we to dress for dinner -- with he a very temperate meal he drink water only at dinner and take coffee instead of wine after it the coffee be serve up with cream and fruit in the upper library after dinner i read to he or he read to I till it be near tea-time when we again walk in the garden and on we return to the house cocoa be serve for he and tea for I after tea i read aloud or sing to he till nine o'clock when the servant come in to prayer which be manuscript composition or compilation of he own and which as you well know he read in a very impressive manner he then converse for half a hour or i sing one or two of handel 's song to he or a hymn of he own and then we retire for the night i think he have for some year be in the habit of wake at five o'clock and compose a hymn but i do not remember to have hear he mention have be so employ while i be he guest with the single exception of a drive to chichester and to lavant where we spend a day with mr poole and of have one or two friend to tea three time there be no _ variety _ in the life which i have above describe during the whole month i pass with mr hayley and i believe the year that follow to the time of he death be as little vary as the day i have detail the honorable miss monckton and they sister mr milne drink tea with we once as they be very ambitious of be present to mr hayley and they conversation and great musical power be justly appreciate by he the next year i repeat my visit to felpham and find the monckton at bognor with they brother and sister viscount and viscountess galway the latter be eager to make mr hayley 's acquaintance and i easily obtain leave to introduce they at the same time the countess of mayo and mr and mr thoma smith request of I a similar introduction and this application draw from we friend the follow remark ' i think my dear you have better _ show _ I at a shill a head ' leave be grant I to present these new visitant and they afterwards i find introduce lord mayo that year mr hayley be unable to bear the motion of a carriage from the increase pain in he hip-joint and from that time he scarcely ever leave he own precinct the next year i go to scotland and do not see felpham till the year 1817 i find mr hayley be become fond of see occasional visitor and that earl and countess paulett and lady mary paulett as well as lord and lady mayo and mr and mr t smith be frequent caller on he that year the miss godfrey be also he guest and with they i occasionally pay visit but for the most part we life be as unvaried as it be in 1814 and 1815 in 1818 i be unable to visit felpham but in 1819 i go down to bognor in considerable alarm on hearing of we poor friend 's illness and i be not certain that i should not arrive too late to see he but i find he out of danger and have the happiness of return to london at the end of the week leave he recover but i see he no more he die in November of the following year you will wish to know what we read aloud chiefly manuscript poem and play of mr hayley 's and modern publication one of the former be a sensible just and as he read it a apparently well-written epistle to a socinian friend on the error of he belief you know i suppose that we friend always read the bible and testament before he leave he chamber in a morning hayley 's memoirs vol ii p 204 the epistle of which mr opie speak be print with a few other poem on serious and sacred subject to be distribute among the friend of the author two year before he death he person and character be well describe by the rev doctor johnson in the follow word : he be considerably above the middle stature have a countenance remarkably expressive of intellect and feeling and a commanding air and deportment that remind the beholder rather of a military officer than of the character he assume in the close of he epistolary address -lrb- he use to sign himself _ the hermit _ -rrb- the deplorable infirmity however of he early year have leave a perceptible lameness which attend he through life and induce a necessity of adventitious aid towards procure he the advantage of a tolerably even walk as to he personal quality of a higher order these be cheerfulness and sympathy in a very eminent degree so eminent indeed that as no affliction of he own could divest he of the former so neither could the affliction of other find he destitute of the latter he temper also be singularly sweet and amiable be not only free from ebullition of anger but from all those minor defect which it be needless to enumerate and to which social peace and harmony be so repeatedly sacrifice it be the most even in its exercise that the writer of this brief account of he ever witness whether this regular flow of good humor be owe to the native cheerfulness of he mind to the habit which he have contract of view every adverse circumstance on its bright side to a course of self discipline which he do not avow to other or to the joint operation of all these it be not possible to say but certain it be that it be one of he most striking peculiarity in all these respects there can be no doubt that the character of hayley be worthy of imitation and the editor feel that he should be deficient in a become attention to the express wish of the author in the close of he memoir if he do not briefly advert to the importance both to individual and social happiness of endeavor to cultivate to the utmost those eminent ingredient of a beneficial life cheerfulness sympathy and good temper closely connect with these be a rich assemblage of amiable quality which the editor can not do better than display in the follow extract from the before-mentioned sketch by the rev samuel greatheed ` hayley retain i believe throughout he life a high sense of honor inflexible integrity a warmth of friendship and overflow benevolence the last be especially exert for the introduction of meritorious young person into useful and respectable situation and it be usually efficient as it never relax while they justify he patronage he do not indeed scruple while it be in he power to entrust they with large sum when there appear a prospect of they future ability for repayment but as this prospect not seldom fail either through death or unavoidable impediment he property be greatly reduce by such beneficence another distinctive mark of the character of hayley which few possess by nature and still fewer attain to by art be a eminently great conversational ability it be scarcely possible for any one to be in he company a hour how distinguished soever he own gift or acquirement might be in the possession and exercise of colloquial power without be conscious of he superiority in this respect it have be a subject of repeat astonishment to the editor that in a soil so unfavourable to the growth of this faculty as seclusion must necessarily be it should yet have arrive at such a pitch of exuberance in the case of the retire subject of this memoir as only a interchange of the best inform mind and that continually exercise could be suppose capable of produce he can only attempt to account for it from the opportunity which the author enjoy through the advantage of one of the finest private library in the kingdom of converse at all hour and in all conceivable frame of mind with the illustrious dead of every age and nation but the solution of the difficulty be still incomplete for although these literary pleiade could furnish as it be the sweet influence of rain and sunshine to foster he native talent yet breath be deny they its improvement be more than he friend cowper could have account for without violate he poetical axiom that -- ev 'n the oak thrive by the rude concussion of the storm as to the defect of the character of hayley perhaps the most prominent feature be a pertinacity of determination with regard to he mode of action which have be seldom exemplify to the same extent in the case of other when in the contemplation of suppose advantage whether to himself or he friend he have once mature he purpose it be a attempt of no ordinary difficulty to divert he from the pursuit of it to this may perhaps be attribute the perpetual disappointment with which he life be chequered certain it be that he matrimonial infelicity may be trace to this source he first adventure of the kind allude to have the warning voice of he survive parent against it and it may naturally be suppose the dissuasive argument of all he thinking and judicious friend and as to the similar connexion he form in the decline of life he must have overcome obstacle both numerous and weighty with respect to he own situation and habit in accomplish that object of he wish instead of enter into a detail of these however it will be more profitable to secure the good effect that may arise from the contemplation of the former part of he character from the danger of be neutralize by the present exhibition of it this may perhaps be accomplish by remind the reader of that principle of we lapse nature which incline we too often to confound evil with good the good in hayley 's case appear to have be the view through he native cheerfulness every _ dispensation of providence _ on its bright side and the evil he apply this rule to what might be not improperly designate _ the dispensation of he own will _ there can be no doubt that he example in the first instance and he mistake in the last be equally to be follow and avoid another fail observable in the character of hayley be the little attention he pay to public opinion in regard to he mode and habit of life during he long residence in he paternal seat of eartham though he occasionally receive friend from a distance and especially the votary of literature and the fine art yet to the family in he vicinity he be not easily accessible he seem indeed to have be almost a insulate mortal among they and one who discharge himself from the obligation of what be commonly call _ etiquette _ make it impossible to maintain with he the reciprocity of intercourse it be true indeed that the attention of the possessor of eartham be considerably engross by meditation and study but this increase rather than lessen he adaptation to society and make the effect of he seclusion the more to be lament hayley 's memoirs vol ii p 220 as hayley be too much extol at the beginning of he poetical course so be he undeservedly neglect or ridicule at the close of it the excessive admiration he at first meet with join to that flattering self-opinion which a solitary life be apt to engender make he too easily satisfy with what he have do perhaps he write worse after he acquaintance with cowper for aim at a simplicity which he have not power to support he become flat and insipid he have at no time much force of conception or language yet if he never elevate he frequently amuse he reader he chief attraction consist in set off some plain and natural thought or observation by a sparkling and ingenious similitude such as we commonly find in the persian poet to this may be add a certain sweetness of number peculiar to himself without the spirit and edge of pope or the boldness of dryden and fashion as i think to he own recitation which though musical be somewhat too pompous and monotonous he be desirous that all he rhyme should be exact but they be sometimes so only accord to he own manner of pronounce they he hold about the same rank among we poet that bertaut do among the french but differ from he in this that whereas bertaut be the earliest of a race analogous to the school of dryden and pope so hayley be the latest of the correspondent class amongst ourselves in one respect he be deserving of most honorable notice during the course of a long literary life i doubt whether he be ever provoke to use a single word of asperity or sarcasm towards any of he contemporary this be praise which alone ought to have exempt he from the harsh and unmerited censure of porson by whom he be call criticorum et poetarum pessimus he sometimes on the other hand indulge himself too much in a lavish and indiscriminate commendation of contemporary writer but from whatever might appear like flattery of the great he scrupulously abstain when the princess charlotte visit he at felpham he would not present some verse he have write on she lest he should be think capable of that meanness he essay on painting history and poetry contain much information that may be useful to young artist and student that on sculpture be very inferior to the rest as the triumph of music be to the triumph of temper the last of these be a poem that still continue to interest a class of reader whose study be intimately connect with the happiness and well be of society the design of it which be to shew the advantage of self-control to the mind of a well-educated girl be much to be commend the machinery though it require no great effort in the production yet suffice to give some relief to the story it have be remark that the trial of the heroine be too insignificant but of one of they at least the calumny in the newspaper this can not properly be say nor would the purpose of the writer have be so well answer if he have be more serious and have utter he oracle from behind a graver mask the taste which have be lately excite amongst we for spanish and italian literature after have sleep nearly since the age of elizabeth may be attribute in a great measure to the influence of he example gray hurd and the two warton have do something towards awaken it but the spell be complete by he the decisive impulse be give by the copious extract from the great poet in those language which he insert in the note to he essay on epic poetry and which he accompany by spirited translation lord holland the best inform and most elegant of we writer on the subject of the spanish theater declare that he have be induce to learn that language by what hayley have write concern the poet ercillum i have hear he greek scholarship question in consequence of a error which in he epistle on history he have make in the quantity of the word olorus the name of the father of thucydide but from a casual mistake of this sort no decisive inference can be draw there be little knowledge of human life and character to be gain from he writings he have see mankind chiefly through the medium of book and those such as do not represent they very faithfully to he that be in ordinary play and novel indeed he appear to

elegy on the death of he acquaintance of that name which have some stanza of remarkable beauty soon after he confirmation by the bishop at twelve year of age he be prompt by the serious reflection which the performance of that ceremony have awaken in he to compose some line on the last day and a paraphrase of the ninth chapter of job and of some chapter in isaiah have he life be protracted there be every reason to believe from the process which usually take place in mind constitute like he that after a interval of scepticism these feeling of piety would have return in they full force at the same time he indulge himself in satirical effusion on he master and such of he schoolfellow as have provoke either he resentment or he ridicule on the first of July 1767 he be take from school and

sign dunhelmus bristoliensis by this the public curiosity be excite and the printer not be able to satisfy the inquiry that be make concern the quarter from whence he have receive the communication it be with some difficulty trace to chatterton to the menace of those who first roughly demand from he a account of the means by which the paper have come into he hand he refuse to give any reply but on be more mildly question after some prevaricate say that he have get it together with several other manuscript that have be in the possession of he father by whom they be find in a large box in a upper room over the chapel on the north side of redcliffe church that some old parchment have be see by he in he mother 's house be nearly certain nor be it at all improbable that they might have be discover in a neglect coffer in the church accord to the account he give of they but that either the description of the fryar 's passage over the bridge or the most considerable of the poem attribute to rowley be among they can scarcely be credit the delusion suppose to have be practice on the public by macpherson and that acknowledge to have be so by walpole in pass off the castle of otranto for a translation from the italian be then recent and these example might have easily engage chatterton to attempt a fraud which do not seem likely to be more injurious in its consequence than either of they about the same time he become know to a mr catrott and to a mr barrett a chirurgeon at bristol who intend to publish a history of that city and be then collect material for the purpose to the former he show the bristowe tragedy the epitaph on robert canynge and some other short piece to the latter several fragment some of considerable length affirm they to be portion of the original manuscript which have fall into he hand from both he receive at different time some pecuniary reward for these communication and be favor by the loan of some book among those which he borrow of mr barrett there be several on medical subject and from he he obtain also some instruction in chirurgery he be represent by one of he companion to have extend he curiosity at this time to many other object of inquiry and to have employ himself not only in the lighter study of heraldry and english antiquity but in the theory of music mathematics metaphysics and astronomy he now become a contributor of prose and verse to the magazine among the acknowledgment to correspondent in the town and country magazine for November 1768 one of he letter appear to be notice but nothing of he write in that miscellany the first with which he be know to have correspond have be discover before the February of the following year the attention he have draw to himself in he native city soon induce he to aspire after higher notice in march he address the following letter to the honorable horace walpole sir -- be verse a little in antiquity i have meet with several curious manuscript among which the follow may be of service to you in any future edition of you truly entertaining anecdote of painting in correct the mistake -lrb- if any -rrb- in the note you will greatly oblige you most humble

have annex he own remark walpole return a polite answer and ask for further communication on the receipt of a second letter from chatterton walpole repeat he wish to know more concern rowley and he poem in reply to which chatterton take occasion to represent he own situation that he be the son of a indigent widow and clerk to a attorney but that he inclination lead he to more elegant pursuit and he intimate a hope that walpole would assist in place he where he might be able to gratify such propensity he letter be accompany by more of the rowleian poem and contain a assurance that the person who have lend they to he to transcribe possess other valuable relic of ancient poetry some inquiry which walpole make confirm the account give by chatterton of himself but in answer to he solicitation for patronage walpole declare that he have not the means of exert it and recommend a sedulous attention to business as the most certain way of recompense he mother for she care and of secure he own independence he mention that more competent judge than he pretend to be be not satisfy of the manuscript be genuine and at the same time state they reason for conclude they to be of another age than that to which they be assign shortly after chatterton write to he two letter which though querulous be not disrespectful in the first while he thanks he correspondent for the advice he have give he he profess he resolution to go a little beyond it by destroy all he useless lumber of literature and never use he pen again but in the law and in the other declare he settle conviction that the papers of rowley be genuine he ask he to return the copy which have be send he owe to the absence of walpole who be then in paris some time elapse without any notice be take of this request and on he return walpole find the following letter which he term singularly impertinent sir -- i can not reconcile you behavior to I with the notion i once entertain of you i think myself injure sir and do you not know my circumstance you would not dare to treat I thus i have send for a copy of the m no answer from you a explanation or excuse for you silence would oblige thoma chatterton July 24th the manuscript and letter be all return in a blank cover on the fourth of August and here the intercourse be at a end gray and mason be the friend whom walpole have consult about the manuscript and they have no hesitation in pronounce they to be forgery it may seem strange that with such man the uncommon beauty of the poetry they contain do not create some interest for the author but gray be now in a state of health that perhaps leave he little power of be interested in anything or the wonder may resolve itself into that blindness which poet no less than patron too frequently discover for the excellence of they contemporary chatterton himself speak with contempt of the production of collin as to walpole he have no doubt more pleasure in pet the lap-dog that be leave to he care by the old blind lady at pari than he could ever have feel in nurse the wayward genius of chatterton during he residence in lambert 's house he constitutional reserve have assume a air of gloomy sullenness : he have repeatedly betray to the servant a intention of commit suicide and at length a paper entitle the last will and testament of thoma chatterton which be find lie on he desk manifest a design of perpetrate this act on the ensue day easter Sunday April 15th 1770 on so unequivocal a proof as this appear to be of he desperate resolution he master no longer think it safe to retain he a few month before he have write letter to several bookseller and printer in london and from they receive assurance of protection and employment if he should remove to the capital this decide he as to he future course when he be question by thistlethwaite as to the plan of life he intend to pursue if the prospect which be thus hold out should fail he he answer : the promise i have have be sufficient to dispel doubt but should i be deceive i will turn methodist preacher credulity be as potent a deity as ever and a new sect may easily be devise but if that too should fail I my last and final resource be a pistol it be almost unnecessary to observe that when he thus speculate on he future proceedings he mind have be strongly taint with infidelity -- towards the conclusion of April he set forth on he ill-omened journey he have never yet go farther than a Sunday 's walk from he native city and at the age of seventeen equally inexperienced and confident without a friend or a guide and with principle shake and pervert he be about to enter on a new and perilous theater nor could it have be difficult to divine what the event must soon be on the 26th of April 1770 immediately after he arrival in london he write to he mother and speak in high spirit of the encouragement he have meet with from the bookseller to whom he have apply who say he all approve of my design on the sixth of the next month he inform she that he get four guinea a month by one magazine and that he shall engage to write a history of england and other piece which will more than double that sum mr wilke have know he by he writings since he first correspond with the bookseller he be to visit he the follow week and by he interest would ensure mr ballance the trinity house in short he be in rapture at the change in he condition and view and talk as if he fortune be already make he now inhabit the house of walmsley a plasterer in shoreditch where he kinswoman mr ballance also live the other letter to he mother and sister betray the same intoxication at the chapter coffee-house he meet with a gentleman who would have introduce he as a companion to the young duke of northumberland in he intended general tour have he not be unluckily incapacitate for that office by he ignorance of any tongue but he own he present profession oblige he to frequent place of the best resort he employ he money in fitting himself fashionably and get into good company this last article always bring he in good interest he have engage to live with a gentleman the brother of a lord -lrb- a scotch one indeed -rrb- who be go to advance pretty deeply into the bookselling branch and be to have lodging and board genteel and elegant grati besides no inconsiderable premium he be introduce to beckford the lord mayor

of # 5000 the kind-hearted boy do indeed find mean out of the little profit arise from he writings to send she he mother and he grandmother several trifling present in July he remove to lodgings at mr angel 's a sack-maker in brook street holborn he assign no reason for quit those he have occupy in shoreditch but sir herbert croft suppose not without probability that it be in order to be nearer to the place of public entertainment to which he employment as a writer for ephemeral publication oblige he to resort on the 20th of July he acquaint he sister that he be engage in write a oratorio which when finish would purchase she a gown and that she might depend on see he before the first of January 1771 almost all the next town and country magazine he tell she be he he boast that he have a universal acquaintance that he company be court every where and could he humble himself to go behind a compter he could have have twenty place but that he must be among the great : state matter suit he better than commercial besides he communication to the above mention miscellany he be a frequent contributor of essay and poem to several of the other literary journal as a political writer he have resolve to employ he pen on both side essay he tell he sister on the patriotic side fetch no more than what the copy be sell for as the patriot themselves be search for a place they have no gratuity to spare on the other hand unpopular essay will not be accept and you must pay to have they print but then you seldom lose by it courtier be so sensible of they deficiency in merit that they generally reward all who know how to daub they with a appearance but all he vision of emolument and greatness be now begin to melt away he be so tired of he literary drudgery or find the return it make he so inadequate to he support that he condescend to solicit the appointment of a chirurgeon 's mate to africa and apply to mr barrett for a recommendation which be refuse he probably on account of he incapacity it be difficult to trace the particulars of that sudden transition from good to bad fortune which seem to have befall he that he poverty be extreme can not be doubt the younger warton be inform by mr cross a apothecary in brook street that while chatterton live in the neighborhood he often call at he shop but though press by cross to dine or sup with he constantly decline the invitation except one evening when he be prevail on to partake of a barrel of oyster and eat most voraciously a barber 's wife who live within a few door of mr angel 's give testimony that after he death mr angel tell she that on the 24th of August as she know he have not eat anything for two or three day she beg he would take some dinner with she but he be offend at she expression which seem to hint that he be in want and assure she he be not hungry the striple whose pride would not let he go behind a compter have now drunk the cup of bitterness to the dregs on that day he swallow arsenic in water and on the follow expire he room be break into and find strew over with fragment of papers which he have destroy he be inter in the burying-ground of shoe lane work-house such be the end of one who have give greater proof of poetical genius than perhaps have ever be show in one of he year by johnson he be pronounce the most extraordinary young man that have ever encounter he knowledge and warton in the history of english poetry where he discuss the authenticity of the rowleian poem give it as he opinion that chatterton would have prove the first of english poet if he have reach a maturer age he be proud say he sister and exceedingly imperious but both she and he school-fellow thistlethwaite vindicate he from the charge of libertinism which be bring against he by some who think they could not sufficiently blacken he memory on the contrary he abstemiousness be uncommon he seldom use animal food or strong liquor he usual diet be a piece of bread and a tart and some water he fancy that the full of the moon be the most propitious time for study and would often sit up and write the whole night by moonlight he spirit be extremely uneven and he be subject to long and frequent fit of absence insomuch that he would look stedfastly in a person 's face without speak or seem to see he for a quarter of a hour or more there be say to have be something peculiarly please in he manner and address he person be mark by a air of manliness and dignity that bespeak the superiority of he mind he eye one of which be more remarkable than the other be of a gray color keen and brilliant especially when any thing occur to animate he of all the hypothesis concern those papers which have be the subject of so much controversy none seem more probable than that suggest by warton who in the history of english poetry admit that some of the poem attribute to rowley might have be preserve in canynge 's chest and in another publication allow that chatterton might have discover parchment of humble prose contain local memoirs and authentic deed illustrate the history of bristol and biographical diary or other notice of the life of canynge ischam and gorge but that many of the manuscript be not genuine be prove not only by the dissimilitude of the style to any composition of the age of henry vi and edward iv and by the marked resemblance to several passage in modern poet but by certain circumstance which leave little or no doubt of they have be fabricate by chatterton himself one of he companion at the time that he be a apprentice to lambert affirm that he one day produce a piece of parchment on which he write several word if not line in a character that appear to he companion totally unlike english that he then hold it over a candle to give it the appearance of antiquity which change the color of the ink and make the parchment appear black and contract another person declare that he see he rub a piece of parchment in several place in streak with yellow ochre and then rub it on the ground which be dirty and afterwards crumple it in he hand have conclude the operation he say it would do pretty well but he could do it better at home the first part of the battle of hasting he confess to mr barrett that he have write himself some anachronism as to particular allusion have be point out the irregular or pindaric measure as it have be call use in the song to aellum in the verse on the mynster and in the chorus in goddwyn be not employ till a much later aera there be also in the aellum some line in blank verse not introduce among we till the time of surrey who adopt it from the italian another criterion of a more general nature which have not yet at least that i be aware be apply to those composition be i think very strongly against the antiquity of they and that be that the intention and purpose of the writer in the longer piece be not sufficiently marked and decisive for the remoter age to which they be ascribe in the early stage of a language before conventional phrase have be form and a stock of imagery as it be provide for the common use we find that the plan of a work be often rude and simple indeed but that it almost always bear evident sign of have subsist anteriorly in the mind of the writer as a whole if we try aellum the longest of the poem by this test we shall discover strong evidence of its be modern a certain degree of uniformity be the invariable characteristic of the earlier production of art but here be as much desultoriness and incoherence as can well he possible in a work that make any pretension to a plan on this internal proof alone i should not hesitate in assign it to chatterton rather than to rowley to the one who luxuriate in a abundance of poetic material pour out before he for he use or he imitation rather than to the other who have comparatively but a few meager model to work upon where he be much inspirit by he subject be throw off he guard he forget himself and become modern as in these line from which i have remove nothing but the old spelling _ first dane _ fly fly ye danes magnus the chief be slay the saxon come with aellum at they head let 's strive to

look would _ and _ look _ do exclaim and he _ fall _ and _ fall _ rolleth thousand down as be also this antithetical comparison of the quality of a war-horse to the mental affection of the rider : bring I a steed with eagle-wing for fight swift as my wish and as my love be strong there be sometimes single line that bear little relation to the place in which they stand and seem to be bring in for no other purpose than they effect on the ear this be the contrivance of a modern and a youthful poet thy word be high of din but nought beside be a line that occur in aellum and may sometimes be apply to the author himself nothing indeed be more wonderful in the rowley poem than the masterly style of versification which they frequently display few more exquisite specimen of this kind can be find in we language than the minstrel 's song in aellum beginning o sing unto my roundelay a young poet may be expect to describe warmly and energetically whatever interest he fancy or he heart but a command of number would seem to be a art capable of be perfect only by long-continued and diligent endeavor it must be recollect however that much might be do in the time which be at chatterton 's disposal when that time be undivided by the study of any other language but he own we see in the instance of milton 's juvenile poem in latin not to mention other to what excellence this species of skill may be bring even in boyhood where the organ be finely dispose for the perception of musical delight and if example of the same early perfection be rarer in we own tongue it may be because so much labor be seldom or ever exact at that age in the use of it tyrwhitt whose critical acumen have enable he to detect a supposititious passage in a tragedy of euripide be at first a dupe to the imposture of chatterton and treat the poem as so decidedly genuine that he cite they for the elucidation of chaucer but see good grounds for change he opinion as mr nichol -lrb- 1 -rrb- inform we he

it have convince he of he error and that so thoroughly impressed be he with a sense of the importance of he maker 's favor that he would willingly give up all acquisition of knowledge and all hope of
