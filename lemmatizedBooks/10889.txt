produce by jonathan ingram carol david and the online distribute proofread team the life and romance of mr eliza haywood by george frisbie whicher phd instructor in the university of illinois 1915 _ this monograph have be approve by the department of english and comparative literature in columbium university as a contribution to knowledge worthy of publication _ a h thorndike _ executive officer _ preface the purpose of the follow study be not to revive the reputation of a forget author or to suggest that mr haywood may yet come into she own for the lover of eighteenth century fashion she numerous page have indeed a stilted early georgian charm but with the passing of ramilly wig and velveteen small-clothes the popularity of she novel vanish once for all she have she world in she time but that world and time disappear with the french revolution -lrb- a -rrb- now even profess student of the novel shrink from read many of she seventy odd volume nor can the infamous celebrity confer by pope 's attack in the dunciad save she name from oblivion but the significance of mr haywood 's contribution can not safely be ignore she romance of palpitating passion write between 1720 and 1730 form a necessary complement to defoe 's romance of adventure exactly as she duncan campbell pamphlet supply the one element lack in he the domestic novel of she later life foreshadow the work of miss burney and miss austen while she career as a woman of letter help to open a new profession to she sex since even the weakest link in the development of a literary form be important i have endeavor to provide future historian of english fiction with a compact and accurate account of this pioneer lady novelist hitherto the most complete summary of mr haywood 's life and writings have be sir sidney lee 's article in the dictionary of national biography which add much information not find in the earlier notice in baker 's biographium dramatica and chalmer ' biographical dictionary the experienced palate of mr edmund gosse and mr austin dobson have test the literary quality respectively of the earlier and later aspect of she work professor walter raleigh dr charlotte e morgan and professor saintsbury have briefly estimate the importance of she share in the change from romance to novel perhaps the main reason for the inadequacy of these notice lie in the fact that no one library contain anything like a complete collection of mr haywood 's innumerable book in pursuit of odd item i have ransack the british museum the bodleian and several minor literary museum in england and in america the library of columbium harvard yale and brown university the peabody institute and the university of chicago the search have enable I to correct many inaccuracy in miss morgan 's tentative list of prose fiction and even to supplement mr esdaile 's admirable list of english tale and prose romance print before 1740 which mention only work now extant in british library in the bibliography i have adopt a alphabetical arrangement as most convenient for ready reference under the various edition of each book i have refer to library english or american where copy be to be find or when no copy be to be have i have refer to advertisement either in the newspaper of the burney collection in the gentleman 's magazine the monthly or the critical or in the catalogue of modern bookseller in the chronological list i have date each work from the earliest advertisement of its publication naturally i have incur obligation to scholar who have previously pass over the same little-cultivated territory mr arundell esdaile of the british museum staff both facilitate the course of my investigation in england by valuable suggestion and cheer it by he cordial hospitality to professor rp utter of amherst jm clapp of lake forest college ah upham of miamus university and ah thorndike of columbium i be indebted for friendly advice encouragement and helpful criticism and above all my thanks be

write not attempt by eliza haywood in the course of she long career as a adventuress in letter unlike mme de villedieu or mrs manley she do not publish the story of she life romantically disguise as the secret history of eliza nor be there one of the fair sex -lrb- real or pretended -rrb- to chronicle she strange and surprising adventure or to print she passion-stirring epistle as have happen with mr aphra behn 's fictitious exploit and amorous correspondence -lrb- 1 -rrb- indeed the first biographer of mr haywood -lrb- 2 -rrb- hint that from a supposition of some improper liberty be take with she character after death by the intermixture of truth and falsehood with she history the apprehensive dame have herself suppress the fact of she life by lay a solemn injunction on a person who be well acquaint with all the particulars of it not to communicate to any one the least circumstance relate to she the success of she precaution be evident in the scantiness of we information about she the few detail record in the biographium dramatica can be amplify only by a tissue of probability consequently mr haywood 's one resemblance to shakespeare be the obscurity that cover the event of she life she be bear in london probably in 1693 and she father a man by the name of fowler be a small shop-keeper -lrb- 3 -rrb- she speak vaguely of have receive a education beyond that afford to the generality of she sex she marriage to valentine haywood -lrb- 4 -rrb- a clergyman at least fifteen year older than he spouse take place before she be twenty for the register of st mary aldermary record on 3 December 1711 the christening of charle son of valentine haywood clerk and elizabeth he wife she husband hold at this time a small living in norfolk and have recently be appoint lecturer of st mathew Friday street whether the worthy cleric reside altogether in london and discharge he duty in the country by proxy or whether mr haywood like tristram shandy 's mother enjoy the privilege of come to town only on certain interesting occasion be question which curious research fail to satisfy at any rate one of the two child assign to she by tradition be bear as we have see in london no other manifestation of they nuptial happiness appear until 7 January 1721 on which date the post boy contain a advertisement of the elopement of mr eliz haywood wife of rev valentine haywood -lrb- 5 -rrb- the cause of eliza 's flight be unknown we only knowledge of she temperament in she early life come from a remark by nichol that the character of sappho in the tatler -lrb- 6 -rrb- may be assign with probability and confidence to mr elizabeth heywood who be in all respects just such a character as be exhibit here sappho be describe by steele as a fine lady who write verse sing dance and can say and do whatever she please without the imputation of any thing that can injure she character for she be so well know to have no passion but self-love or folly but affectation that now upon any occasion they only cry ` it be she way ' and ` that be so like she ' without farther reflection she quote a wonderfully just passage from milton call a licentious speech from dryden 's state of innocence a odious thing and say a thousand good thing at random but so strangely mixed that you would be apt to say all she wit be mere good luck and not the effect of reason and judgment in the second paper sappho quote example of generous love from suckling and milton but take offence at a letter contain some sarcastic remark on married woman we know that steele be personally acquaint with mr manley and it be possible that he know mr haywood since she later dedicate a novel to he with some reservation then we may accept this sketch as a fair likeness as a young matron of seventeen or eighteen she be evidently a lively unconventional opinionate gadabout fond of the company of similar she-romp who exchange verse and specimen letter with the lesser celebrity of the literary world and perpetuate the stilted romantic tradition of the matchless orinda and she circle a woman of she independence of mind we may imagine could not readily submit to the authority of a arbitrary orthodox clergyman husband mr haywood 's writings be full of the most lively scene of marital infelicity due to cause range from theological dispute to flagrant licentiousness she enemy be not so charitable as to attribute she flight from she husband to any reason so innocent as incompatibility of temper or discrepancy of religious view the position of ex-wife be neither understand nor tolerate by contemporary society in the word of a favorite quotation from jane shore : but if weak woman chance to go astray if strongly charm would she leave the thorny way and in the softer path of pleasure stray ruin ensue reproach and endless shame and one false step entirely damn she fame : in vain with tear the loss she may deplore in vain look back to what she be before she set like star that fall to rise no more eliza haywood however after leave the thorny way of matrimony fail to carry out the laureate 's metaphor have less of the fall star in she than mr rowe imagine and perhaps more of the hen she refuse to set but resolutely face the world and in spite of all rule of decorum try to earn a living for herself and she two child if indeed as pope 's slander imply she have child to support the way in which a woman could win she bread outside the pale of matrimony be extremely limit a stage career connect with a certain degree of infamy have be open to the sex since restoration time and write for the theater have be successfully practice by mr behn mrs manley mrs centlivre mrs pix and mrs davys the first two female playwright mention have produce beside they dramatic work a number of piece of fiction and mr mary hearne mr jane barker and mr sarah butler have already gain a milder notoriety as _ romancières _ poetry always the elegant amusement of polite person have not yet prove profitable enough to sustain a woman of letter eliza haywood be sufficiently catholic in she taste to attempt all these means of gain reputation and a livelihood and try in addition a short-lived experiment as a publisher beside these literary pursuit we know not what obscure means for support she may have find from time to time she first thought however be apparently of the theater where she have already make she debut on the stage of the playhouse in smock alley -lrb- orange street -rrb- dublin during the season of 1715 as chloe in timon of athen or the man-hater -lrb- 7 -rrb- one scan the _ dramati persona _ of timon in vain for the character of chloe until one recall that the eighteenth century have no liking for shakespeare undefile the version use by the theater royal be of course the adaptation by thoma shadwell in which chloe appear chiefly in act ii and iii as the maid and confidant of the courtesan melissa both part be add by og the rôle of cleon be take by quin later a interpreter of mr haywood 's own play but if she form a connection with either of the london theater after leave she husband the engagement be soon break off and she subsequent appearance as a actress in she comedy of a wife to be lett -lrb- 1723 -rrb- and in hatchett 's rival father -lrb- 1730 -rrb- be due in the one case to a accident and in the other to she friendship for the playwright she herself accord to the biographium dramatica when young dabble in dramatic poetry but with no great success the first of she play a tragedy entitle the fair captive be act the traditional three time at lincoln 's inn field begin 4 march 1721 -lrb- 8 -rrb- aaron hill contribute a friendly epilogue quin take the part of mustapha the despotic vizier and mr seymor play the heroine on 16 November it be present a fourth time for the author 's benefit -lrb- 9 -rrb- then allow to die shortly after the first performance the print copy make its appearance in the advertisement to the reader mr haywood expose the circumstance of she turn playwright naïvely announce : to attempt any thing in vindication of the follow scene wou would cost I more time than the compose 'em take I up this tragedy be originally writ by capt hurst and by he deliver would to mr rich to be act soon after the opening of the new house -lrb- 10 -rrb- but the season be a little too far elap would for the bring it on then and the author oblig have to leave the kingdom mr rich become the purchaser of it and the winter follow order would it into rehearsal : but find it so unfit for representation that for a long time he lay aside all thought of make any thing of it till last January he give I the history of he bargain and make I some proposal concern the new model it : but however i be prevail would upon i can not say my inclination have much share in my consent on reading i find i have much more to do than i expect every character i be oblig 'd to find employment for introduce one entirely new without which it have be impossible to have guess at the design of the play and in fine change the diction so wholly that except in the part of alphonso and isabellum there remain not twenty line of the original the plot which be too involve to be analyze center about the effort of alphonso to redeem he beloved isabellum from the harem of the vizier mustapha spaniard turk keeper and inhabitant of the harem and a young lady disgui would in the habit of a eunuch mingle in inextricable intrigue some of the worst absurdity and the most bathetic line occur in the part of the two lover for which mr haywood disclaim responsibility but even the best passage of the play add nothing to the credit of the reviser she next dramatic venture be produce after she novel have gain some vogue with the town as the prologue speak by mr theophilus cibber indicate critick be dumb tonight -- no skill display a dangerous woman-poet write the play : measure she force by she known novel writ with manly vigor and with woman 's wit then tremble and depend if ye beset she she who can talk so well may act yet better the fair success achieve by a wife to be lett : a comedy act at drury lane three time commence 12 August 1723 -lrb- 11 -rrb- be say to have be due largely to the curiosity of the public to see the author who by reason of the indisposition of a actress perform in person the part of the wife mr graspall a character well suit to she romping disposition it be difficult to imagine how the play could have succeed on its own merit for the intricacy of the plot tax the attention even of the reader a certain ann minton however revive the piece in the guise of the comedy of a wife to be lett or the miser cure compress into two act -lrb- 1802 -rrb- apparently the reception of she comedy be not sufficiently encourage to induce mr haywood to continue write play for six year elapse before she make a third effort in dramatic write with a tragedy entitle frederick duke of brunswick-lunenburgh which be first produce at lincoln 's inn field on 4 march 1729 -lrb- 12 -rrb- and shortly afterward publish with a dedication to frederick lewi prince of wale the intention of the dedication be obviously to bid for royal patronage but the intended victim be too astute to be catch in eulogize the emperor frederick -lrb- _ c _ 1400 -rrb- the author find abundant opportunity to praise by implication he namesake but unfortunately for the success of the play none of the royal family vouchsafe to honor it with they presence mr haywood complain that hers be the only new performance this season which have not receive a sanction from some of that illustrious line and the unthinking part of the town follow the fashion set by royalty unlike the fair captive which suffer from a plethora of incident mr haywood 's second tragedy contain almost nothing in its five act but rant a analysis of the plot be but a summary of conversation act i the german prince hail frederick recently elect emperor count waldec and ridolpho in league with the archbishop of metz conspire against he waldec urge he sister adelaid to marry the gallant wirtemberg sophium she woman and confidant also urge she to marry but adelaid can only reply i charge thee peace nor join such distant sound as joy and wirtemberg and during the rest of the act proclaim the anguish inspire by she unrequited passion for frederick married three year before to a saxon princess act ii the conspirator plan to kill frederick adelaid reproach he for abandon she he welcome he imperial consort anna and take occasion to deliver many magnanimous sentiment act iii adelaid declare that she can not love wirtemberg waldec excite the impatient lover to jealousy of frederick ridolpho be banish court for murder act iv frederick be distressed by wirtemberg 's discontent the empress seek to learn the reason for it be infect by wirtemberg 's suspicion adelaid overhear ridolpho and waldec plot to slay frederick but hesitate to accuse she own brother wirtemberg reproach she for she suppose yield to frederick and resolve to leave she forever act v adelaid in order to warn he send to ask the emperor to visit she waldec intercept the letter and resolve to murder frederick in she chamber wirtemberg learn that he have be dupe and defend the emperor waldec and ridolpho be kill though not before they succeed in mortally wound frederick who die amid tear genest say with truth that the love scene be dull and that the subject be not well calculate for dramatic representation the play be act only the usual three time and fully deserve the deep damnation of its take off in 1730 mr haywood take part in the rival father or the death of achille write by she friend the actor and playwright william hatchett and perform at the haymarket -lrb- 13 -rrb- three year later she join with he to produce a adaptation of fielding 's tragedy of tragedy or the life and death of tom thumb the great on the model of gay 's popular beggar 's opera the opera of opera follow its original closely with a number of condensation and omission almost the only addition make by the collaborator be the short lyric which be set to music by the ingenious mr frederick lampe -lrb- 14 -rrb- the hatchett-haywood version be act at the haymarket on 31 may 1733 and accord to genest be repeat eleven time at least with mr clive as queen dollalollum -lrb- 15 -rrb- it be publish immediately on 9 November a performance be give at drury lane although unusually successful it be mrs haywood 's last dramatic offering -lrb- 16 -rrb- the aspiring authoress apparently never find in dramatic write a medium suitable to she genius and even less be she attract by a stage career the reason for she abandon the theater to develop she power as a writer of fiction be state in a characteristic letter still file among the state papers -lrb- 17 -rrb- _ sir _ the stage not answer my expectation and the averseness of my relation to it have make I turn my genius another way i have print some little thing which have mett a better reception then they deservd or i expect : and have now ventur would on a translation to be do by subscription the proposall whereof i take the liberty to send you : i have be so much we would to receive favor from you that i can make no doubt of y' r forgiveness for this freedom great as it be and that you will alsoe become one of those person whose name be a countenance to my undertaking i be mistress of neither word nor happy turn of think to thank you as i ought for the many unmeritted favor you have conferr would on I but beg you to believe all that a gratefull soul can feel mine do who be sir yo ' r most humble & most obedient serv ' t eliza haywood August ye 5th 1720 enclose with the letter be proposal for printing by subscription a translation from the french of the famous monsieur bursault contain ten letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier -lrb- 18 -rrb- the work thus herald be publish in the latter part of 1720 by subscription -- three shilling each book in quire or five shilling bind in calf gilt back -- a method never again employ by mr haywood though in this case it must have succeed fairly well three hundred and nine name appear on she list of subscriber of which one hundred and twenty-three be woman 's few subscriber of either sex be distinguish there be however that universal patron of minor author george bubb esq later the doddington to whom thomson dedicate he summer mr barker the novelist aaron hill a mr osborne possibly the bookseller whose name be afterward infamously connect with eliza 's in the dunciad charle de la faye the under-secretary of state with whom defoe correspond and a sprinkling of aristocratic title the publisher of the letter be william rufus chetwood later the prompter at drury lane theater but then just commence bookseller at the sign of cato 's head covent garden he have already bring out for mr haywood the first effort of she genius a romantic tale entitle love in excess : or the fatal enquiry we have the author 's testimony that the three part mett a better reception then they deservd and indeed the piece be extraordinarily successful run through no less than six separate edition before its inclusion in she collect secret history novel and poem in 1725 on the last page of letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier chetwood have also advertise for speedy publication a book entitle the danger of give way to passion in five exemplary novel : first the british recluse or the secret history of cleomira suppose dead second the injur would husband or the mistaken resentment third lasselium or the unfortunate mistress fourth the rash resolve or the untimely discovery fifth idalium or the self-abandon 'd -lrb- 19 -rrb- write by mr eliza haywood during the next three year the five novel be issue singly by chetwood with the help of other bookseller usually daniel browne jr and samuel chapman this pair or jame roberts chetwood 's successor publish most of mr haywood 's early writings the staple of she output during the first decade of authorship be the short amatory romance like love in excess and the exemplary novel just mention these exercise in fiction be evidently compose _ currente calamo _ with little thought and less revision for a eager and undiscriminating public possibly as mr gosse conjecture -lrb- 20 -rrb- they be read chiefly by milliner and other woman on the verge of literacy but though person of solid education avoid read novel and eastern tale as they might the drinking of dram it be certain that no one of scanty means could have afford mr haywood 's slender octavo at the price of one to three shilling the lady 's library -lrb- spectator no 37 -rrb- contain beside numerous romance a book of novel and the new atalanti with a key to it which last lady mary montagu also enjoy and the dissolute country-gentleman 's daughter -lrb- spectator no 128 -rrb- who read volume of love-letter and romance to they mother a _ ci-devant _ coquette give we perhaps a more accurate idea of the woman novelist 's public doubtless mr haywood 's wares be know to the more frothy mind of the polite world and to the daughter of middle-class trading family such as the sister describe in defoe 's religious courtship whose taste for fashionable play and novel be soon to call the circulate library into be beside the proceeds arise from the sale of she work mr haywood evidently expect and sometimes receive the present of a guinea or so in return for a dedication though patron be not lack for she numerous work it do not appear that she use of they name be always authorize in put the arragonian queen under the protection of lady france lumley in fact the author confess that she have not the happiness of be know to the object of she praise but wish to be the first to felicitate she publicly upon she nuptials we may be sure that the offering of frederick duke of brunswick - lunenburgh to the hero 's namesake frederick prince of wale be both unsanctioned and unacknowledged sometimes however the writer 's language imply that she have already experience the bounty of she patron while in the case of the novel dedicate to sir richard steele at a time when he health and credit be fast give way eliza can hardly be accuse of interested motive apparently sincere too though address to a wealthy widow be the tribute to lady elizabeth germain prefix to the fruitless enquiry and at least one other of mr haywood 's production be know to have be in lady betty 's library but these instance be decidedly exceptional usually the needy novelist 's dedication be make up of servile adulation and barefaced beg with considerable skill in choose a favorable moment she direct a stream of panegyric upon william yonge -lrb- later sir -rrb- within two month after he appointment as one of the commissioner of the treasury in great britain soon after sir thoma lombe be make a knight the wife of that rich silk weaver have the pleasure of see she virtue and she new title in print and most remarkable of all lady elizabeth henley who elope with a rake early in 1728 receive mr haywood 's congratulation upon the event in the dedication of the agreeable caledonian publish in June though if we may trust mr delany 's account of the matter the bride must already have have time for repentance even grief the specialist in the study of the passion know might loosen the purse string and accordingly she take the liberty to condole with col stanley upon the loss of he wife while entreat he favor for the masquerader but of all she dedication those address to she own sex be the most melting and from they frequency be evidently the most fruitful the income derive from patronage however be at best uncertain and necessitate many application to the public moreover a novel mean nothing if not something new eliza haywood 's productiveness therefore be enormous when she have settle to she work the authoress could produce little piece range from sixty to nearly two hundred page in length with extraordinary rapidity in 1724 for instance a year of tremendous activity she rush into print no less than ten original romance beside translate half of a lengthy french work la belle assemblée by mme de gomez at this time too she celebrity have become so great that the prude a novel write by a young lady be dedicate to she just as mr hearne at the beginning of she career have put a romance the lover 's week under the protection of the famous mr manley between 1720 and 1730 mr haywood write beside play and translation thirty-eight work of she own compose one in two stout volume and several in two or more part if we may judge by the number and frequency of edition most of the indefatigable scribbler 's tale find a ready sale while the best of they such as idalium -lrb- 1723 -rrb- the fatal secret -lrb- 1724 -rrb- the mercenary lover -lrb- 1726 -rrb- the fruitless enquiry and philidore and placentium -lrb- 1727 -rrb- gain for she not a little applause nor be the young adventuress in letter unhail by literary man aaron hill immediately befriend she by write a epilogue for she first play and another of hill 's circle the irresponsible richard savage attempt to paint the wonder of eliza 's praise in verse prefix to love in excess and the rash resolve -lrb- 1724 -rrb- -lrb- 21 -rrb- along with savage 's first complimentary poem be two other effusion in one of which a atheist to love 's power acknowledge he conversion through the force of eliza 's revelation of the tender passion while the other express with less rapture the same idea but it remain for jame sterling the friend of concanen to state most vigorously the contemporary estimate of mr haywood and she early writings -lrb- 22 -rrb- great arbitress of passion he exclaim persuasion wait on all you bright design and where you point the vary soul incline : see love and friendship the fair theme inspire we glow with zeal we melt in soft desire thro ' the dire labyrinth of ill we share the kindred sorrow of the gen ` rous pair till plea would reward vertue we behold shine from the furnace pure as tortur would gold : of _ love in excess _ part ii and at the front of each successive edition have never be reprint -lrb- transcriber 's note : wording in

minister on high command the throbbing breast and watry eye and as we captive spirit ebb and flow smile at the tempest you have rai would below : the face of guilt a flush of vertue wear and sudden burst the involuntary tear : honor 's swear foe the libertine with shame descend to curse the sordid lawless flame the tender maid here learn man 's various wiles rash youth hence dread the wanton 's

with conscious shame pathetic _ behn _ or _ mauley 's _ greater name forget they sex and own when _ haywood _ writ she clo would the fair triumvirate of wit bear to delight as to reform the age she paint example thro ' the shine page satiric precept warm the moral tale and caustick burn where the mild balsam fail -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- a task reserv would for she to whom ` tis give to stand the proxy of vindictive heav 'n amid the conventional extravagance of this panegyric exist some useful grain of criticism one of the most clearly express and continually reiterate aim of prose fiction as of other species of write from time immemorial be that of convey to the reader a moral through the agreeable channel of example this exemplary purpose inherit by eighteenth century novelist from cervante and from the french romance be assert again and again in mr haywood 's preface -lrb- 23 -rrb- while the last paragraph of nearly all she tale be use to convey a admonition or to proclaim the value of the story as a warn to the youth of both sex to modern reader these piece seem less successful illustration of fiction make didactic than of didacticism dissolve and quite forget in fiction but sterling and other eulogist strenuously support the novelist 's claim to moral usefulness -lrb- 24 -rrb- the pill of improvement suppose to be swallow along with the sweet of diversion hardly ever consist of good precept and praiseworthy action but usually of a warning or a horrible example of what to avoid -lrb- 25 -rrb- as a necessary corollary the more striking and sensational the picture of guilt the more efficacious it be likely to prove in the cause of virtue so in the preface to lasselium -lrb- 1723 -rrb- publish to remind the unthinking part of the world how dangerous it be to give way to passion the writer hope that she unexceptionable intent will excuse the too great warmth which may perhaps appear in some particular page for without the expression be invigorate in some measure proportionate to the subject ` twou would be impossible for a reader to be sensible how far it touch he or how probable it be that he be fall into those inadvertency which the example i relate wou would caution he to avoid as a woman too mr haywood be exclude from learning 's base monopoly but not from a intuitive knowledge of the passion in which respect the sex be and be think the superior of insensible man -lrb- 26 -rrb- consequently she chief excellence in the opinion of she reader lay in that power to command the throbbing breast and watry eye previously recognize by the volunteer laureate and she other admirer she could tell a story in clear and lively if not always correct and elegant english and she could describe the ecstasy and agony of passion in a way that seem natural and convincing to a audience nurture on french _ roman à longue haleine _ and heroic play unworthy as they may seem when place beside the subsequent triumph of the novel she short romance nevertheless keep alive the spirit of idealistic fiction and stimulate a interest in the emotion during a age when even poetry have become the handmaid of reason but although eliza have few rival as a arbitress of the passion she do not enjoy a equal success as the proxy of vindictive heaven when she attempt to apply the caustic of satire instead of the mild balsam of moral tale she speedily make herself enemy from the very first indeed she have be persecute by those who have a inveterate habit of detect particular person aim at in the character of she fiction -lrb- 27 -rrb- and even without they aspersion she path be sufficiently hard it would be impossible to recount the numerous difficulty a woman have to struggle through in she approach to fame : if she writings be considerable enough to make any figure in the world envy pursue she with unweary would diligence and if on the contrary she only write what be forget as soon as read contempt be all the reward she wish to please excite and the cold breath of scorn chill the little genius she have and which perhaps cherish by encouragement might in time grow to a praise-worthy height -lrb- 28 -rrb- unfortunately the cold breath of scorn though it may have stunt she genius could not prevent it from bear unseasonable fruit she contribution to the duncan campbell literature a spy upon the conjurer -lrb- 1724 -rrb- and the dumb projector -lrb- 1725 -rrb- in which the romancer add a breath of intrigue to the atmosphere of mystery surround the wizard open the way for more notorious appeal to the popular taste for personal scandal in the once well know memoirs of a certain island adjacent to the kingdom of utopia -lrb- 1725-6 -rrb- and the no less infamous secret history of the present intrigue of the court of carimanium -lrb- 1727 -rrb- mr haywood find a fit repertory for daringly licentious gossip of the sort make fashionable reading by mr manley 's atalanti but though the _ roman à clef _ of mr haywood like the juvenile composition of mr stepney might well have make gray author blush she chief claim to celebrity undoubtedly depend upon she inclusion in the immortal rank of grubstreet she scandal novel do not fail to arouse the wrath of person in high station and alexander pope make of the writer 's know though never acknowledge connection with piece of the sort a pretext for show he righteous

have think that day lose which do not present I with some new opportunity of shew myself -- my life for some year be a continue round of what i then call pleasure and my whole time engross would by a hurry of promiscuous diversion -- but whatever inconvenience such a manner of conduct have bring upon myself i have this consolation to think that the publick may reap some benefit from it : -- the company i keep be not indeed always so well choose as it ought to have be for the sake of my own interest or reputation but then it be general and by consequence furnish I not only with the knowledge of many occurrence which otherwise i have be ignorant of but also enable I to see into the most secret spring which give rise to the action i have either hear or be witness of -- to judge of the various passion of the human mind and distinguish those imperceptible degree by which they become master of the heart and attain the dominion over reason with this experience add to a genius tolerably extensive and a education more liberal than be ordinarily allow to person of my sex i flatter would myself that it might be in my power to be in some measure both useful and entertaining to the

cléopâtre other permit the inclusion of numerous little history only loosely connect with the main plot letter burn with love or jealousy be insert upon the slightest provocation and indeed remain a important component of eliza haywood 's write whether the ostensible form be romance essay or novel scrap of poetry too be sometimes use to ornament she earliest effusion but the other miscellaneous feature of the romance -- list of maxim oratory moral discourse and conversation -- be discard from the first the language of these short romance while generally more easy and often more colloquial than the absurd extravagance of the translator of heroic romance and they imitator still smack too frequently of shady grove and purling stream to be natural many conventional theme of love or jealousy together with such stock type as the amorous oriental potentate the lover disguise as a slave the female page the heroine of excessive delicacy the languish beauty the ravishing sea-captain and the convenient pirate persist in the page of mr barker mr haywood and mr aubin as in the interminable tome of scudéry love and honor supply the place of life and manners in the tale of she female successor and though in some respects they story be nearer the standard of real conduct new novel on the whole be but old romance writ small in attempt to revitalize the material and method of the romance mr haywood be but follow the lead of the french _ romancières _ who have successfully invade the field of prose fiction when the passing of the précieuse fashion and boileau 's influential ridicule -lrb- 1 -rrb- have discredit the romance in the eye of writer with classical predilection mme de la fayette far outshine she rival but a host of obscure woman head by hortense desjardin better know as mme de villedieu hasten to supply the popular demand for romantic story in draw they subject from the history of more modern court than those of rome greece or egypt they endeavor to make they historical romance of passion more lifelike than the heroic romance and while they avoid the extravagance they also shun the voluminousness of the _ roman à longue haleine _ so the story relate in la belle assemblée by mme de gomez translate by mr haywood in 1725 and often reprint be nearer the model of boccaccio 's novella than of the scudéry romance both in they directness and in be set in a framework but the inclusion in the framework of long conversation on love moral politics or wit with copious example from ancient and modern history of elegant verse on despair and similar topic and of such miscellaneous matter as the general instruction of a mother to a daughter for she conduct in life show that the influence of the salon be not yet exhaust in the continuation call l'entretien des beaux esprit -lrb- translate in 1734 -rrb- however the elaborate framework be so far reduce that fourteen short tale be crowd into two volume as compare with eighteen in the four volume of the previous work writer of fiction be evidently find brief unadorned narrative most acceptable to the popular taste that the novel insert in these production have not cease to breathe the atmosphere of romance be sufficiently indicate by such title as nature outdo by love the triumph of virtue the generous corsair love victorious over death and heroick love french model of this kind supply mr haywood with a mine of romantic plot and situation which she be not slow to utilize -lrb- 2 -rrb- furthermore she natural interest in emotional fiction be quicken by these and other translation from the french the letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier emphasize the teaching of the lettre portugaise while the lady 's philosopher 's stone or the caprice of love and destiny

indicate in the sub-title and in the disgui would prince : or the beautiful parisian -lrb- 1728 -rrb- she translate the melting history of a prince who wed a merchant 's daughter in spite of complicated difficulty -lrb- 4 -rrb- much reading in book of this sort fill mr haywood 's mind with image of exalted virtue and tremendous vice and like a female quixote she see and report the life about she in term borrow from the romance so too mrs manley have write she autobiography in the character of rivellum this romantic turn of mind be not easily lay aside but the woman writer make some progress toward a more direct and natural representation of the passion the advance be due partly no doubt to a perception of the heroic absurdity of french fiction but also to the study of italian _ novella _ and the exemplary novel of cervante but even when imitate the compression of these short tale mr haywood do not always succeed in free herself from the amour trop delicat of the romantic convention in two short novel append to cleomelium : or the generous mistress -lrb- 1727 -rrb- the robust animalism of the italian tale come in sharp contrast with the _ délicatesse _ of the french

indifferent answer and marry gaspero out of pique the distract lover thereupon fall upon he sword in the presence of the newly wed couple and the bride touch by the spectacle of she lover 's devotion languish and die in a few month there be little naturalness in the extravagant passion of the second story but until sensationalism cloy the public palate realism be a unnecessary labor by place the event in some romantic country like spain portugal italy or even france any narrative of excessive love could be make to pass current the latin country be vaguely imagine by romantic novelist as a sort of remote but actual _ pay du tendre _ where the most extraordinary action might occur if only love soft love be the motivate force a collection of select novel call love in its variety advertise in 1727 as write in spanish by signior michel ban dello make english by mr eliza haywood be apparently a translation from the _ novella _ of matteo bandello probably from a french version -lrb- 5 -rrb- the best example of she brief direct tale however be to be find in the fruitless enquiry be a collection of several entertaining history and occurrence which fall under the observation of a lady in she search after happiness -lrb- 1727 -rrb- although the scene be lay in venice the model of this framework story be probably not the decameron but the oriental tale know in england through french translation and imitation of the arabian night intercalate story be not uncommon in french romance but they be almost invariably introduce as life history of the various character a fantastic framework with a hint of magic fabricate expressly to give unity to a series of tale half exemplary half satirical point directly to a ultimate connection with the narrative of scheherezade and sutlememé no attempt to catch the spirit of the east be discernible but the vogue of oriental tale be evidently begin to make a impression on french and english writer of fiction care for the moral welfare of she reader doubtless influence mr haywood to assert in the dedication to lady elizabeth germain that the follow sheet contain the history of some real fact and that the author 's chief design in publishing be to persuade my sex from seek happiness the wrong way at any rate the moral of the story suit the taste of the age -lrb- 6 -rrb- miramillium widow of a nobleman in venice lose

interest that attach to lover separate but eternally constant the history of stenoclea and of tellisinda contain situation of dramatic intensity but perhaps the story of violathium be the most worthy of attention on account both of its defect and of its merit the weakest part of the plot be the husband who be jealous without cause and equally without reason suddenly reform but the character of violathium be admirably draw unlike the usual heroine of haywoodian fiction she be superior to circumstance and do not yield she love to the most complacent adjacent male as a dutiful wife she resist for a long time the insinuation of charmillo but when she decide to fly to she lover she husband 's tardy change of heart can not alter she feeling she character be individual firm and palpable if the

from other literary form the maker of fiction freely derive sensational material and technical hint without insist too closely upon the connection between novel and play we may well remember that nearly all the early novelist defoe except be intimately associate with the theater mr behn mr manley mr haywood and later fielding and mr lennox be successful in both field the woman writer especially be familiar with dramatic technique both as actor and playwright and turn they stage training to account when they write prose fiction mr haywood 's first novel love in excess -lrb- 1720 -rrb- show evidence of she apprenticeship to the theater its three part may be compare to the three act of a play the principal climax fall properly at the end of the second part and the whole end in stereotyped theatrical fashion with the marriage of all the survive couple the handling of incident too be in the fashion of the stage mr haywood have sufficient skill to build up a dramatic situation but she invariably solve it or rather fail to solve it by a interruption at the critical moment so that the reader 's interest be continually titillate of a situation have in itself the germ of a solution she apparently have not the remotest conception when a love scene have be carry far enough the come of a servant the sound of a duel near by or a seasonable outbreak of fire interrupt it such device be the common stock in trade of minor writer for the theater dramatic hack who turn to prose fiction find it only a more commodious vehicle for incident and scene already familiar to they on the stage in they hand the novel become simply a looser and more extended series of sensational adventure accident though temper in various degree by jealousy hatred envy or love be the supreme motivate force the character of mr haywood 's love in excess also inherit many trait from the debased but glittering sir fopling flutter mirabell millamant and lady wishfort of the restoration stage of character drawing indeed there be practically none in the entire piece the personage be distinguish only by the degree of they willingness to yield to the tender passion the story in all its intricacy may best be describe as the _ vie amoureuse _ of count d'elmont a hero with none of the wit but with all the gallantry of the rake of late restoration comedy two part of the novel relate the aristocratic intrigue of d'elmont and he friend the third show he like mr centlivre 's gallant in the fifth act reform and a model of constancy it would be useless to detail the sensational extravagance of the plot in all its ramification but the hero 's adventure before and after marriage may serve as a fair sample of the whole d'elmont return to pari from the french war become the admiration of both sex but especially in the eye of the rich and noble alovisa appear a conquest worthy of she power to a incoherent expression of she passion send to he in a anonymous letter he pay no attention have for diversion commence a intrigue with the lovely amena though alovisa in a second billet bid he aim at a higher mark he have say too many fine thing to be lose and continue he pursuit until amena 's father take alarm and lock she up through she maid she arrange for a secret meeting and though touch by she father 's reproof she be unable to withstand the plea of the captivating count they tete-a-tete in the tuillery however be interrupt by alovisa 's spy who alarm the house with cry of fire so that the lover find themselves lock out half senseless with dismay amena find shelter in the house of alovisa who though inwardly triumphant receive she rival civilly and promise to reconcile she to she father d'elmont be so patently glad to be relieve of he fair

wife and console himself by fall in love with he ward the matchless melliora but the progress of he amour be interrupt by numerous unforeseen accident the mere suspicion of he inconstancy raise he wife 's jealousy to a fever heat to expose she rival she pretend to yield to the persuasion of she wooer the baron d'espernay but as a result of a very intricate intrigue both alovisa and the baron

husband continue with they fair wife great and lovely example of conjugal affection such with the omission of all secondary narrative be the main plot of eliza haywood 's first novel love in excess best illustrate the similarity of sensational fiction to clap-trap drama but other of she early work bear trace of the author 's familiarity with the theater the escape of the pair of lover from a oriental court already the theme of countless play include mr haywood 's own pair captive be re-vamped to supply a episode in idalium -lrb- 1723 -rrb- and part of the same novel be write in conceal blank verse that echo the heroic orientalism of some of dryden 's tragedy in the character of grubguard the amorous alderman of the city jilt -lrb- 1726 -rrb- mr haywood apparently have in mind not alderman barber whom the character little resemble but rather antonio in otway 's venice preserve and the plot of the distressed orphan or love in a mad-house -lrb- c 1726 -rrb- where young colonel marathon feign himself mad in order to get access to he beloved annilium may perhaps owe its inspiration to the coarser mad-house scene of middleton 's changeling -lrb- 8 -rrb- on the whole however the drama but poorly repay its debt to prose fiction a indication of the multifarious origin of the short tale of love be to be find in the nominal diversity of the set the scene though often lay in some such passion-ridden land as spain or italy rarely affect the nature of the story but as in such novel as philidore and placentium and the agreeable caledonian the character wander widely over the face of europe and even come in contact with strange eastern clime so the writer of romantic tale ransack the remotest corner of literature and history for sensational matter the much elaborate chronicle of the moor be make to eke out substance for the arragonian queen -lrb- 1724 -rrb- a story of europe in the eighth century while cleomelium : or the generous mistress be advertise as the secret history of a lady lately arriv would from bengall the tendency to exploit the romantic feature of outlandish locality be carry to the ultimate degree by mr penelope aubin whose character range over africa turkey persium the east and west indy and the north american continent often with peculiar geographical result but neither mr aubin nor mr haywood be able to use the gorgeous local color that distinguish mr behn 's oroonoko and still less do they command the realistic imagination that could make the travels of a captain singleton lifelike even when as in the mercenary lover the setting be transfer to the metropolis of one of the finest island in the world and the action take place in the neighborhood of a celebrated church in the sound of whose bell the inhabitant of that populous city think it a honor to be bear -lrb- 9 -rrb- the change be unaccompanied by any attempt at circumstantial realism we be tell that belinda of the british recluse be a young lady of warwickshire that fantomina follow she lover to bath in the guise of a chambermaid or that the fair hebrew relate the true but secret history of two jewish lady who lately reside in london but without the label the setting could not be distinguish from the vague and unidentified _ mise en scène _ of such a romance as the unequal conflict placentium in england rave of she passion for philidore exactly as alovisa in pari emanuellum in madrid -lrb- 10 -rrb- or cleomelium in bengal expose the rapture and agony of they passion the hero of the double marriage -lrb- 1726 -rrb- rescue a distressed damsel in the wood outside of plymouth exactly as one of ariosto 's or spenser 's knights-errant might have do in the fairy country of old romance in the sordid tale of irish artifice print in curll 's female dunciad -lrb- 1728 -rrb- no reader could distinguish in the romantic name aglaura and merovius the nationality or the meanness of a villainous irish housekeeper and she son and though the tale be the very reverse of romantic it contain no hint of actual circumstance the character in mr haywood 's early fiction move in a imaginary world sometimes it be true marked with the name of real place but no more truly realistic than the setting of arcadium or parthenissa nor be the figure that people the eighteenth century paradise of romance more definitely picture than the landscape they be generally unindividualized lay figure sway by the passion of the moment or at best mere humor character represent love 's epitome extravagant jealousy or eternal constancy pope could make a portrait specific by the vigorous use of epigram but mr haywood 's comment on she hero and heroine be but feeble the description of lasselium for instance contain no trait that be particular no characteristic definitely individual the girl be simply the type of all that be conventionally charming in she sex splendidly null dead perfection but if the grave part of the world be charm would with she wit and discretion the young and gay be infinitely more so with she beauty which tho ' it be not of that dazzling kind which strike the eye at first look on it with desire and wonder yet it be such as seldom fail would of captivating heart most averse to love she feature be perfectly regular she eye have a uncommon vivacity in they mix would with a sweetness which speak the temper of she soul she mien be gracefully easy and she shape the most exquisite that could be in fine she charm encrea would by be often see every view discover would something new to be admir would and tho ' they be of that sort which more properly may be say to persuade than to command adoration yet they persuade it in such a manner that no mortal be able to resist they force -lrb- p 2 -rrb- mr haywood 's hero be merely the masculine counterpart of she woman bellcor the type of many more have as much learning as be necessary to a gentleman who depend not on that alone to raise he fortune : he have also admirable skill in fencing and become a horse as well as any man in the world -lrb- 11 -rrb- victor over a thousand heart the haywoodian male range through he glitter sphere ever ready to fall in or out of love as the occasion demand d'elmont of love in excess possess a soul large enough to contain both love and fury at almost the same moment a brulée with he spouse merely increase he tenderness for he ward you have do well madam -lrb- say d'elmont look on she with eye sparkling with indignation -rrb- you have do well by you impertinent curiosity and imprudence to rouze I from my dream of happiness and remind I that i be that wretched thing a husband ` tis well indeed answer would alovisa -lrb- who see now that there be no need of farther dissimulation -rrb- that any thing can make you remember both what you be and what i be you resum would he hastily interrupt she have take a effectual method to prove you self a wife -- a very wife -- insolent -- jealous -- and censorious -- but madam continue he frown since you be pleased to assert you privilege be assur would i too shall take my turn and will exert the -- husband in say this he fling out of the room in spite of she endeavor to hinder he and go hastily through a gallery which have a large window that look would into the garden he perceiv would melliora lie on a green bank in a melancholy but a charming posture directly opposite to the place where he be she beauty appear would if possible more to advantage than ever he have see they or at least he have more opportunity thus unseen by she to gaze upon they : he in a moment lose all the rage of temper he have be in and he whole soul be take up with softness ambition envy hate fear or anger every other passion that find entrance in the soul art and discretion may disguise but love tho ' it may be feign would can never be conceal would not only the eye -lrb- those true and most perfect intelligencer of the heart -rrb- but every feature every faculty betray it it fill the whole air of the person possess would of it it wander round the mouth play in the voice tremble in the accent and show itself a thousand different way even melliora 's care to hide it make it more apparent and the transport d'elmont not consider where he be or who might be a witness of he rapture could not forbear catch she in he arm and grasp she with a extasy which plainly tell she what he thought be tho ' at that time he have not power to put 'em into word and indeed there be no greater proof of a vast and elegant passion than the be uncapable of express it -lrb- p 79 -rrb- oddly enough the early experimenter in fiction never perceive that to seem real a passion must be feel by a real person they attempt again and again to heighten the picture of envy fear ambition rage or love by all manner of extraordinary circumstance but they rarely succeed in attach the emotion to a lifelike character it be indeed passion but passion paint on the void impalpable consequently they almost never succeed in maintain complete verisimilitude nor be they character draw any less shadowy than in the sentimental romance of sidney and lodge compare for example the first expression of rosalynde 's love with the internal debate of mr haywood 's placentium -lrb- 12 -rrb- both be cast in soliloquy form and except that the eighteenth century romancer make no attempt to decorate the style with fantastic conceit the two description be not essentially different -lrb- placentium -rrb- be no sooner at liberty to reflect than she grow amaze at herself for have expresd and still feel so uncommon a concern for the service she have receive from jacobin -lrb- philidore -rrb- he do no more say she than be he duty nay any man would have do as much for a woman to whom he have not the least obligation if distressed and assault in the manner she have be -- why then continue she do the action appear so charming so meritorious from he -- ` tis certainly the surprize to find so much gallantry and courage in a man of he mean birth that have cause this disorder in my soul -- be he my equal i should think it be love have seize I but oh far be it from I to debase myself so far -- yet again would she retort what can i wish in man that be not to be find in this too lovely slave besides who know but that he descent may be otherwise than he pretend -- i have hear of prince who have wander in strange disguise -- he may be in reality as far above I as he seem beneath the thought that there be a possibility for such a thing to be have no sooner enter into she head than she indulge it with a infinity of rapture she paint he in imagination the most desperate die lover that ever be represent the transport she shou would be in when the blest discovery shou would be make hold long discourse with he and form answer such as she suppose he wou would make on such a occasion thus for some hour do she beguile she care but love who take delight sometimes to torment he votary wou would not long permit she to enjoy this satisfaction reason with stern remonstrance check the romantick turn of she late thought and show she the improbability of the hope she have entertain : be he cry she with a agony proportion to she former transport of any degree which you would encourage he pretension to my love he cou would not for so long a time have endure the servile office to which he have be put -- some way he ingenious passion wou would have find out to have reveal itself -- no no he be neither a lover nor a gentleman and i but raise chimera 's to distract myself but ill -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- retrieve all yet ill discharge he from my house and service -- he be a enchanter and have bewitch I from my reason and never never more shall he behold my face the normal character in eliza haywood 's tale almost invariably conform to some conventional type borrow from the romance or the stage the author 's purpose be not to paint a living portrait but to create a vehicle for the expression of vivid emotion and in she design she be undoubtedly successful until the read public be educate to demand better thing on -lrb- transcriber 's note : sic -rrb- exception however to the customary conventionality of mr haywood 's heroine ought to be note ordinarily the novelist accept the usual conception of man the pursuer and woman the victim but sometimes instead of let lovely woman reap the consequence of she folly after the fashion of goldsmith 's celebrated lyric she violate romantic tradition by make she disappointed heroine retire into self-sufficient solitude defy society in real life the author of these story be even more uncompromising far from pine in obscurity after she elopement from she husband she continue to exist in the broad light of day gain a independent living by the almost unheard of occupation -lrb- as far as woman be concern -rrb- of write if she be blighted she give no indication of the fact something of the same defiant spirit

have be immure in a convent to suffer a living death but instead of acquiesce in they fate belinda and cleomira mirtamene and glicera defy the world and in the last case prove that the worm may turn among the work of she first decade of authorship a few effusion in which mr haywood have succeed to a degree in motivate characterize or analyze the passion of she character must be exempt from the general charge of commonplaceness the first of these be idalium : or the unfortunate mistress -lrb- 1724 -rrb- the story of a young venetian beauty -- like lasselium she charm can only be imagine not describe -- whose vary amorous adventure carry she over most of italy she be seek by countless suitor among they the base florez whom she father promptly forbid the house idalium 's vanity be pique at

by remorse she die by the same knife the motivation of the heroine at the beginning of the story as miss morgan have point out -lrb- 13 -rrb- be more elaborate than usual in haywoodian romance to show a young girl 's vanity tease she into a intrigue require a more delicate appreciation of the passion than the stock situation in love story afford oblige to draw upon she own resource mr haywood handle the incident with a niceness that could hardly have be expect from the author of love in excess she sense for _ vraisemblance _ protect she from many absurdity though not from all for instance when idalium to preserve herself from the importunity of ferdinand employ the same threat of stab herself that clarissa harlowe in similar circumstance hold over lovelace the italian heroine very naturally try first to stab she seducer but realism vanish when idalium begin she romantic flight from place to place and from lover to lover the incident of romance crowd fast around she when in man 's clothes she be love by a woman who take she for what she seem and by the woman 's husband who know she for what she be the reader can not help recall a similar gordian love-knot in sidney 's arcadium perhaps the only convincing detail in the latter part of the book be the heroine 's miserable end but although the sentiment of the character be report in conceal blank verse that smack of theatrical rant though the absurd oriental digression the disguise the frequent poisoning and fortunate accident all detract from the naturalness and plausibility of the tale yet one can not deny the piece occasional merit which if smother in extravagance be hopeful sign of a coming change the very excess of strained and unnatural incident indicate that the popular palate be become cloy for a time the writer of fiction attempt to stimulate it by spice the dish but when the limit of mordancy be reach a new diet become imperative though in no sense a soothing draught for the overstrained sensibility of romance reader the fatal secret : or constancy in distress -lrb- 1724 -rrb- nevertheless represent a valuable part of mr haywood 's contribution to the technique of the novel few of she work indicate more clearly she power to display the operation of passion dominate a young and innocent heart when the story open anadea be a heart-free maid of sixteen better educate than most young girl and chiefly interested in she study fear to leave she unprovided for she father urge she to marry and she though incline to a single life return a dutiful answer beg he to direct she choice he fix upon the worthy chevalier de semar and bid she prepare for the wedding the time which the necessary preparation take up anadea pass would in model she soul as much as possible to be plea would with the state for which she be intend -- the chevalier have many good quality and she endeavor to add to they in imagination a thousand more never do any woman take greater pain to resist the dictate of desire than she do to create they yet she have it not in she power to feel any of those soft emotion those impatiency for he absence those tender thrilling in he presence nor any of those agreeable perplexity which be the unfailing consequence of love and she begin at length to lay the blame on she own want of sensibility and to imagine she have not a heart fram would like those of other woman at the house of a friend anadea meet the count de blessure and feel the start of hitherto unsuspected passion beside this new lover the chevalier appear as nought she mind be rack by a alternation of hope and despair in anxiety such as hopeless lover feel do the discontented anadea pass the night : -- she could not avoid wish though there be not the least room for she to imagine a possibility of what she wish would : -- she could not help pray yet think those prayer a sin -- she once calm and peaceful bosom be now all hurry and confusion : -- the esteem which she have be long labor to feel for the chevalier be now turn would to aversion and disdain and the indifference she have for all mankind now convert into the most violent passion for one she think she could be contend to live a single life and know so little of the encroach nature of the passion she have entertain that she believe she should never languish for any greater joy than that she might without a crime indulge contemplation with the idea of he perfection and to destroy that please theory by marry with another be more terrible to she than the worst of death -- confound what to do or rather wild that there be nothing she could do that might be of service to she in a exigence like this she mind grow all a chaos and the unintermitting inquietude of she soul not permit any repose she have a very good pretence to keep she chamber and receive no visit she pass the day in torment perplexity sometimes relieve by interval of unsubstantial joy when she fancy that she affianced may break off the match for some reason that he sickness a accident or death may leave she free to wed blessure in imagination she picture to herself happy meeting with she lover and even repeat they conversation then recollect she true situation she lapse into real woe and bitterness of heart the count however have be deeply affect by she charm and though he learn that she be engage to de semar he send she a appealing letter to discover whether the match be the result of choice or duty upon the receipt of this billet the soul of anadea be distract between the impulse of love and the dictate of prudence finally she write a discreet but not too severe reply intimate that she choice be due more to duty than to inclination naturally the count protest vehemently against she sacrifice herself to a man for whom she care nothing vow that the day of she wedding with de semar shall be he last upon earth and entreat a meeting what now become of the enamor would anadea how be it possible for a heart so prepossessed as hers to hold out in a reserve which be very near break the string which hold it -- yet still the consequence that might attend this meeting for a time repel the dictate of she passion -- but it be no more than a faint struggle love all-conquering all-o'er-powering love triumph over every other consideration and she consent to he and she own impatient wish under the pretence of a change of air she go to a friend 's house at versaille where blessure secretly wed she after a short period of felicity they be betray by a officious maid blessure kill the chevalier but be himself wound and cast into prison he father secure a pardon by promise the king 's mistress that the count shall marry she daughter but blessure remain constant to anadea though keep he marriage a secret for fear of infuriate he father he be send away by he displeased parent to learn the virtue of obedience while anadea retire to st cloud to await she husband 's return there the story end in a unexpected tragedy of incest and blood the back-stairs intrigue and the sensational horror which to the majority of mr haywood 's reader doubtless seem the chief attraction of the story be not different from the melodramatic feature of countless other amatory tale french and english but when for a dozen page the author seek to discover and explain the motive of she character both by impersonal comment and by the self-revelation of letter she be make a noteworthy step -- even if a unconscious one -- toward the richardsonian method of lay bare the inner nature of ordinary people she have here pursue the analysis of character as a end in itself for in the fatal secret there be no hint of disguised scandal nor any appeal to the pruriency of degenerate reader sensational in the extreme the story be but nevertheless the progress of the narrative be delay while the sentiment of the heroine be examine in the minutest detail while better know romancer exploit chiefly the strange and surprising adventure -lrb- other than amorous -rrb- of they character or use the _ voyage imaginaire _ for the purpose of satire eliza haywood and she female colleague stimulate the popular taste for romance of the heart in try to depict the working of intense human passion they render a distinct service to the development of english fiction the story of the mercenary lover -lrb- 1726 -rrb- involve besides the ability to body forth emotion considerable power to show a gradual degradation in the character of one of the heroine the avaricious clitander gain the moiety of a fortune by marry the young gay miranda but can not rest without secure to himself the portion of the elder sister as well althea 's thoughtful and less volatile nature have hitherto resist the assault of love but she insidious brother-in-law undermine she virtue by give she wanton book and tempting she with soft speech until she yield to he wish when he attempt to make she sign a deed of gift instead of a will to provide for they child she discover he treachery and flee to the country by play upon she tenderness he coax she back and poison she miranda be fully inform of she husband 's villainy but contents herself with remove from the house thus clitander lose not only he sister-in-law 's but he wife 's fortune as well and be completely unmanned by remorse and apprehension the contrast between the character of the gay and thoughtless wife and the pensive pure-minded girl be skilfully manage and the various step in the downward course of althea 's nature be exhibit in detail like anadea in the fatal secret she retire to she chamber not to sleep but to indulge in the freedom of she thought which be pour forth at length to let the reader into the secret of she passion-ridden bosom to reveal character in action be beyond the limit of eliza haywood 's technique and once the story be well under way althea become as colorless as only a heroine of romance can be but the author 's effort to differentiate the female character before the action begin and to make a portion of the plot turn upon a psychological change in one of they show that even sensation-loving reader be demand a stricter veracity of treatment than have hitherto be necessary but perhaps the most careful interlocking of character and event to be find among these embryo novel be contain in the life of madam de villesache write by a lady who be a eye-witness of the greatest part of she adventure and faithfully translate from she french manuscript by mr eliza haywood -lrb- 1727 -rrb- since no original source for this story have come to light we may probably assume that the french manuscript be a complete fabrication on the part of the english author at any rate the tale be one of passion and intrigue such as she delight to compose henrietta daughter of a certain duke grow up in obscure circumstance to be a miracle of beauty when she father come to carry she to court she rustic lover clermont plead so effectually that she consent to a secret union with he in the glare of the court she half forget she country husband until too fatally remind of he by be seek in marriage by the marquis of ab -- lle she attempt at evasion be vain and rather than face she father 's anger she permit herself to be marry a second time she have not long enjoy she new rank when clermont whom she have inform of she step appear to reproach she and to claim he rights still irresolute she persuade he by tear and prayer not to expose she perfidy and secretly admit he to a husband 's privilege in due time the pair be catch by the marquis and to avoid he rage confess they prior marriage clermont be throw into prison where he die not without suspicion of poison henrietta retire to convent but the duke she father in order to gain the marquis 's estate for she unborn infant manage to stifle the evidence of she first marriage enrage that he can not obtain a divorce the marquis resolve to be revenge upon he perjured wife he intercept she coach in a wood outside of pari and brutally murder she the duke order she magnificently bury although nothing against the marquis can be prove he be not allow to escape the vengeance of heaven but go mad and in a lucid interval just before death confess he crime the weakness and irresolution of the heroine be make the pivot of each turn point in the plot when she yield to she lover 's entreaty to consummate a hasty marriage when fear of she father 's displeasure induce she to keep they union a secret when she love of luxurious grandeur at court persuade she to contract a more exalted match when she terror of clermont force she into a shameless expedient for the sake of mollify he anger and when after she exposure by she husband the marquis she brazen out she trial in hope of maintain the splendor of she rank and fortune she be welding link by link the chain of circumstance that draw she to ultimate disaster she be by no mean a simple heroine motivate by the elementary passion instead she be constantly sway by emotion and desire of the most diverse and complex nature after she first taste of court life she learn to look back on she husband 's rusticity with a sort of contempt and to regret she precipitate action not that she hate clermont on the contrary she have yet very great remains of she former passion for he whenever she reflect on the endearment which have past between they : but then she depi would the meanness of he extraction and the thought that she have put he in possession of a title which give he the power whenever he plea have to exert it of call she from the present grandeur of she state and oblige she to live with he in a mean retirement make all desire instigate by she affection immediately give way to that new idol of she wish greatness and she more ardently endeavor would to find some stratagem to prevent he from ever see she again than she have formerly pray would in the simplicity and innocence of she affection never to be separate from he -lrb- p 14 -rrb- when a ambitious marriage be propose she first horror at the thought of desert she country husband yield to a sort of resignation when she persuade herself of the necessity of the step and when she consider the riches title and agreeable person of the marquis she almost disdain herself for hesitate to prefer he to clermont she life be the tragedy of a soul too indolent to swim against the current of event mr haywood manage to give extraordinary vividness and consistency to the character of the vacillate henrietta by make the plot depend almost entirely upon the indecision of the heroine consequently none of the author 's woman be as sharply define as this weak pleasure-loving french girl the character draw though too much subordinate to the sensational element in the story be nevertheless distinct and true to life most probably however the few attempt at analysis of character or interrelation of character and plot be of little concern both to the author of emotional fiction and to she reader the romancer 's purpose be not to reveal a accurate picture of life and manners but to thrill the susceptible bosom by scene of tender love amorous rapture or desperate revenge the department of sensationalism especially exploit by woman writer and generally allow to be most suit to they genius be sufficiently indicate by the word typographically

style of this piece be unusually clear and straightforward sometimes suitably periphrastic but never inflate the passion describe be that of real life ungarnished by romance only greater refinement be need to make the entertainment fit for lady and gentleman the cardinal defect of some of mr haywood 's romances-in-little lay however in a romantic over-refinement of the passion rather than in a too

entirely moral or more essentially dull though the scene of the rash resolve : or the untimely discovery -lrb- 1724 -rrb- be lay in porto rico and in spain the romancer take little advantage of she opportunity to introduce the usual cloak and sword incident of spanish fiction instead she tale be one of generous love and melting pathos more characteristic of the romance than of the _ novellum _

wear out by she affliction she die of a broken heart leave she son to be adopt by he father dr johnson might with equal truth have say to mr haywood as to the author of the memoirs of miss sydney biddulph i know not madam that you have a right to make you reader suffer so much even the pathetic history of jemmy and jenny jessamy have nothing to surpass the train of woe exhibit in this earlier tale in the same soft style be two novel the unequal conflict : or nature triumphant -lrb- 1725 -rrb- and its sequel fatal fondness : or love its own opposer the plot begin with the writer 's favorite situation philenia affiance to coeurdemont fall in love with fillamor by the help of a confidant antonia the lover be enable to arrange a plan of escape on the eve of the wedding fillamor break into the house and leave he servant to bind and gag the father fly immediately to he soul 's adore he throw himself on he knee as he approach would the dear mistress of he soul and with a voice and manner

future life be entirely devote to you the innocent philenia have not presently the power of reply the different emotion of love and shame fear and joy make such a confusion in she sentiment that she could only look the meaning of they all : fillamor however find enough in this mute language to make he know he be in as fair a way of happiness as he cou would wish and return she glance with other as languish as the most melting longing love cou would teach the loveliest eye in the world they continue for some moment thus transmit soul -- until they confidant hurry they out of the house after the elopement fillamor be distract by the oppose motive of love and interest to marry philenia mean ruin for he ambitious uncle who have propose a advantageous marriage to he would never forgive he for a love match the innocent cause of he distress finally discover he perplexity and agree to live a single life until they can marry without loss of fortune in this state of affair they love seem would to be a copy of that pure and immaterial passion which angel regard each other with and which we be allow would to hope shall be we portion when shake off we earth we meet in a happier world where we be to live and love forever the lover ' paradise be invade by philenia 's father who carry she home and lock she up more closely than before in a short time she have the shocking intelligence that fillamor have marry accord to the wish of he worldly uncle she still remain constant to he but the remainder of she yet surprising adventure remark the author and those of antonium and coeurdemont must be tell another time have good reason to doubt my reader will be tir would when i be so myself eliza be perhaps the first to recover from the fatigue for in a little more than two month the continuation cost sixpence more than the first instalment be offer to she reader after make he marriage of _ convenance _ fillamor again pay he court to philenia and seize a lucky moment to surprise she on she daily walk half by persuasion half by force carry he point but before they can meet a second time she be carry off by a gang of villain who mistake she for another woman the languish misimene who have pursue fillamor into the country in man 's clothes console he for the loss of he first love upon he return to town he find that he wife have flee to join she lover meanwhile

the honor of coeurdemont receiv have the reward they virtue merit and they continue to they life end great and shine example of conjugal affection apparently philenia 's adventure be somewhat too improbable even for the taste of reader steep in melodramatic romance for if we may judge by the few copy that have survive these effusion do not enjoy a wide popularity but not to be discourage by failure mr haywood soon produce another extravagant and complicated romance entitle cleomelium : or the generous mistress be the secret history of a lady lately arriv would from bengall -lrb- 1727 -rrb- the scene might equally well have be lay in the isle of wight but bengal on the title-page doubtless serve to whet the curiosity of reader gasper secretly affiance to cleomelium be convey out of bengal by a avaricious father to prevent he from marry and she believe he unfaithful give she hand to the generous heartlove inform of the truth by a letter from she lover announce he speedy return

bride of another in despair he go to england and when she second husband be lose at sea she follow to reward he constancy cleomelium 's generosity do not seem to be as notable as the sub-title would indicate but the story be evidently intend to illustrate virtue exalt to a high romantic level with the same end in view mr haywood attempt a even loftier flight into the empyrean of romance with the result that philidore and placentium : or l ` amour trop delicat -lrb- 1727 -rrb- be more conventional and stilted than any other work from she pen it imitate closely the heroic french romance both in the inflated style and elaborate regard for the tender passion and in the structure of the plot with little history of the principal character intersperse at interval throughout the story in substance the tale be simply a mosaic of romantic adventure though some of the hero 's wanderings in the desert after be maroon by pirate and especially he encounter with the tyger sound like a faint echo of captain singleton or of captain john smith 's true travels the noble philidore fall in love with the rich and beautiful placentium but as he estate be no match for hers he contents himself with enter she service in disguise and perform menial office for the pleasure of see she one day she hear he singing in a grotto and be charm by the graceful reply he make to she question a little later he save

carry they to the castle of a persian nobleman there philidore wait with the utmost impatience for the wounded man to recover strength enough to relate he story but this as also the misfortune perplexity and danger to which the despairing passion of the enamoured placentium occasion she to reduce herself and the catastrophe of philidore 's surprising fate must be tell in a second part part ii the youthful stranger conceal he name and family relate the sad effect of he love for the favorite wife of the bashaw of liperto and how by she aid he be enable to escape from slavery only to be pursue and about to be retake by janizary when rescue by philidore we hero be kindly receive by he uncle in persium who soon die and leave he sole heir of a enormous fortune he be now placentium 's

surprise when the fair slave prove to be placentia kiss embrace and all the fond endearment of reward passion make up for they want of speech -- in they expressive look and eager grasping the violence of they mutual flame be more plainly demonstrate than it could have be by the greatest elegance of language -- those of the persian that stand by who understand not english easily perceive not only that they be lover but also that they be so to the most unbounded height of tender passion placentium relate how she have elude she brother and set sail to rejoin she lover how she have be save from

splendid than the celebration of they nuptials and of they future bliss the reader may better judge by they almost unexampled love they constancy they generosity and nobleness of soul than by any description i be able to give of it philidore and placentium be one of the few novel by mr haywood that do not pretend to a moral purpose realism need some justification for realism at the time almost invariably mean a picture of vice and folly and a author could not expose objectionable thing except in the hope that they would lessen in fact as they increase in fiction but in spite of the disapproval sometimes express for fable on the ground of they inherent untruth idealistic romance be generally justified as mirror of all desirable virtue pious mr penelope aubin write no other kind of fiction though she sometimes admit a deep-dyed villain for the sake of show he condign punishment at the hand of providence it be perhaps due to the sale of this lady 's novel largely advertise toward the end of 1727 and apparently very successful that mr haywood be encourage to desert she favorite field of exemplary novel show the dangerous effect of passion for a excursion into pure romance that she find the attempt neither congenial nor profitable may be infer from the fact that it be not repeat if the highly imaginary romance suffer from a excess of delicacy certain other tale by mr haywood overleap decency as far on the other side the tendency of fiction before richardson be not toward refinement the model french and spanish which writer in england find profit in imitate rack sensationalism to the utmost degree by story of horrible and perverted lust all the excitement that could be obtain from incest threaten narrowly avert or actually commit be offer to eager reader usually as in defoe 's moll flander or fielding 's tom jone ignorance of birth be a essential element in the plot a story of this type in which the catastrophe be prevent by a timely discovery of the hero 's parentage be the force of nature : or the lucky disappointment -lrb- 1725 -rrb- felisinda daughter of don alvario of valladolid fall in love with a dependent of she father 's name fernando who

fernando can do no less than marry alantha incest be almost the only crime not to be find in the extraordinary series of barefaced and infamous intrigue crowd into the page of the injur would husband : or the mistaken resentment -lrb- 1723 -rrb- the author naively remark in the dedication that the subject of the trifle i presume to offer be the worst of woman and she have indeed out-villained the blackest of she male villain in the character of the wicked baroness the doting baron de tortillee marry the lascivious and extravagant mademoiselle la motte who promote the villainous du lache to be the instrument of she vile pleasure after enjoy several lover of he procure she fix she affection upon the worthy beauclair du lache despair of ensnare he because he be about to marry the lovely

beauclair be unite to he faithful montamor in the conduct of the story the writer show no deficiency in express the passion but rather a want of measure for thrill follow thrill so fast that the reader can hardly realize what be happen and as if the lust and crime of the baroness do not furnish enough sensational incident the tender romance of beauclair and montamor be superad the hero be a common romantic type easily inconstant but reward above he merit by a faithful mistress a woman disguise as a man be a favorite device with mr haywood as well as with other writer of love story but one need read only the brazen mr charke 's memoirs or defoe 's realistic moll flander to discover that it be a device not unheard of in real life the actual occurrence of such disguise however make no difference to the female writer of fiction anything soul-stirring whether from romance or from play be equally grist to they mill in seek for the most dramatic _ dénouements _ sensational romancer be not long in perceive the suspense that could be produce by involve the chief character in a trial for they life mr behn have by that mean considerably protracted the interest in the fair jilt : or the amours of prince tarquin and miranda -lrb- 1688 -rrb- and mr haywood follow she example succeed in give a last stimulus to the jaded nerve of the reader of the force of nature and the injur would husband and finally the title-page of a anonymous work attribute to she indicate that the struggle authoress be not insensible to the popular demand for romance of roguery a prospective buyer might have imagine that he be secure a criminal biography in memoirs of the baron de brosse who be break on the wheel in the reign of lewi xiv contain a account of he amours with several particulars relate to the war in those time but the promise of the title be unfulfilled for mr haywood be no journalist to make capital out of a malefactor 's exit from the world the whole book be a chronicle of the baron 's unsuccessful pursuit of a hard-hearted beauty name larissa mingle with little history of the baron 's rival of a languish madam de monbray and of larissa 's mother the fair charmer finally marry a count and she lover plunge into adequate despair can barely exert himself to answer a false accusation trump up by the revengeful monbray with the verdict in he favor the story end abruptly and the promise continuation be apparently never write we read nothing of the war nor of the baron 's execution on the wheel torture tragedy of blood and heinous crime add piquancy to mr haywood 's love story but be not the normal material of she romance she talent be chiefly for soft thing she prefer the novel of intrigue and passion in which the character could be run through a breathless maze of amatory adventure with a pause now and again to relate a digressive episode for variety 's sake typical of this sort the best adapt to the romancer 's genius be the agreeable caledonian : or memoirs of signiora di morella a roman lady who make she escape from a monastery at viterbo for the love of a scot nobleman intermix would with many other entertaining little history and adventure which present themselves to she in the course of she travels no moralizing no romantic idealism disturb the rapid current of event it be a pure cloak and sword novel definitely located in italy with all the machinery of secret assignation escape from convent adventure on the road and at inn sudden assault duel seduction and revenge characteristic of spanish fiction don jaque di morella determine to marry he daughter clementina to a certain cardinal who have offer to renounce the scarlet hat for love of she when she pique she lover by she evident unwillingness to wed don jaque pack she off to a convent at viterbo by pick up a copy of verse clementina become acquaint with signiora miramene who relate the history of she correspondence with the baron glencairn clementina become the instrument of the lover but no sooner see the lovely north briton than she herself be captivate in response to she proffer affection glencairn manage by a extraordinary device to convey she out of the convent in spite of the rage of dan jaque they escape to sienna the further surprising turn in they affair to be later communicate to the public part ii at sienna the lover enjoy a season of perfect felicity until don jaque come to town in pursuit of a default steward discover clementina and apprehend the pair while the two be confine in separate convent await trial clementina 's maid ismenia -lrb- who have already related she little history -rrb- become they go-between and serve she mistress the same trick that clementina have already play upon she friend miramene ismenia and the faithless baron decamp to part unknown while clementina 's father start back to rome with he recreant daughter in man 's clothes she escape from she parent to seek revenge upon she lover at a inn she hear a woman in

attempt to stab he and throw into prison where he visit she and disarm she resentment by offer to marry she after the ceremony they proceed to pari where each plunge into dissipation finally they separate clementina die of a fever and the baron be leave free to pursue he inclination through a possible third part which however be never write after a slumber of forty year the agreeable caledonian be reprint as the monthly review inform we from a copy correct by mr haywood not long before she death -lrb- 16 -rrb- the review continue it be like the rest of mr haywood 's novel write in a tawdry style now utterly explode the romance of these day be reduce much nearer the standard of nature and to the manners of the living world realism be indeed far to seek in the brief but intricate tissue of incident that make the novel of 1728 to a taste accustom to sir charle grandison and peregrine pickle and the sentimental journey the rehash of eliza haywood 's novel must have seem very far even from the manners of the world of fiction the judgment of the critical review be still more savage in its accuracy -lrb- 17 -rrb- this be a republication of a dull profligate haywoodian production in which all the male be rogue and all the female whore without a glimpse of plot fable or sentiment in its uncompromising literalness the critic 's verdict rank with the learn ascham 's opinion of the morte d'arthur -- except that it have not be supersede the same animadversion might be urge against defoe 's colonel jacque or the fortunate mistress if mr haywood sin against the standard of the age to come she be not out of touch with the spirit of she own generation as a writer she know but one unfailing recipe for popularity : whatever she touch must be forthwith gilded with passion the chief _ raison d'être _ for the fair hebrew : or a true but secret history of two jewish lady who lately reside in london -lrb- 1729 -rrb- be to gratify the prejudice of anti-semitic reader yet it be hardly distinguishable from she sentimental love story the young and gay dorante go to the synagogue for a lark be tempt by the sight of a fair hand to break into the woman 's apartment and to expose himself to the charm of the beautiful kesiah he engage she in a correspondence but at they first interview she give he clearly to understand that he can gain nothing from she but by marriage drive by he unhappy passion he comply with she demand and she become a church of england woman but once married kesiah be too proud to permit the concealment that prudence demand though he father be sure to disinherit they she insist upon reveal the marriage dorante entrust he small stock of money to he wife 's brother abimelech in order to start he in trade the jew go to holland with a woman whom he have save from religious murder at the hand of a levite and nothing further be hear from he or the money imprison by he creditor dorante be persuade by he wife to sign away the entail of he estate in return for a sum of money thereupon she depart with the gold and a new gallant leave she unhappy husband to be rescue from want by the kindness of a younger brother after the poor solace of hearing that kesiah and she paramour have be lose at sea he die of a broken heart -lrb- 18 -rrb- though eliza haywood exhaust nearly every possible bit of sensationalism that could be extract from tale of passion she almost never make use of the heroic feat of arm which constitute a no less important resource of the french romance she hero be victor in love but not in war the sole exception be a little romance of moorish chivalry in the eighth century though this period have already be pre-empt by mr manley 's memoirs of europe there be little doubt that mr haywood be responsible for the arragonian queen : a secret history -lrb- 1724 -rrb- a peculiar blend of heroic adventure in battle bullfight and tournament with amorous intrigue of the most involved kind prince albaraizor of arragon go to assist omar king of valencium against a traitorous foe and with the help of the young general abdelhamar succeed in vanquish the enemy though the latter youth be seriously wound while perform miracle

king that he wife be unfaithful to he a indiscreet letter from abdelhamar confirm he suspicion he order both queen and ambassador cast into prison and by he woe destroy the happiness of the whole court the passage relate the monarch 's love and jealousy be describe with a fulness entirely lack in the tournament scene quote above and we may fairly infer that both writer and reader be more deeply interested in affair of the heart than in feat of arm however glorious the emphasis give to love rather than to war in this tale be significant as a contrast to the opposite tendency in such romance of a century later as ivanhoe in which a tournament scene very similar in outline to that in the arragonian queen be tell with the greatest attention to warlike detail while the love story though not allow to languish be keep distinctly subordinate to the narrative of chivalric adventure mr haywood however be too warm-blooded a creature to put aside the interest of the heart for the sake of a barbarous gothic brawl and too experience a writer not to know that she greatest forte lay in paint the tender rather than the sterner passion in this respect she form a decide contrast to defoe whose man and woman be almost never startle out of they matter-of-fact attitude he picaresque character though outwardly rogue or they female counterpart have at bottom something of the dissent parson and cool-headed middle-aged man of business whatever else they may be they be never love-sick passion be to they a questionable asset and if they marry they be like to have the matter over with in the course of half a paragraph eliza haywood however possess in excess the one gift that defoe lack to the scribble authoress love be the force that motivate all the world crude and conventional as be many of she repeat attempt to analyze the workings of a mind under the sway of soft desire she nevertheless succeed now and then in actuate she heroine with genuine emotion both romance and realism

of sensational matter but as we have see appeal to the reader 's emotional nature from different side defoe with he strong interest in practical life look for stir incident for strange and surprising adventure on land and sea for unusual or uncanny occurrence whereas mr haywood less a journalist than a romancer rest she claim to public favor upon the secure basis of the tender passion in the book exploit the deaf and dumb prophet duncan campbell whose fame once illustrate by notice in the tatler and spectator -lrb- 1 -rrb- be become a little dimmed by 1720 each writer choose the kind of material that the natural propensity and previous experience of each have train he or she to use with the greatest success accordingly the history of the life and adventure of mr duncan campbell a gentleman who though deaf and dumb write down any stranger 's name at first sight with they future contingency of fortune : now live in exeter court over against the savoy in the strand publish by curll on 30 April 1720 and write largely by defoe devote only four chapter directly to the narrative of the conjuror 's life while four chapter and the appendix be give over to disquisition upon the method of teaching deaf and dumb person to read and write upon the perception of demon genie or familiar spirit upon the second sight upon magic in all its branch and upon the law against false diviner and soothsayer beside show the keenness of he interest in the supernatural the author deliberately avoid any occasion for talk gossip or for indulge person of airy temper with sentimental love-tale instead of make they a bill of fare out of patchwork romance and pollute scandal read the preface sign by duncan campbell the good old gentleman who write the adventure of my life have make it he business to treat they with a great variety of entertaining passage which always terminate in moral that tend to the edification of all reader of whatsoever sex age or profession those who come to consult the seer on affair of the heart therefore receive only the scantiest mention from he biographer and never be the languish and sigh of mr campbell 's devotee describe with any romantic glamor on the contrary defoe portray in terse and homely phrase the folly and affectation of the dumb man 's fair client the young bloom beauty who find little duncan wallow in the dust and bribe he with a sugarplum to reveal the name of she future husband the sempstress with a itching desire for a parson housekeeper in search of steal goods the widow who bounce from one end of the room to the other and finally scuttle too airily downstairs for a woman in she clothes and the chambermaid disguise as a fine lady who by the toss of she head the jut of the bum the sidelong leer of the eye proclaim she real condition -- these type be treat by defoe in a blunt realistic manner entirely foreign to eliza haywood 's vein some passage -lrb- 2 -rrb- perhaps by a sentiment too exalted or by a description in romantic style suggest the hand of another writer possibly mr haywood but more probably william bond in whose name the reprint of 1728 be issue -lrb- 3 -rrb- but in the main the book reflect defoe 's strong tendency to speculate upon unusual and supernatural phenomenon and utterly fail to divulge the secret intrigue and amours of one part of the sex to give the other part room to make favorite scandal the subject of they discourse -lrb- 4 -rrb- that defoe have refrain from treat one important aspect of duncan campbell 's activity he be well aware if i be to tell he adventure with regard for instance to woman that come to consult he i might perhaps have not only write the story of eleven thousand virgin that die maid but have have the relation to give of as many married woman and widow and the work would have be endless -lrb- 5 -rrb- in he biography of the scotch prophet he do not propose to clog the reader with any adventure save the most remarkable and those in various way mysterious the method of swell distorted and comment trifle into volume he be content to leave to the writer of fable and romance it be not long before the press-agent of the dumb presager find a romancer willing to undertake the task that defoe neglect mr haywood in she association with aaron hill and he circle could hardly have escape know william bond who in 1724 be play steele to hill 's addison in produce the number of the plain dealer instigate perhaps by he the rise young novelist contribute on 19 march 1724 the second considerable work on the fortune-teller under the caption : a spy upon the conjurer : or a collection of surprising story with name place and particular circumstance relate to mr duncan campbell commonly know by the name of the deaf and dumb man and the astonishing penetration and event of he prediction write to my lord -- by a lady who for more than twenty year past have make it she business to observe all transaction in the life and conversation of mr campbell -lrb- 5a -rrb- as long as atalanti shall be read some reader be sure to find little to they taste in the curious information contain in the first biography of campbell but mr haywood be not reluctant to gratify a appetite for scandal when she could profitably cater to it develop the clue afford she by the announcement in defoe 's life and adventure of a forthcoming little pocket volume of original letter that pass between mr campbell and he correspondent -lrb- 6 -rrb- she compose a number of epistle as come from all sort of applicant to the prophet these missive however be precede by a long letter address to a anonymous lord and sign justicium which be chiefly concoct of anecdote illustrative of the dumb man 's power unlike the incident in defoe 's work the greater number of the story relate to love affair in the course of which one party or the other invoke the seer 's assistance although the author be thoroughly acquaint with the previous history of mr campbell -lrb- 7 -rrb- she be evidently more interested in the phenomenon of passion than in the theory of divination a brief discussion of astrology witchcraft and dream easily lead she to a narrative of mr campbell 's sincerity exemplify would in the story of a lady injure in the tenderest part by a pretended friend a glance through the table of contents reveal the preponderance of such heading as a strange story of a young lady who come to ask the name of she husband a whimsical story of a old lady who want a husband reflection on the inconstancy of man a proof of it in a ruin would girl that come to ask mr campbell 's advice a story of my lady love-puppy a merry story of a lady 's chamber-maid cook-maid and coach-man and so on evidence of a attempt to suggest if not actual reference to contemporary scandal be to be find in such item as a strange instance of vanity and jealousy in the behavior of mrs f -- the particulars of the fate of mr j -- l -- and a story of the duke of -- 's mistress it be not surprising that memoirs of a certain island appear within six month of a spy upon the conjurer when justicium refer to she personal relation with the lord to whom she letter be address she comment be still more in keep with the acknowledged forte of the lady novelist they be permeate with the tenderest emotion the author of moll flander and the fortunate mistress might moralize upon the unhappy consequence of love but he be incline to regard passion with a equal mind he state fact simply love in he opinion be not a strong motive when uncombine with interest but eliza haywood hold the romantic watchword of all for love and she book be a continual illustration of _ amor vincit omnia _ in the present case she word seem to indicate that the passion of love and jealousy so often experience by she character be not unfamiliar to she own breast even duncan campbell 's prediction be unable to alter she destiny but tho ' i be far enough from disbelieve what he say yet youth passion and inadvertency render would he caution ineffectual it be in he hand-writing i first behold the dear fatal name which have since be the utter destruction of my peace : it be from he i know i should be undo by love and the perfidy of mankind before i have the least notion of the one or have see any of the other charming enough to give I either pain or pleasure yet besot as i be i have neither the power of defend myself from the assault of love nor think sufficient to enable I to make those preparation which be necessary for my future support while i have yet the means -lrb- p 13 -rrb- yet so it be with we inconsiderate sex -- to vent a present passion -- for the short liv would ease of railing at the baseness of a ungrateful lover -- to gain a little pity -- we proclaim we folly and become the jest of all who know we -- a forsake woman immediately grow the object of derision -- rally by the man and point at by every little flirt who fancy herself secure in she own charm of never be so and think ` tis want of merit only make a wretch for my dear lord i be sensible tho ' we wound have be a long time heal would there yet remain a tenderness which if touch would will smart afresh -- the dart of passion such as we have feel make too indeliable a impression ever to be quite eraz would -- they be not content with the eternal sear they leave on the reputation -lrb- p76 -rrb- these passage be in substance and style after eliza haywood 's manner while the experience therein hint at do not differ essentially from the circumstance of she own life the various aspect of love and jealousy be also the theme of the second and third part of a spy upon the conjurer -lrb- 8 -rrb- the two packet of letter be merely imaginary unless the pseudonymous signature of some of the missive may have aid contemporary reader to smoke allusion to current gossip at any rate the reference be now happily beyond we power to fathom apparently the taste for duncan campbell anecdote be stimulate by the piquant sauce of scandal for beside the several issue of a spy upon the conjurer a second and smaller volume of the same sort be publish on 10 may 1725 this sixpenny pamphlet of forty page entitle the dumb projector : be a surprize account of a trip to holland make by mr duncan campbell with the manner of he reception and behavior there as also the various and divert occurrence that happen on he departure be like the former work couch in the form of a letter to a nobleman and sign justicium both from internal evidence -lrb- 9 -rrb- and from the style it can be assign with confidence to the author of a spy upon the conjurer the story relate how mr campbell be induce to go into holland in the hope of make he fortune how he be disappoint the extraordinary instance of he power and he adventure amatory and otherwise be of little importance as a narrative the account differ widely from that of campbell 's trip to the netherland in the life and adventure of 1720 soon after the publication of the dumb projector defoe also make a second contribution to the now considerable duncan campbell literature under the title of the friendly daemon : or the generous apparition be a true narrative of a miraculous cure newly perform upon dr duncan campbell by a familiar spirit that appear to he in a white surplice like a cathedral singing boy the quotation of the story from glanvil already use by the prophet 's original biographer and the keen interest in question of the supernatural display by the writer make the attribution of this piece to defoe a practical certainty evidently then eliza haywood be not the only one to profit by keep alive the celebrity of the fortune-teller the year 1728 be mark by the reissue of the life and adventure as the supernatural philosopher by william bond whose probable connection with the work have already be discuss and by the publication in the craftsman -lrb- 10 -rrb- of a letter sign fidelium describe a visit to duncan campbell the writer who profess a intense admiration for mr caleb d'anver and all he work relate how the dumb oracle after write down she name have prophesy that the craftsman would certainly gain he point in 1729 she conclude with praise of mr campbell and a offer to conduct caleb to visit he on the ensue Saturday that the communication be not to be regard as a companion-piece to the letter from dulcibelum thankley in the spectator -lrb- no 474 -rrb- be the purport of the editorial statement which introduce it : i shall make no other apology for the vanity which i may seem guilty of in publish the follow letter than assure the reader it be _ genuine _ and that i do it in complyance with the repeat importunity of a _ fair correspondent _ the style of the letter do not strongly suggest that of a spy upon the conjurer though the conclude sentence _ love _ shall be there too who wait forever upon _ wit _ be a sentiment after eliza 's heart and moreover though fidelium and justicium may be one and the same person mr d'anver ' assurance that the letter be genuine be not to be rely upon with too much confidence for have he wish to praise himself he would naturally have resort to some such device the last volume relate to the scotch wizard do not appear until 1732 two year after campbell 's death secret memoirs of the late mr duncan campbel the famous deaf and dumb gentleman write by himself who order they should be publish would after he decease consist of 164 page devote to miscellaneous anecdote of the prophet a reprint of defoe 's friendly daemon -lrb- p 166 -rrb- original letter send to mr campbel by he consulter -lrb- p 196 -rrb- and a appendix by way of vindication of mr duncan campbel against that groundless aspersion cast upon he that he but pretend to be deaf and dumb by a friend of the deceased -lrb- p 225 -rrb- the authorship of this book have receive but slight attention from student of defoe and still remain something of a puzzle no external evidence on the point have yet come to light but some probable conclusion may be reach through a examination of the substance and style in the first place there be no probability -- the statement on the title-page notwithstanding -- that mr campbell himself have anything to do with the composition of the memoirs since the magician have take no part in the literary exploitation of he fame during he lifetime it be fair to infer that he do not begin to do so two year after he death moreover each of the three writer bond defoe and eliza haywood already identify with the campbell pamphlet be perfectly capable of pass off fiction as feigned biography both the author of memoirs of a cavalier and the scribbler of secret history have repeatedly use the device there be no evidence however that william bond have any connection with the present work but a large share of it be almost certainly do by defoe and mr haywood the former have die full of year on 26 April 1731 about a year before the secret memoirs be publish it be possible however that he may have assemble most of the material for the book and compose a number of page the inclusion of he friendly daemon make this suspicion not unlikely and furthermore certain anecdote tell in the first section particularly in the first eighty page be such story as would have appeal to defoe 's penchant for the uncanny and might well have be select by he the style be not different from that of piece know to be he but that the author of robinson crusoe would have tell the little history of the young woman without a fortune who obtain the husband she desire by means of a magic cake -lrb- p 86 -rrb- be scarcely probable for the story be a sentimental tale that would have appeal to love-sick lydium languish as far as we know defoe remain hard-headed to the last but mr haywood when she be not a scandal-monger be a sentimentalist the story would have suit she temperament and the taste of she reader it be tell so much in she manner that one could swear that the originator of the anecdote be _ aut eliza aut diabolum _ a few page further on -lrb- p 104 -rrb- appear the incident of a swaggerer who enter the royal vault of westminster abbey at dead of night on a wager and have the tail of he coat twitch by the knife he have stick in the ground be frighten into a faint -- a story which mr haywood later retell in different word in she female spectator -lrb- 11 -rrb- the secret memoirs further inform we by a casual remark of mr campbell 's that eliza haywood be well acquaint with the seer sometimes when surround by my friend such as anthony hammond esq mr philip horneck mr philip mr -- mrs centlivre mrs fowk mrs eliza haywood and other celebrated wit of which my house for some year have be the general rendezvous a good bowl of punch before I and the glass go round in a constant circle of mirth and good humor i have in a moment behold sight which have freeze my very blood and put I into agony that disorder the whole company -lrb- p 131 -rrb- the last anecdote in the first section be a repetition at some length of the story of campbell 's adventure in holland not as related in defoe 's life and adventure but accord to the version in mr haywood 's dumb projector the beginning which have to do with a grave old gentleman who be bite by a viper be tell in almost the same word indeed some letter that pass between the character be identically the same and the end though much abbreviate contain a number of sentence take word for word from the earlier tell of the story finally mr haywood be the first and hitherto the only writer of the campbell pamphlet who have print letter supposedly address to the prophet by he client the device be peculiarly hers the original letter send to mr campbel by he consulter in the secret memoirs be similar to those already compose by she for a spy upon the conjurer there be no reason to think that she do not invent the later epistle as well as the former if then a number of anecdote in the secret memoirs be suggestive of mr haywood 's known writings and if one of they remain in she memory thirteen year later if the pamphlet carefully allude to eliza haywood as one of the dumb seer 's particular friend and if it repeat in slightly different form she peculiar account of the dumb projector 's journey into holland and if finally the book contain a series of letter to campbell from fictitious correspondent fashion on the last already use by she we may conclude that in all likelihood the authoress whose name have previously be associate with duncan campbell literature be again concern in write or revise this latest work at least a cautious critic can say that there be no inherent improbability in the theory that defoe with journalistic instinct think that campbell 's death in 1730 might stimulate public interest in the wizard have draft in the rough the manuscript of a new biography but be prevent by the trouble of he last day from complete it that after he death the manuscript fall into the hand of mr haywood or perhaps be give to she by the publisher millan and chrichley to finish that she revise the material already write supplement it with new and old matter of she own compose a packet of original letter and send the volume to press the origin of the appendix by way of vindication of mr duncan campbel remain unknown and any theory about the authorship of the secret memoirs must be regard in last analysis as largely conjectural -lrb- 11a -rrb- though the author of the original life and adventure have receive most of the credit due to campbell 's biographer mr haywood as we have see be not less active in exploit the deaf and dumb gentleman she spy upon the conjurer be fubb off upon the public as often as defoe 's earlier volume and neither writer could claim any advantage over the other from he second and slighter contribution each hold successfully he own coign of vantage eliza haywood in contemporary opinion outrank defoe almost as far as a interpreter of the heart as he surpass she in concoct a account of a new marvel or a tale of strange adventure the arbitress of the passion indeed write nothing to compare in popularity with robinson crusoe but before 1740 she love in excess run through as many edition as moll flander and its abridgment while idalium : or the unfortunate mistress have be reprint three time separately and twice with she collect novel before a reissue of defoe 's fortunate mistress be undertake when in 1740 applebee publish a new edition of roxana he have it supplement by a continuation of nearly one hundred and fifty page many of which be fill with rubbish about woman name cleomira and belinda -lrb- 12 -rrb- here again mr haywood 's red herr cross the trail of defoe for oddly enough the sheet thus accurately characterize be transcribe word for word from eliza 's second novel the british recluse at the point where the heroine swallow a sleep potion suppose it poison faint and be think to be dead the narrative break off abruptly with the word : though the history of cleomira and belinda 's misfortune may be think foreign to my affair yet it be absolutely necessary i should give it a place because it be the source or spring of many strange and uncommon scene which happen to I during the remain part of my life and which i can not give a account of without -lrb- 13 -rrb- the page which follow relate how roxana become reconcile to she daughter die in peace and be bury at hornsey the curious reader find however no further mention of belinda and she friend evidently applebee 's hack simply steal as much copy as he need from a almost forget book trust to receive he money before the fraud be discover the volume of eliza haywood be indeed a mine of emotional scene and those who wish to read of warm desire or palpitating passion have to turn to she romance or do without wretched as she work seem in comparison to the modern novel it be for the time be the nearest approach to idealistic fiction and to the analysis of human feeling defoe 's romance of incident be the triumphant culmination of the picaresque type mr haywood 's sentimental tale be in many respects mere vague inchoation of a form as yet to be produce but when free from the impurity of intrigue and from the taint of scandal the novel of heart interest become the dominant type of english fiction unfortunately however eliza haywood be too practical a writer to outrun she generation the success of a spy upon the conjurer may have convince she that a ready market await story of amorous adventure and hint libel at any rate she soon set out to gratify the craving for book of that nature in a series of

other study than that of sowing dissention among those who be so unhappy and indeed unwise as to entertain he either imagine or pretend to do so that tho ' i have lay the scene in paris i mean that the adventure shou would be think to have happen would in london and that in the character of a french baroness i have attempt to expose the reputation of a english woman of quality i shou would be sorry to think the action of any of we lady such as you would give room for a conjecture of the reality of what he wou would suggest but suppose there be indeed a affinity between the vice i have describ would and those of some woman he know -lrb- for doubtless if there be she must be of he acquaintance -rrb- i leave the world to judge to whom she be indebted for become the subject of ridicule to I for draw a picture whose original be unknown or to he who write she name at the bottom of it however if i have design would this as a satyr on any person whose crime i have think worthy of it i shou would not have think the resentment of such a one considerable enough to have oblige I to deny it but as i have only related a story which a particular friend of mine assure I be matter of fact and happen would at the time when he be in paris : i wou would not have it make use of as a umbrage for the tongue of scandal to blast the character of any one a stranger to such detested guilt before long the term secret history fall into disrepute so that writer find it necessary to make a special plea for the veracity of they work the double marriage the mercenary lover and persecute virtue be distinguish as true secret history and in the preface to the pair hebrew : or a true but secret history of two jewish lady who lately reside in london mrs haywood at once confess the general truth of the charge against the type and defend the accuracy of she own production there be so many thing meerly the effect of invention which have be publish of late under the title of secret history that to distinguish this i be oblige to inform my reader that i have not insert one incident which be not relate to I by a person nearly concern in the family of that unfortunate gentleman who have no other consideration in the choice of a wife than to gratify a present passion for the enjoyment of she beauty about 1729 eliza haywood seem to have find the word life or memoirs on the title-page a more effective means for gain the credence of she reader and after that time she write in name at least no more secret history the fiction so denominate in secret history novel and poem be in no way different from she novel and have only the slightest if any foundation in fact a novel actually base upon a real occurrence however be dalinda or the double marriage be the genuine history of a very recent and interesting adventure -lrb- 1749 -rrb- not certainly know to have be write by mr haywood but bearing in the turn of expression the letter and the moralize end almost indubitable mark of she handiwork one at least of she favorite quotation come in at a appropriate point and the preface to the reader state that the author 's sole design be to show the danger of inadvertently give way to the passion -- a stock phrase with the author of love in excess the monthly review inform we that the story be the affair betwixt mr cresswell and miss scrope throw into the form of a novel -lrb- 1 -rrb- the situation be somewhat similar to that describe in the mercenary lover dalinda 's unhappy passion for malvolio incite he to ruin she and though he delude she with a unregistered marriage at the fleet he have no scruple against marry the rich flavillum wish to possess both flavillum 's fortune and dalinda 's charm he effect a reconciliation with the latter by promise to own they prior contract but when he come out into the open and propose to entertain she as a mistress she indignantly return to she grandmother 's house where she summons she brother and she faithful lover leander to force she perfidious husband to do she justice the latter half of the novel be a tissue of intrigue upon intrigue with a complication of lawsuit and letter in which malvolio 's villainy be fully expose and he be force to separate from flavillum but be unable to exert he claim upon dalinda she in turn can not wring from he any compensation nor can she in conscience recompense the faithful love of leander while she husband be live thus all party be sufficiently unhappy to make they way a warning to the youth of both sex evidently the history though indeed found on fact differ from the work of mr haywood 's imagination only in the tedious length of the legal proceedings and the uncertainty of the outcome the only reason for base the story on the villainy of mr cresswell be to take advantage of the momentary excitement over the scandal a similar appeal to the passion for diving into the intrigue of the great be apparent in the title of a novel of 1744 the fortunate foundling : be the genuine history of colonel m -- r and he sister madame du p -- y the issue of the hon ch -- e m -- r son of the late duke of r -- l -- d contain many wonderful accident that befel they in they travels and intersperse with the character and adventure of several person of condition in the most polite court of europe the preface after the usual assurance that the work be compile from original document and be therefore more veracious than the many fiction which have be lately impose upon the world under the specious title of secret history memoirs & c inform we that the purpose of the publication be to encourage virtue in both sex by show the amiableness of it in real character instead of expose vice in the action of particular person the book be a highly moral laudation of those scion of the house of manners whose name be adumbrate in the title it can not therefore be class as a scandal novel or secret history the latter term though loosely apply to the short tale of passion for the purpose of stimulate public curiosity mean strictly only that type of pseudo-historical romance which interpret actual history in the light of court intrigue in france a flood of history annals anecdote and memoirs -- secret gallant and above all true -- have be pour from the press since 1665 the writer of these work proceed upon the ostensible theory that secret history in recognize woman 's influence upon the destiny of nation be more true than pure history which take into account only religious political social or moral factor in judge the conduct of king and statesman do not anthony suffer the world to slip from he finger for the love of cleopatra although the grand romance have a little exhaust the vein of classical material mme durand-bedacier and mme de villedieu compile sundry annals of grecian and roman gallantry -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the cycle of french secret history be much more extensive romance historian ferret out a prodigious amount of intrigue in every court from that of childeric to loui xiv and set out to remodel the chronicle of the realm from the standpoint of the heart nearly every reign and every romantic hero be the subject of one or more monograph among which mme de la fayette 's princesse de clèves take a prominent place the thesaurus and omnium gatherum of the genus be sauval 's intrigue galante de la cour de france -lrb- 1695 -rrb- of which dunlop remark that to a passion which have no doubt especially in france have considerable effect in state affair there be assign a paramount influence but romancer with a nose for gallantry have no difficulty in find material for they pen in england during the time of henry viii elizabeth and henrietta marium but most frequently of all be choose the life of the queen of scot from fifteen or sixteen french biography of the romantic mary -lrb- 3 -rrb- mr haywood draw material for a english work of two hundred and forty page mary stuart queen of scot : be the secret history of she life and the real cause of all she misfortune contain a relation of many particular transaction in she reign never yet publish in any collection -lrb- 1725 -rrb- be distinguishable from she true fiction only by the larger proportion of event between set scene of burn passion which form the chief constituent of eliza 's romance as history it be worthless and its significance as fiction lie merely in its attempt to incorporate imaginative love scene with historical fact it be apparently compile hastily to compete with a rival volume the history of the life and reign of mary stuart publish a week earlier and it enjoy but a languid sale early in 1726 it pass into a second edition which continue to be advertise as late as 1743 mary stuart be the only one of mr haywood 's romance that strictly deserve the name of secret history but late in 1749 a little romance that satisfy nearly all the condition of the type insinuate itself into the pamphlet shop without the agency of any publisher a letter from h -- g -- g esq one of the gentleman of the bedchamber to the young chevalier and the only person of he own retinue that attend he from avignon in he late journey through germany and elsewhere contain many remarkable and affect occurrence which happen to the p -- during the course of he mysterious progress have be assign to mr haywood by the late mr andrew lang -lrb- 4 -rrb- perhaps on the authority of the notice in the monthly review already quote the pretended author of the letter be a certain henry goring a gentleman know to be in attendance upon the last of the stuart the preface give a commonplace explanation of how the letter fall into the hand of the editor through a similarity of name apparently the pamphlet be think seditious because it eulogize the young chevalier hint how advantageous it would be to have he on the throne as the secret journey progress the prince have a chance to expose he admirable political tenet in conversation with a nobleman of exalted rank in rescue a young woman from a fire caring for she in distress and refuse to take advantage of she passion for he he give evidence of a morality not accord he by history and prove how fit he be to govern other who know so well how to govern himself and when assault by hire assassin he manifest courage and coolness kill one of the bravo with he own hand it be unnecessary to review the various stage in the pretender 's travels which be relate with a great air of mystery but amount to nothing the upshot be that the prince have not renounce all thought of fill the throne of he ancestor but have end in view which the world know nothing of and which will surprise they all some day have the prince show himself more susceptible to the charm of the merchant ' daughter who fall in he way this bit of romance might claim the doubtful distinction of be mr haywood 's only original secret history but as it stand no part of the story have the necessary motivation by passion the intrigue be entirely political there would seem to be little dangerous stuff in this performance even five year after the insurrection of 1745 but if as the monthly review ill-naturedly hint eliza haywood really suffer for she suppose connection with it the lesson be at any rate effectual for the small reference to the p -- occasionally noticeable in she previous work suddenly cease and thereafter the novelist scrupulously refrain from mingle fiction and politics previously however she have at least once attempt to write a political satire elaborately disguise as a romance in July 1736 accord to the list of book in the gentleman 's magazine numerous duodecimo volume emanate from the shop of s baker and be sell under the title of adventure of eovaaus princess of ijaveo a pre-adamitical history intersperse with a great number of remarkable occurrence which happen and may again happen to several empire kingdom republick and particular great man write originally in the language of nature -lrb- of later year but little understood -rrb- first translate into chinese and now retranslate into english by the son of a mandarin reside in london -lrb- 5 -rrb- after the introduction have give a fantastic account of the pre-adamitical world and explain with elaborate unconvincingness how the manuscript of the book come into existence the tale commence like a moral allegory but soon lapse into mere extravagant adventure capable at all time of use a _ deus ex machina _ as the readiest way of solve a situation mr haywood here make immoderate use of magic element eojaeu king of ijaveo leave to he daughter eovaai a precious jewel upon the keep of which she happiness depend one day as she be gaze at it in the garden it slip from its setting and be carry away by a little bird immediately the princess be forsake by she quarrel subject and abandon by she suitor save only the wicked ochihatou prime minister of the neighbor kingdom of hypotofa who have gain ascendancy over he sovereign by black magic cause the promising young prince to be banish and use he power to promote he ambition and lust by infernal agency he convey eovaaus to the hypotofan court where he corrupt she mind and be about to triumph in she charm when he be summon to quell a political disturbance the princess leave languish in a bower be save by she good genius who enable she to discern the true deformity of she betrayer and to escape to the castle of the good alhahuza and ultimately into the kingdom of oozoff where ochihatou 's magic have no power over she during she stay there she listen to much political theorizing of a republican trend ochihatou succeed in kidnapping she and she be only save from he loathe embrace by discover one of he former mistress in the form of a monkey whom she manage to change back into human shape and substitute in she stead while the statesman be employ as a lover the populace lead by alhahuza storm the palace ochihatou discover the trick that have be play upon he hastily transform he unlucky mistress into a rat and convey himself and eovaaus through the air into a kingdom near at hand where he hope to make head against the rebel he pretension be encouraged but learn by he magic that the hypotofan monarch have be free from the power of he spell he persuade the princess to return to ijaveo with he in hope of regain she kingdom he transform she into a dive himself into a vulture and fly with she to a wood near the ijavean court there he restore they natural shape and make a base attack upon she honor in the struggle she manage to break he wand and he in a fury hang she up by the hair and be about to scourge she to death when she be rescue by a glorious young stranger the wicked ochihatou dash he brain out against a oak she deliverer turn out to be the banish prince of hypotofa who restore to she the lose jewel wed she and prosperously govern they united realm the fantastic story however be probably little calculated to sell the book it be address to those who could read between the line well enough to discern particular personage in the character of the fiction and especially a certain great man in the figure of the evil prime minister in 1736 when eliza 's novel first appear walpole 's defeat excise bill of 1733-4 and he policy of non-interference on the continent have make he cordially dislike by the people and by 1741 he unpopular ministry like lady mary montagu 's stair be in a decline way sir robert have never show himself a friend to letter and there be not a few writer among they one so illustrious as henry fielding who be ready to seize upon any pretext for attack he -lrb- 6 -rrb- there can be no doubt that in the character of the villainous corrupt greedy vain lascivious but plausible ochihatou mr haywood intend she reader to recognize a semblance of the english minister of all the statesman who have hold high office it would be impossible to find one who have be more systematically abused and more unjustly treat than sir robert walpole he be the ` father of parliamentary corruption ' the ` foe to english liberty ' the ` man who maintain he power by the basest and most venal tactic ' whenever he administration be allude to in parliament a shudder run through the house at the very think that one so sordid so interested so schemingly selfish should have attain to the position of prime minister and have command a follow if we read the pamphlet literature of the eighteenth century we see walpole represent as the meanest and most corrupt of mankind -lrb- 7 -rrb- lord chesterfield say of he : he prevail weakness be to be think to have a polite and happy turn to gallantry of which he have undoubtedly less than any man live it be he favorite and frequent subject of conversation which prove to those who have any penetration that it be he prevail weakness and they apply to it with success -lrb- 8 -rrb- and lord hervey report that the queen remark of walpole 's mistress dear molly skerritt : she must be a clever gentlewoman to have make he believe she care for he on any other score -lrb- but he money -rrb- and to show you what fool we all be in some point or other she have certainly tell he some fine story or other of she love and she passion and that poor man -- _ avec ce gros corps ces jambes enflées et ce vilain ventre _ -- believe she ah what be human nature -lrb- 9 -rrb- with this sketch of walpole compare the account of ochihatou prime minister of hypotofa this great man be bear of a mean extraction and so deform in he own person that not even he own parent cou would look on he with satisfaction as he be extremely amorous and have so little in he to inspire the tender passion the first proof he give of he art be to cast such a delusion before the eye of all who see he that he appear to they such as he wish to be a most comely and graceful man with this advantage join would to the most soothing and insinuate behavior he come to court and by he artifice so wound himself into the favor of some great officer that he be not long without be put into a considerable post this he discharge so well that he be soon promote to a better and at length to those of the highest trust and honor in the kingdom but that which be most remarkable in he and very much contribute to endear he to all sort of people be that he elevation do not seem to have make the least change in he sentiment he natural pride he lust he exorbitant ambition be disguise under the appearance of sweetness of disposition chastity and even more condescension than be consistent with the rank he then possest by this behavior he render would himself so far from exciting envy that those by whose recommendation he have obtain what he enjoy would and with some of whom he be now on more than a equality wish would rather to see a augmentation than diminution of a power he so well know to use and so successful be he hypocrisy that the most discerning saw not into he design till he find mean to accomplish they to the almost total ruin of both king and people -lrb- 10 -rrb- ochihatou worm he way into the favor of the king and after gain complete ascendancy over he royal master use the power for he own end he fill the position at court with wretch subservient to he own interest he next proceed to seize the publick treasure into he own hand which he convert not to work of justice or charity or any use for the honor of the kingdom but in build stately palace for himself he wife and concubine and enrich he mean family and other who adhere to he and assist in he enterprize lest this reference should not be plain enough in its application to walpole 's extravagance at houghton mr haywood add in a footnote we author might have save himself the trouble of particularizing in what manner ochihatou apply would the nation 's money since he have say enough in say he be a _ prime minister _ to make the reader acquaint with he conduct in that point further allusion to a standing army of mercenary and to a odious tribe of tax-collector -- two of the most popular grievance against walpole -- give additional force to the satire there be a suspicion that in the character of the young prince banish by ochihatou reader of a right turn of mind be intend to perceive a cautious allusion to the pretender -lrb- transcriber 's note : quote in paragraph in original not block quote -rrb- that walpole not only perceive but actively resent the affront we may infer though evidence be lack from the six year of silence that follow the publication of the satire perhaps the government see fit to buy off the troublesome author by a small appointment but such indulgent measure be not usually apply to similar case more probably eliza find it wise to seek in france or some neighboring country the safety from the malignant power of the prime minister that she heroine seek in the kingdom of oozoff the adventure of eovaaus contain almost the last of the dedication write in a servile tone to a patron whose favor mr haywood hope to curry henceforward she be to be more truly a woman of letter in that she book appeal ostensibly at least only to the read public the victim of she final eulogy be the redoubtable sarah duchess dowager of marlborough who when find herself address as o most illustrious wife and parent of the greatest best and loveliest it be not sufficient for you to adorn posterity with the amiableness of every virtue etc etc may perhaps have recall how she shine character have be blacken some twelve year before in a licentious volume call memoirs of a certain island adjacent to the kingdom of utopia -lrb- 11 -rrb- have she grace be aware that the reputed author of that comprehensive lampoon be none other than the woman who now outdo herself in praise eliza haywood would probably have profit little by she panegyric for though the memoirs of a certain island like the adventure of eovaaus make a pretence of be translate into english from the work of a celebrated utopian author the british public find no difficulty in attribute it by popular acclaim to mr haywood and she reap immense notoriety from it in preface to some of she subsequent work she complain of the readiness of the world to pick meaning in whatever be publish by a struggle woman or protest that she have no person or family in view in write she story but she never disclaim the authorship of this production undoubtedly the world be right in smoke the writer -lrb- 12 -rrb- if before she have retail secret history of late amours singly mr haywood deal in they now by the wholesale and any reader curious to know the identity of the personage hide under such fictitious name as romanus beaujune oraino davilla flirtillarium or saloida could obtain the information by consult a convenient key affix to each of the two volume in this respect as in the general scheme of she work mr haywood be follow the model set by the celebrated mr manley in she new atalanti she in turn have derive she method from the french _ roman à clef _ or romance in which contemporary scandal be report in a fictitious disguise the imitation write by mr haywood become only less notorious than she original and be still well enough know in 1760 to be include in the convenient list of novel prefix to the elder colman 's polly honeycombe it consist of a tissue of anecdote which if retold would -lrb- in fuller 's word -rrb- stain through the cleanest language i can wrap they in all set in a allegorical framework of a commonplace kind a noble youth arrive upon the shore of a happy island -lrb- england -rrb- where he encounter the god of love who convey he to a spacious court in the midst of the city there pecunia and fortuna serve by they high priest lucitario -lrb- j cragg the elder -rrb- preside over a enchanted well -lrb- south sea company -rrb- while all degree of humanity stand about in expectation of some wonderful event from amid the throng the god of love select certain person as example of perverted love the story he relate about they range from mere anecdote to elaborate history contain several love-letter in substance these tale consist of the grossest scandal that could be collect from the gossip of profligate society after hear more than a satiety of these illustration the youth behold the genius of the isle support by astrea and reason expose the fraud of the enchanted well to the dismay of the greedy rabble the young stranger then sink to rest in a perfumed bower while the god of love and the genius of the isle set about a much need reformation of manners none of the skimming of contemporary gossip pour out in the two volume deserve the least consideration save such as reveal the fair writer 's relation with other author in return for savage 's eulogy of she love in excess and rash resolve the scribble dame include in she scandal novel the story of he noble parentage substantially as it have already be tell by aaron hill in the plain dealer for 24 June 1724 but in addition she preface the account with a highly color narrative of the amours of masonium and riverius -lrb- 13 -rrb- however much the author of the bastard may have desire to prove he noble origin he might easily have resent a too open flaunting of he mother 's disgrace moreover mr haywood hint that he unfeeling mother be not the only woman whom the poet have to fear by the insinuation of a female fury a pretender to the art of poetry for whom eliza have no word too black -- in fact some of she epithet be too shady to be quote -- he have be lead into action mean unjust and wicked the vile woman it seem have be guilty of defame the reputation of other the monster whose soul be wholly compos 'd of hipocrisy envy and lust can ill endure another woman should be esteem would mistress of those virtue she have act with too barefaced a impudence to pretend to and be never so happy as when by some horrid stratagem she find the means to traduce and blast the character of the worthy with how much readiness the easily deceiv would riverius -lrb- savage -rrb- have oblige she in spread those report coin would in the hellish mint of she own brain i be sorry to say it can not be doubt but that he have lose many friend on she account in particular one there be who bear he a singular respect tho ' no otherway capacitate to serve he than by good wish -- this person receiv would a more than common injury from he thro ' the instigation of that female fury but yet continue to acknowledge he good quality and pity he fall into the contrary take no other revenge than write a little satire which he have publish would some admirable fine thing in the praise of friendship and honor give a handsome opportunity for -lrb- vol i p 184 -rrb- from the exceptional animus display by eliza haywood in describe she colleague in the school for scandal one may suspect that the lightning have strike fairly near home one be almost force to believe that savage 's well-wisher the writer of the little satire to the ingenious riverius on he write in the praise of friendship be none other than eliza herself -lrb- 14 -rrb- exactly what injury she have sustain from he and he siren be not know but although he still stand high in she esteem she be implacable against that worse than lai whom in a long and pungent description she satirize under the name of gloatitia behold another in every thing as ridiculous in some more vile -- that big-bone would buxom brown woman of all the god there be none she acknowledge but phoebus he she frequently implore for assistance to charm she lover with the spirit of poetry she pretend however to have a intimate acquaintance with the muse -- have judgment enough to know that _ ease _ and _ please _ make a rhyme and to count ten syllable on she finger -- this be the stock with which she set up for a wit and among some ignorant wretch pass for such but with people of true understanding nothing afford more subject of ridicule than that incoherent stuff which she call verse -- she bribe with all the favor she be capable of confer a bookseller -lrb- curll -rrb- -lrb- famous for publish soft thing -rrb- to print some of she work -lrb- the amours of clio and strephon 1719 -rrb- on which she be not a little vain : tho ' she might very well have spare herself the trouble few man of any rank whatsoever but have be honor would with the receipt of some of she letter both in prose and measure -- few coffee-house but have be the repository of they -lrb- 15 -rrb- the student of contemporary secret history do not need to refer to the key to discover that the woman whose power to charm savage be so destructive to eliza 's peace of mind be that universal mistress of minor poet the mira of thomson the clio of dyer and hill the famous martha fowke who at the time happen to have fix the scandal of she affection upon the volunteer laureate -lrb- 16 -rrb- that the poet 's opinion of she remain unchanged by mr haywood 's vituperation may be infer from some line in she praise in a satire call the author of the town print soon after the publication of memoirs of a certain island -lrb- 17 -rrb- clio descend angel sweep thy lyre prompt thy soft lay and breathe seraphic fire tear fall sigh rise obedient to thy strain and the blood dance in the mazy vein in social spirit lead thy hour along thou life of loveliness thou soul of song but not content with singing the praise of she rival savage cast a slur upon mr haywood 's work and even upon the unfortunate dame herself first let I view what noxious nonsense reign while yet i loiter on prosaic plain if pen impartial active annals trace other with secret histr ' y truth deface : view and review and wild memoirs appear and slander darken each recorded year after relate at some length the typical absurdity of the _ chronique scandaleuse _ -- death by poison the inevitably drop letter and intrigue of passion and jealousy -- he become more specific in describe various author among other a cast-off dame who of intrigue can judge write scandal in romance -- a printer 's drudge flush would with success for stage-renown she pants and melt and swell and pen luxurious rant the first two line might apply to the notorious mr manley lately decease who have for some time be live as a hack writer for alderman barber but she have write no play since lucius in 1717 mr haywood however equally a cast-off dame and a printer 's drudge have recently produce she fair captive a most luxurious rant the passage then may probably refer to she if as be possible the poem be circulate in manuscript before its publication this intended insult may be the injury complain of by mr haywood in memoirs of a certain island though she be content to retaliate only by heap coal of fire upon the poet 's bay and though she even heighten the pathos of he story by relate how he have refuse the moiety of a small pension from he mother upon hearing that she have suffer loss in the collapse of the south sea scheme savage remain henceforth she implacable enemy perhaps she abuse of the divine clio the suspect instigator of he attack upon she may have be a unforgivable offense no need to particularize further we need not vex the shade of addison by repeat what eliza record of he wild kinsman eustace budgell -lrb- bellario -rrb- no other person of literary note save aaron hill favorably mention as lauranus appear in all the dreary two volume the vogue of the book be not due to its merit as fiction which be slight but to the spiciness of personal allusion that such reading be appreciate even in the highest circle be show by young lady mary pierrepont 's defense of mr manley 's new atalanti -lrb- 18 -rrb- in the history of the novel however the _ roman à clef _ deserve perhaps more recognition than have hitherto be accord it specific delineation be necessary to make effective the satire and though the presence of the key make broad caricature possible since each picture be label yet the writer of scandal novel usually draw they portrait with a amount of detail foreign to the method of the romancer -lrb- 19 -rrb- while the tale of passion develop the novelist 's power to make the emotion seem convince the _ chronique scandaleuse _ emphasize the necessity of accurate observation of real man and woman but satire and libel though necessitate detailed description do not like burlesque or parody lead to the creation of character in that respect the memoirs of a certain island and all its tribe be notably deficient a less comprehensive survey of current tittle-tattle perhaps model on mr manley 's court intrigue -lrb- 1711 -rrb- steal forth anonymously on 16 October 1724 under the caption bath-intrigue : in four letter to a friend in london a title which sufficiently indicate the nature of the work like the memoirs of a certain island these letter consist of mere jotting of scandal most probably both production be from the same pen though bath-intrigue have be attribute to mr manley -lrb- 20 -rrb- opposite the title-page robert the publisher advertise the masquerader the fatal secret and the surprise as by the same author one of mr haywood 's favorite quotation use by she later as a motto for the third volume of the female spectator stand with naïve appropriateness on the title-page : there be a lust in man no awe can tame of loudly publish he neighbor 's shame the writer of bath-intrigue moreover do not hesitate to recommend eliza 's earlier novel to the good grace of scandal-loving reader for she describe a certain letter as amorous as mr o -- f -- d 's eye or the writings of the author of love in excess most curious of all be the fact that the composer of the four letter who sign herself jb refer _ en passant _ to belinda 's inconstancy to sir thoma worthly a allusion to the story of the second part of the british recluse this reference would indicate either that there be some basis of actuality in the earlier fiction or that mr haywood be use imaginary scandal to pad she collection however that may be this second _ chronique scandaleuse _ be apparently no less successful though less renowned than the first for a third edition be imprint during the follow march the scribble dame again use the feigned letter as a vehicle for mildly infamous gossip in letter from the palace of fame write by a first minister in the region of air to a inhabitant of this world translate from a arabian manuscript -lrb- 21 -rrb- its pretended source and the sham oriental disguise make the work a unworthy member of that group of feigned oriental letter begin by gp marana with l'espion turc in 1684 continue by dufresny and he imitator t brown raise to a philosophic level by addison and steele and finally culminant in montesquieu 's lettre persane -lrb- 1721 -rrb- and goldsmith 's citizen of the world -lrb- 1760 -rrb- -lrb- 22 -rrb- the fourth letter be a well-told eastern adventure deal with the revenge of forzio who seduce the wife of he enemy ben-hamar through the agency of a christian slave but in general the letter be valuable only as they add a atom of evidence to the popularity of pseudo-oriental material eliza haywood be anxious to give the public what it want she have find a ready market for scandal and know that the piquancy of slander be enhance and the writer protect from disagreeable consequence if she story be cast in some sort of a disguise she have already use the obvious ruse of a allegory in the memoirs of a certain island and have just complete a feigned history in the court of carimanium the well know turkish spy and its imitation or perhaps the recent but untranslated lettre persane may have suggest to she the possibility of combine bit of gossip in letter purport to be translate from the arabic and write by some supermundane be the latter part of the device have already be use by defoe in the consolidator mr haywood merely add the suggestion of a mysterious oriental source she make no attempt to satirize contemporary society but be content to retail vague bit of town talk to customer who might be delude into imagine they of importance the new create vizier the airy correspondent report might have succeed better in another post than in this which with so much earnestness he have sollicit for notwithstanding the plaudit he have receive from we princess and the natural propensity to state-affairs give he by he saturnine genius he significator mar promi would he greater honor in the field than he can possibly attain to in the cabinet and so on both bath-intrigue and letter from the palace of fame may be class as _ roman à clef _ although no key for either have yet be find in all other respects they conform to type the only one of

falsehood and scurrility who have asperse almost all the great character of the age and this with impunity they own person and name be utterly secret and obscure he intend to seize the opportunity of do some good by detect and drag into light these common enemy of mankind since to invalidate this universal slander it suffice to show what contemptible man be the author of it he be not without hope that by manifest the dulness of those who have only malice to recommend they either the bookseller would not find they account in employ they or the man themselves when discover would want courage to proceed in so unlawful a occupation this it be that give birth to the ` dunciad ' and he think it a happiness that by the late flood of slander on himself he have acquire such a peculiar right over

here draw as vile a picture as could be represent in the color of epic poesy -lrb- 3 -rrb- on these grounds pope justify the coarseness of he allusion to mr thoma -lrb- corinna -rrb- and eliza haywood but a statement of high moral purpose from the author of the dunciad be almost inevitably the stalking-horse of a unworthy action mr pope 's reason real and profess for give mr haywood a particularly obnoxious place in he epic of dullness afford a curious illustration of he unmatched capacity ostensibly to chastise the vice of the age while in fact hit a opponent below the belt the scourge of dunce have as we have see a legitimate cause to resent the licentious attack upon certain court lady especially he friend mr howard in a scandalous fiction of which eliza haywood be the reputed author besides she have ally herself with bond defoe and other inelegant pretender in the domain of letter and be know to be the friend of aaron hill esq who stand not high in pope alexander 's good grace and finally pope may have honestly believe that she be responsible for a lampoon upon he in person in a list of book papers and verse in which we author be abuse before the publication of the dunciad with the true name of the author append to the dunciad variorum of 1729 mr haywood be credit with a anonymous memoirs of lilliput octavo print in 1727 -lrb- 4 -rrb- the full title of the work in

publish by luca bennet with a preface shew how these papers fall into he hand the title indeed be suggestive of such production as the court of carimanium in the preface mr luca bennet describe himself as a schoolfellow and friend of captain gulliver which be reason enough to make we doubt he own actuality but whether a real personage or a pseudonym for some other author he be probably not mr haywood for the style of the book be unlike that of she known work and the historian of lilliput indulge in some mild sarcasm at the expense of woman who set up for writer before they have well learn they alphabet either before or after compose he line on eliza however pope choose to attribute the volume to she the passage which doubtless provoke he noble rage against shameless scribbler be part of a debate between lilliputian court lady who be anxious lest they have be see by gulliver in a delicate situation should reflect on they reputation the speaker undertake to reassure she companion and besides the inequality of we stature rightly consider would ought to be for we as full a security from slander as that between mr p -- pe and those _ great _ lady who do nothing without

presume prude who boast a superiority of charm : or in privately transcribe and pass for he own the elaborate study of some more learn genius -lrb- 5 -rrb- such a attack upon the sensitive poet 's person and pride do not go unnoticed more than a year later he return the slur with interest upon the head of the suppose author the line on eliza which still remain the coarsest in the satire be in the original dunciad even more brutal -lrb- 6 -rrb- nothing short of childish personal animus could account for the filthy malignity of pope 's revenge see in the circle next eliza plac would two babe of love close cling to she waste fair as before she work she stand confess would in flow ` r would brocade by bounteous _ kirkall _ dress would pearl on she neck and rose in she hair and she

latter as always win the obscene contest and the plea would dame soft-smiling lead away nearly all of this account be impudent slander but mr pope 's imputation may have have enough truth in they to

dunciad quote with evident relish by pope in the variorum note record on the authority of contemporary scandal that the two babe of love be the offspring of a poet -lrb- 9 -rrb- and a bookseller this bit of libel mean no more than that mr haywood 's relation with savage and other minor writer have be injudiciously unconventional as for the bookseller curll have not be professionally connect with the authoress before the publication of the dunciad and the part he play in the game may be regard as due entirely to pope 's malice w r chetwood be indeed the first publisher of eliza 's effusion but he name be even more strongly associate with the prize which actually fall to he lot -lrb- 10 -rrb- in 1735 chapman be substitute for chetwood and in the last revision thoma osborne then the object of pope 's private antipathy gain a permanent place as curll 's opponent take all in all the chief virulence of the abuse be direct more against the bookseller than against mr haywood the second mention

evidently abuse equally applicable to any one or more of five woman writer could not be either specific or strikingly personal nothing can be infer from the line except that pope despise the whole race of female wit and bear particular malice against certain of they number eliza haywood sustain the largest share of anathema for not only be she vilify in the poem but haywood 's novel and the offensive court of carimanium occupy a conspicuous position in the cargo of book carry by the ass laden with author which form the well-known vignette to the quarto edition of 1729 in the universal

codrus or the dunciad dissect to which be add farmer pope and he son -lrb- 1729 -rrb- but mr haywood 's contribution be probably on she part unintentional and be due entirely to the activity of the same infamous bookseller who be among the first to get he reply and counter-slander into print -lrb- 13 -rrb- the key to the dunciad already mention run through three edition in competition with a

publisher as the nearest thing to hand when he come to patch up another pamphlet against pope nothing could be more characteristic of curll than he willingness to make capital out of he own disgrace so hurry be the compilation of the female dunciad that he even print the letter design to introduce mr haywood 's tale to the reader of the rover pope who assiduously read all the libel direct against

my own life record i be sensible it will be do in such a manner as i can not but approve no particular intimacy between the author and the bookseller can be infer from this extravagant but conventional flattery the interpretation of what mr haywood term inadvertency -- a word almost invariably use in she writings as a euphemism -- be a more difficult problem for definite evidence of the authoress ' gallantry be entirely lack but however damage to herself she frankness may have be there be little in the production to arouse the ire of pope the only instance in which the maligned novelist may have intend to show she resentment be in the preface to she tragedy frederick duke of brunswick-lunenburgh -lrb- 1729 -rrb- where with veil sarcasm she confess herself below the censure of the gyant-critick of this age although mr haywood be evidently not responsible for the inclusion of she tale in the female dunciad and although the piece itself be entirely innocuous she daring to raise she head even by accident bring down upon she another scurrilous rebuke not this time from the poet himself but from she former admirer richard savage in a author to be let -lrb- 1732 -rrb- pope

she soul be it well scour by repentance for the sin of she youth : but she rather choose starve by write novel of intrigue to teach young heiress the art of run away with fortune-hunter and scandalize person of the highest worth and distinction savage 's mention of elope heiress show that he have be look for exceptionable material in irish artifice but find little to he purpose there have revert to the stock objection to the scandal novel where he be upon safe but not original ground in the body of the pamphlet he return to assault the same breach the suppose writer iscariot hackney in state he

she deserve she be indeed a friend of theobald 's for a copy of the dunciad : with note variorum and the prolegomenon of scriblerus bearing on the fly-leaf the follow inscription : lewi theobald to mr heywood as a testimony of he esteem present this book call _ the dunciad _ and acquaint she that mr pope by the profit of its publication save he library _ wherein unpawned much learn lumber lay _ -lrb- 15 -rrb- show that the two victim of pope 's most bitter satire feel a sort of companionship in misfortune but there be no evidence to show that eliza take any part in the war of the dunce but that the immortal infamy heap upon she by the dunciad injured she prospects can not be doubt she be far from be a signal illustration of the powerlessness of this attack upon the immediate fortune of those assail as professor lounsbury describe she -lrb- 16 -rrb- it be true that she continue to write though with less frequency than before and that some of she best-seller be produce at a time when pope 's influence be at its height but that the author be oblige to take extreme measure to avoid the ill consequence of the lampoon upon she may be prove by compare the title-page of she earlier and later novel before the publication of the dunciad the adventuress in letter have enjoy a large share of popularity most of she legitimate work be advertise as write by mr eliza haywood and bear she name in full prominently display on the title-page that she signature possess a distinct commercial value in sell popular fiction be amusingly illustrate by a bit of literary rascality practice in 1727 when arthur bettesworth the bookseller issue a chapbook call the pleasant and delightful history of gillian of croydon after a long summary of the contents in small type come the statement the whole do much after the same method as those celebrated novel by mr eliza haywood the forge author 's name be emphasize in the largest possible type in the hope that a cursory glance at the title-page might deceive a prospective buyer -lrb- 17 -rrb- of she forty publication before 1728 only fifteen of which five from they libelous nature could not be acknowledge fail to sail openly under she color only once do she employ any sort of pseudonym and only in one case be she signature relegate to the end of the dedication -lrb- 18 -rrb- a word of scorn from the literary dictator however be enough to turn the taste of the town not indeed away from sensational and scandalous fiction but away from the hitherto popular writer of they eliza haywood be no longer a name to conjure with she reputation be irretrievably go it be no unusual thing in those day for lady in semi-public life to outlive several reputation the quondam clio have already find the notoriety of that name too strong for she comfort and have be rechristen mira by the dapper mr mallet -lrb- 19 -rrb- instead of adopt some such expedient mr haywood find it more convenient simply to lapse into anonymity of the four novel publish within a year after the dunciad none bear she name on the title-page though two have sign dedication and the other be advertise as by she not one of they be re-issue the tragedy frederick duke of brunswick-lunenburgh know to be of she make be a complete failure and love-letter on all occasion -lrb- 1730 -rrb- with collect by mr eliza haywood on the title-page never reach a second edition both she translation from the french l'entretien des beaux esprit -lrb- 1734 -rrb- and the virtuous villager -lrb- 1742 -rrb- be acknowledge at the end of the dedication and both be unsuccessful although the anonymous predecessor of the former la belle assemblee -lrb- 1725 -rrb- run through eight edition the single occurrence of mr haywood 's name on a title-page after 1730 if we except the two reprint of secret history be when the unacknowledged adventure of eovaaus -lrb- 1736 -rrb- re-appear five year later as the unfortunate princess with what seem to be a fubbed title-page for which the author be probably not responsible and the successful work refer to by professor lounsbury be all either issue without any signature or under such designation as the author of the fortunate foundling or mira one of the author of the female spectator or exploralibus so that even the reviewer sometimes appear to be ignorant of the writer 's identity moreover mr haywood 's re-establishment as a anonymous author seem to have be a work of some difficulty necessitate a ten year ' struggle against adversity between 1731 and 1741 she produce fewer book than during any single year of she activity after the publication of idalium and before the dunciad she probable share in the secret memoirs of mr duncan campbel be merely that of a hack writer she contribution to the opera of opera be of the most trifling nature and the two volume of l'entretien des beaux esprit be not original for six year after the adventure of eovaai she send to press no work now know to be hers and not until the catch-penny present for a servant-maid -lrb- 1743 -rrb- and the anonymous fortunate foundling -lrb- 1744 -rrb- do she wares again attain the popularity of several edition all due credit must be allow mr haywood for she persistent effort to regain she footing as a woman of letter for during this time she have little encouragement pope 's attack do destroy she best asset she grow reputation as a author but instead of follow savage 's ill-natured advice to turn washerwoman she remain loyal to she profession and in she later novel gain greater success than she have ever before enjoy but it be only she dexterity that save she from literary annihilation -lrb- 20 -rrb- the lesson of she hard usage at the hand of pope and he ally however be not lose upon the adaptable dame after she year of silence mr haywood seem to have return to the production of perishable literature with less inclination for gallantry than she have evince in she early romance warm-blooded creature though she be eliza could not be insensible to the cooling effect of age and perhaps too she perceive the more sober moral taste of the new generation in the numerous volume which she give to the world towards the latter part of she life say the biographium dramatica somewhat hastily no author have appear more the votary of virtue nor be there any novel in which a stricter purity or a greater delicacy of sentiment have be preserve without discuss here the comparative decency of mr haywood 's later novel we may admit at once with few allowance for change of standard the moral excellence of such work as the female spectator and epistle for the lady certainly if the penance pay by the reader be any test the novelist be successful in she effort to atone for the looseness of she early writings when she

of that poem and that too at a period when pope 's predominance be far higher than it be at the time the satire itself appear -lrb- 17 -rrb- a esdaile _ english tale and romance _ introduction xxviii

let we be just to merit of every kind mr _ heywood _ have the singular good fortune to recover a lose reputation and the yet greater honor to atone for she error -- she devote the remainder of she life and labor to the service of virtue those work by which she be most likely to be know to posterity be the _ female spectator _ and the _ invisible spy _ chapter vi letter and essay the work of mr haywood 's maturity most renowned for they pious intent be not of the tribe of novel but rather in the shape of letter or periodical essay such as epistle for the lady -lrb- 1749 -rrb- and the female spectator -lrb- 1746 -rrb- each of these form as practice during the eighteenth century permit the introduction of short romantic story either for the purpose of illustrate a moral or to make the didacticism more palatable even as a votary of virtue eliza do not neglect to mingle a liberal portion of _ dulce _ with she _ utile _ indeed in the first of the production mention she manifest a occasional tendency to revert to the letter of amorous intrigue characteristic of she earlier effort in she latest and soberest writings the conduct book call the wife and the husband -lrb- 1756 -rrb- she frequently yield to the temptation to turn from dry precept to picture the foible of either sex she long training in the school of romance have make gallantry the natural object of eliza haywood 's thought during the time that she be incessantly occupy with short tale of passion she have experiment in both the letter and the essay form use the former especially as a adjunct to she story one of she first attempt also to find she proper vein as a author be a translation from the french of the letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier with a discourse concern writings of this nature by way of essay for which the translator be responsible in the tea-table -lrb- 1725 -rrb- which never advance beyond the second part and reflection on the various effect of love -lrb- 1726 -rrb- the then well-known novelist return to the essay form and a comprehensive volume of love-letter on all occasion -lrb- 1730 -rrb- close the first period of she literary activity but none of these departure be noticeably different in tone from she staple romance the sweet of love be perhaps most convincingly reveal in the amorous billet of which love in excess and many of eliza 's subsequent piece of fiction contain a plentiful supply letter languish with various degree of desire or burning with jealous rage be introduce into the story upon any pretext write they be evidently the author 's forte and peruse they apparently a pleasure to she reader for they remain a conspicuous part of mr haywood 's sentimental paraphernalia as in the french romance of the scudéry type the missive be quote at length and label with such heading as the despairing d'elmont to he repent charmer or to the never enough admir would count d'elmont and sign with some such formulum as you most passionate and tender but -lrb- 'till she receive a favorable answer -rrb- you unknown adorer the custom of insert letter in the course of the story be as have already be indicate a heritage from the time of gomberville la calprenède and the scudérys when miscellaneous material of all sort from poetry to prosy conversation be habitually use to diversify the narrative mr haywood however employ the letter not to ornament but to intensify she _ billet-doux _ like the lyric in a play represent moment of supreme emotion in seek vividness she too often fall into exaggeration as in the follow specimen of absolute passion torture -- distraction -- hell -- what will become of I -- i can not -- i will not survive the knowledge that you be mine no more -- yet this suspence be worse than all yet ever bear the name of horror -- let I not linger in it if you have humanity -- declare my doom at once -- be kind in cruelty at least and let one death conclude the thousand thousand death which every minute of uncertainty bring with it to the miserable but still adoring melantha p i have order have the messenger to bring a answer if he come without depend i will murder he and then myself -lrb- 1 -rrb- such remnant of the romantic tradition as the verse on the unfortunate camillum 's complaint to the moon for the absence of she dear henricus frankville in love in excess be soon discard but the letter though they encumber the progress of the narrative make it more realistic by give a opportunity for the display of passion at first hand they continue vogue be undoubtedly due in large measure to the popularity of the celebrated letter of a portuguese nun -lrb- 1669 -rrb- which with a note of sincerity till then unknown aid the return to naturalness -lrb- 2 -rrb- the lettre nouvelle de monsieur boursault avec treize lettres amoureuses d'une dame à un cavalier loosely translate by mr haywood as letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier -lrb- 1721 -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- be one of the numerous imitation of the portuguese letter like most of the other imitation it echo the mannerism rather than the fervor of its original the lady 's epistle do not reveal a story but describe in detail the doubt disappointment fear jealousy and rapture of a married woman for a lover who in the last three letter have leave france for england except for this remove there be no change in the situation of the character the lover apparently remain constant to the end the reader be even leave in some doubt as to the exact nature of they relationship the lady at one time call it a criminal conversation but later resent a attempt upon she honor and seem generally to believe that a distant conversation if it be less sweet will be not only more pure but also more durable but perhaps it be only fair to let the author speak for herself the lady whose letter i have take the liberty to translate tho she have be cautious enough in express any thing -lrb- even in those the most tender among they -rrb- which can give the reader a assurance she have forfeit she virtue yet there be not one but what sufficiently prove how impossible it be to maintain such a correspondence without a anxiety and continual perturbation of mind which i think a woman must have bid farewell to she understanding before she could resolve to endure in the very first she plainly discover the agitation of she spirit confess she know herself in the wrong and that every expression she tenderness force from she be a stab to she peace she dread the effect of she lover 's too powerful attraction doubt she own strength of resist such unite charm as she find in he and tremble at the apprehension that by some unlucky accident the secret should be know every thing alarm she ` tis impossible to be conscious of any thing we wish to conceal without suspect the most undesigning word and action as snare lay to entrap we so this unfortunate lady divide between excess of love and nicety of honor could neither resolve to give a loose to the one nor entirely obey the precept of the other but suffer herself to be toss alternately by both and tho the person she love be most certainly -lrb- if such a thing can be -rrb- deserving all the condescension a woman could make by he assiduity constancy and gratitude yet it must be a good while before she could receive those proof and the disquiet she suffer in that time of probation be i think if no worse ensue too dear a price for the pleasure of be beloved by the most engaging and most charming of he sex the discourse concern writings of this nature from which the above quotation be take make no attempt to consider other series of amorous letter but proceeds to enforce by platitude and scrap of poetry the only too obvious moral of the lady of quality 's correspondence the author remember how a lady of my acquaintance perhaps not without reason fall one day as she be sit with I into this poetical exclamation : ` the pen can furrow a fond female 's heart and pierce it more than cupid 's talk would - of dart : letter a kind of magick virtue have and like strong philter human soul enslave ' after thirty page of moralize the writer come to a conclusion with the reflection a commonplace of she novel that if the little i have do may give occasion to some abler pen to expose -lrb- such indiscretion -rrb- more effectually i shall think myself happy in have give a hint which improv would may be of so general a service to my sex but the impression leave by this and other of mr haywood 's work be that the fair novelist be not so much interested in prevent the inadvertency of she sex as in expose they the tender passion be still the theme in love-letter on all occasion lately pass between person of distinction which contain a number of letter mainly disconnect devote to the warmer phase of gallantry some be essay in little on definite subject : levity sincerity the pleasure of conjugal affection insensibility and so on most of they however be occasional : strephon to dalinda on she forbid he to speak of love oronte to deanira entreat she to give he a meeting and many other in which both the proper name and the situation suggest the artificial romance none of the missive reveal emotion of any but the most tawdry romantic kind warm desire extravagantly utter conventional doubt causeless jealousy and petty quarrel like mr behn 's correspondence with the amorous van bruin these epistle have nothing to distinguish they except they excessive hyperbole there be one series of twenty-four connected letter on the model of letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier relate the love story of theano and elismonda but in the course of the whole correspondence nothing more momentous occur than the lover 's leave town indeed so imperceptible be the narrative element in mr haywood 's epistolary sequence that they can make no claim to share with the anonymous love story in letter entitle love 's posy -lrb- 1686 -rrb- with the letter write by mr manley -lrb- 1696 -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- or with tom brown 's adventure of lindamira -lrb- 1702 -rrb- in twenty-four letter the honor of have anticipate richardson 's method of tell a story in epistolary form -lrb- 5 -rrb- even after the publication of pamelum and clarissa mr haywood fail to realize the narrative possibility of consecutive letter for epistle for the lady -lrb- 1749 -rrb- hardly contain three missive on any one theme though the collection be not free from letter in the vein of gallantry the emphasis on the whole be decidedly change there be few attempt to exploit the emotion by describe the palpitation of injured beauty or the expostulation and vow of love-sick cavalier instead aminta be praise for endure with unusual self-possession the treachery of she lover and she most intimate friend sophronium encourage palmira to persist in she resolution of live apart from she husband until she be convince of the reformation of he manners and isabinda send to elvira a copy of a modest epithalamium on she sister 's marriage occasionally a romantic love story run through three or four letter but any deviation from the strictest principle of delicacy -- and there be not many -- be sure to be follow by a fitting catastrophe some reprobation of the licentious manners of the age be permit but no catering to degenerate taste and no breath of scandal the aim of the epistle which be apparently not intend as model be to convey moral precept in a agreeably alleviated form but the balance incline rather heavily toward sober piety a mother

of a future existence and the absurdity and meanness of those people 's notion who degrade the dignity of they species and put human nature on a level with that of the brute creation in all this devotion there be no doubt something of mr howe epistle for the lady be not the first attempt to employ the ornament of romance in the decoration of religion -lrb- 6 -rrb- nor the best but along with the pious substance the author sometimes adopt a almost johnsonian weightiness of style as when ciamara give to sophronia a account of the finish of a fine building she have be at a infinite expense in erect with some moral reflection on the vanity and disappointment of all sub-lunary expectation in she essay even the most serious mr haywood be a follower of addison rather than johnson the first of they if we disregard the slight discourse append to the letter from a lady of quality to a chevalier be the tea-table : or a conversation between some polite person of both sex at a lady 's visit day wherein be represent the various foible and affectation which form the character of a accomplish would beau or modern fine lady intersperse with several entertaining and instructive story -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- 1725 -rrb- which most resemble a day detach from the interminable la belle assemblée of mme de gomez translate by mr haywood a few month before there be the same polite conversation the debate between love and reason the poem -lrb- 8 -rrb- and the story but the moral reflection upon tea-table the description of amiana 's where only wit and good humor prevail and the satirical portrait of a title coxcomb and a bevy of fine lady be all in the manner of the tatler the manuscript novel read by one of the company savor of nothing but mr haywood who be evidently unable to slight she favorite theme of passion she comment on contemporary manners soon give place to beraldus and celemena : or the punishment of mutability a tale of court intrigue in she warmest vein the author of the tatler and spectator have of course set a precedent for the inclusion of short romantic story in the essay of manners and even the essay with no distinct element of fiction be prepare for the novelist the powerful tool of characterization writer of fiction be slow to apply the new art to they proper material in the present instance a experienced novelist employ the essay form to depict the folly and affectation of a beau and fine lady and immediately turn back to a story in which characterization be almost entirely neglect for incident it be interesting to find the same writer use the realistic sketch of manners and the romantic tale of intrigue and passion without any thought of combine the two element in the second part of the tea-table mr haywood make no attempt to diversify the patchwork of verse and prose with any narrative save one small incident illustrate pride the sole point of interest be the long and laudatory tribute to she friend aaron hill in a pastoral dialogue between alexi and clarinda occasion by hillarius 's intend a voyage to america the reflection on the various effect of love -lrb- 1726 -rrb- however take full advantage of the looseness of the essay form to become a mere tissue of short narrative illustrate the consequence of passion the story of celium and evandra one cursing she betrayer the other wish he always happy exemplify revengeful and generous love there be two model epistle from climene to mirtillo the first upon he absence the second upon he desertion of she soon the trite remark degenerate into a scandal novel relate the history

a gutter-nymph the essay abruptly end with the exclamation more of this in we next though there be no lack of slander at the end of mr haywood 's pen she never attempt to continue the reflection but almost twenty year later she make a more noteworthy excursion into the field of the periodical essay the female spectator begin in April 1744 and continue in monthly part until may 1746 bid fair to

run only from 2 August to 4 October 1746 the number consist commonly of two part : the first be moralizing on life and manners by a miraculous parrot and the second a digest of whatever happening the author could scrape together the news of the day be concerned chiefly with the fate of the rebel in the last stuart uprising and with rumor of the pretender 's movement from many indication eliza haywood would seem to have take a lively interest in the stuart cause but certainly she have no exceptional facility for report the course of event and consequently she budget of information be often stale or fill with vague surmise but she do not overlook the opportunity to narrate _ con amore _ such pathetic incident as the death of jemmy dawson 's sweetheart at the moment of he execution later the subject of shenstone 's ballad the vaporizing of the parrot be also largely inspire by the trial of the rebel but the sagacious bird frequently draw upon such stock subject as the folly of the gay

every conceivable situation begin with the first few week after marriage vulgarly call would the honey-moon and end with how a woman ought to behave when in a state of separation from she husband -- a subject upon which mr haywood could speak from first-hand knowledge indeed it must be confess that the writer seem to be chiefly interested in the infelicity of married life and continually alleviate the rigor of she didactic pasage -lrb- transcriber 's note : sic -rrb- with lively picture of domestic jar such as the following : the happy day which have join would this pair be scarce six week elapse when lo behold a most terrible reverse -- the hurry of they fond passion be over -- dalliance be no more -- kiss and embrace be now succeed by fight scratch and endeavor to tear out each other 's eye -- the lip that before could utter only -- my dear -- my life -- my soul -- my treasure now pour would forth nothing but invective -- they take as little care to conceal the proof of they animosity as they have do to moderate those of a contrary emotion -- they be continually quarrel -- they house be a babel of confusion -- no servant would stay with they a week -- they be shunn would by they most intimate friend and despi would by all they acquaintance till at last they mutually resolv would to agree in one point which be to be separate for ever from each other -lrb- p 16 -rrb- so

suspicion of she virtue the great indiscretion of take too much notice of the unmeaning or transient gallantry of a husband the method which a wife be justified to take after support for a long time a

ameliorate she husband 's fault if addict to drink she must take care to have he cellar well stor would with the best and richest wine and never seem averse to any company he shall think fit to

argument for those he will not listen to -- but by get often to she house the most witty gay and spirituous of she acquaintance who will sing dance tell pleasant story and take all the freedom that innocence allow -lrb- p 163 -rrb- occasionally the advice to married woman be very practical as the follow deterrent from gluttony show : i dine one day with a lady who the whole time she employ would she knife and fork with incredible swiftness in dispatch a load of turkey and chine she have heap would upon she plate still keep a keen regard on what she have leave behind greedily devour with she eye all that remain would in the dish and throw a look of envy on every one who put in for the smallest share -- my advice to such a one be that she would have a great looking-glass fix would opposite the seat she take at table and i be much mistaken if the sight of herself in those grim attitude i have mention would will not very much contribute to bring she to more moderation -lrb- p 276 -rrb- the method of the husband in answer to the wife -lrb- 1756 -rrb- be similar to that of its companion-piece in fact much of the same advice be merely modify or amplify to suit the other sex the husband

not to mention the female foundling -lrb- 1750 -rrb- eliza haywood 's contribution to foundling literature relate the history of twin brother and sister find by a benevolent gentleman name dorilaus in the memorable year 1688 louisa be of the tribe of marianne pamelum and henrietta nor do she experience differ materially from the course usually run by such heroine rear a model of virtue she be oblige to fly from the house of she guardian to avoid he importunity after serve as a milliner 's apprentice long enough to demonstrate the inviolability of she principle she become mistress of the rule of politeness at the lead court of europe as the companion of the gay melanthe save from a atrocious rake by a honorable lover whom she be unwilling to accept because of the humbleness of she station she take refuge in a convent where she soon become so popular that the abbess lay a plot to induce she to become a nun but escape the religious snare she go back to pari to be claim by dorilaus as he real daughter thus every obstacle to she union with she lover be happily remove horatio meanwhile after leave westminster school to serve as a volunteer in flander have encounter fewer amorous and more military adventure than usually fall to the lot of haywoodian hero he promising career under marlborough be terminate when he be take captive by the french but he be subsequently release to enter the service of the chevalier he then become enamored of the beautiful charlotta de palfoy and in the hope of make he fortune equal to hers resolve to cast he lot with the swedish monarch in the saxon campaign he win a commission as colonel of horse and a comfortable share of the spoil but later be take prisoner by the russian and condemn to languish in a dungeon at st petersburg after many hardship he make he way to pari to be welcome as a son by dorilaus and as a husband by he adored charlotta in describe horatio 's martial exploit mr haywood may well have learn some lesson from the memoirs of a cavalier the narrative be direct and rapid and diversify by the mingling of private escapade with history too much be make of course of the hero 's personal relation with charle xii but that be a fault which few historical novelist have know how to avoid the geographical background as well as the historical setting be lay out with a precision unusual in she fiction the whole map of europe be the scene of action and the author speak as one familiar with foreign travel though she passing reference to paris venice vienna and other city have not the full vigor of the description in peregrine pickle from the standpoint of structure too the fortunate foundling be a improvement over the haphazard plot of mr haywood 's early romance though the double-barreled story necessitate by twin hero and heroine could hardly be tell without awkward interruption in the sequence of one part of the narrative in order to forward the other but the author doubtless feel that the reader 's interest would be freshen by turn from the amorous adventure of louisa to the daring deed of horatio while a protagonist of each sex enable she to exhibit at once example of both male and female virtue and in spite of inherent difficulty she succeed to some extent in show a interrelation of plot as where dorilaus by go to the north of ireland to hear the die confession of the mother of he child thereby miss horatio 's appeal for a ransom and thus prevent he from rejoin marlborough 's standard but there be nothing like fielding 's ingenious link of event and careful preparation for the catastrophe nor do mrs haywood make much out of the hint of unconscious incest and the foundling motif which she book have in common with tom jone occasionally also she can not refrain from insert a bit of court gossip or a amorous page in she warmest manner but the number of intercalated story be small indeed compare to that in a romance like love in excess and they be usually dismiss in a few paragraph here for the first time the author have show some ability to subordinate sensational incident to the need of the main plot when mr haywood 's inclination or necessity lead she back to the novel four year later she produce a work upon a still more consistent if also more artificial plan than any of she previous attempt life 's progress through the passion : or the adventure of natura avowedly aim to trace the workings of human emotion the author 's purpose be to examine in what manner the passion operate in every stage of life and how far the constitution of the _ outward frame _ be concern in the emotion of the _ internal faculty _ for action which we might admire or abhor would lose much of they _ eclat _ either way be the secret spring that give they motion see into with the eye of philosophy and reflection natura a sort of everyman expose to the variation of passion be not the faultless hero of romance but a mere ordinary mortal indeed the writer declare that she be a enemy to all _ romance novel _ and whatever carry the air of they and as it be a _ real _ not _ fictitious _ character i be about to present i think myself oblige to draw he such as he be not such as some sanguine imagination might wish he to have be the survey of the passion begin with a account of natura 's birth of well-to-do but not extraordinary parent he mother 's death and he father 's second marriage he attack of the small-pox he education at eton and he boyish love for he little play-mate delium later he become more seriously compromise with a woman of the street who lure he into financial engagement though lock up by he displeased father he manage to escape find he lady entertaining another gallant and in despair become a regular vagabond just as he be about to leave england he father discover he and send he to make the grand tour under a competent tutor in paris the tutor die and the young man be leave to the exercise of he own discretion benighted in a wood he find shelter in a monastery of noble lady where both the abbess and she sister fall in love with he after fluctuate between the two he try to elope with the sister be foiled by the abbess and set off again upon he travels in italy he hear of he father 's difficulty and start for home but enter the french service instead he be involve with a nobleman in a attempt to abduct a lady from a nunnery and would have be tortured have not the jailor 's wife elope with he to england there he enter parliament and be about to contract a fortunate marriage when he incautiously defend the chevalier in conversation fight a duel and although he antagonist be only wound he find he reputation blighted by the stigma of jacobitism after a long illness at vienna where he be pester by catholic priest he recover he health at spa and fall in love with a young english girl she parent gladly give they consent but marium seem unaccountably averse to the match and when we hero be assault by a jealous footman he perceive that the lady have fix she affection on a lower object natura on he return to england prosper and marry happily but he joy be soon destroy by the death of he father and of he wife in give birth to a son consume by ambition the widower then marry the niece of a statesman only to discover what misery there be in a luxurious and unvirtuous wife natura soon experience the passion of melancholy grief and revenge he son die and he wife 's conduct force he to divorce she in the hope of prevent he brother from inherit he estate he be about to marry a healthy country girl when he hear that he brother be dead and that he sister 's son be now he heir thereupon he buy off he intended bride at he sister 's house he meet a young matron name charlotte for whom he long entertain a platonic affection but finally marry she and have three son thereafter he sink into a calm and natural decline and die in he sixty-third year thus i have attempt to trace nature in all she mazy winding and shew life 's progress through the passion from the cradle to the grave -- the various adventure which happen to natura i think afford a more ample field than those of any one man i ever hear or read of and flatter myself that the reader will find many instance that may contribute to rectify he own conduct by point out those thing which ought to be avoid or at least most carefully guard against and those which be worthy to be improve and imitate the obvious and conventional moral ending and the shred of romance that still adhere to the story need not blind we to its unusual feature besides insist upon the necessity for psychological analysis of a sort the author here for the first time become a genuine novelist in the sense that she confess purpose be to depict the actual condition of life not to glorify or idealize they as fielding be to do in tom jone mr haywood proclaim the mediocrity of she hero as he most remarkable quality have she be able to make he more than a lay figure distort by various passion she might have produce a real character although at time he seem to be in danger of acquire the romantic faculty of cause every woman he meet to fall in love with he yet the glamor of he youth be obscure by a peaceful and ordinary old age artificial in design and stilted in execution as the work be it nevertheless mark eliza haywood 's emancipation from the tradition of the romance -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the history of miss betsy thoughtless -lrb- 1751 -rrb- she reach the full fruition of she power as a novelist she heroine like natura be little more than a humor character whose prevail fault be denote by she surname -lrb- 4 -rrb- though not fundamentally vicious she heedless vanity inquisitiveness and vivacity lead she into all sort of folly and embarrassment upon she first entry into fashionable life in london among all the suitor who strive to make a impression upon she heart mr trueworth alone succeed but she levity and she disregard of appearance force he to think she unworthy of he attention meanwhile she guardian 's wife lady mellasin have be turn out of the house for a egregious infidelity and betsy be leave to she own scant discretion after somewhat annoying she brother by receive man at she lodgings she elect under family pressure to marry a mr munden who quickly show himself all that a husband should not be eventually she have to abandon he but demonstrate she wifely devotion by go back to nurse he through he last illness mr trueworth 's mate in the interim have conveniently manage to succumb he old passion revive and exactly upon the anniversary of mr munden 's death he arrive in a chariot and six to claim the fair widow whose youthful levity have be chasten by the severe discipline of she unfortunate marriage tell in a easy and dilatory style and intersperse with the inevitable little history and impassioned letter the story attain the conventional bulk of four duodecimo volume as mr austin dobson have point out -lrb- 5 -rrb- mr haywood 's novel be remarkable for its scant allusion to actual place and person once mention be make of a appointment at general tatten 's bench opposite rosamond 's pond in st jame 's park and once a character refer to cuper 's garden but except for a outburst of unexplained virulence direct against fielding -lrb- 6 -rrb- there be hardly a thought of the novelist 's contemporary here be a change indeed from the method of the _ chronique scandaleuse _ and a restraint to be wonder at when we remember the worthy caricature by so eminent a writer as smollett but even more remarkable be the difference of spirit between betsy thoughtless and mr haywood 's earlier and briefer romance the young _ romancière _ who in 1725 could write love be a topick which i believe few be ignorant of a shady grove and purling stream be all thing that be necessary to give we a idea of the tender passion -lrb- 7 -rrb- have in a quarter of a century learn much worldly wisdom and she heroine likewise be too sophisticated to be move by the style of love-making that warm the susceptible bosom of anadea filenia or placentium one of betsy 's suitor indeed venture upon the romantic vein with no very favorable result ` the deity of soft desire ' say he ` fly the confused glare of pomp and public shew -- ` tis in the shady bower or on the bank of a sweet purling stream he spread he downy wing and waft he thousand nameless pleasure on the fond -- the innocent and the happy pair ' he be go on but she interrupt he with a loud laugh ` hold hold ' cry she ` be there ever such a romantick description i wonder how such silly idea come into you head -- shady bower and purling stream -- heaven how insipid well ' -lrb- continue she -rrb- ` you may be the strephon of the wood if you think fit but i shall never envy the happiness of the chloe that accompany you in these fine recess what to be coop up like a tame dive only to coo and bill and breed o it would be a delicious life indeed ' -lrb- 8 -rrb- thus completely metamorphose be the heroine of mr haywood 's maturest fiction betsy thoughtless be not even the innocent lovely and pliable girl typify in fielding 's sophium western she be eminently hard-headed inquisitive and practical and be justly describe by sir walter raleigh as own cousin to roderick random -lrb- 9 -rrb- whether she may be consider also the ancestor of evelina must briefly be consider dunlop who apparently originate the idea that betsy thoughtless might have suggest the plan of miss burney 's novel work out a elaborate parallel between the plot and some of the chief character of the two composition -lrb- 10 -rrb- both as he point out begin with the launching of a young girl on the great and busy stage of life in london each heroine have much to endure from the vulgar manners of a lady mellasin or a madam duval and each be annoy by the malice and impertinence of a miss flora or the miss branghton through they inexperience in the manners of the world and they heedlessness or ignorance of ceremony both young lady be mortify by fall into embarrassing and awkward predicament both in the same way alarm the delicacy and almost alienate the affection of they choose lover the chief perplexity of mr trueworth the admirer of miss thoughtless arise from meet she in company with miss forward who have be she companion at a boarding-school and of whose infamous character she be ignorant in like manner the delicacy of lord orville be wound and he attachment shake by meet he evelina in similar society at vauxhall the subsequent visit and counsel of the lover to they mistress be see however in a very different point of view by the heroine the likeness between the plot of the two novel be indeed sufficiently striking to attract the attention of a experienced hunter for literary parallel but unfortunately there be no external evidence to show that miss burney ever read she predecessor 's work one need only compare any two parallel character the common profligate lady mellasin for instance with the delightfully coarse madam duval to see how little the author of evelina could have learn from the page of mr haywood but if it deserve scant credit as a model for miss burney 's infinitely more delicate art betsy thoughtless should still be notice as a early attempt to use the substance of everyday life as material for fiction it have be call with some justice the first domestic novel in the language although the exact definition of a domestic novel nowhere appear the term may be understand -- by expand the french _ roman à la tasse de thé _ -- as mean a realistic piece of fiction in which the heroine serve as chief protagonist and which can be read with a teacup in one hand without danger of spilling the tea mrs haywood indeed draw upon she old stock of love scene tender or importunate duel marital dispute and elopement to lend interest to she story but except for the mock-marriage with a scoundrelly valet from which the imprudent betsy be rescue in the nick of time by she former lover no passage in the four volume recommend itself particularly either to sense or to sensibility there be few high light in betsy thoughtless the story keep the even and loquacious tenor of its way after a fashion call insipid by the monthly review though the critic finally acknowledge the difficulty of the task if not the success of the writer in justice to -lrb- we author -rrb- however this may be further observe that no other hand would probably have more happily finish a work begin on such a plan as that of the history of a young inconsiderate girl whose little foible without any natural vice of the mind involve she in difficulty and distress which by correct make she wiser and deservedly happy in the end a heroine like this can not but lay she historian under much disadvantage for tho ' such a example may afford lesson of prudence yet how can we greatly interest ourselves in the fortune of one whose character and conduct be neither amiable nor infamous and which we can neither admire nor love nor pity nor be divert with great spirit in the writer and uncommon beauty in the expression be certainly necessary to supply the deficiency of such a barren foundation -lrb- 11 -rrb- neither of the latter quality be at the command of the female pen that compose betsy thoughtless but in spite of the handicap impose by the plan of she work and the deficiency of she genius she produce a novel at once realistic and readable without resort to the dramatic but inherently improbable plot by which richardson make he writings at once the joy of the chambermaid of all nation -lrb- 12 -rrb- and something of a laughing stock to person capable of detect they absurdity mr haywood preserve he method of minute fidelity to actual life and still make she book entertain to such a connoisseur of fiction as lady mary wortley montagu -lrb- 13 -rrb- though rarely mention with entire approbation betsy thoughtless be widely read for fifty year after its publication -lrb- 14 -rrb- and undoubtedly deserve its place among the best of the minor novel collect in harrison 's novelist 's library in the same useful repertory of eighteenth century fiction be the second of mr haywood 's domestic novel only less famous than its predecessor like she earlier effort too the history of jemmy and jenny jessamy -lrb- 1753 -rrb- contain a great number of letter quote at full length though the narrative be usually retard rather than develop by these effusion yet all the letter together with numerous digression and insert narrative serve only to fill out three volume in twelve to reader whose taste for fiction have be cloy by novel full of incident movement and compression nothing could be more maddening than the leisurely footpace at which the story drag its slow length along no wonder then that scott record he abhorrence of the whole jemmy and jenny jessamy tribe while to coleridge and thackeray jemmy jessamy stuff be a favorite synonym for the emotional inane -lrb- 15 -rrb- but mrs haywood make no pretense of interesting such reader in the run fire of comment on the narrative contain in the lengthy chapter heading she confess that she book treat only on such matter as it be highly probable some reader will be apt to say might have be recite in a more laconick manner if not totally omit but as there be other the author imagine much the greater number who may be of a different opinion it be judge proper that the majority should be oblige she have no hesitation either in recommend part of the story that can not fail of give a agreeable sensation to every honest and good-natured reader or in spare he a digression of no consequence to the history which may be read or omit at discretion but those who love to read in a easy-chair either soon after dinner or at night just go to rest will find in the tale such thing as the author be pretty well convince from a long series of observation on the human mind will afford more pleasure than offence we have every reason to believe that what the novelist term she distressful narrative succeed in its appeal to the martha buskbody of the generation for even goethe 's charlotte take a heartfelt interest in the fortune of miss jenny -lrb- 18 -rrb- it be indeed so far calculate to stir the sensibility that a most touching turn in the lover ' affair be label not fit to be read by those who have tender heart or watry eye but though popular with sentimental reader the new production be not wholly approve by the critic of the monthly review -lrb- 17 -rrb- he find the character and conduct of miss jessamy more interesting to the reader than those of miss thoughtless but he do not fail to point out that the fable be equally deficient in plot and in natural incident the history in fact though it do not want a hero have like the fortunate foundling double the usual number of protagonist have a more uncommon want that of a story when the novel begin jemmy son of a land gentleman and he cousin jenny daughter of a wealthy merchant have long be affiance by they respective parent but each be leave a orphan before they union can be accomplish thereupon jemmy leave oxford and come up to london where he and jenny indulge innocently but with keen relish in the pleasure of the town but the numerous instance of marital levity and unhappiness that come to they notice make they decide to defer they marriage until they have gain more knowledge of the world and of they own sentiment in pursuance of this delicate experiment each communicate to the other he observation on the jealousy discontent and misery attend marriage jenny note how mrs marlove 's partiality for she froward maid promote discord in the family and jemmy be shock to find the fair liberium so fond of card that though at present a profest enemy to religion she would be the greatest devotee imaginable

disadvantage she be save from the rudeness of celandine by the intrusion of the gallant 's jealous mistress who faint when foiled in she attempt to stab jenny but later relate the story of she ruin this narrative be enough to disgust lady speck with she foppish admirer and to make she sensible of the merit of mr lovegrove in spite of bellpine 's industrious slander and in spite of seemingly incontrovertible proof of jemmy 's inconstancy jenny 's faith in she lover remain unshaken after tedious delay he finally rejoin she in london but learn the full extent of bellpine 's treachery he

wedding journey to pari there she find she adored jessamy now fully sensible of the merit of he treasure he do not fail to press for a speedy termination to they delay and jenny be not unwilling to crown he love by a happy catastrophe besides be unwarrantably expand by a wealth of tedious detail the novel have little merit as a piece of realism the society of lord humphrey and lady speck be not that in which eliza haywood commonly move but she have live upon the skirt of gay life long enough to imitate its appearance although she exhibit the diamond tassel sparkling in st jame 's sun or the musk and amber that perfume the mall she never penetrate beyond externality the sentiment of she character be as inflate as those of a grandison and she picture of refined society as ridiculously stilted as richardson 's own the scene whether in london bath oxford or pari be describe with more attention to specific detail than appear in she early romance but compare with the setting of humphrey clinker she glittering world appear pale and unreal mr haywood have so frame she style to suit the short rapid tale of passion that she never move easily in the unwieldy novel form consequently she best narrative be to be find in the digression a chapter or two long which be equivalent to little history upon the old model in they the progress of the action be unimpeded compress and at time even sprightly recognize perhaps she inability to cope with a plot of any extent mr haywood adopt in she next novel a plan that permit she to include a pot-pourrus of short narrative conversation letter reflection and miscellaneous material without damage the comprehensive scheme of she story except that it lack the consistent purpose of traduce the fair fame of she contemporary

nature mr haywood have undoubtedly salvage from she sixty year of buffet about in the world but so rapid and complete have be the development of prose fiction during she literary life that she be unable quite to comprehend the magnitude of the change she early training in romance writing have leave too indelible a stamp upon she mind she be never able to apprehend the full possibility of the newer fiction and she success as a novelist be only a evidence of she ability to create the image of a literary form without master its technique so at the maturity of she power she lack a vessel

march 1788 chapter viii conclusion though eliza haywood produce nothing which the world have not willingly let die yet at least the obituary of she work deserve to be record in the history of fiction of the many kind of write attempt by she during the thirty-six year of she literary adventuring none consider absolutely be superior to the novel of she last period betsy thoughtless contain at once she best develop character most extensive plot and most nearly realistic setting but before it be send to press in 1751 richardson fielding and sarah fielding have establish themselves in public favor and smollett be already know as they peer even in company with david simple eliza haywood 's most notable effort could not hope to shine the value then of what be all in all she best work be greatly lessen by the obvious inferiority of she production to the masterpiece of the age as a writer of amatory romance and scandal novel on the contrary mr haywood be surpass by none of she contemporary the immense reputation that she acquire in she own day have deservedly vanish for though she tale undoubtedly help to frame the novel of manners they be properly discard as useless lumber when once the new species of write have take tangible form perhaps they be chiefly significant to the modern student not as reveal now and then the first feeble stirring of realism but as show the last throe of sensational extravagance the very extreme to which writer of the haywoodian type carry breathless adventure warm intrigue and soul-thrilling passion exhaust the possibility of they method and make progress possible only in a new direction on the technical development of the modern novel the _ roman à clef _ can hardly have exercise a strong influence nor can the lampoon in mr haywood 's anthology of scandal be value highly as attempt to characterize to draw a portrait from the life be not to create a character still less when the line be distort by satire but the caricaturing of fine lady and gentleman can not have be without effect as a corrective to the glittering atmosphere of courtly life that still permeate the page of the short debased romance the character of the scandal novel be still prince and courtier but they exploit be more licentious than the lowest pothouse amours of picaro and they doxy the chivalrous convention of the heroic romance have degenerate into the formality of gallantry the exalted modesty of romantic heroine have sink into a fearful regard for shaky reputation and the picture of genteel life be fill with scene of fraud violence and vice as the writer of anti-romance in the previous century have find a delicately malicious pleasure in exhibit character draw from humble and rustic life perform the ceremony and profess the sentiment of a good breeding foreign to they social position so the scandal-mongering author like mr haywood help to make apparent the hollowness of the aristocratic convention even as practice by the aristocracy and the incongruity of apply exalted ideal derive from a outworn system of chivalry to everyday lady and gentleman of the georgian age undoubtedly the writer of _ roman à clef _ do not bargain for this effect for they cling to they prince and court lady till the last leave to more able pen the task of make hero and heroine out of cobbler and kitchen wench but in represent people of quality as the vilest and silliest part of the nation mr haywood and she ilk prepare they reader to welcome character draw from they own station in society and pave the way for that confounding of all rank and make a jest of order which though deplore by lady mary wortley montagu -lrb- 1 -rrb- be nevertheless a condition of progress toward realism quite apart from the slight merit of she writings the very fact of mr haywood 's long career as a woman of letter would entitle she to much consideration about the middle of the seventeenth century woman romancer like woman poet be elegant trifler content to add the lustre of wit to they other charm while mme de la fayette be gain the plaudit of the urbane world for the _ délicatesse _ of la princesse de clèves and the eccentric duchess of newcastle be employ she genius upon the fantastic philosophical description of a new world call the blaze world -lrb- 1668 -rrb- woman of another stamp be begin to write fiction with the advent of mme de villedieu in france and she more celebrated contemporary mr behn in england literature become a profession whereby woman could command a livelihood the pioneer _ romancières _ be commonly adventuress in life as in letter needy widow like mr behn mme de gomez and mr mary davy or cast mistress like mme de villedieu mile de la force and mr manley who cultivate minerva when venus prove unpropitious but although the divine astraea win recognition from easy-going john dryden and approbation from the profligate wit of charle ii 's court she memory be little honor by the coterie about pope and swift when even the lofty ideal and trenchant style of mary astell serve as a target for the ridicule of mr bickerstaff 's friend -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be not remarkable that such authoress as mr manley and mr haywood should be dismiss from notice as infamous scribble woman -lrb- 3 -rrb- ind -lrb- transcriber 's note : sic -rrb- the position of woman novelist be anything but assure at the beginning of the eighteenth century they have to support the disfavor and even the malign attack of established man of letter who scout the pretension of the inelegant to literary fame and follow the lead of boileau discredit the romance as absurd and unclassical moreover the moral soundness of fictitious fable be question by scrupulous reader and the amatory tale turn out in profusion by most of the female romancer be not calculate to reassure the pious even though preface by assertion of didactic aim and tag with a exemplary moral nevertheless the tribe of woman who earn they living chiefly by the proceeds of they pen rapidly increase -lrb- 4 -rrb- mr haywood as we have see look to the bookseller for support when she husband disclaim she of all the amazon of prose fiction who in a long struggle with neglect and disparagement demonstrate the fitness of they sex to follow the novelist 's call none be more persistent more adaptable or more closely identify with the development of the novel than she mr behn and mr manley must be give credit as pioneer in fiction but much of they best work be write for the stage eliza haywood on the other hand add little to she reputation by she few dramatic performance she achieve she success first and last as a writer of romance and novel and unlike mr aubin and she other rival continue to maintain she position as a popular author over a considerable period of time during the thirty-six year of she activity the romance of defoe and of mr jane barker give place to the novel of richardson fielding and smollett yet the female veteran keep abreast of the change in the taste of she public and even contribute slightly to produce they nor be she progress accomplish without numerous difficulty and discouragement in spite of all however mrs haywood remain devoted to she calling and be still scribble when the great dr johnson crown the brow of mr charlotte lennox to celebrate the publication of the life of harriot stuart -lrb- 1750 -rrb- after such recognition a career in letter be open to woman without reproach though unlaureled by any lexicographer and despise by the virtuous mr lennox -lrb- 5 -rrb- mr haywood nevertheless have do yeoman service in prepare the way for modest fanny burney and quiet jane austen moreover she be the only one of the old tribe of _ romancières _ who survive to join the new school of lady novelist and in she tabloid fiction rather than in the criminal biography or the _ voyage imaginaire _ or the periodical essay may best be study the obscure but essential link between the voluminous extravagance of the parthenissa kind
