i be a householder in a pleasant country neighborhood about twenty mile from new york my family consist of myself and wife we boy george william aged two two maid-servant and a man but in the summer we have frequent visitor and at the time of which i be about to write my aunt martha be stay with we my house be large and pleasant and we have neighbor near enough for social purpose and yet not too near or too many to detract from the rural aspect of we surroundings but we do not live in a paradise we be occasionally trouble by mosquito and burglar against the first of these annoyance we have always be able to guard ourselves at least in a measure and we man and the cook declare that they have become so use to they that they do not mind they but to guard against burglar be much more difficult and to become use to they would i think require a great deal of practice for several month before the period of this narrative we neighborhood have be subject to visit from burglar from time to time house have be enter and rob and the offender have never be detect we have no police force not even a village organization there be a small railway station near we house and six mile away be the county town for fire and police protection each household be oblige to depend upon itself before the beginning of the burglarious enterprise in we midst we have not feel the need of much protection in this direction sometimes poultry be steal but this be a rare occurrence and although window and door be generally fasten for the night this labor be often consider much more troublesome than necessary but now a great change have take place in the feeling of we community when the first robbery occur the neighbor be incline to laugh about it and to say that captain hubbard 's habit of sit up after the rest of he family have go to bed and then retire and forget to close the front door have invite the entrance of a pass tramp but when a second and a third house where window and door have not be leave open have be enter and in a measure despoil people cease to laugh and if there have be any merriment at all on the subject it would have be cause by the extraordinary and remarkable precaution take against the entrance of thief by night the loaded pistol become the favorite companion of the head of the house those who have no watch-dog buy they there be new lock new bolt new fastening at one time there be a mount patrol of young man which however be soon break up by they mother but this trouble be unavail for at interval the burglary continue as a matter of course a great many theory be broach as to the reason for this disturbance in we hitherto peaceful neighborhood we be at such a distance from the ordinary centre of crime that it be generally consider that professional burglar would hardly take the trouble to get to we or to get away from we and that therefore the offence be probably commit by unsuspected person live in this part of the country who have easy means of determine which house be worth break into and what method of entrance would be most feasible in this way some family hitherto regard as respectable family have fall under suspicion so far mine be the only house of any importance within the distance of a mile from the station which have not in some way suffer from burglar in one or two of these case the offender have be frighten away before they have do any other injury than the breaking of a window-shutter but we have be spare any visitation whatever after a time we begin to consider that this be a invidious distinction of course we do not desire that robber should break into we house and steal but it be a sort of imply insult that robber should think that we house be not worth break into we contrived however to bear up under this imply contempt and even under the facetious imputation of some of we lively neighbor who declare that it look very suspicious that we should lose nothing and even continue to add to we worldly goods while everybody else be suffer from abstraction i do not however allow any relaxation in my vigilance in the protection of my house and family my time to suffer have not yet arrive and it might not arrive at all but if it do come it should not be my fault i therefore carefully examine all the new precaution my neighbor have take against the entrance of thief and where i approve of they i adopt they of some of these my wife and i do not approve for instance a tin pan contain iron spoon the dinner bell and a miscellaneous collection of hardware balance on the top stair of the staircase and so connect with fine cord that a thief come up the stair would send it rattle and bound to the bottom be look upon by we with great disfavor the descent of the pan whether by innocent accident or the approach of a burglar might throw we little boy into a fit to say nothing of the terrible fright it would give my aunt martha who be a maiden lady of middle age and not accustom to a clatter in the night a bull-dog in the house my wife would not have nor indeed a dog of any kind george william be not yet old enough to play with dog especially a sharp one and if the dog be not sharp it be of no use to have he in the house to the ordinary burglar-alarm she strongly object she have be in house where these thing go off of they own accord occasion great consternation and besides she say that if thief get into the house she do not want to know it and she do not want I to know it the quicker they find what they come for and go away with it the better of course she wish they keep out if such a thing be possible but if they do get in we duty as parent of the dearest little boy be non-interference she insist however that the room in which the loveliest of child sleep and which be also occupy by ourselves should be make absolutely burglar proof and this object by means of extraordinary bolt and chain i flattered myself i accomplish my aunt martha have a patent contrivance for fasten a door that she always use whether at home or travel and in whose merit she place implicit confidence therefore we do not feel it necessary to be anxious about she and the servant sleep at the top of the house where thief would not be likely to go they may continue to slight we by they absence say my wife but i do not believe that they will be able to frighten we by they presence i be not however so easily contented as my wife of course i wish to do everything possible to protect george william and the rest of the family but i be also very anxious to protect we property in all part of the house therefore in addition to everything else i have do i devise a scheme for interfere with the plan of man who should feloniously break into we home after a consultation with a friend who be a physician greatly interested in the study of narcotic drug i procure a mixture which be almost tasteless and without peculiar odour and of which a small quantity would in less than a minute throw a ordinary man into a state of unconsciousness the potion be however no more dangerous in its effect than that quantity of ardent spirit which would cause entire insensibility after the lapse of several hour the person under the influence of the drug would recover consciousness without assistance but in order to provide against all contingency my friend prepare a powerful antidote which would almost immediately revive one who have be make unconscious by we potion the scheme that i have devise may possibly have be put into use by other but of this i know not i think it a good scheme and determine to experiment with it and if possible to make a trap which should catch a burglar i would reveal this plan to no one but my friend the physician and my wife secrecy would be a important element in its success we library be a large and pleasant room on the ground floor of the house and here i set my trap it be my habit to remain in this room a hour or so after the rest of the family have go to bed and as i be a early riser i be always in it again before it be necessary for a servant to enter it in the morning before leave the library for the night i place in a conspicuous position in the room a small table on which be a tray hold two decanter partially fill with wine in the one red and in the other white there be also upon the tray a open box of biscuit and three wine-glass two of they with a little wine at the bottom i take pain to make it appear that these refreshment have be recently partake of there be biscuit crumb upon the tray and a drop or two of wine be freshly spill upon it every time the trap be set the table thus arrange be leave in the room during the night and early in the morning i put the tray and its contents into a closet and lock it up a portion of my narcotic preparation be thoroughly mix with the contents of each of the decanter in such proportion that a glass of the wine would be sufficient to produce the desire effect it be my opinion that there be few man who after a night walk and perhaps some labor in forcibly open a door or a window-shutter would not cease for a moment in pursuance of they self-imposed task to partake of the refreshment so conveniently leave behind they by the occupant of the house when they retire to rest should my surmise be correct i might reasonably expect should my house be break into to find a unconscious burglar in the library when i go down in the morning and i be sure and my wife agree with I that if i should find a burglar in that room or any other part of the house it be highly desirable that he should be a unconscious one night after night i set my burglar trap and morning after morning i lock it up in the closet i can not say that i be exactly disappoint that no opportunity offer to test the value of my plan but it do seem a pity that i should take so much trouble for nothing it have be some week since any burglary have be commit in the neighborhood and it be the general opinion that the miscreant have consider this field work out and have transfer they labor to a better-paying place the insult of have be consider unworthy the attention of the knight of the midnight jimmy remain with we but as all we goods and chattel also remain with we we could afford to brook the indignity as the trap cost nothing my wife do not object to my set it every night for the present something might happen she remark and it be just as well to be prepare in more way than one but there be a point upon which she be very positive when george william be old enough to go about the house by himself she say those decanter must not be leave expose upon the table of course i do not expect he to go about the house drinking wine and everything that he find but there be no know what a child in the first moment of he investigative existence may do for myself i become somewhat tired of act my part in this little farce every night and morning but when i have undertake anything of this sort i be slow to drop it it be about three week since i have begin to set my trap when i be awaken in the night by a sudden noise i sit up in bed and as i do so my wife say to I sleepily -- what be that be it thunder there it be again she exclaim start up what a crash it must have strike somewhere i do not answer it be not thunder it be something in the house and it flash into my mind that perhaps my trap have be spring i get out of bed and begin rapidly to dress what be you go to do anxiously ask my wife i be go to see what have happen say i at that moment there be another noise this be like two or three heavy footstep follow by a sudden thump but it be not so loud as the other john cried my wife do not stir a inch it be burglar and she spring out of bed and seize I by the arm i must go down i say but there be really no reason for you be frightened i shall call david and shall carry my pistol so there be really no danger if there be thief in the house they have probably decamp by this time -- that be if they be able to do so for of course they must know that noise would awaken the soundest sleeper my wife look at I and then slowly withdraw she hand from my arm you promise I she say if you find a burglar downstairs in the possession of he sens you will immediately come back to I and george william i promise she and slip on some clothes i go out into the second-story hall i carry no light before i have reach the bottom of the back stair i hear david my man come down to be sure it be he and not a burglar i speak to he in a low voice my pistol raise in case of a unsatisfactory reply i hear that noise sir he whisper and be go down to see about it be you ready if it be thief i whisper i have get the biscuit-beater he reply come on then say i and we go downstairs i have leave no light in the library but there be one there now and it shine through the open door into the hallway we stop and listen there be no sound and then slowly and cautiously we approach the door of the library the scene i beheld astounded I and involuntarily i spring back a step or two so do david but in a instant we see that there be no need of retreat or defense stretch upon the floor not far from the doorway lay a tall man he face upturn to the light of a bull 's - eye lantern which stand by the mantel-piece he eye be shut and it be evident that he be perfectly insensible near by in the wreck of the small table glass and decanter lay another man apparently of heavier build he also be as still as a corpse a little further back half sit on the floor with the upper part of he body rest against the lounge be another man with a black mask over he face be they dead exclaimed david in a undertone of horror no say i they be not dead they have be catch in my trap and i must admit that the consciousness of this create a proud exultation of spirit within I i have overmatch these rascal they be prostrate before I if one of they move david and i could kill he but i do not believe there would be any killing nor any move for the present in a high whisper which could have be hear distinctly all over the house my wife now call to I from the top of the stair what be it she say what have happen i step quickly to the stairway everything be all right i say in a loud distinct voice intend to assure my wife that there be no necessity for caution or alarm i will be with you presently i be glad to hear that nothing be the matter say aunt martha now for the first time open she door i be afraid something have happen but i have business to attend to before i could go upstairs in think over and arrange this plan for the capture of burglar i have carefully consider its various process and have provide against all the contingency i could think of therefore i be not now oblige to deliberate what i should do keep you eye on they say i to david and if one of they move be ready for he the first thing to do be to tie they hand and foot i quickly light a lamp and then take from another shelf of the closet a large coil of strong cotton rope which i have provide for such a occasion as the present now say i to david i will tie they while you stand by to knock over any one of they who attempt to get up the instrument with which david be prepare to carry out my order be a formidable one in the day of my youth my family be very fond of maryland biscuit which owe much of its delicacy to the fact that before bake it be pound and beat by a piece of heavy iron some people use one kind of a beater and some another but we have have make for the purpose a heavy iron club a little over a foot long large and heavy at one end and a handle at the other in my present household maryland biscuit be never make but i have preserve this iron beater as a memento of my boyhood and when the burglary begin in we vicinity i give it to david to keep in he room to be use as a weapon if necessary i do not allow he to have a pistol have a regard for my own safety in a sudden night alarm and nothing could be more formidable in a hand-to-hand encounter than this skull-crushing club i begin with the tall man and rapidly tie he foot together with many twist of the rope and as many knot i then turn he over and tie he elbow behind he in the same secure way i have give so much thought to the best method of secure a man by cord that i do not think this fellow could possibly have release himself when i have finish with he david be obey my order and keep a strict watch on the prostrate man but he emotion of amazement be so great that he could not keep they down what be the matter with they sir he say how do they come so there be no time for talk now i answer i will tell you all about it when the man have be secure i now turn my attention to the man who be partly rest against the lounge i first tie he foot and before let he down to the floor so as to get to he arm i remove he hat and he mask which be make of black muslin i be surprise to see the beardless face of a young and very good-looking man he be well dress and have the general appearance of a person belong to theatrical circle when he arm have be tie i tell david he might lay down he biscuit-beater and help I with the third man who be badly mix up with the _ débris _ of the refreshment we haul he out and tie he up he be rather a short man but very heavy and i could see no sign of he have be hurt by the smash-up he make in fall we now proceed to search the insensible burglar for arm upon the tall man we find a large revolver a heavy billy which seem as if it have see service and a long-bladed knife the stout man carry two double-barrelled pistol and upon one of the finger of he right hand wear a brass ring with a murderous-looking iron protuberance upon it which when drive forward by he powerful arm be probably more dangerous than a billy upon the younger man we find no arm at all and he hip pocket contain nothing but a small handbook on civil engineering i now briefly explain to david the nature of the trap which have catch the burglar he gaze upon I with a face glowing with amaze admiration what a head you have get sir he exclaim i do not believe there be another man in this state who would have think of that and what be you go to do with they now sir hang 'em that be what ought to be do with they the hound all i shall do i answer will be to keep they till daylight and then i shall send word to the sheriff at kennertown and have he send officer for they upon my word exclaim david they be in the worst kind of a box now my wife call I again what in the world be you do down there she call why do not you come upstairs this annoyed I for i be not yet ready to go upstairs i wish to resuscitate these fellow for they stupor be so profound that i begin to fear that perhaps they have take too much of the drug and ought to be bring to they sens as speedily as possible this feeling be due more to my desire that serious injury should not occur to the rascal while in my house than to any concern for they my dear say i step to the bottom of the stair i have some thing to attend to down here which will occupy I a few minute longer then i will come up to you i can not imagine what the thing be she say but i suppose i can wait and she go into she room and close she door after she i now begin to consider what be to be do with the burglar after they have be resuscitate my first impulse be to rid the house of they by carry they out of door and bring they to they sens there but there be a objection to this plan they would be pretty heavy fellow to carry and as it would be absolutely necessary to watch they until they could be give into the charge of the officer of the law i do not want to stay out of door to do this for the night air be raw and chilly and i therefore determine to keep they in the house and as they could be resuscitate better in a sit position they must be set up in some way or other i consult david on the subject you might put 'em up with they back agin the wall sir say he but the dirty beast would spoil the paper i would not keep they in a decent room like this i would haul 'em out into the kitchen anyway but as they be already in the library i decide to let they stay there and to get they as speedily as possible into some position in which they might remain i bethought I of a heavy wooden settle or bench with back and arm which stand on the side piazza with david 's help i bring this into the room and place it with its back to the window now then say i to david we will put they on this bench and i will tie they fast to it we can not be too careful in secure they for if one of they be to get loose even without arm there be no know what trouble he might make well sir say david if i be to handle they at all i would rather have they dead as i hope they be than have they alive but you need not be afraid sir that any one of they will get loose if i see any sign of that i 'll crack the rascal 's skull in a jiffy it require a great deal of tug and lift to get those three man on the bench but we get they there side by side they head hang listlessly some one way some another i then tie each one of they firmly to the bench i have scarcely finish this when i again hear my wife 's voice from the top of the stair if any pipe have burst she call down tell david not to catch the water in the new milk-pans very well i reply i 'll see to it and be rejoice to hear again the shut of the bedroom door i now saturate a sponge with the powerful preparation which dr mark have prepare as a antidote and hold it under the nose of the tall burglar in less than twenty seconds he make a slight quiver in he face as if he be about to sneeze and very soon he do sneeze slightly then he sneeze violently raise he head and open he eye for a moment he gaze blankly before he and then look stupidly at david and at I but in a instant there flash into he face the look of a wild beast he quick glittering eye take in the whole situation at a glance with a furious oath he throw himself forward with such a powerful movement that he nearly lift the bench stop that say david who stand near he with he iron club uplift if you do that again i 'll let you feel this the man look at he with a fiery flash in he eye and then he look at I as i stand hold the muzzle of my pistol within two foot of he face the black and red fade out of he countenance he become pale he glance at he companion bind and helpless he expression now change entirely the fury of the wild beast be succeed by a look of frightened subjection gaze very anxiously at my pistol he say in a voice which though agitate be low and respectful : -- what do this mean what be you go to do will you please turn away the muzzle of that pistol i take no notice of this indication of my steadiness of hand and answer : -- i be go to bring these other scoundrel to they sens and early in the morning the three of you will be on you way to jail where i hope you may remain for the rest of you life if you do not get kill on you way there say david in whose nervous hand the heavy biscuit-beater be almost as dangerous as my pistol the stout man who sit in the middle of the bench be twice as long in revive as have be he companion who watch the operation with intense interest when the burly scoundrel finally become conscious he sit for a few minute gaze at the floor with a silly grin then he raise he head and look first at one of he companion and then at the other gaze for a instant at I and david try to move he foot give a pull at one arm and then at the other and when he find he be bind hard and fast he face turn as red as fire and he open he mouth whether to swear or yell i know not i have already close the door and before the man have utter more than a premonitory sound david have clap the end of he bludgeon against he mouth taste that he say and you know what you will get if you disturb this family with any of you vile cursin ' and swearin ' look here say the tall man suddenly turn to the other with a air of authority keep you mouth shut and do not speak till you be speak to mind that now or these gentleman will make it the worse for you david grin as he take away he club i would gentleman you he say if i could get half a chance to do it the face of the heavy burglar maintain its redness but he keep he mouth shut when the younger man be restore to he sens he full consciousness and power of perception seem to come to he in a instant he eye flash from right to leave he turn deadly white and then merely move he arm and leg enough to make himself aware that he be bind he sit perfectly still and say not a word i now feel that i must go and acquaint my wife with what have happen or otherwise she would be come downstairs to see what be keep I so long david declare that he be perfectly able to keep guard over they and i run upstairs david afterward tell I that as soon as i leave the room the tall burglar endeavor to bribe he to cut they rope and tell he if he be afraid to stay behind after do this he would get he a much better situation than this could possibly be but as david threaten personal injury to the speaker if he utter another word of the kind the tall man say no more but the stout man become very violent and angry threaten all sort of vengeance on my unfortunate man david say he be begin to get angry when the tall man who seem to have much influence over the other fellow order he to keep quiet as the gentleman with the iron club no doubt think he be do right the young fellow never say a word when i tell my wife that i have catch three burglar and they be fast bind in the library she nearly faint and when i have revive she she beg I to promise that i would not go downstairs again until the police have carry away the horrible wretch but i assure she that it be absolutely necessary for I to return to the library she then declare that she would go with I and if anything happen she would share my fate besides she say if they be tie fast so they can not move i should like to see what they look like i never see a burglar i do not wish my wife to go downstairs but as i know there would be no use in object i consent she hastily dress herself make I wait for she and when she leave the room she lock the door on the sleep george william in order that no one should get at he during she absence as we pass the head of the stair the door of my aunt martha 's room open and there she stand completely dress with she bonnet on and a little leather bag in she hand i hear so much talking and so much go up and down stair that i think i have better be ready to do whatever have to be do be it fire no say my wife it be three burglar tie in a bunch in the library i be go down to see they my aunt martha gasp and look as if she be go to sit down on the floor goodness gracious she say if you be go i 'll go too i can not let you go alone and i never do see a burglar i hurry down and leave the two lady on the stair until i be sure everything be still safe and when i see that there have be no change in the state of affair i tell they to come down when my wife and aunt martha timidly look in at the library door the effect upon they and the burglar be equally interesting the lady each give a start and a little scream and huddle themselves close to I and the three burglar gaze at they with face that express more astonishment than any i have ever see before the stout fellow give vent to a smother exclamation and the face of the young man flush but not one of they speak be you sure they be tie fast whisper my aunt martha to I perfectly i answer if i have not be sure i should not have allow you to come down thereupon the lady pick up courage and step further into the room do you and david catch they ask my aunt and how in the world do you do it i 'll tell you all about that another time i say and you have better go upstairs as soon as you two have see what sort of people be these cowardly burglar who sneak or break into the house of respectable people at night and rob and steal and ruin other people 's property with no more conscience or human feeling than be possess by the rat which steal you corn or the polecat which kill you chicken i can scarcely believe say aunt martha that that young man be a real burglar at these word the eye of the fellow speak of glow as he fix they on aunt martha but he do not say a word and the paleness which have return to he face do not change have they tell you who they be ask my wife i have not ask they i say and now do not you think you have better go upstairs it seem to I say aunt martha that those rope must hurt they the tall man now speak indeed they do madam he say in a low voice and very respectful manner they be very tight i tell david to look at all the cord and see if any of they be too tightly draw it be all nonsense sir say he when he have finish the examination not one of the rope be a bit too tight all they want be a chance to pull out they ugly hand of course say aunt martha if it would be unsafe to loosen the knot i would not do it be they to be send to prison yes say i as soon as the day break i shall send down for the police i now hear a slight sound at the door and turn saw alice we maid of the house who be peep in at the door alice be a modest girl and quite pretty i hear the noise and the talk sir she say and when i find the lady have go down to see what it be i think i would come too and where be the cook ask my wife do not she want to see burglar not a bit of it answer alice very emphatically as soon as i tell she what it be she cover up she head with the bedclothes and declare ma'am that she would never get up until they be entirely go out of the house at this the stout man grin i wish you would all cover up you head he say the tall man look at he severely and he say no more david do not move from he post near the three burglar but he turn toward alice and look at she we know that he have tender feeling toward the girl and i think that he do not approve of she be there have they steal anything ask aunt martha they have not have any chance to take anything away i say and my wife remark that whether they have steal anything or not they have make a dreadful mess on the floor and have break the table they should certainly be punish at this she make a motion as if she would leave the room and a anxious expression immediately come on the face of the tall man who have evidently be revolve something in he mind madam he say we be very sorry that we have break you table and that we have damage some of you glass and you carpet i assure you however that nothing of the kind would have happen but for that drugged wine which be doubtless intend for a medicine and not a beverage but weary and chill as we be when we arrive madam we be glad to partake of it suppose it ordinary wine i could not help show a little pride at the success of my scheme the refreshment be intend for fellow of you class and i be very glad you accept it the tall man do not answer I but he again address my wife madam he say if you lady would remain and listen to I a few moment i be sure i would make you aware that there be much to extenuate the apparent offence which i have commit to-night my wife do not answer he but turn to I say smile if he allude to they drinking you wine he need not apologize the man look at she with a expression as if she word have pained he madam he say if you consent to listen to my explanation and the story of this affair i be sure you feeling toward I would not be so harsh now then say my aunt martha if he have a story to tell he ought to be allow to tell it even in a case like this nobody should be judge until he have say what he think he ought to say let we hear he story i laugh any statement he may make i say will probably deserve a much stronger name than story i think that what you say be true remark my wife but still if he have a story to tell i should like to hear it i think i hear david give a little grunt but he be too well breed to say anything very well say i if you choose to sit up and hear he talk it be you affair i shall be oblige to remain here anyway and will not object to anything that will help to pass away the time but these man must not be the only one who be seat david you and alice can clear away that broken table and the rest of the stuff and then we might as well sit down and make ourselves comfortable alice with cloth and brush approach very timidly the scene of the disaster but the younger burglar who be nearest to she gaze upon she with such a gentle and quiet air that she do not seem to be frighten when she and david have put the room in fair order i place two easy-chair for my wife and aunt martha at a moderate distance from the burglar and take another myself a little nearer to they and then tell david to seat himself near the other end of the bench and alice take a chair at a little distance from the lady now then say aunt martha to the burglar i would like very much to hear what any one of you can say in extenuation of have break into a gentleman 's house by night without hesitation the tall man begin he speech he have a long and rather lean close-shaven face which at present bear the expression of a undertaker conduct a funeral although it be my aunt who have show the greatest desire to hear he story he address himself to my wife i think he imagine that she be the more influential person of the two madam say he i be glad of the opportunity of give you and you family a idea of the difficulty and misery which beset a large class of you fellow-being of whom you seldom have any chance of know anything at all but of whom you hear all sort of the most misleading account now i be a poor man i have suffer the greatest misery that poverty can inflict i be here suspect of have commit a crime it be possible that i may be put to considerable difficulty and expense in prove my innocence i should not wonder i interrupted to this remark he pay no attention consider all this he continue you may not suppose madam that as a boy i be bring up most respectably and properly my mother be a religious woman and my father be a boat-builder i be send to school and my mother have often tell I that i be a good scholar but she die when i be about sixteen and i be sure have this not happen i should never have be even suspect of break the law of my country not long after she death my father appear to lose interest in he business and take to rowing about the river instead of building boat for other people to row very often he go out at night and i use to wonder why he should care to be on the water in the darkness and sometimes in the rain one evening at supper he say to I : ` thoma you ought to know how to row in the dark as well as in the daytime i be go up the river to-night and you can come with I ' it be about my ordinary bedtime when we take a boat with two pair of oar and we pull up the river about three mile above the city what city i ask the city where i be bear sir he say and the name of which i must be excuse from mention for reason connect with my only survive parent there be house on the river bank but they be not very near each other some of they have light in they but most of they be dark as it must have be after eleven o'clock before one of they my father stop rowing for a moment and look at it pretty hard it seem to be all dark but as we pull on a little i see a light in the back of the house my father say nothing but we keep on though pull very easy for a mile or two and then we turn and float down with the tide ` you might as well rest thoma ' say he ` for you have work pretty hard ' we float slowly for the tide be just begin to turn and when we get near the house which i mention i notice that there be no light in it when we be about opposite to it father suddenly look up and say not speak very loud ` by george if that be not williamson green 's house i be not thinking of it when we row up and pass it without take notice of it i be sorry for that for i want to see williamson and now i expect he have go to bed ' ` who be mr green ' i ask ` he be a old friend of mine ' say my father ` and i have not see he for some little while now about four month ago he borrow of I a sextant quadrant and chronometer they be instrument i take from old captain barney in payment of some work i do for he i be not usin ' they and williamson have buy a catboat and be study navigation but he have give up that fad now and have promise I over and over to send I back my instrument but he have never do it if i would think of it i would have stop and get 'em of he but i do not think and now i expect he have go to bed however i 'll row in shore and see perhaps he be up yet ' you see ma'am say the speaker to my wife i be tellin ' you all these particulars because i be very anxious you should understand exactly how everything happen on this night which be the turning-point of my life very good say aunt martha we want to hear all the particulars well then continue the burglar we pull up to a stone wall which be at the bottom of green 's place and make fast and father he get out and go up to the house after a good while he come back and say that he be pretty sure williamson green have go to bed and as it would not do to waken people up from they sleep to ask they for nautical instrument they have borrow he sit down for a minute on the top of the wall and then he slap he knee not make much noise though ` by george ' he say ` a idea have just strike I i can play the prettiest trick on williamson that ever be play on mortal man those instrument be all in a box lock up and i know just where he keep it i see it not long ago when i go to he house to talk about a yacht he want build they be on a table in the comer of he bedroom he be take I through the house to show I the improvement he have make and he say to I : -- ` martin there be you instrument i will not trouble you to take they with you because they be heavy and you be not go straight home but i 'll bring they to you day after to-morrow when i shall be goin ' you way ` now then ' say my father ` the trick i be thinkin ' of play on williamson be this : i would like to take that box of instrument out of he room without he know it and carry they home have the boat here convenient and then in a day or two to write to he and tell he i must have 'em because i have a special use for 'em of course he 'll be awfully cut up not have they to send back and when he come down to my place to talk about it and after hear all he have to say i 'll show he the box he 'll be the most dumbfoundedest man in this state and if i do not choose to tell he he 'll never know to he die day how i get that box and if he lie awake at night try to think how i get it it will serve he right for keep my property from I so long ' ` but father ' say i ` if the people have go to bed you can not get into the house to play he you trick ' ` that can be manage ' say he ` i be rather old for climb myself but i know a way by which you thoma can get in easy enough at the back of the house be a trellis with a grape-vine run over it and the top of it be just under one of the second-story window you can climb up that trellis thoma and lift up that window-sash very carefully so be not to make no noise and get in then you 'll be in a back room with a door right in front of you which open into mr and mr green 's bedroom there be always a little night lamp burning in it by which you can see to get about in the corner on you right as you go into the room be a table with my instrument-box standing on it the box be pretty heavy and there be a handle on top to carry it by you need not be afraid to go in for by this time they be both sound asleep and you can pick up the box and walk out as gingerly as a cat have of course take you shoe off before you go in then you can hand the box out the back window to I -- i can climb up high enough to reach it -- and you can scuttle down and we 'll be off have the best rig on williamson green that i ever hear of in my bear day ' i be a very active boy use to climb and all that sort of thing and i have no doubt that i could easily get into the house but i do not fancy my father 's scheme ` suppose ' i say ` that mr williamson green should wake up and see I what could i say how could i explain my situation ' ` you need not say anything ' say my father ` if he wake up blow out the light and scoot if you happen to have the box in you hand drop it out the back window and then slip down after it he will not see we but if he do he can not catch we before we get to the boat but if he should however i 'll have to explain the matter to he and the joke will be against I but i shall get my instrument which be the main point after all ' i do not argue with my father for he be a man who hate to be differ with and i agree to help he carry out he little joke we take off we shoe and walk quietly to the back of the house my father stand below and i climb up the trellis under the back window which he point out the window-sash be down all but a little crack to let in air and i raise it so slowly and gently that i make no noise then without any trouble at all i get into the room i find myself in a moderate-sized chamber into which a faint light come from a door opposite the window have be several hour out in the night my eye have become so accustomed to darkness that this light be comparatively strong and i could see everything look about I my eye fall on a little bedstead on which lay one of the most beautiful infant i ever behold in my life its golden hair lay in ringlet upon the pillow its eye be close but its soft cheek have in they a rosy tinge which almost equal the color of its dainty little lip slightly open as it softly breathe and dream at this point i see my wife look quickly at the bedroom key she have in she hand i know she be think of george william i stand entranced continue the burglar gaze upon this babe for i be very fond of child but i remember that i must not waste time and step softly into the next room there i beheld mr and mr williamson green in bed both fast asleep the gentleman breathe a little hard in a corner just where my father tell I i should find it stand the box upon the table but i could not immediately pick it up and depart the beautiful room in which i find myself be a revelation to I until that moment i have not know that i have taste and sympathy of a higher order than might have be expect of the youthful son of a boat-builder those artistic furnishings arouse within a love of the beautiful which i do not know i possess the carpet the wall the picture the hanging in the window the furniture the ornament -- everything in fact impressed I with such a delight that i do not wish to move or go away into my young soul there come a longing ` oh ' i say to myself ` that my parent have belong to the same social grade as that worthy couple repose in that bed and oh that i in my infancy have be as beautiful and as likely to be so carefully nurture and culture as that sweet babe in the next room ' i almost heave a sigh as i thought of the difference between these surroundings and my own but i check myself it would not do to make a noise and spoil my father 's joke there be a great many thing in that luxurious apartment which it would have delighted I to look upon and examine but i forbore i wish i would be there say the stout man there would not have be any forbearin ' the speaker turn sharply upon he do not you interrupt I again he say angrily then instantly resume he deferential tone he continue the story but i have come there by the command of my parent and this command must be obey without trifling or loss of time my father do not approve of trifling or loss of time i move quietly toward the table in the corner on which stand my father 's box i be just about to put my hand upon it when i hear a slight movement behind I i give a start and glance backward it be mr williamson green turn over in he bed what if he should awake he back be now toward I and my impulse be to fly and leave everything behind I but my father have order I to bring the box and he expect he order to be obey i have often be convince of that i stand perfectly motionless for a minute or so and when the gentleman recommence he regular and very audible breathing i feel it safe to proceed with my task take hold of the box i find it be much heavier than i expect it to be but i move gently away with it and pass into the back room there i could not refrain from stop a moment by the side of the sleep babe upon whose cherub-like face the light of the night lamp dimly shine the little child be still sleep sweetly and my impulse be to stop and kiss it but i know that this would be wrong the infant might awake and utter a cry and my father 's joke be spoil i move to the open window and with some trouble and i think without any noise i succeed in get out upon the trellis with the box under my arm the descent be awkward but my father be a tall man and reach upward relieved I of my burden before i get to the ground ' i do not remember it be so heavy ' he whisper ` or i should have give you a rope to lower it down by if you have drop it and spoil my instrument and make a lot of noise besides i should have be angry enough ' i be very glad my father be not angry and follow he over the greensward we quickly reach the boat where the box be stow away under the bow to keep it from injury we push off as quietly as possible and row swiftly down the river when we have go about a mile i suddenly drop my oar with a exclamation of dismay ` what be the matter ' cry my father ` oh i have do a dreadful thing ' i say ` oh father i must go back ' i be sorry to say that at this my father swear ` what do you want to go back for ' he say ` just to think of it i have leave open the window in which that beautiful child be sleep if it should take cold and die from the damp air of the river blow upon it i should never forgive myself oh if i have only think of climb up the trellis again and pull down that sash i be sure i could go back and do it without make the least noise ' my father give a grunt but what the grunt mean i do not know and for a few moment he be silent and then he say : -- ` thoma you can not go back the distance be too great the tide be against we and it be time that you and i be both in we bed nothing may happen to that baby but attend to my word now if any harm should come to that child it will go hard with you if it should die it would be of no use for you to talk about practical joke you would be hold responsible for its death i be go to say to you that it might be as well for you not to say anything about this little venture until i have see how williamson green take the joke some people get angry with very little reason although i hardly believe he be that sort of a man but now thing be different he think all the world of that child which be the only one they have get and if you want to stay outside of jail or the house of refuge i warn you never to say a word of where you have be this night ' with this he begin to row again and i follow he example but with a very heavy heart all that night i dream of the little child with the damp night wind blow in upon it do you ever hear if it catch cold ask aunt martha no reply the burglar i never do i mention the matter to my father and he say that he have great fear upon the subject for although he have write to williamson green ask he to return the instrument he have not see he or hear from he and he be afraid that the child have die or be dangerously sick shortly after that my father send I on a little trip to the long island coast to collect some bill from people for whom he have do work he give I money to stay a week or two at the seashore say that the change would do I good and it be while i be away on this delightful holiday that a event occur which have a most disastrous effect upon my future life my father be arrest for burglary it appear -- and i can not tell you how shocked i be when i discover the truth -- that the box which i have carry away do not contain nautical instrument but be fill with valuable plate and jewel my unfortunate father hear from a man who have be discharge from the service of the family whose house he have visit -- whose name by the way be not green -- where the box contain the valuable mention be always place at night and he have also receive accurate information in regard to the situation of the room and the best method of gain access to they i believe that some arrangement have be make between my father and this discharge servant in regard to a division of the contents of the box and it be on account of a disagreement on this subject that the man become very angry and after pocket what my father think be he fair share he depart to unknown region leave behind a note to the police which lead to my father 's arrest that be a mean trick say aunt martha the burglar look at she gratefully in the lower sphere of life madam such thing often happen some of the plate and jewel be find in my father 's possession and he be speedily try and sentence to a long term of imprisonment and now can you imagine lady say the tall burglar apparently have become satisfied to address himself to aunt martha as well as my wife the wretched position in which i find myself i be upbraid as the son of a thief i soon find myself without home without occupation and alas without good reputation i be careful not to mention my voluntary connection with my father 's crime for fear that should i do so i might be compel to make a statement which might increase the severity of he punishment for this reason i do not dare to make inquiry concern the child in whom i have take such a interest and whose little life i have perhaps imperil i never know lady whether that infant grow up or not but i alas grow up to a life of hardship and degradation it would be impossible for person in you sphere of life to understand what i now be oblige to suffer suitable employment i could not obtain because i be the son of a burglar with a father in the state prison it be of no use for I to apply for employment at any respectable place of business i labor at one thing and another sometimes engaging in the most menial employment i also have be educate and bring up by my dear mother for a very different career sometimes i manage to live fairly well sometimes i suffer always i suffer from the stigma of my father 's crime always in the eye of the community in which i live -- a community i be sorry to say incapable as a rule of make correct judgment in delicate case like these -- i be look upon as belong to the rank of the dishonest it be a hard lot and sometimes almost impossible to bear up under i have speak at length lady in order that you may understand my true position and i wish to say that i have never feel the crush weight of my father 's disgrace more deeply than i feel it last evening this man nod toward the stout burglar come to I shortly after i have eat my supper which happen to be a frugal one and say to I : -- ` thomas i have some business to attend to to-night in which you can help I if you choose i know you be a good mechanic ' ` if it be work that will pay I ' i answer ' i should be very glad to do it for i be greatly in need of money ' ` it will pay ' say he and i agree to assist he as we be walk to the station as the business to be attend to be out of town this man whose name be jame barlow talk to I in such a way that i begin to suspect that he intend to commit a burglary and openly charge he with this evil purpose ` you may call it burglary or anything else you please ' say he ` property be very unequally divide in this world and it be my business in life to make wrong thing right as far as i can i be go to the house of a man who have a great deal more than he need and i have not anything like as much as i need and so i intend to take some of he overplus -- not very much for when i leave he house he will still be a rich man and i 'll be a poor one but for a time my family will not starve ' ` argue as you please jame barlow ' i say ` what you be go to do be nothing less than burglary ' ` of course it be ' say he ` but it be all right all the same there be a lot of people thoma who be not as particular about these thing as they use to be and there be no use for you to seem better than you friend and acquaintance now to show there be not so many bigot as there use to be there be a young man go to meet we at the station who be greatly interested in the study of social problem he be go along with we just to look into this sort of thing and study it it be impossible for he to understand people of we class or do anything to make they condition better if he do not thoroughly investigate they method of life and action he be go along just as a student nothing more and he may be down on the whole thing for all i know he pay I five dollar for the privilege of accompany I and whether he like it or not be he business i want you to go along as a mechanic and if you conscience will not let you take any share in the profit i 'll just pay you for you time ' ` jame barlow ' say i ' i be go with you but for a purpose far different from that you desire i shall keep by you side and if i can dissuade you from commit the crime you intend i shall do so but if i fail in this and you deliberately break into a house for purpose of robbery i shall arouse the inmate and frustrate you crime ' now jame barlow say he turn to the stout man with a severe expression on he strongly marked face be not what i have say perfectly true do you not say to I every word which i have just repeat the stout man look at the other in a very odd way he face seem to broaden and redden and he merely close he eye as he promptly answer : -- that be just what i say every blast word of it you have tell it fair and square leavin ' off nothin ' and puttin ' in nothin ' you have tell the true fact out and out up and down without a break now lady continue the tall man you see my story be corroborate and i will conclude it by say that when this house in spite of my protest have be open i enter with the other with the firm intention of step into a hallway or some other suitable place and announce in a loud voice that the house be about to be rob as soon as i find the family arouse and my purpose accomplish i intend to depart as quickly as possible for on account of the shadow cast upon I by my father 's crime i must never be find even in the vicinity of criminal action but as i be pass through this room i could not resist the invitation of barlow to partake of the refreshment which we see upon the table i be faint from fatigue and insufficient nourishment it seem a very little thing to taste a drop of wine in a house where i be about to confer a great benefit i yield to the temptation and now i be punish partaking even that little which do not belong to I i find myself place in my present embarrassing position you be right there say i it must be embarrassing but before we have any more reflection there be some practical point about which i wish you would inform I how do that wicked man mr barlow i think you call he get into this house the tall man look at I for a moment as if in doubt what he should say and then he expression of mingled hopelessness and contrition change into one of earnest frankness i will tell you sir exactly he say i have no wish to conceal anything i have long want to have a opportunity to inform occupant of house especially those in the suburb of the insufficiency of they window fastening familiar with mechanic device as i be and accustom to think of such thing the precaution of householder sometimes move I to laughter you outer door front and back be of heavy wood chained lock and bolt often double lock and bolt but you lower window be close in the first place by the lightest kind of shutter which be very seldom fasten at all and in the second place by a little contrivance connect the two sash which be hold in place by a couple of baby screw if these contrivance be of the best kind and can not be open from the outside with a knife-blade or piece of tin the burglar put a chisel or jimmy under the lower sash and gently press it upward when the baby screw come out as easily as if they be baby ' milk-teeth not for a moment do the burglar trouble himself about the front door with its lock and chain and bolt he go to the window with its baby screw which might as well be leave open as shut for all the hindrance it be to he entrance and if he meddle with the door at all it be simply to open it from the inside so that when he be ready to depart he may do so easily but all that do not apply to my window i say they be not fasten that way no sir say the man you lower shutter be solid and strong as you door this be right for if shutter be intend to obstruct entrance to a house they should be as strong as the door when jame barlow first reach this house he try he jimmy on one of the shutter in this main building but he could not open it the heavy bolt inside be too strong for he then he try another near by with the same result you will find the shutter splintered at the bottom then he walk to the small addition at the back of the house where the kitchen be locate here the shutter be smaller and of course the inside bolt be smaller everything in harmony builder be so careful now-a-day to have everything in harmony when barlow try he jimmy on one of these shutter the bolt resist for a time but its harmonious proportion cause it to bend and it be soon draw from its staple and the shutter open and of course the sash be open as i tell you sash be open well say i shutter and sash of mine shall never be open in that way again it be with that object that i speak to you say the tall man i wish you to understand the fault of you fastening and any information i can give you which will better enable you to protect you house i shall be glad to give as a slight repayment for the injury i may have help to do to you in the way of broken glass and spoil carpet i have make window fastening a especial study and if you employ I for the purpose i 'll guarantee that i will put you house into a condition which will be absolutely burglar proof if i do not do this to you satisfaction i will not ask to be pay a cent we will not consider that proposition now i say for you may have other engagement which would interfere with the propose job i be about to say that i think we have enough of this sort of story when aunt martha interrupt I it seem to I she say speak to the tall burglar that you have instinct and perhaps conviction of what be right and proper but it be plain that you allow yourself to be lead and influence by unprincipled companion you should avoid even the outskirts of evil you may not know that the propose enterprise be a bad one but you should not take part in it unless you know that it be a good one in such case you should be rigid the man turn toward my aunt and look steadfastly at she and as he gaze he face grow sadder and sadder rigid he repeat that be hard yes i remark that be one of the meaning of the word pay no attention to I he continue : -- madam say he with a deep pathos in he voice no one can be better aware than i be that i have make many mistake in the course of my life but that quality on which i think i have reason to be satisfy with myself be my rigidity when i know a thing be wrong there occur to I now a instance in my career which will prove to you what i say i know a man by the name of spotkirk who have invent a liniment for the cure of boil he make a great success with he liniment which he call boilene and at the time i speak of he be a very rich man one day spotkirk come to I and tell I he want I to do a piece of business for he for which he would pay I twenty-five dollar i be glad to hear this for i be greatly in need of money and i ask he what it be he want I to do ` you know timothy barker ' say he ` well timothy and i have have a misunderstanding and i want you to be a referee or umpire between we to set thing straight ' ` very good ' say i ` and what be the point of difference ' ` i 'll put the whole thing before you ' say he ` for of course you must understand it or you can not talk properly to timothy now you see in the manufacture of my boilene i need a great quantity of good yellow gravel and timothy barker have get a gravel pit of that kind two year ago i agree with timothy that he should furnish I with all the gravel i should want for one-eighth of one per cent of the profit on the boilene we do not sign no papers for which i be sorry but that be the agreement and now timothy say that one-eighth of one per cent be not enough he have go wild about it and actually want ten per cent and threaten to sue I if i do not give it to he ' ` be you oblige to have gravel would not something else do for you purpose ' ` there be nothing as cheap ' say spotkirk ` you see i have to have lot and lot of it every day i fill a great tank with the gravel and let water onto it this soak through the gravel and come out a little pipe in the bottom of the tank of a beautiful yellow color sometimes it be too dark and then i have to thin it with more water ' ` then you bottle it ' i say ` yes ' say spotkirk ` then there be all the expense and labor of bottle it ' ` then you put nothing more into it ' say i ` what more go into it before it be cork ' say spotkirk ` be my business that be my secret and nobody 's be able to find it out people have have boilene analyze by chemist but they can not find out the hidden secret of its virtue there be one thing that everybody who have use it do know and that be that it be a sure cure for boil if apply for two or three day accord to direction and at the proper stage the boil be sure to disappear as a proof of its merit i have sell seven hundred and forty-eight thousand bottle this year ' ` at a dollar a bottle ' say i ` that be the retail price ' say he ` now then mr spotkirk ' say i ` it will not be easy to convince timothy barker that one-eighth of one per cent be enough for he i suppose he haul he gravel to you factory ' ` haul 's get nothing to do with it ' say he ` gravel be only ten cent a load anywhere and if i choose i could put my factory right in the middle of a gravel pit timothy barker have nothing to complain of ` but he know you be make a lot of money ' say i ` and it will be a hard job to talk he over mr spotkirk it be worth every cent of fifty dollar ' ` now look here ' say he ` if you get barker to sign a paper that will suit I i 'll give you fifty dollar i would rather do that than have he bring a suit if the matter come up in the court those rascally lawyer will be try to find out what i put into my boilene and that sort of thing would be sure to hurt my business it will not be so hard to get a hold on barker if you go to work the right way you can just let he understand that you know all about that robbery at bonsall 's clothing-store where he keep the steal goods in he barn cover up with hay for nearly a week it would be a good thing for timothy barker to understand that somebody else beside I know about that business and if you bring it in right it will fetch he around sure ' i keep quiet for a minute or two and then i say : -- ` mr spotkirk this be a important business i can not touch it under a hundred dollar ' he look hard at I and then he say : -- ` do it right and a hundred dollar be yours ' after that i go to see timothy barker and have a talk with he timothy be boil over and consider himself the worst-cheated man in the world he have only lately find out how spotkirk make he boilene and what a big sale he have for it and he be determine to have more of the profit ` just look at it ' he shout ` when spotkirk have wash out my gravel it be worth more than it be before and he sell it for twenty-five cent a load to put on gentleman 's place even out of that he make a hundred and fifty per cent profit ' i talk a good deal more with timothy barker and find out a good many thing about spotkirk 's dealings with he and then in a off-hand manner i mention the matter of the steal goods in he barn just as if i have know all about it from the very first at this timothy stop shout and become as meek as a mouse he say nobody be as sorry as he be when he find the goods conceal in he barn have be steal and that if he have know it before the thief take they away he should have inform the authority and then he go on to tell I how he get so poor and so hard up by give he whole time to digging and haul gravel for spotkirk and neglect he little farm that he do not know what be go to become of he and he family if he could not make better term with spotkirk for the future and he ask I very earnestly to help he in this business if i could now then i set myself to work to consider this business here be a rich man oppress a poor one and here be this rich man offering I one hundred dollar -- which in my eye be a regular fortune -- to help he get thing so fix that he could keep on oppress the poor one now then here be a chance for I to show my principle here be a chance for I to show myself what you madam call rigid and rigid i be i just set that dazzling one hundred dollar aside much as i want it much as i actually need it i would not look at it or think of it i just say to myself ` if you can do any good in this matter do it for the poor man ' and i do do it for timothy barker with he poor wife and seven child only two of they old enough to help he in the gravel pit i go to spotkirk and i talk to he and i let he see that if timothy barker show up the boilene business as he threaten to do it would be a bad day for the spotkirk family he try hard to talk I over to he side but i be rigid madam i be rigid and the business end in my get seven per cent of the profit of boilene for that poor man timothy barker and he large family and they domestic prosperity be entirely due -- i say it without hesitation -- to my effort on they behalf and to my rigidity in stand up for the poor against the rich of course i here remark you do not care to mention anything about the money you squeeze out of timothy barker by means of you knowledge that he have be a receiver of steal goods and i suppose the boilene man give you something to get the percentage bring down from ten per cent to seven the tall burglar turn and look at I with a air of saddened resignation of course say he it be of no use for a man in my position to endeavor to set himself right in the eye of one who be prejudice against he my hope be that those present who be not prejudice will give my statement the consideration they deserve which they certainly will do i continue turn to my wife and aunt martha as you have hear this fine story i think it be time for you to retire i do not wish to retire promptly return aunt martha i be never more awake in my life and could not go asleep if i try what we have hear may or may not be true but it furnish subject for reflection -- serious reflection i wish very much to hear what that man in the middle of the bench have to say for himself i be sure he have a story yes ma'am say the stout man with animation i have get one and i would like nothin ' better than to tell it to you if you 'll give I a little somethin' to wet my lip with -- a little beer or whiskey and water or anything you have convenient whiskey and water say aunt martha with severity i should think not it seem to I you have have all the intoxicating liquor in this house that you would want but i do not think you be the kind of person who have doctor the liquor this be the first gentleman 's house where i ever find anything of that kind the worse for the gentleman i remark the man grunt well ma'am he say call it anything you please -- milk cider or if you have nothin ' else i 'll take water i can not talk without somethin' soaky my wife rise if we be to listen to another story she say i want something to keep up my strength i shall go into the dining-room and make some tea and aunt martha can give these man some of that if she like the lady now leave the room follow by alice presently they call I and leave the burglar in charge of the vigilant david i go to they i find they make tea i have be upstairs to see if george william be all right and now i want you to tell I what you think of that man 's story say my wife i do not think it a story at all say i i call it a lie a story be a relation which purport to be fiction no matter how much like truth it may be and be intend to be receive as fiction a lie be a false statement make with the intention to deceive and that be what i believe we have hear to-night i agree with you exactly say my wife it may be say aunt martha that the man 's story be true there be some thing about it which make I think so but if he be really a criminal he must have have trial and temptation which lead he into he present mode of life we should consider that i have be study he i say and i think he be a bear rascal who ought to have be hang long ago my aunt look at I john she say if you believe people be bear criminal they ought to be execute in they infancy it could be do painlessly by electricity and society would be the gainer although you lawyer would be the loser but i do not believe in you doctrine if the child of the poor be properly bring up and educate fewer of they would grow to be criminal i do not think this man suffer for want of education say my wife he use very good language that be one of the first thing that lead I to suspect he it be not likely that son of boat-builder speak so correctly and express themselves so well of course i can not alter you opinion say aunt martha but the story interested I and i very much wish to hear what that other man have to say for himself very well say i you shall hear it but i must drink my tea and go back to the prisoner and i say aunt martha will take some tea to they they may be bad man but they must not suffer i have be in the library but a few moment when aunt martha enter follow by alice who bear a tray contain three very large cup of tea and some biscuit now then say aunt martha to I if you will untie they hand i will give they some tea at these word each burglar turn he eye on I with a quick glance i laugh hardly say i i would not be willing to undertake the task of tie they up again unless indeed they will consent to drink some more of my wine which we will not do say the middle burglar and that be flat then they must drink this tea with they hand tie say aunt martha in a tone of reproachful resignation and take a cup from the tray she approach the stout man and hold it up to he lip at this act of extreme kindness we be all amuse even the burglar 's companion smile and david so far forget himself as to burst into a laugh which however he quickly check the stout burglar however see nothing to laugh at he drink the tea and never draw breath until the cup be empty i forget say my aunt as she remove the cup from he lip to ask you whether you take much or little sugar do not make no difference to I answer the man tea be not malt liquor it be poor stuff any way and it do not matter to I whether it be get sugar in it or not but it be moistenin ' and that be what i want now madam i 'll just say to you if ever i break into a room where you be sleepin ' i 'll see that you do not come to no harm even if you sit up in bed and holler thank you say aunt martha but i hope you will never again be concern in that sort of business he grin that depend on circumstance say he aunt martha now offer the tall man some tea but he thank she very respectfully and decline the young man also say that he do not care for tea but that if the maid -- look at alice -- would give he a glass of water he would be oblige this be the first time he have speak he voice be low and of a please tone david 's face grow dark and we could see that he object to this service from alice i will give he the water myself say aunt martha this she do and i notice that the man 's thirst be very soon satisfy when david have be refresh and biscuit refuse by the burglar who could not very well eat they with they hand tie we all sit down and the stout man begin he story i give it as he tell it omit some coarse and rough expression and a good deal of slang which would be unintelligible to the general reader there be no use say the burglar for I to try and make any of you believe that i be a pious gentleman under a cloud for i know i do not look like it and would not be likely to make out a case at this the tall man look at he very severely i do not mean to say he continue that my friend here try anything like that every word he say be perfectly true as i could personally testify if i be call upon the stand and what i be goin ' to tell you be likewise solid fact my father be a cracksman and a first-rate one too he bring I up to the business beginning when i be very small i do not remember havin ' any mother so i 'll leave she out my old man be very particular he like to see thing do right one day i be with he and we see a tinner nail a new leader or tin water-spout to the side of a house ` look here young man ' say dad ` you be makin ' a pretty poor job of that you do not put in enough nail and they be not half drive in supposin ' there be a fire in that house some night and the family have to come down by the spout and you nail would give way and they would break they neck what would you think then and i can tell you what it be young man i can appear ag ` in you for do poor work ' the tinner grumble but he use more nail and drive 'em tight dad and I standin ' by a ' look at he one rainy night not long after this dad take I out with he and we stop in front of this house ` now bobbie ' say he ' i want you to climb into that open second-story window and then slip down stair and open the front door for I the family 's at dinner ' ` how be i to get up dad ' say i ` oh you can go up the spout ' say he ` i 'll warrant that it will hold you i have see to it that it be put on good and strong ' i try it and as far as i can remember i never go up a safer spout and you open the front door ask aunt martha indeed i do ma'am say the burglar you would not catch I makin ' no mistake in that line after a while i get too heavy to climb spout and i take to the regular business and do well at it too do you mean to say asked aunt martha that you willingly and premeditatedly become a thief and midnight robber that be what i be ma'am say he i do not make no bone about it i be a number one double-extra back-springed copper-fastened burglar with all the attachment and noiseless treadle that be what i be and no mistake there be all kind of business in this world and there be get to be people to work at every one of 'em and when a fellow take any particular line he business be to do it well that be my motto when i break into a house i make it a point to clean it out first-class and not to carry away no trash nuther of course i have have my up and my downs like other people -- preacher and doctor and storekeeper -- they all have they and i guess the downs be more amusin ' than the up at least to outsider i have just happen to think of one of they and i 'll let you have it there be a man i know name jerry hammond that be a contractor and sometimes he have pretty big job on hand buildin ' or road-makin ' or somethin' or other he would contract to do anything would jerry no matter whether he would ever do it before or not i get to know he time and season for collect money and i lay for he abominable meanness exclaim my wife it be all business say the stout man quite unabashed you do not catch a doctor refusin ' to practice on a friend or a lawyer nuther and in we line of business it be the same thing it be about the end of October nigh four year ago that i find out that jerry have a lot of money on hand he have be collectin ' it from different party and have get home too late in the day to put it in the bank so say i to myself this be you time old fellow and you would better make hay while the sun shine i be a little afraid to crack jerry 's house by myself for he be a strong old fellow so i get a man name putty henderson to go along with I putty be a big fellow and very handy with a jimmy but he be awful contrary-minded and he would not agree to clean out jerry until i promise to go half with he this be not fair for it be not he job and a quarter would have be lot for he but there be not no use arguin ' and along we go and about one o'clock we be standin ' alongside jerry 's bed where he be fast asleep he be a bachelor and live pretty much by himself i give he a punch to waken he up for we would make up we mind that that be the way to work this job it would not pay we to go around huntin ' for jerry 's money he be such a sharp old fellow it be six to four we would never find it he sit up in bed with a jump like a hop-toad and look first at one and then at the other of we we both have mask on and it be not puzzlin ' to guess what we be there fur ` jerry hammond ' say i speakin ' rather rough and husky ` we know that you have get a lot o ' money in this house and we have come fur it we mean business and there be no use foolin ' you can give it to we quiet and easy and keep a whole head on you shoulder or we 'll lay you out ready fur a wake and help ourselves to the fund and now you pay you money and you can take you choice how you do it there be nothin ' shabby about we but we mean business do not we pard ' -- ` that be so ' say putty ` look here ' say jerry jest as cool as if he have be sittin ' outside on he own curbstone ' i know you two man and no mistake you be tommy randall and you be putty henderson so you might as well take off they mask ' -- ` which i be glad to do ' say i ` for i hate 'em ' and i put mine in my pocket and putty he take off he excuse I say aunt martha interrupt at this point but when mr hammond mention the name of tommy randall to whom do he refer i can explain that madam say the tall burglar quickly this man by he criminal course of life have get himself into a good many scrape and be frequently oblige to change he name since i accidentally become acquaint with he he have have several alias and i think that he very often forget that he real name be james barlow that be so say the stout man there never be a more correct person than this industrious and unfortunate man sittin ' by I i be dreadful forgetful and sometimes i disremember what belong to I and what do not name the same as other thing ` well now jerry ' say i ` you need not think you be goin ' to make anythin ' by knowin ' we you have get to fork over you cash all the same and if you think to make anything by peachin ' on we after we have clear out and leave you peaceful in you bed you be mistake so far as i be concerned for i have make the track clear to get out of this town before daybreak and i do not know when i 'll come back this place be gettin ' a little too hot for I and you be my concludin ' exercise ' jerry he sit still for a minute considerin ' he be not no fool and he know that there be not no use gettin ' scared nor cussin ' nor hollerin ' what be more he know that we be there to get he money and if he do not fork it over he would get himself lay out and that be worse than losin ' money any day ` now boy say he ` i 'll tell you what i 'll do i 'll make you a offer a fair and square offer what money i have get i 'll divide even with you each of we takin ' a third and i 'll try to make up what i lose out of my next contract now nothin ' could be no squarer than that ' -- ` how much money have you get jerry ' say i ` that be the first thing to know ' -- ` i have get thirty-one hundred dollar even ' say he ` and that will be one thousand and thirty-three dollar and thirty-three cent apiece i have get bill to pay to-morrow for lumber and brick and my third will pay 'em if i do not i 'll go to piece you do not want to see I break up business do you ' -- ` now jerry ' say i ` that will not do you have not get enough to divide into three part putty and I agree to go half with what we get out of you and when i lay out a piece of business i do not make no change half of that money be for I and half be for putty so just hand it out and do not let 's have no more jabberin '' jerry he look at I pretty hard and then say he : ` you be about the close-fisted and meanest man i ever meet with here i offer you a third part of my money and all you have get to do be to take it and go away peaceable i would be willin ' to bet two to one that it be more than you expect to get and yet you be not satisfy now i 'll be hang if i be go to do business with you ' -- ` you can be hang if you like ' say i ` but you 'll do the business all the same ' -- ` no i will not ' say he and he turn to putty henderson ` now putty ' say he ` you have get a pile more sense that this pal of yourn and i be goin ' to see if i can not do business with you now you and I together can lick this tommy randall just as easy as not and if you 'll help I do it i 'll not only divide the money with you but i 'll give you fifty dollar extra so that instead of fifteen hundred and fifty dollar -- that be all he would give you if he do not cheat you -- you 'll have sixteen hundred and i 'll have fifteen hundred instead of the thousand and thirty-three dollar which i would have have leave if my first offer have be take so putty what do you say to that ' now putty he must have be a little sore with I on account of the argument we would have about dividin ' and he be mighty glad besides to get the chance of makin ' fifty dollar extry and so he say it be all right and he would agree then i think it be about time for I to take in some of my sail and say i : ` jerry that be a pretty good joke and you can take my hat as soon as i get a new one but of course i do not mean to be hard on you and if you really have bill to pay to-morrow i 'll take a third and putty 'll take another and we 'll go away peaceful ' -- ` no you will not ' sing out jerry and with that he jump out of bed right at I and putty henderson he come at I from the other side and between the two they give I the worst lickin ' i ever get in my bear day and then they drag I down stair and kick I out the front door and i have hardly time to pick myself up before i see a policeman about a block off and if he have not be a fat one he would have I sure it would not have be pleasant for i be a good deal want about that time so you see lady and gent that it be true what i say -- thing do not always go right in we line of business no more than any other one i think you be serve exactly right say aunt martha and i wonder such a experience do not induce you to reform it do ma'am it do say the burglar i make a vow that night that if ever again i have to call in any one to help I in business of that kind i would not go pard with he i would pay he so much for the job and i would take the risk and i have stick to it but even that do not always work luck sometimes go ag ` in ' a man even when he be work by himself i remember a thing of that kind that be beastly hard on I a gentleman employ I to steal he daughter what exclaim my wife and aunt martha steal he own daughter what do you mean by that that be what it be say the stout burglar no more nor less i be recommend to the gent as a reliable party for that sort of thing and i meet he to talk it over and then he tell I just how the case stand he and he wife be separate and the daughter about eleven year old have be give to she by the court and she put it into a boardin ' school and the gent he be goin ' to europe and he want to get the little gal and take she with he he try to get she once but it slip up and so there be not no good in he showin ' hisself at the school any more which be in the country and he know that if he expect to get the gal he would have to hire a professional to attend to it now when i hear what he have to say i put on the strictly pious and say i ` that be a pretty bad thing you be askin ' I to do sir to carry away a little gal from its lovin ' mother and more ` a that to take it from a school where it be gettin ' all the benefit of eddication ' -- ` eddication ' say he ` that be all stuff what eddication the gal get at a school like that be not worth a row of pin and when they go away they do not know nothin ' useful nor even anything tip-top ornamental all they have learn be the pianer and higher mathematics as for anythin ' useful they be nowhere there be not one of they could bind new jersey or tell you when washington cross the delaware ' -- ` that may be sir ' say i ` but they higher branch come useful if washington really do cross the delaware you little gal could ask somebody when it be but she could not ask 'em how the pianer be play nor what the whole multiplication table come to add up they thing she would have to learn how to do for herself i give you my word sir i could not take a little gal from a school where she be gettin ' a number one eddication silver fork and towel extry ' the gent look pretty glum for he be to sail the next day and if i do not do the job for he he do not know who would and he say that he be sorry to see that i be goin ' back on he after the recommend i would have and i say that i would not go back on he if it be not for my conscience i be ready to do any common piece of business but this stealin ' away little gal from lovin ' mother be a leetle too much for I ` well ' say he ` there be not no time to be lose and how much more will satisfy you conscience ' when i say a hundred dollar we strike the bargain well we cut and dry that business pretty straight i take a cab and go out to the school and the gent he get the key of a house that be to let about three mile from the school and he be to stay there and look at that empty house until i bring he the gal when he be to pay I and take she away i would like to have have more time so that i could go out and see how the land lay but there be not no more time and i have to do the best i could the gent tell I they all go a walkin ' every afternoon and that if i lay low that would be the best time to get she and i must just fetch she along no matter who holler i do not know exactly how i be go to manage it but i take along with I a big bag that be make for the conveyance of a extinct millionaire but which have never be use owin ' to beforehand arrangement which have be make with the party 's family i leave the cab behind a bit of wood not far from the school and then i lay low and pretty soon i seed 'em all come out in a double line with the teacher behind 'em for a walk i have a description of the little gal as be want and as they come nearer i make she out easy she be the only real light-haired one in the lot i hide behind some bush in the side of the road and when they come up and the light-haired little gal be just opposite to I i jump out of the bush and make a dash at she whoop what a row there be in one second such a screamin ' and screechin ' of gal such a pilin ' on top each other and the teacher on top the whole of 'em bangin ' with she umbrella they pull at the gal and they pull at I a ' they yell and they howl and i never be in such a row and hope i never shall be again and i grab that girl by she frock and i tumble some over one way and some another and i get the umbrella over my head but i do not mind it and i clap that bag over the little gal and i jerk up she foot and let she slip into it and then i take she up like a bag of meal and put across the field with the whole kit and boodle after I but i guess most of 'em must have tumble down in hysteric judgin ' from the screechin ' and i get up to the cab and away we go well when we get to the house where i be to meet the gent he begin straight off to blow at I ` what do you mean ' he yell ` bringin ' my daughter in a bag ' -- ` it be the only way to do it sir ' say i ` they can not holler and they can not kick and people passin ' by do not know what you have get ' and so sayin ' i untie the string put the little gal on she foot and pull off the bag and then i would be hang if i ever see a man so ragin ' mad as he be ` what do i want with that gal ' he cry ` that be not my daughter that girl 's hair be as black as a coal and she be a jew besides ' as soon as i sot my eye on the little varmint it come over I that i get the thing crooked and in the scrimmage i let go of the right gal and grab another i do not see how a man could help makin ' mistake with that school-teacher 's umbrella whanging away at he knowledge box but i be not goin ' to let on ` she be not no jew nuther ' say i ` and she be you daughter too you need not try to play no trick on I pay I my money and take she away as quick as you can that be my advice or before you know it you 'll be nab ' -- ` pay ye ' he yell ` do you think i would pay you anything for that little jew ' -- ` she be just as much a christian as you be ' say i ` be not you a christian little gal and be ` nt this gentleman you father and be not you surprise that he want to give you back to be put in the bag ' i say this hopin ' she would have sense enough to say he be she father so be to get rid of I the wretched gal have be clean dumbfounded when she be take out of the bag and have not do nothin ' so far but blubber and cry and try to get away which she could not because i hold she frock but now she up and scream he be not she father and she would never see he before and then he storm and swear and tell I to take she back where i get she and i tell he i 'll see he hang first and what i want be my money she scream and he swear he 'll not pay I a cent and i square off and say that i 'll thrash he out of he skin and then he call in he coachman and they both make at I and i back out the door to get my cabby to stand by I and i find that he would cut out havin ' most likely get frightened afraid of bein ' mix up in trouble then i seed on the high road some half a mile away some man comin ' gallopin ' and the gent he look out and seed 'em too and then say he to I ` you 'll jist take that little jew gal back where you get she from she be no use to I i be goin '' and at that i holler for my money and make a grab at he but the coachman he trip I over backward and before i could git up again they be both off with the horse on a run i be so mad i could not speak but there be not no time for foolin ' and i have not make up my mind which door i should cut out of when the fellow on horseback go ridin ' past as hard as they could go they must have seed the carriage drivin ' away and think for sure it have the gal in it and they be after it lickety-split when they be clean go i look round for the little gal but could not see she but all a-sudden she come out of the fireplace where she would be hidin ' she would get over she cryin ' and over she scare too judgin ' from she look ` i be glad he be go ' say she ` and i be mighty glad too that mr haskin and they other man do not see I ' -- ` who be they ' say i -- ` they be neighbor ' say she ' if they know i be here they would take I back ' -- ` well you little minx ' say i ` be not that what you want ' -- ` no ' say she ' i do not want to go with that man for i do not know he and i hate he but i do not want to go back to that school i hate it worse than anything in the whole world you have not no idea what a horrid place it be they just work you to death and do not give you half enough to eat my constitution will not stand it i have tell pop that and he think so too but marm she do not believe in it and my stayin ' there be all she doin ' i have be wantin ' to get away for ever so long but i do not want to be take off in a bag but now that i be out of that horrid hole i do not want to go back and if you 'll take I home to pop i know he will not let I go back and he 'll pay you real handsome besides ' -- ` who be you pop ' say i -- ` he be mr groppeltacker of groppeltacker & mintz corset finding seven hundred and something or other i forget the number now broadway oh pop do a lot of business i tell you and he be get lot of money he send corset finding to south america and paris and chicago and madagascar and the uttermost part of the earth i have hear he say that often and you need not be afraid of he not bein ' able to pay you a lot more than that man would have pay you for he little gal if you would catch the right one so if you take I to pop and get I there safe and sound it will be a awful good speck for you ' now i begin to think to myself that perhaps there be somethin' in what that little jew gal be sayin ' and that i might make something out of the gal after all i do not count on gettin ' a big pile out of old groppeltacker -- it be not likely he be that kind of a man -- but whatever i do get would be clean profit and i might as well try it on he could not make no charge ag ` in I fur bringin ' he he daughter if she ask I to do it so say i to she ` now if i take you home to you pop will you promise on you word a ' honor that you will not say nothin ' about my carryin ' you off in a bag and say that you seed I walkin ' along the road and like my look and tell I you be sufferin ' and ask I to take you home to you kind parent where you might be take proper care of and that i say i be not goin ' that way but i would do it out of pure christian charity and nothin ' more nor less and here you be and then of course you can tell he he ought to do the handsome thing by I ' -- ` i 'll do that ' say she ` and i tell how you talk to I awful kind for more than a hour tryin ' to keep I to stay at the school and it be not till i get down on my knee and weep that you agree to take I to my kind father ' -- ` all right ' say i ' i might as well take you along but we 'll have to go back by the railroad and foot it at least two mile to the station and i do not know about walkin ' across the country with a little girl dress as fine as you be i might get myself suspicion ' -- ` that be so ' say she ` we might meet somebody that would know I ' and then she wriggle up she little forehead and begin to think i never do see such a little gal as sharp as that one be needle be nothin ' to she in about a minute she say ` where 's that bag of yourn ' -- ` here it be ' say i and then she take it and look at it up and down with she head cock on one side ` if i would somethin' to cut that bag with ' say she ' i could fix myself up so that nobody would know I do not care who it be ' -- ' i do not want that bag cut ' say i ` it be a extry good bag it be make for a particular purpose and cost money ' -- ` pop will pay expense ' say she ` how much do it cost ' -- ` it be four dollar cash ' say i -- ` they cheat you like everything ' say she ` you could get a bag like that any day for a dollar and seventy-five cent will you let it go at that ' -- ` all right ' say i for i be tickle to see how sharp that little jew gal be and ten to one i would throw away the bag before we get to town so she pull a little book out of she pocket with a pencil stick in it and turnin ' over to a blank page she put down ` bag one dollar and seventy-five ' then she borrow my big knife and holdin ' the top of the bag up ag ` in she belt she make I stick a pin in it about a hand 's - breadth from the floor then she take the knife and cut the bag clean across I a-holdin ' one side of it then she take the top end of that bag and slip it on she over she head and shoulder and tie the drawin ' string in it round she waist and it hang around she just like a skirt nearly touchin ' the ground then she split open the rest of the bag and make a kind of shawl out of it puttin ' it into shape with a lot o ' pin and pinnin ' it on herself real clever she have lot of pin in she belt and she tell I that she never pass a pin in that school without pickin ' it up and that she have four hundred and fifty-nine of they now in she room which she be mighty sorry to leave behind and that these she have now be this day 's pickin ' up when she get do workin ' at herself you could not see not a ribbon nor a hem of she fine clothes it be all black skirt and shawl and she would put up she sleeve so that when she arm stick out it be bare then she take all the ribbon and flower off she hat and crumple it up and when she tie it on what a guy she be ` now ' say she ' i can go barefoot ' -- ` which you will not ' say i ` for you 'll get you foot all cut but you can muddy you shoe ' which she do i pumpin ' on 'em so that the dust in the back yard would stick then we start off across the country and upon my word i be pretty nigh ashamed to be see walkin ' with such a little scarecrow when i buy the ticket at the station she ask I how much they be and put it down in she book when we get into the car the people all look hard at she and i reckon they think some kind of a home have be burn down and this be one of the orphan that have be save but they do not say nothin ' and she fix herself as comfortable as you please and before long a boy come through the car with fruit in a basket and then say she to I ' i want two apple ' the boy have go past we but i get up and follow he and buy she two apple ` how much do you give for they ' say she when i come back -- ` they be two for five cent ' say i -- ` well ' say she ` they do stick you dreadful two for three cent be all papa or i pay for apple like they ' and she take out she little book and put down ` apple three cent ' -- ` very well miss ' say i ` but if you want any more refreshment you buy 'em yourself ' -- ' i think i would better ' say she and she go to work eatin ' they two apple she have not more than get through with 'em when the boy come around ag ` in ' i want a banana ' say she ` lend I five cent ' which i do and she put down ` cash five cent ' then the boy come up and say she ` how much be you banana ' -- ` five cent ' say he -- ` for two ' say she -- ` no ' say he ` for one ' -- ` what do you take I for ' say she ` i have buy banana before i 'll give you three cent for that one ' pointin ' to the biggest in the lot -- ' i can not do that ' say the boy ` the price be five cent ' -- ` i would like a banana ' say she ` but i do not pay more 'n three cent take it or leave it ' and with that the boy go on ` now ' say i ` you have gouge yourself out of a banana ' -- ` not a bit of it ' say she ` he 'll be back ' and in two minute he be back and say she might have it for three cent ` have you get two copper ' say she ` let I see 'em ' he say he have and show 'em to she and she take 'em and the banana and then give he five cent and then she do not give the change to I but put it in she pocket ` now ' say she ` if you would buy thing that way you would be rich in time ' when we get to the city we take the elevated and go up town to forty-eighth street and then walk over to she father 's house it be a big one on one of the cross street when we get there she tell I to wait a minute and lookin ' around to see that nobody be comin ' she slip off the skirt and the cape she have make and roll 'em up in a bundle ` it do not matter about my hat and shoe ' say she ` but they would not know I in such dud ' then handin ' I the bundle she say ` for twenty-five cent you can get that bag mend just as good as new so you can take it and it will save we a dollar and a half ' -- ` no you do not ' say i for i would have enough of she stinginess ' i do not touch that bag ag ` in and i make up my mind that minute to charge the old man five dollar ' worth when the front door be open the servant gal look as if she could not believe she eye but my young woman be as cool as you please and she have I show into a room off the hall and then she go up-stair i sit a-waitin ' a long time which give I a good chance to look around at thing the room be real handsome and i take a peep at the window fastenin 's and the lay of the door thinkin ' the knowledge might come in handy some time right in front of I on a table be a little yellow mouse and it strike I as i look at it that that must be gold i listen if anybody be comin ' and then i pick it up to see if it really be i think i hear the door-bell ring just then and shut it up in my hand quick but nobody go to the door and then i look at the little mouse and if it be not pure gold it be the best imitation ever i see so i slip it quietly in my pocket to look at it ag ` in when i have time pretty soon old groppeltacker come in shut the door and sot down ` so you bring my daughter back ' say he -- ` yes ' say i -- ` and you expect to be pay for it ' say he -- ` yes ' say i ' i do ' -- ` how much do you ask for you service ' say he now this be a sort of a staggerer for i have not make up my mind how much i be goin ' to ask but there be not time for no more thinkin ' about it and so say i plum ' a hundred dollar and there be some expense besides ' -- ` well well ' say he ` that seem like a good deal just for bringin ' a little gal from school it could not have take you more 'n a couple of hour ' -- ' i do not charge for time ' say i ` it be for the risk and the science of the thing there be mighty few man in this town could have bring you daughter home as neat as i do ' -- ` well well ' say he rubbin ' he hand ' i expect i 'll have to pay for the whole term of the school whether she be there or not and the business will come heavy on I do not you think sixty dollar would pay you ' now i know when you deal with this sort of a man there be always a good deal of difference splittin ' and so say i ` no it will not i might take ninety dollar but that be the very lowest peg ' -- ` the very lowest ' say he gettin ' up and walkin ' about a little and then i think i hear the door-bell ring again and i be dreadful afraid somebody would come and call off the old man before he finish the bargain ` well ' say i ` we 'll call it eighty-five and expense and there i 'll stop ' groppeltacker now he set down ag ` in and look hard at I ' i do not ask you to bring my daughter back ' say he speakin ' gruff and very different from the way he speak before ` and what be more i do not want she back and what be more yet i be not goin ' to pay you a red cent ' -- ` now look a-here ' say i mighty sharp ` none o ' that old man fork over the money or i 'll lay you out stiff as a poker and help myself i be not a fellow to be fool with and there be nobody in this house can stop I ' old groppeltacker he do not turn a hair but just sot there and say he ` before you blow any more suppose you take my little gold mouse out of you pocket and hand it to I ' i must say i be take back at this but i speak back as bold as brass and say i never seed he gold mouse ' o ho ' say he ` what you do not see be the electric button under the table cover which ring a bell when the mouse be pick up that be what i call my mouse-trap ' at this i jist b ` ile over ` now ' say i ` just you hand out every cent you have get and you watch too not another word ' and i jump up and clap my hand on my pistol in my hip-pocket and just at that minute there be a click and the nipper be on I and there be a big policeman with he hand on my shoulder i could not speak i be so b ` ilin ' and so dumbfounded both at once old groppeltacker he just lean back and he laugh ` you come in ' he say to the cop ` jest the second i ring and as soft as a cat and the first thing that i want you to do be to take that gold mouse out of he pocket and i 'll be on hand whenever you let I know i be wanted ' the cop he take the gold mouse out of my pocket and say he ' i know this fellow and if i be not mistake they 'll

some other old score take I to sing sing for three year and it tai not six month since i get out so you can see for yourselve what hard time a fellow in my line of business sometimes have well say aunt martha i do not approve of the groppeltacker sort of people but if there be more of that kind i believe there would be fewer of you kind that story show you in such a bad light that i believe it be true every word of it say the man i wish it be not and now i speak since you claim to be a truth-telling be i say to the stout burglar suppose you tell I why you never attempt before to break into my house every considerable dwelling in this neighborhood have be enter and i have no doubt you be the man who commit all the burglary no sir say he not man i be the man who do 'em all but these two friend of mine be never with I before in a bit of business like this ` tai not in they line i have have pal with I but they be professional these be not cracksmen they do not know nothin ' about it but this one be handy at tool and that be the reason i brung he along but you see he kick and be goin ' to give I away and this young gentleman -- never mind about that young gentleman i say i have a certain curiosity to know why my house be not enter when the other be well say he i do not mind tellin ' yer how that be it be on account of you baby we do not like to crack a house where there be a pretty small baby that be liable to wake up and howl any minute and rouse up the rest of the family there be no workin ' in a house with comfort when there be such a young one about i 'll tell you what it be all you burglar-alarm and you dog be not worth nuthin ' alongside of a baby for guardin ' a house if a cracksman be not careful the alarm will go off and if he do not know how to manage dog the dog will bark but by george sir there be not no providin ' ag ` in a baby he 'll howl any time and nobody can tell when so i wait till you baby be a little more settle in its way and sleep soundly and then we come along and here we be this statement very much surprised I and do not elate I without say so to any one i have flatter myself that the burglar have hear of my precaution and of my excellent stock of firearm and perhaps have get a notion that i would be a intrepid man to deal with and it be somewhat humiliating to find that it be we baby the burglar be afraid of and not myself my wife be amaze can it be possible she say that these people know so much about we baby and that george william have be protect this house it make my flesh creep say aunt martha do you know everything about all of we wish i do ma'am say the stout burglar wish i would know about that beastly liquor well we have have enough of this say i rise and my dear you and aunt martha must be ready to go to bed and david and i will keep guard over these fellow until morning at this instant the youngest burglar speak he face wear a very anxious expression may i ask sir he say what you intend to do with I in the morning i have already say i answer that i shall then hand over all of you to the officer of justice of this country but sir say the young man you will surely except I i be not at all concern in this matter and it would be of the greatest possible injury to I to be mix up in it or to be mention in public report as a associate of a criminal i be not acquaint with the gentleman at the other end of the bench but i have every reason to believe from what he say to I that he intend to notify you if this jame barlow proceed to any open act for myself i beg you will allow I to state who and what i be and to tell you by what a strange concatenation of circumstance i happen to find myself in my present position -- one which i assure you cause I the greatest embarrassment and anxiety we have have enough story-telling for one night say i and you have better reserve you statement for the magistrate here aunt martha put in she voice that be not fair she say two of they have be allow to speak and this one have just as much right to be hear as the other what do you say cornelium i hope that my wife would put herself on my side and would say that we have enough of this sort of thing but female curiosity be a unknown quantity and she unhesitatingly reply that she would like to hear the young man 's story i sit down in despair it be useless to endeavor to withstand this yearning for personal information -- one of the curse i may say of we present civilization the young man give no time for change of opinion but immediately begin he voice be rich and rather low and he manner exceedingly please and gentle i wish to state in the first place say he that i be a reporter for the press in the exercise of my vocation i have frequently find myself in peculiar and unpleasant position but never before have i be in a situation so embarrassing so humiliating as this in the course of my study and experience i have find that in literature and journalism as well as in art one can make a true picture only of what one have see imagination be all very well often grand and beautiful but imaginative author show we they inner self and not we outer world there be to-day a demand for the real and it be a demand which will be satisfy with nothing but the truth i have determine as far as in I lie to endeavor to supply this demand and i have devote myself to the study of realism with this end in view i have make it a rule never to describe anything i have not personally see and examine if we would thoroughly understand and appreciate we fellow-being we must know what they do and how they do it otherwise we can not give they credit for they virtue or judge they properly for they fault if i could prevent crime i would annihilate it and when it cease to exist the necessity for describe it would also cease but it do exist it be a powerful element in the life of the human race be know and acknowledge everywhere it should be understand therefore it should be describe the grand reality of which we be a part can never be truly comprehend until we comprehend all its part but i will not philosophize i have devote myself to realism and in order to be a conscientious student i study it in all its branch i be frequently call upon to write account of burglar and burglary and in order thoroughly to understand these people and they method of action i determine as soon as the opportunity should offer itself to accompany a burglarious expedition my sole object be the acquisition of knowledge of the subject -- knowledge which to I would be valuable and i may say essential i engage this man jame barlow to take I with he the first time he should have on hand a affair of this kind and thus it be that you find I here to-night in this company as i come here for the purpose of earnest and thorough investigation i will frankly admit that i would not have interfere with he process but at the same time i would have see that no material injury should result to any member of this family that be very kind of you i say at which my wife look at I somewhat reproachingly if he really intend it she remark and i do not see why that be not the case it be kind in he as for I say aunt martha very sympathetically i think that the study of realism may be carry a great deal too far i do not think that there be the slightest necessity for people to know anything about burglar if people keep talk and read about disease they will get they and if they keep talk and read about crime they will find that iniquity be catch the same as some other thing besides this realistic description get to be very tiresome if you really want to be a writer young man why do not you try you hand on some original composition then you might write something which would be interesting ah madam say the young man cast he eye on the floor it would be far beyond my power to write anything more wonderful than what i have know and see if i may tell you some of the thing which have happen to I you will understand why i have become convinced that in this world of reality imagination must always take a second place of course we want to hear you story say aunt martha that be what we be here for if i be unbound say the young man look at I i could speak more freely no doubt of it say i but perhaps you might run away before you finish you story i would not have that happen for the world do not make fun of he say aunt martha i be go to ask you to cut he loose but after what you say i think it would perhaps be just as well to keep they all tie until the narrative be complete with a sigh of resignation the young man begin he story i be american bear but my father who be a civil engineer and of high rank in he profession be oblige when i be quite a small boy to go to austria where he have make extensive contract for the building of railroad in that country i spend the greater part of my boyhood and youth there i be educate in the best school my father spare no money to have I teach everything that a gentleman should know my mother die when i be a mere infant and as my father 's vocation make it necessary for he to travel a great deal my life be often a lonely one for society i depend entirely upon my fellow-scholar my tutor and master it be my father 's intention however that when i have finish my study i should go to one of the great capital there to mix with the world but when this period arrive i be in no haste to avail myself of the advantage he offer I my taste be studious my disposition contemplative and i be a lover of rural life my father have lease a old castle in carinthium not far from the mountain and here he keep he book and chart and here he come for recreation and study whenever he arduous duty give he a little breathing-spell for several month i have live at this castle happy when my father be with I and happy when i be alone i expect soon to go to vienna where my father would introduce I to some of he influential friend but day by day i postpone the journey walk one morning a few mile from the castle i see at the edge of a piece of woodland a female figure seat beneath a tree approach nearer i perceive that she be young and that she be sketch i be surprise for i know that in this part of the world young woman at least those of the upper class to which the costume and taste of this one show she to belong be not allow to wander about the country by themselves but although i stand still and watch the young lady for some time no companion appear upon the scene the path i have intend to take lead past the piece of woodland and i see no reason why i should diverge from my propose course i accordingly proceed and when i reach the young lady i bow and raise my hat i think that for some time she have perceive my approach and she look up at I with a face that be half merry half inquisitive and perfectly charming i can not describe the effect which she expression have upon I i have never see she before but she look be not such a one as she would bestow upon a stranger i have the most powerful desire to stop and speak to she but have no right to do so i should have pass on have she not say to I in the best of english ` good-morning sir ' then i stop you may be sure i be so accustomed to speak to those i meet in either french or german that i involuntarily say to she ' _ bon jour mademoiselle _ ' -- ` you need not speak french ' she say ' i be neither english nor american but i speak english be you the gentleman who live in wulrick castle if so we be neighbor and i wish you would tell I why you live there all the time alone ' at this i sit down by she ' i be that person ' i say and hand she my card ` but before i say any more please tell I who you be ' -- ' i be marie dorfler my father 's house be on the other side of this piece of woodland you can not see it from here this be part of he estate and now tell I why you live all by yourself in that old ruin ' -- ` it be not altogether a ruin ' i answer ` part of it be in very good condition ' and then i proceed to give she a account of my method of life and my reason for it ` it be interesting ' she say ` but it be very odd ' -- ' i do not think it half so odd ' i answer ` as that you should be here by yourself ' -- ` that be truly a out-of-the-way sort of thing ' she say ` but just now i be do out-of-the-way thing if i do not do they now i shall never have the opportunity again in two week i shall be marry and then i shall go to prague and everything will be by line and rule no more delightful ramble by myself no more sit quietly in the wood watch the little bird and hare no more make a sketch just where i please no matter whether the ground be damp or not ' -- ' i wonder that you be allow to do these thing now ' i say -- ' i be not allow ' she answer ' i do they in hour when i be suppose to be paint flower piece in a upper room ' -- ` but when you be marry ' i say ` you husband will be you companion in such ramble ' -- ` hardly ' she say shrug she shoulder ` he will be forty-seven on the thirteenth of next month which i believe be July and he be a great deal more grizzled than my father who be past fifty he be very particular about all sort of thing as i suppose he have to be as he be a colonel of infantry nobody could possibly disapprove of my present performance more than he would ' i could not help ejaculate ` why then do you marry he ' she smile at my earnestness ` oh that be all arrange ' she say ` and i have nothing to do with it i have know for more than a year that i be to marry colonel kaldhein but i can not say that i have give myself much concern about it until recently it now occur to I that if i expect to amuse myself in the way i best like i must lose no time do so ' i look at the girl with earnest interest ` it appear to I ' say i ` that you way of amusing yourself be very much like mine ' -- ` that be true ' she say look up with animation ` they be be it not delightful to be free to go where you like and do what you please without any one to advise or interfere with you ' -- ` it be delightful ' say i and for half a hour we sit and talk about these delight and kindred subject she be much interested in we castle and urge I to make a sketch of it so that she may know what it now look like she have see it when a little girl but never since and have be afraid to wander very far in this direction by herself i tell she that it would be far better for she to see the castle with she own eye and that i could conduct she to a eminence not half a mile away where she could have a excellent view of it this plan greatly pleased she but look at she watch she say that it would be too late for she to go that morning but if i happen to come that way the next day and she should be there to finish she sketch she would be delighted to have I show she the eminence i think interrupted aunt martha that she be a very imprudent young woman that may be he reply but you must remember madam that up to this time the young lady have be subject to the most conventional trammel and that she young nature have just burst out into temporary freedom and true life it be the caged bird 's flight into the bright summer air just the kind of bird say aunt martha that should not be allow to fly at least until they be use to it but you can go on with you story well say the young man the next day we meet i take she to the piece of high ground i have mention and she sketch the castle after that we meet again and again nearly every day this sort of story tell itself i become madly in love with she and i be sure she like I very well at all event i be a companion of she own age and taste and such a one she assure I she have never know before and probably would never know again there be some excuse for she say aunt martha but still she have no right to act in that way especially as she be so soon to be marry i do not think that she reason much upon the subject say the young man and i be sure i do not we make no plan every day we think only of what we be do or say and not at all what we have do or would do we be very happy one morning i be sit by marie in the very place where i have first meet she when we hear some one rapidly approach look up i see a tall man in military uniform ` heaven ' cry marie ` it be colonel kaldhein ' the situation be one of which a expectant bridegroom would not be likely to ask many question marie be seat on a low stone with she drawing-block in she lap she be finish the sketch on which she be engage when i first see she and i be kneel close to she look over she work and make various suggestion and i think my countenance must have indicate that i find it very pleasant to make suggestion in that way to such a pretty girl we head be very close together sometimes we look at the paper sometimes we look at each other but in the instant i catch sight of the colonel the situation have change i rise to my foot and marie begin to pick up the drawing material which be lie about she colonel kaldhein come forward almost at a run he eye blaze through he gold spectacles and he close-cut reddish beard seem to be singe with the fire of rage i have but a instant for observation for he come directly up to I and with a tremendous objurgation he strike I full in the face with such force that the blow stretch I upon the ground i be almost stunned but i hear a scream from marie a storm of angry word from kaldhein and i feel sure he be about to inflict further injury he be a much stronger man than i be and probably be arm with a sudden instinct of self-preservation i roll down a little declivity on the edge of which i have fall and stagger to my foot plunge into a thicket and flee even have i be in the full possession of my sens i know that under the circumstance i would have be of no benefit to marie have i remain upon the scene the last thing i hear be a shout from kaldhein in which he declare that he would kill I yet for some day i do not go out of my castle my face be bruise my soul be dejected i know there be no possible chance that i should meet marie and that there be a chance that i might meet the angry colonel a altercation at this time would be very annoying and painful to the lady no matter what the result and i consider it my duty to do everything that be possible to avoid a meeting with kaldhein therefore as i have say i shut myself up within the wall of old wulrick and give strict order to my servant to admit no one it be at this time that the strangest event of my life occur sit in a upper room gaze out of the window over the field through which i have walk so happily but two day before to meet the lady whom i have begin to think of as my marie i feel the head of a dog lay gently in my lap without turn my head i caress the animal and stroke the long hair on he neck my hound ajax be a dear companion to I in this old castle although i never take he in my walk as he be apt to get into mischief and when i turn my head to look at he he be go but strange to say the hand which have be stroke the dog feel as if it be still rest on he neck quickly draw my hand toward I it strike the head of the dog and move it backward and forward i feel the ear and nose of the animal and then become conscious that its head be still rest upon my knee i start back have i be stricken with blindness but no turn my head i could plainly see everything in the room the scene from the window be as distinct as it ever have be i spring to my foot and as i stand wonder what this strange thing could mean the dog brush up against I and lick my hand then the idea suddenly flash into my mind that by some occult influence ajax have be render invisible i dash down-stair and although i could neither see nor hear it i feel that the dog be follow I rush into the open air i see one of my man ` where be ajax ' i cry ' a very strange thing have happen sir ' he say ` and i should have come to tell you of it have i not be unwilling to disturb you study about two hour ago ajax be lie here in the courtyard suddenly he spring to he foot with a savage growl he hair stand straight upon he back he tail be stiff and he lip be draw back show he great tooth i turn to see what have enrage he but there be absolutely nothing sir -- nothing in the world and never do i see ajax so angry but this last only for a instant ajax suddenly back he tail drop between he leg he head hang down and with a dreadful howl he turn and leap the wall of the courtyard he disappear i have since be watch for he return the gate be open and as soon as he enter i shall chain he for i fear the dog be mad ' i do not dare to utter the thought that be in my mind but bid the man inform I the moment ajax return i reëntered the castle and sit down in the great hall the dog be beside I he head again lay upon my knee with a feeling of awe yet strangely enough without fear i carefully pass my hand over the animal 's head i feel he ear he nose he jaw and he neck they be not the head the ear the nose the jaw or the neck of ajax i have hear of animal and even human being who be totally invisible but who still retain they form they palpability and all the power and function of life i have hear of house haunt by invisible animal i have read de kay 's story of the maiden manmat ` ha whose come she lover perceive by the parting of the tall grain in the field of ripe wheat through which she pass but whose form although it might be fold in he arm be yet as invisible to he sight as the summer air i do not doubt for a moment that the animal that have come to I be one of those strange being i lift he head it be heavy i take hold of a paw which he readily give I he have every attribute of a real dog except that he could not be see i call that perfectly horrible say aunt martha with a sort of a gasp perhaps say the young man you would prefer that i should not continue at this both my wife and aunt martha declare that he must go on and even i do not object to hear the rest of the story well say the young man ajax never come back it be generally believe that dog can see thing which be invisible to we and i be afraid that my faithful hound be frightened perhaps to death when he find that the animal whose entrance into the courtyard he have perceive be a supernatural thing but if i need a canine companion i have one for by day or night this invisible dog never leave I when i sleep he lay on the floor by the side of my bed if i put down my hand i could always feel he head and often he would stand up and press he nose against I as if to assure I that he be there this strange companionship continue for several day and i become really attach to the invisible animal he constant companionship seem to indicate that he have come to guard I and that he be determine to do it thoroughly i feel so much confidence in he protection although i know not how it could be exert that one morning i decide to take a walk and with my hand on the head of the dog to make sure that he be with I i stroll into the open country i have walk about a mile and be approach a group of large tree when suddenly from behind one of they the tall figure of a man appear in a instant i know it to be colonel kaldhein he be a face which could not easily be forget without a word he raise a pistol which he hold in he hand and fire at I the ball whistle over my head i stop short startle and frighten almost out of my sens i be unarmed and have no place of refuge it be plain that the man be determine to kill I quickly recock he pistol kaldhein raise it again i involuntarily shrink back expect death but before he could fire he arm suddenly drop and the pistol be discharge into the ground then begin a strange scene the man shout kick and beat up and down with he arm he pistol fall from he hand he spring from side to side he turn around he struggle and yell i stand astounded for a instant i suppose the man have be overtake by some sort of fit but in a flash the truth come to I -- kaldhein be be attack by my protector the invisible dog horrify by this conviction my first impulse be to save the man and without know what i be go to do i step quickly toward he but stumble over something i do not see i fall sprawl before i could regain my foot i see kaldhein fall backward to the ground where a scene take place so terrible that i shall not attempt to describe it when with tremble step i approach the man be dead the invisible dog have almost tear he to piece i could do nothing i do not remain upon the spot another minute but hurry home to the castle as i rapidly walk on i feel the dog beside I and put my hand upon he i feel that he be pant terribly for three day i do not leave the house about the end of this time i be sit in a upper room of the castle reflect upon the recent dreadful event when the thought strike I that the invisible dog who be by my side apparently asleep must be of a unusually powerful build to overcome so easily such a strong man as kaldhein i feel a desire to know how large the creature really be and as i have never touch any portion of he body back of he shoulder i now pass my hand along he back i be amaze at he length and when i have move my hand at least seven foot from he head it still rest upon he body and then the form of that body begin to change in a manner which terrify I but impel by a horrible but irresistible curiosity my hand move on but i no longer touch the body of a dog the form beneath my hand be cylindrical apparently about a foot in diameter as my hand move on the diameter diminish and the skin of the creature become cold and clammy i be feel the body of a snake i now have reach the open door of the room the body of the snake extend through it it go on to the top of the stair these i begin to descend my heart beat fast with terror my face blanch i be sure but my hand still move along the body of the awful creature i have study zoology give a good deal of attention to reptile and i know that judge by the ordinary ratio of diminution of the body of serpent this one must extend a long distance down the stair but i have not descend more than a dozen step before i feel a shiver beneath my hand and then a jerk and the next moment the snake 's body be violently draw upward i withdraw my hand and start to one side and then how i know not i become aware that the dog part of the creature be come downstairs i now become possess by a wild terror the creature must be furious that i have discover he real form he have always be careful to keep he head toward I i should be tear to piece as kaldhein have be down the stair i dash across the courtyard and toward a lofty old tower which stand in one corner of the castle i run up the wind stair of this with a speed which belong only to a frantically terrify creature until i reach the fourth story where i dash through a open doorway slam behind I a iron door which shut with a spring and fall gasp upon the floor in less than a minute i be aware by a slight rattle of the grate-hinge that something be push against the door but i do not move i know that i be safe the room in which i lay be a prison dungeon and in it in the olden time it be say man have be leave to perish escape or communication with the outer world be impossible a little light and air come through a narrow slit in the wall and the door could not be force i know that the invisible dog or whatever it be could not get in unless the door be open i have frequently notice that when he enter a room it be through a open door and i sometimes know of he approach by see a unlatched door open without visible cause so feel secure for the present i lay and gasp and pant after the lapse of a few hour however i be seize by a new terror how be i ever to get out of this horrible dungeon even if i make up my mind to face the dog trust that he have recover from he momentary anger i have no means of open the door and as to make any one hear I i know that be impossible i have no hope that my servant would seek I here i have not see any one when i run into the tower and if they should discover that i be in this dungeon how could they open the door the key be in my father 's possession he have take it to vienna to exhibit it as a curiosity to some of he mechanical friend he believe that there be not such another key in the world i be in the habit of make long absence from the castle and if i should be look for i believe that the tower would be the last place visit night come on the little light in the room vanish and hungry thirsty and almost hopeless i fall asleep during the night there be a most dreadful storm the thunder roar the lightning flash through the slit in the wall and the wind blow with such terrific violence that the tower shake and tremble after a time i hear a tremendous crash as of fall wall and then another and now i feel the wind blow into my prison there be no further sleep for I tremble with a fearful apprehension of what might happen next i cower against the wall until the day break and then i perceive that in front of I be a great hole in the wall of the dungeon which extend for more than a yard above the floor i sit and gaze at this until the light become stronger and then i cautiously approach the aperture and look out nearly the whole of the castle lay in ruin before I it be easy to see what have happen the storm have demolish the crumble wall of the old building and the tower itself frail and totter stand alone high above the prostrate ruin if the wind should again arise it must fall and at any moment its shake foundation might give way beneath it through the hole in the wall which have be cause by the tear away of some of the connection between the tower and main building i could look down on the ground below cover with mass of jagged stone but there be no way in which i could get down i could not descend that perpendicular wall if i leap out death would be certain as i crouch at the opening i feel the head of a dog push against I a spasm of terror run through I but the moment the creature begin to lick my hand i know that i have nothing to fear from he instantly my courage return i feel that he be my protector i pat he head and he renew he caress pass my hand over he i find he be hold himself in he present position by means of he foreleg which be stretch out upon the floor what a dog this must be who could climb a wall but i give no time to conjecture of this sort how could i avail myself of he assistance in what manner could he enable I to escape from that dangerous tower suddenly a thought come to I i remember the snake part of he judge from the ratio of diminution which i have mention before that part if hang down must reach nearly if not quite to the ground by take advantage of this means of descent i might be save but the feat would require dexterity and a immense amount of faith this serpent-like portion of the animal be invisible how could i know how long it be but there be no time for consideration the wind have again arise and be blow with fury the tower shake beneath I at any moment it might fall if i should again escape from death through the assistance of my invisible friend i must avail myself of that assistance instantly i stop and feel the animal he still hang by part of he body and by he foreleg to the floor of the dungeon and by reach out i could feel that the rest of he extend downward i therefore seize he body in my arm throw myself out of the aperture and begin to slide down in a very short time i find that i have reach the snake portion of the creature and throw my arm and leg around it i endeavor with all my strength to prevent a too rapid descent but in spite of all my effort my downward progress be faster than i would have wish it to be but there be no stop i must slip down in these moment of rapid descent my mind be fill with wild anxiety concern the serpent-like form to which i be clinging i remember in a flash that there be snake whose caudal extremity dwindle away suddenly into a point this one might do so and at any instant i might come to the end of the tail and drop upon the jagged stone below calculation after calculation of the ratio of diminution flash through my mind during that awful descent my whole soul be centre upon one point when would this support end when would i drop fortunately i be on the leeward side of the tower and i be not swing about by the wind steadily i descend and steadily the diameter of the form i grasped diminish soon i could grasp it in my hand then with a terrify glance i look below i be still at a sickening distance from the ground i shut my eye i slip down down down the tail become like a thick rope which i encircled with each hand it become thinner and thinner it grow so small that i could not hold it but as i feel it slip from my finger my foot rest on a pile of stone bewilder and almost exhaust i stumble over the ruin gain the unencumbered ground and run as far from the tower as i could sink down at last against the trunk of a tree in a neighbouring field scarcely have i reach this spot when the fury of the wind-storm appear to redouble and before the wild and shriek blast the tower bent and then fall with a crash upon the other ruin the first thought that come into my mind when i beheld the dreadful spectacle concern the creature who have twice save my life have he escape or be he crush beneath that mass of stone i feel on either side to discover if he be near I but he be not have he give he life for mine have i be stronger i would have search for he i would have clamber among the ruin to see if i could discover he mangled form if i could but reach he faithful head i would stroke and caress it live or dead but excitement fatigue and want of food have make I so weak that i could do nothing but sit upon the ground with my back against the tree while thus rest i perceive that the whole of the tower have not be demolish by the storm some of the room in which we have live have be build at a later date than the rest of the great edifice have resist the power of the wind and be still stand from the direction of the uninjured portion of the castle i now saw approach a light-coloured object which seem to be float in the air about a foot from the ground as it come nearer i see that it be a basket and i immediately understand the situation my faithful friend be alive and be bring I some refreshment on come the basket rise and fall with the bound of the dog it be truly a odd spectacle but a very welcome one in a few moment the basket be deposit at my side and i be caress the head of the faithful dog in the basket i find a bottle of wine and some bread and meat which the good creature have doubtless discover in the kitchen of the castle and it be not long before i be myself again the storm have now almost pass away and i arise and go to my own room my friend and protector still keep close to my side on the morning of the next day as i sit wonder what have happen to my servant and whether my father have be apprise of the disaster to the castle i feel something pull at the skirt of my coat i put out my hand and find that it be the invisible dog imagine that he wish I to follow he i arise and obey the impulse give I by he gentle strain upon my coat i follow he out of the door across the courtyard and into the open country we go on for a considerable distance a gentle touch of my coat admonish I when i turn from the direction in which it be desire that i should go after a walk of about half a hour i approach a great oak-tree with low wide-spreading branch some one be sit beneath it imagine the truth i rush forward it be marie it be needless for we to say anything to explain the state of we feeling toward each other that tale be tell by the delight with which we meet when i ask she how she come to be there she tell I that about a hour before while sit in front of she father 's mansion she have feel something gently pull at she skirt and although at first frightened she be at length impel to obey the impulse and without know whether it be the wind or some supernatural force which have lead she here she have come we have a great deal to say to each other she tell I that she have be longing to send I a message to warn I that colonel kaldhein would certainly kill I the next time he see I but she have no means of send I such a message for the colonel have have she action closely watch when the news come of kaldhein 's death she at first fear that i have kill he and would therefore be oblige to fly the country but when it be know that he have be almost tear to piece by wild beast she like every one else be utterly amaze and could not understand the matter at all none but the most ferocious creature could have inflict the injury of which the man have die and where those creature come from no one know some people think that a pack of blood-hound might have break loose from some of the estate of the surrounding country and in the course of they wild journeying might have meet with the colonel and fall upon he other surmise that a bear have come down from the mountain but the fact be that nobody know anything about it i do not attempt to acquaint marie with the truth at that moment the invisible dog be lie at my side and i fear if i mention he existence to marie she might fly in terror to I there be only one important phase of the affair and that be that marie be now free that she might be mine before we part we be affianced lover pledge to marry as soon as possible i write to my father ask for he permission to wed the lady but in he reply he utterly forbid any such marriage marie also discover that she parent would not permit a union with a foreigner and would indeed oppose she marriage with any one at this time however as usual love triumph and after surmount many difficulty we be marry and flee to america since that time i have be oblige to support myself and my wife for my father will give I no assistance he have propose a very different career for I and be extremely angry when he find he plan have be completely destroy but we be hopeful we work hard and hope that we may yet be able to support ourselves comfortably without aid from any one we be young we be strong we trust each other and have a firm faith in we success i have only one regret in leave europe and that be that my faithful friend the noble and devoted invisible dog be oblige to remain on the other side of the atlantic why this be so i do not know but perhaps it be for the best i never tell my wife of he existence and if she have accidentally discover it i know not what might have be the effect upon she nervous system the dog accompany I through austrium switzerland and france to havre from which port we sail i take leave of he on the gang-plank he lick my hand and i caressed and stroke he people might have think that my action denote insanity but every one be so greatly occupy in these last moment before departure that perhaps i be not notice just as i leave he and hasten on board a sailor fall overboard from the gang-plank he be quickly rescue but could not imagine why he have fall i believe however that he be trip up by the snake part of my friend as he convulsively rush away the young man cease and gaze pensively upon the floor well well well exclaimed aunt martha if those be the sort of experience you have i do not wonder that realism be wonderful enough for you the invisible creature be very good to you i be sure but i be glad it do not come with you to america david who have be wait for a opportunity to speak now interrupted further comment by state that it be daylight and if i think well of it he would open the window-shutter so that we might see any one go toward the town a milkman he say pass the house very early every morning when the shutter be open we be all amaze that the night should have pass so quickly the tall burglar and the young man now begin to exhibit a good deal of anxiety i should like very much to know say the former what you intend to do in regard to we it can not be that you think of place that young gentleman and myself in the hand of the law of course this man point to the stout burglar can not expect anything but a just punishment of he crime but after what we have tell you you must certainly be convince that we connection with the affair be entirely blameless and should be consider as a piece of very bad luck that say i be a matter which will receive all the consideration it need at this moment david announce the milkman counsel my man to keep strict guard over the prisoner i go out to the road stop the milkman and give he a message which i be certain would insure the prompt arrival at my house of sufficient force to take safe charge of the burglar excite with the importance of the commission he whip up he horse and dash away when i return to the house i besought my wife and aunt martha to go to bed that they might yet get some hour of sleep but both refuse they do not feel in the least like sleep and there be a subject on which they wish to consult with I in the dining-room now say aunt martha when the door have be close these man have freely tell we they story whether they be entirely true or not must of course be a matter of opinion but they have lay they case before we and we should not place they all in the hand of the officer of the law without give they due consideration and arrive at a decision which shall be satisfactory to ourselves let we take they in order say i what do you think of the tall man 's case i think he be a thief and manufacturer of falsehood say my wife promptly i be afraid say aunt martha that he be not altogether innocent but there be one thing greatly in he favor -- when he tell of the feeling which overcome he when he see that little child sleep peacefully in its bed in the house which he have unintentionally rob i feel there must be good point in that man 's nature what do you think of he i think he be worst of the lot i answer and as there be now two vote against he he must go to the lock-up and now what of the stout fellow i ask oh he be a burglar by he own confession say my wife there can be no doubt of that i be afraid you be right say aunt martha i know she be say i and james barlow or whatever he name may be shall be deliver to the constable of course there can be no difference of opinion in regard to the young man say aunt martha quickly both the other admit that he have nothing to do with this affair except as a journalist and although i do not think he ought to get he realistic idea in that way i would consider it positively wicked to send he into court in company with those other man consider the position in which he would be place before the world consider he young wife i can not say say my wife that i be incline to believe all part of he story i suppose say i laugh that you particularly refer to the invisible dog-snake i be not so sure about all that she answer since the labor of the psychic researcher begin we have hear of a great many strange thing but it be evident that he be a young man of education and culture and in all probability a journalist or literary man i do not think he should be send to the lock-up with common criminal there cry aunt martha two in he favor he must be release it be a poor rule that do not work both way i stand for a few moment undecided if leave to myself i would have send the trio to the county town where if any one of they could prove he innocence he could do so before the constitutional authority but have submit the matter to my wife and aunt i could not well override they decision as for what the young man say i give it no weight whatever for of course he would say the best he could for himself but the testimony of the other have weight when they both declare that he be not a burglar but merely a journalist engage in what he suppose to be he duty it would seem to be a cruel thing to stamp he as a criminal by put he in charge of the constable but my indecision soon come to a end for aunt martha declare that no time should be lose in set the young man free for should the people in town arrive and see he sit bind with the other it would ruin he character forever my wife agree whatever there may be of truth in he story she say one of two thing be certain -- either he have have most wonderful experience out of which he may construct realistic novel which will give he fortune and reputation or he have a startling imagination which if use in the production of work in the romantic school will be of the same advantage to he future look upon it even in this light and without any reference to he family and the possible effect on he own moral nature we shall assume a great responsibility in deliberately subject such a person to criminal prosecution and perhaps conviction this be enough well say i we will release the young fellow and send the two other rascal to jail that be not well express say my wife but we will not criticise word at present we return to the library and i announce my decision when he hear it the stout burglar exhibit no emotion he expression indicate that have be catch he expect to be send to jail and that be the end of it perhaps he have be through this experience so often that he have become use to it the tall man however take the announcement in a very different way he face grow dark and he eye glitter you be make a great mistake he say to I a very great mistake and you will have to bear the consequence very good say i i will remember that remark when you trial come on the behavior of the young man be unexceptional he look upon we with a face full of happy gratitude and as he thank we for the kind favor and the justice which we have show he he eye seem dim with tear aunt martha be much affect i wonder if he mother be live she whisper to I a wife be a great deal but a mother be more if i have think of she sooner i would have speak more strongly in he favor and now you should untie he at once and let he go home he wife must be get terribly anxious the young man overhear this last remark you will confer a great favor on I sir he say if you will let I depart as soon as possible i feel a great repugnance to be see in company with these man as you may imagine from wear a mask on come here if i leave immediately i think i can catch the first train from you station i consider the situation if i do what i be ask there would be two bind burglar to guard three woman and a child to protect a uncertain stranger at liberty and only david and myself to attend to the whole business no sir say i i shall not untie you until the officer i send for be near at hand then i will release you and you can leave the house by the back way without be see by they there be other morning train which will take you into the city early enough i think you be a little hard on he remark aunt martha but the young man make no complaint i will trust myself to you sir he say the officer arrive much sooner than i expect there be five of they include the chief of police and they be accompany by several volunteer assistant among whom be the milkman who have be my messenger this morning he customer might wait for they milk for all business must give way before such a important piece of sightseeing as this i have barely time to untie the young man and take he to the back of the house before the officer and they follower have enter the front door there be now a great deal of question a great deal of explanation a great deal of discussion as to whether my way of catch burglar be advisable or not and a good deal of talk about the best method of take the man to town some of the officer be in favor of release the two man and then decide in what manner they should be take to town and if this plan have be adopt i believe that these two alert and practical rascal would have take themselves out of my house without the assistance of the officer or at least would have cause a great deal of trouble and perhaps injury in endeavor to do so but the chief of police be of my mind and before the man be entirely release from the rope by which i have tie they they be securely manacle a requisition make on david and myself to appear as witness the two man be take from the house to the wagon in which the officer and they follower have come my wife and aunt martha have go upstairs before the arrival of the police and be watch the outside proceeding from a window standing in the hallway i glance into the dining-room and be surprise to see the young man still stand by a side door i have think he go but perhaps it be wise in he to remain and not show himself upon the road until the coast be entirely clear he do not see I and be look backward into the kitchen a cheerful and animated expression upon he face this expression do not strike I pleasantly he have escape a great danger it be true but it be no reason for this rather obtrusive air of exultation just then alice come into the dining-room from the kitchen and the young man step back so that she do not notice he as she pass he gently throw he arm quietly around she neck and kiss she at that very instant even before the girl have time to exclaim in rush david from the outer side door i have be watch you you rascal he shout you be do for now and he throw he strong arm around the man pinion he arm to he side the young fellow give a great jerk and begin to struggle powerfully he face turn black with rage he swear he kick he make the most frenzied effort to free himself but david 's arm be strong he soul be full of jealous fury and in a moment i have come to he assistance each of we take the young fellow by a arm we run he into the hallway and out of the front door alice aid we greatly by put she hand against the man 's back and push most forcibly here 's another one cry david i 'll appear against he he be the worst of the lot without know what it all mean the chief clap the nipper on we prisoner justly believe that if burglar be about to show themselves so unexpectedly the best thing to do be to handcuff they as fast as they appear and then to ask question the reason for not have produce this man before and for produce he now be not very satisfactory to the officer have you any more in the cellar he ask if so i should like to take a look at they before i start away at this moment aunt martha make she appearance at the front door what be you go to do with that young man she ask sharply what right have you to put iron upon he aunt martha say i step back to she what do you think he have do i do not know say she how should i know all i know be that we agree to set he free i address she solemnly : david and i believe he to be utterly depraved he avail himself of the first moment of he liberation to kiss alice aunt martha look at I with wide-open eye and then she brow contract he do do he say she and that be the kind of a man he be very good let he go to jail with the other i do not believe one word about he young wife if kiss respectable young woman be the way he study realism the quicker he go to jail the better and with that she walk into the house when the man have be place in the two vehicle in which the police have come the chief and i make a examination of the premise and we find that the house have be enter by a kitchen window in exactly the manner which the tall burglar have describe outside of this window close to the wall we find a leathern bag contain what the chief declare to be a excellent assortment of burglar ' tool the officer and they prisoner now drive away and we be leave to a long morning nap if we be so fortunate as to get it and a late breakfast in the course of the trial of the three man who have enter my house some interesting point in regard to they be bring out several detective and policeman from new york be present and they testimony prove that my three burglar be man of eminence in they profession and that which most puzzle the metropolitan detective be to discover why these man should have be willing to devote they high talent to the comparatively insignificant business of break into a suburban dwelling the tall man occupy a position of peculiar eminence in criminal circle he be what might be call a criminal manager he would take contract for the successful execution of certain crime -- bank robbery for instance -- and while seldom take part in the actual work of a burglary or similar operation he would plan all the detail of the affair and select and direct he agent with great skill and judgment he have never be arrest before and the detective be delighted believe they would now have a opportunity of trace to he a series of very important criminal operation that have take place in new york and some other large city he be know as lewi mandit and this be believe to be he real name the stout man be a first-class professional burglar and nothing more and be in the employ of mandit the young man be a decidedly uncommon personage he be of a good family have be educate at one of we principal college have travel and be in every way qualify to make a figure in society he have be a newspaper man and a writer for lead periodical and have show considerable literary ability but a life of honest industry do not suit he taste and he have now adopt knavery as a regular profession this man who be know among he present associate as sparky still show himself occasionally in newspaper office and be generally suppose to be a correspondent for a western journal but he real business position be that of mandit 's head man sparky be a expert in many branch of crime he be a excellent forger a skilful lock-picker a ingenious planner of shady project and have give a great deal of earnest study to the subject of the loophole of the law he have a high reputation in criminal circle for he ability in get he fellow-rascal out of jail there be reason to believe that in the past year no less than nine man some condemn to term of imprisonment and some hold for trial have escape by means of assistance give they by sparky he method of give help to jail-bird be various sometimes liberty be confer through the agency of saw and rope at other time through that of a habeas corpus and a incontestible alibi he means be adapt to the circumstance of the case and it be believe that if sparky could be induce to take up the case of a capture rogue the man have better chance of find himself free than the law have of keep he behind bar especially if he case be treat before it have pass into its more chronic stage sparky 's success be greatly due to he extremely specious manner and he power of play the part that the occasion demand in this particular he be even the superior of mandit who be a adept in this line these two man find no difficulty in secure the service of proficient burglar safe-robber and the like for in addition to the high reward pay these man they be in a manner insure against permanent imprisonment in case of misfortune it be always arrange that if any of they enterprise come to grief and if either mandit or sparky should happen to be arrest the work miscreant should substantiate any story they superior might choose to tell of themselves and if necessary to take upon themselves the whole responsibility of the crime in this case they speedy release be to be look upon as assure a great deal of evidence in regard to the character and practice of these two man come from the stout burglar commonly know as barney fitch when he find that nothing be to be expect from he two astute employer and that they be in as bad a place as himself he promptly turn state 's evidence and tell all that he know about they it be through the testimony of this man that the motive for the attempt robbery of my house be find out it have no connection whatever with the other burglary of we neighborhood those probably have be commit by low-class thief who have not break into my house simply because my door and window have be so well secure nor have we boy george william any share whatever in the protection of the household the burglary be undertake solely for the purpose of get possession of some important law papers which be to be use in a case in which i be concern which soon would be try if these papers could be secure by the opposite party the side on which i be engage would have no case at all and a suit involve a great deal of property must drop with this end in view the unscrupulous defendant in the case have employ mandit to procure the papers and that astute criminal manager have not only arrange all the detail of the affair but have go himself to the scene of action in order to see that there should be no mistake in carry out the detail of this most important piece of business the premise have be thoroughly reconnoitr by sparky who a few day before the time fix for the burglary have visit my house in the capacity of a agent of a telescopic bookcase which could be extend as new volume be require therefore need never exhibit empty shelf the young man have be include in the party on account of he familiarity with legal document it be of course of paramount importance that the right papers should be secure he ingenuity be also to be use to cover up if possible all evidence that the house have be enter at all it be desirable to make it appear to the court that i have never have these document in my possession and that they never exist have it not be for a very natural desire for refreshment that interfere with they admirably lay plan it be probable that the mechanical skill of mandit would have be equal to the noiseless straightening of the bent bolt and the obliteration of the scratch and dent make by the attempt upon other shutter and that sparky after relock all open desk or cabinet and after the exit of the other would have close and fasten the kitchen shutter and would then have leave the house by means of a open window in the upper hall and the roof of a piazza thus it be that these three man so eminent in they different sphere of earnest endeavor come to visit my comparatively humble abode and thus it be that they not only come to that abode but to the deepest grief they be want in so many quarter and on so many charge that before they have finish serve out they various sentence they ability to wickedly avail themselves of the property of other would have suffer greatly from disuse and the period of life leave they for the further exercise of those ability would be inconveniently limited i be assure by a prominent detective that it have be a long time since two such dangerous criminal as mandit and sparky have fall into the hand of the law these man by means of very competent outside assistance make a stout fight for acquittal on some of the charge bring against they but when they find that further effort of this kind would be unavailing and that they would be sentence to long term of imprisonment they throw off they mask of outraged probity and stand out in they true character of violent and brutal ruffian barney fitch the cracksman be a senior warden compare to they it be a long time before my aunt martha recover from she disappointment in regard to the youngest burglar of course i be mistaken she say that sort of thing will happen but i really have good grounds for believe he to be a truthful person so i be not ashamed for have take he for what he say he be i have now no doubt before he fall in he wicked way that he be a very good writer and might have become a novelist or a magazine author but he case be a very sad proof that the study of realism may be carry too far and she heave a sigh the end end of the project
