produce by jonathan ingram josephine paoluccus and pg distribute proofreader peaceless europe by francesco s nitti 1922 preface in this book be embody the idea which as a parliamentarian as head of the italian government and as a writer i have uphold with firm conviction during the last few year i believe that europe be threaten with decadence more owe to the peace treaty than as a result of the war she be in a state of daily increase decline and the cause of dissatisfaction be grow apace europe be still wait for that peace which have not yet be definitely conclude and it be necessary that the public should be make aware that the course now be follow by the policy of the great victorious state be perilous to the achievement of serious lasting and useful result i believe that it be to the interest of france herself if i speak the language of truth as a sincere friend of france and a confirm enemy of german imperialism not only do that imperialism plunge germany into a sea of misery and suffer cover she with the opprobrium of have provoke the terrible war or at least of have be mainly responsible for it but it have ruin for many year the productive effort of the most culture and industrious country in europe some time ago the ex-president of the french republic r poincaré after the san remo conference _ à propo _ of certain difference of opinion which have arise between lloyd george and myself on the one hand and millerand on the other write as follow : italy and england know what they owe to france just as france know what she owe to they they do not wish to part company with we nor do we with they they recognize that they need we as we have need of they lloyd george and nittus be statesman too shrewd and experience not to understand that they greatest strength will always lie in this fundamental axiom on leave san remo for rome or london let they ask the opinion of the ` man in the street ' he reply will be : ' _ avant tout restez unis avec la france _ ' i believe that lloyd george and i share the same cordial sentiment toward france we have go through so much suffering and anxiety together that it would be impossible to tear asunder link firmly weld by common danger and pain france will always remember with a sympathetic glow that italy be the first country which proclaim she neutrality on August 2 1914 without that proclamation the destiny of the war might have take a very different turn but the work of reconstruction in europe be in the interest of france herself she have hate too deeply to render a sudden cessation of she hate-storm possible and the treaty have be beget in rancor and apply with violence even as the life of man the life of people have day of joy and day of grief : sunshine follow the storm the whole history of european people be one of alternate victory and defeat it be the business of civilization to create such condition as will render victory less brutal and defeat more bearable the recent treaty which regulate or be suppose to regulate the relation among people be as a matter of fact nothing but a terrible regress the denial of all those principle which have be regard as a unalienable conquest of public right president wilson by he league of nation have be the most responsible factor in set up barrier between nation christopher columbus sail from europe hope to land in indium whereas he discover america president wilson sail from america thinking that he be go to bring peace to europe but only succeed in bring confusion and war however we should judge he with the greatest indulgence for he intention be undoubtedly sincere and honest france have more to gain than any other country in europe by revert to those sound principle of democracy which form she erstwhile glory we do not forget what we owe she nor the noble spirit which pervade some of she historic deed but _ noblesse oblige _ and all the more binding be she duty to respect tradition when france shall have witness the gradual unfold of approach event she will be convince that he who have speak to she the language of truth and have seek out a formulum permit the people of europe to rediscover they path in life towards life be not only a friend but a friend who have opportunely bring back to france 's mind and heart the deed of she great ancestor at the time when fresh deed of greatness and glory await accomplishment the task which we must undertake with we inmost feeling with all the ardor of we faith be to find once more the road to peace to utter the word of brotherly love toward oppressed people and to reconstruct europe which be gradually sink to the condition of quattrocento italy without its effulgence of art and beauty : thirty state mutually diffident of each other in a sea of program and balkan idea towards the achievement of this work of civilization the great democracy must march shoulder to shoulder at the present moment i hear nothing but hostile voice but the time be not far distant when my friend of france will be march with we along the same road they already admit in private many thing which they will presently be oblige to recognize openly many truth be the fruit of persuasion other again be the result of former delusion i place my greatest trust in the action of american democracy by refuse to sanction the treaty of versaille and all the other peace treaty the american senate have give proof of the soundest political wisdom : the united state of america have negotiate its own separate treaty and resume its pre-war relation with victor and vanquish alike it follow that all that have be do hitherto in the way of treaty be render worthless as the most important participant have withdraw this be a further motive for reflect that it be impossible to continue live much longer in a europe divide by two contend field and by a medley of rancor and hatred which tend to widen the chasm it be of the greatest interest to america that europe should once more be the wealthy prosperous civilized europe which before 1914 rule over the destiny of the world only by so great a effort can the finest conquest of civilization come back to they own we should only remember we dead in so far as they memory may prevent future generation from be sadden by other war victim the voice of those whom we have lose should reach we as voice pray for the return of that civilization which shall render massacre impossible or shall at least diminish the violence and ferocity of war just as the grow dissolution of europe be a common danger so be the renewal of the bond of solidarity a common need let we all work toward this end even if at first we may be misunderstand and may find obstacle in we way truth be on the march and will assert herself : we shall strike the main road after much of dreary wander in the dark lane of prejudice and violence many of the lead man of europe and america who in the intoxication of victory proclaim idea of violence and revenge would now be very glad to reverse they attitude of which they see the unhappy result the truth be that what they privately recognize they will not yet openly admit but no matter the confession which many of they have make to I both verbally and in write induce I to believe that my idea be also they idea and that they only seek to express they in the form and on the occasion less antagonistic to the current of opinion which they themselves set up in the day when the chief object to be achieve seem to be the vivisection of the enemy recent event however have entirely change the situation as i say before the american senate have not sanction the treaty of versaille nor be it likely to give it its approval the united state of america conclude separate treaty on its own account agreement of a military character have be arrive at in paris : the united state of america and great britain guarantee france against any future unjust attack by germany the american senate do not sanction the agreement in fact it do not even discuss it the house of common have approve it subordinate to the consent of the united state italy have keep aloof from all alliance as a result of this situation the four entente power ally and associate -lrb- as formerly be the official term -rrb- have cease to be either ally or associate after the end of the war on the other hand europe after emerge from the war be darken and overcast by intrigue secret agreement and dissimulated plot : fresh menace of war and fresh explosion of dissatisfaction nothing can help the cause of peace more than give a full knowledge of the real situation to the various people error thrive in darkness while truth walk abroad in the full light of day it have be my intention to lay before the public those great controversy which can not merely form the object of diplomatic note or of posthumous book present to parliament in a more or less incomplete condition after event have become irreparable the sense of a common danger threaten all alike will prove the most persuasive factor in swerve we from the perilous route which we be now follow as a result of the war the bond of economic solidarity have be tear asunder : the loser in the war must not only make good they own loss but accord to the treaty be expect to pay for all the damage which the war have cause meanwhile all the country of europe have only one prevail fear : german competition in order to pay the indemnity impose upon she -lrb- and she can only do it by export goods -rrb- germany be oblige to produce at the lowest possible cost which necessitate the maximum of technical progress but export at low cost must in the long run prove detrimental if not destructive to the commerce of neutral country and even to that of the victor thus in all tariff which have already be publish or which be in course of preparation there be one prevail object in view : that of reduce german competition which practically amount to render it impossible for she to pay the war indemnity if winner and loser be to abandon war-time idea for a while and rather be to persuade themselves that the oppression of the vanquish can not be lasting and that there be no other logical way out of the difficulty but that of small indemnity payable in a few year debit to the loser in tolerable proportion all debt contract towards great britain and the united state the european situation would immediately improve why be europe still in such a state of economic disorder because the confusion of moral idea persist in many country nerve be still as tense as a bowstring and the language of hatred still prevail for some country as for some social group war have not yet cease to be one hear now in the country of the victor the same argument use as be current coin in germany before the war and during the first phase of the war only now and then more as a question of habit than because they be truly feel we hear the word justice peace and democracy why be the present state of discomfort and dissatisfaction on the increase because almost everywhere in continental europe in the country which have emerge from the war the rate of production be below the rate of consumption and many social group instead of produce more plan to possess themselves with violence of the wealth produce by other at home the social class unable to resist be threaten abroad the vanquish equally unable to resist be menace but in the very menace it be easy to discern the anxiety of the winner confusion discomfort and dissatisfaction thus grow apace the problem of europe be above all a moral problem a great step toward its solution will have be accomplish when winner and loser persuade themselves that only by a common effort can they be save and that the best enemy indemnity consist in peace and joint labor now that the enemy have lose all he possess and threaten to make we lose the fruit of victory one thing be above all other necessary : the resumption not only of the language but of the idea of peace during one of the last international conference at which i be present and over which i preside at san remo after a long exchange of view with the british and french premier lloyd george and millerand the american journalist ask I to give they my idea on peace : what be the most necessary thing for the maintenance of peace they inquire one thing only i reply be necessary europe must smile once more smile have vanish from every lip nothing have remain but hatred menace and nervous excitement when europe shall smile again she will rediscover she political peace idea and will drink once more at the spring of life class struggle at home in they acutest form be like the competition of nationalism abroad : explosion of cupidity mask by the pretext of the country 's greatness the deeply rooted economic crisis which threaten and prepare new war the deeply root social crisis which threaten and prepare fresh conflict abroad be nothing but the expression of a _ status animae _ or soul condition statesman be the most directly responsible for the continuation of a language of violence they should be the first to speak the language of peace f nitti acquafredda in basilica _ September _ 30 1921 p -- peaceless europe be a entirely new book which i have write in my hermitage of acquafredda face the blue adriatic it contain however some remark and notice which have already appear in article write by I for the great american agency the _ unite press _ and which have be reproduce by the american papers i have repeatedly state that i have not publish any document which be not mean for publication i have avail myself of my knowledge of the most important international act and of all diplomatic document merely as a guide but it be on fact that i have solidly base my consideration j keyne and robert lansing have already publish some very important thing but no secret document recently however tardieu and poincaré in the interest of the french nationalist thesis which they sustain have publish also document of a very reserved nature tardieu 's book be a documentary proof of the french government 's extremist attitude during the conference amply show that the present form of peace have be desire almost exclusively by france and that the other have be unwilling party to it besides he article in the _ revue des deux mondes

period which precede the first year of the war it all seem terribly remote something like a prehistoric era not only because the condition of life have change but because we viewpoint on life have swerve to a different angle something like thirty million dead have dig a chasm between two age war kill many million disease account for many more but the hardiest reaper have be famine the dead have build up a great cold barrier between the europe of yesterday and the europe of to-day we have live through two historic epoch not through two different period europe be happy and prosperous while now after the terrible world war she be threaten with a decline and a reversion to brutality which suggest the fall of the roman empire we ourselves do not quite understand what be happen around we more than two-third of europe be in a state of ferment and everywhere there prevail a vague sense of uneasiness ill-calculated to encourage important collective work we live as the say be from hand to mouth before 1914 europe have enjoy a prolonged period of peace attain a degree of wealth and civilization unrivalled in the past in central europe germany have spring up after the napoleonic invasion in the course of a century germany which a hundred year ago seem of all european country the least disposed to militarism have develop into a great military monarchy from be the most particularist country germany have in reality become the most unified state but what constitute she strength be not so much she army and navy as the prestige of she intellectual development she have achieve it laboriously almost painfully on a soil which be not fertile and within a limited territory but thanks to the tenacity of she effort she succeed in win a prominent place in the world-race for supremacy she university she institute for technical instruction she school be a model to the whole world in the course of a few year she have build up a merchant fleet which seriously threaten those of other country have arrive too late to create a real colonial empire of she own such as those of france and england she nevertheless succeed in exploit she colony most intelligently in the field of industry she appear to beat all competitor from a technical point of view and even in those industry which be not hers by habit and tradition she develop so powerful a organization as to appear almost uncanny germany hold first place not only in the production of iron but in that of dye and chemical man go there from all part of the world not only to trade but to acquire knowledge a ominous threat weigh on the empire namely the constitution of the state itself essentially militaristic and bureaucratic not even in russium perhaps be the rein of power hold in the hand of so few man as in germany and austria-hungary a few year before the world war start one of the lead european statesman tell I that there be everything to be fear for the future of europe where some three hundred million the inhabitant of russium germany and austria-hungary about two-third of the whole continent be govern in a almost irresponsible manner by a man without will or intelligence the tsar of russium a madman without a spark of genius the german kaiser and a obstinate old man hedge in by he ambition the emperor of austria-hungary not more than thirty person he add act as a control force on these three irresponsible sovereign who might assume on they own initiative the most terrible responsibility the magnificent spiritual gift of the german give they a emanuel kant the greatest thinker of modern time beethoven they greatest exponent of music and goethe they greatest poet but the imperial germany which come after the victory of 1870 have limit the spirit of independence even in the manifestation of literature and art there still exist in germany the most widely known man of science the best university the most up-to-date school but the clumsy mechanism tend to crush rather than to encourage all personal initiative great manifestation of art or thought be not possible without the most ample spiritual liberty germany be the most highly organize country from a scientific point of view but at the same time the country in which there be the least liberty for individual initiative it go on like a huge machine : that explain why it almost stop after be damage by the war and the whole life of the nation be paralyse while there be very few individual impulse of reaction imperial germany have always be lack in political ability perhaps not only through a temperamental fail but chiefly owe to she militaristic education before the war germany beat she neighbor in all the branch of human labor : in science industry banking commerce etc but in one thing she do not succeed and succeed still less after the war namely in politics when the german people be bless with a political genius such as frederick the great or bismarck it achieve the height of greatness and glory but when the same people after obtain the maximum of power find on its path william ii with he mediocre collaborator it ruin by war a colossal work not only to the great detriment of the country but also to that of the victor themselves of whom it can not be say with any amount of certainty so far as those of the continent be concerned whether they be the winner or the loser so great be the ruin threaten they and so vast the material and moral loss sustain i have always feel the deepest aversion for william ii so few as ten year ago he be still treat with the greatest sympathy both in europe and america even democracy regard with ill-dissimulated admiration the work of the kaiser who bring everywhere he voice he enthusiasm he activity to the service of germany as a matter of fact he speech be poor in phraseology a mere conglomerate of violence prejudice and ignorance as no one believe in the possibility of a war no one trouble about it but after the war nothing have be more harmful to germany than the memory of those ugly speech unrelieved by any noble idea and full of a clumsy vulgarity drape in a would-be solemn and majestic garb some of he threatening utterance such as the address to the troops sailing for china in order to quell the boxer rebellion the constant association in all he speech of the great idea of god with the ravings of a megalomaniac the frenzied oratory in which he indulge at the beginning of the war have harm germany more than anything else it be possible to lose nobly but to have lose a great war after have win so many battle would not have harm the german people if it have not be represent abroad by the presumptuous vulgarity of the kaiser and of all the member of he entourage who be more or less guilty of the same attitude before the war germany have everywhere attain first place in all form of activity except perhaps in certain spiritual and artistic manifestation she admire herself too much and too openly but succeed in affirm she magnificent expansion in a greatness and prosperity without rival by common accord germany hold first place probably this consciousness of power together with the somewhat brutal form of the struggle for industrial supremacy as in the case of the iron industry throw a mysterious and threatening shadow over the granitic edifice of the empire when i be minister of commerce in 1913 i receive a deputation of german business man who wish to confer with I on the italian custom regime they speak openly of the necessity of possess themselves of the iron mine of french lorraine they look upon war as a industrial fact germany have enough coal but not enough iron and the press of the iron industry trumpet forth loud note of war after the conclusion of peace when france through a series of wholly unexpected event see germany prostrate at she foot and without a army the same phenomenon take place the iron industry tend to affirm itself in france she have the iron and now she want coal should she succeed in get it german production would be doom to deprive germany of upper silesium would mean killing production after have disorganize it at the very root of its development seven year ago or thereabout germany be flourish in a unprecedented manner and present the most favourable condition for develop she powerful demographic structure be almost unique place in the center of europe after have withstand the push of so many people she have attain a unrivalled economic position close to germany the austro-hungarian empire unite together eleven different people not without difficulty and this union tend to the common elevation of all the vast monarchy the result of a slow aggregation of violence and of administrative wisdom represent perhaps the most interesting historic attempt on the part of different people to achieve a common rule and discipline on the same territory have successfully weather the most terrible financial crisis and have heal in half a century the wound of two great war which she have lose austria-hungary live in the effort of hold together german magyar slav and italian without they fly at each other ' throat time will show how the effort of austria-hungary have not be lose for civilization russium represent the largest empire which have ever be in existence and in spite of its defective political regime be daily progress perhaps for the first time in history a immense empire of twenty-one million and a half of square kilometre eighty-four time the size of italy almost three time as large as the united state of america be rule by a single man from the baltic to the yellow sea from finland to the caucasus one law and one rule govern the most different people scatter over a immense territory the method by which after peter the great the old duchy of muscovy have be transform into a empire still live in the administration they survive to-day in the bolshevist organization which represent less a revolution than a hieratic and brutal form of violence place at the service of a political organization the war between russium and japan have reveal all the peril of a political organization exclusively base on central authority represent by a few irresponsible man under the apparent rule of a sovereign not gifted with the slightest trace of will power those who exalt nationalist sentiment and pin they faith on imperialistic system fail to realize that while the greatest push towards the war come from country live under a less liberal regime those very country give proof of the least power of resistance modern war mean the full exploitation of all the human and economic resource of each belligerent country the greater a nation 's wealth the greater be the possibility to hold out and the perfection of arm and weapon be in direct ratio with the degree of technical progress attain moreover the combatant and the possibility of use they be in relation with the number of person who possess sufficient skill and instruction to direct the war germany great britain france italy the united state of america be able without any appreciable effort to improvise a enormous number of officer for the war transform professional man engineer and technician into officer russium who do not have a real industrial bourgeoisie nor a sufficient development of the middle class be only able to furnish a enormous number of combatant but a insufficient organization from a technical and military point of view and a very limited number of officer while on a peace foot she army be the most numerous in the world over one million three hundred thousand man when she officer begin to fail russium be unable to replace they so rapidly as the proportion of nine or ten time more than normal require by the war russium have always have a latent force of development there be within she a _ vis inertiae _ equivalent to a mysterious energy of expansion she birth-rate be higher than that of any other european country she do not progress she increase she weight act as a menace to neighbouring country and as by a mysterious historic law the primitive migration of people and the ancient invasion mostly originate from the territory now occupy by russium the latter have succeed in amalgamate widely different people and in create unity where no affinity appear possible at any rate although suffer from a excessively centralized government and a form of constitution which do not allow the development of popular energy nor a sufficient education of the people russium be perhaps half a century before the war the european country which consider the difficulty in she path have accomplish most progress european russium with she yearly excess of from one million and a half to two million birth over death with the development of she industry and the formation of important commercial centre progress very rapidly and be about to become the pivot of european politics when it will be possible to examine carefully the diplomatic document of the war and time will allow we to judge they calmly it will be see that russium 's attitude be the real and underlying cause of the world-conflict she alone promote and keep alive the agitation in serbium and of the slav in austrium she alone in germany 's eye represent the peril of the future germany have never believe in a french danger she know very well that france single handed could never have withstand germany numerically so much she superior russium be the only danger that germany saw and the continual increase of the russian army be she gravest preoccupation before the war when italy be germany 's ally the lead german statesman with whom i have occasion to discuss the situation do nothing but allude to the russian peril it be know -lrb- and subsequent fact have amply prove it -rrb- that the tsar be absolutely devoid of will power that he be lead and carry away by conflict current and that he adviser be for the most part favourable to the war after the japanese defeat the militarist party feel keenly the need for just such a great military revival and a brilliant _ revanche _ in europe possess a enormous wealth of raw material and a immense territory russium represent europe 's great resource she support for the future if the three great empire have attain enviable prosperity and development in 1914 when the war burst the three great western democracy great britain france and italy have likewise progress immensely great britain proud of she splendid isolation and ruler of the sea trade in every country of the world have the vastest empire she be also financially the greatest creditor country : creditor of america and asia of the new african state and of australium perhaps all this wealth have somewhat diminish the spirit of enterprise before the war and popular culture also suffer from this unprecedented prosperity there be not the spasmodic effort noticeable in germany but a continuous and secure expansion a undisputed supremacy although somewhat preoccupy at germany 's progress and regard it as a peril for the future great britain attach more importance to the problem of she empire namely to she internal constitution : like ancient rome she be a truly imperial country in the security of she supremacy in she calm in she forbearance france continue patiently to accumulate wealth she do not increase she population but ably add to she territory and she savings threaten with the phenomenon know to political economist under the name of oliganthropy or lack of man she have found a colonial empire which may be regard as the largest on earth it be true that the british colony even before the war cover a area of thirty million square kilometre while france 's colonial empire be slightly over twelve million but it must be remember that the british colony be not colony in the real sense of the word but consist chiefly in dominion which enjoy a almost complete autonomy canada alone represent about one-third of the territory of the british dominion australium and new zealand more than one-fourth and australasium the south african union and canada put together represent more than two-third of the empire while indium account for about fifty per cent of the miss third after england france be the most important creditor country she astonishing capacity for save increase in proportion with she wealth without have germany 's force of development and great britain 's power of expansion france enjoy a wonderful prosperity and she wealth be scatter all over the world italy have arise under the greatest difficulty but in less than fifty year of unity she progress steadily have a territory too small and mountainous for a population already overflow and constantly on the increase italy have be unable to exploit the limited resource of she subsoil and have be force to build up she industry in condition far less favourable than those of other country italy be perhaps the only nation which have succeed in form she industry without have any coal of she own and very little iron but the acquisition of wealth extremely difficult at first have gradually be render more easy by the improvement in technical instruction and method for the most part borrow from germany on the eve of the war after a period of thirty-three year the triple alliance have render the greatest service to italy fully confirm crispus 's political intuition france with whom we have have serious difference of opinion especially after the tuni affair do not dare to threaten italy because the latter belong to the triple alliance and for the same reason all idea of a conflict with austria-hungary have be set aside because of she form part of the triplice during the triple alliance italy build up all she industry she consolidate she national unity and prepare she economic transformation which be fraught with considerable difficulty suddenly she son spread all over the world stimulate by the fecundity of they race and by the narrowness of they field the greater state be surround by minor nation which have achieve considerable wealth and great prosperity europe throughout she history have never be so rich so far advance on the road to progress above all so united and living in she unity as regard production and exchange she be really a living unity the vital lymph be not limit to this or that country but flow with a even current through the vein and artery of the various nation through the great organization of capital and labor promote a continuous and increase solidarity among all the party concern in fact the idea of solidarity have greatly progress : economic moral and spiritual solidarity moreover the idea of peace although threaten by military oligarchy and by industrial corner be firmly base on the sentiment of the great majority the strain of barbaric blood which still ferment in many population of central europe constitute -- it be true -- a standing menace but no one dream that the threat be about to be follow lightning like by fact and that we be on the eve of a catastrophe europe have forget what hunger mean never have europe have at she disposal such abundant economic resource or a greater increase in wealth wealth be not we final object in life but a minimum of means be a indispensable condition of life and happiness excessive wealth may lead both to moral elevation and to depression and ruin europe have not only increase she wealth but develop the solidarity of she interest europe be a small continent about as large as canada or the united state of america but she economic tie and interest have be steadily on the increase now the development of she wealth mean for europe the development of she moral idea and of she social life and aspiration we admire a country not so much for its wealth as for the work of civilization which that wealth enable it to accomplish although peace be the aspiration of all people even as physical health be the aspiration of all live being there be war which can not be avoid as there be disease which help we to overcome a organic crisis to which we might otherwise succumb war and peace can not be regard as absolutely bad or absolutely good and desirable war be often wage in order to secure peace in certain case war be not only a necessary condition of life but may be a indispensable condition towards progress we must consider and analyze the sentiment and psychological cause which bring about a war a war wage to redeem its independence by a nation downtrodden by another nation be perfectly legitimate even from the point of view of abstract morality a war which have for its object the conquest of political or religious liberty can not be condemn even by the most confirm pacificist take as a whole the war fight in the nineteenth century war of nationality of independence of unity even colonial war be of a character far less odious than that of the great conflict which have devastate europe and upset the economic condition of the world it have not only be the greatest war in history but in its consequence it threaten to prove the worst war which have ravage europe in modern time after nearly every nineteenth-century war there have be a marked revival of human activity but this unprecedented clash of people have reduce the energy of all it have darken the mind of man and spread the spirit of violence europe will be able to make up for she loss in life and wealth time heal even the most painful wound but one thing she have lose which if she do not succeed in recover it must necessarily lead to she decline and fall : the spirit of solidarity after the victory of the entente the microbe of hate have develop and flourish in special culture consist of national egotism imperialism and a mania for conquest and expansion the peace treaty impose on the vanquish be nothing but arm of oppression what more could germany herself have do have she win the war perhaps she term would have be more lenient certainly not harder as she would have understand that condition such as we have impose on the loser be simply inapplicable three year have elapse since the end of the war two since the conclusion of peace nevertheless europe have still more man under arm than in pre-war time the sentiment of nationality twist and transform into nationalism aim at the subjugation and depression of other people no civilized co-existence be possible where each nation propose to harm instead of help its neighbor the spread of hatred among people have everywhere render more difficult the internal relation between social class and the economic life of each country fear a repetition of armed conflict and owe to that spirit of unrest and intolerance engender everywhere by the war worker be become every day more exact they too claim they share of the spoil they too clamor for enemy indemnity the same manifestation of hate the same violence of language spread from people to people and from class to class this tremendous war which the people of europe have fight and suffer have not only bleed the loser almost to death but it have deeply perturb the very life and existence of the victor it have not produce a single manifestation of art or a single moral affirmation for the last seven year the university of europe appear to be stricken with paralysis : not one outstanding personality have be reveal in almost every country the war have bring a sense of internal dissolution : everywhere this disquieting phenomenon be more or less noticeable with the exception perhaps of great britain whose privileged insular situation enormous mercantile navy and flourish trade in coal have enable she to resume she pre-war economic existence almost entirely no country have emerge scatheless from the war the rate of exchange soar daily to fantastic height and insuperable barrier to the commerce of european nation be be create people work less than they do in pre-war time but everywhere a tendency be noticeable to consume more austrium germany italy france be not different phenomenon but different manifestation and phase of the same phenomenon before the war europe in spite of she great sub-division represent a live economic whole to-day there be not only victor and vanquish but current of hate ferment of violence a hunger after conquest a unscrupulous cornering of raw material carry out brutally and almost ostentatiously in the name of the rights of victory : a situation which render production let alone its development and increase utterly impossible the treaty system as apply after the war have divide europe into two distinct part : the loser hold under the military and economic control of the victor be expect to produce not only enough for they own need but to provide a super-production in order to indemnify the winner for all the loss and damages sustain on account of the war the victor bind together in what be suppose to be a permanent alliance for the protection of they common interest be suppose to exercise a military action of oppression and control over the loser until the full payment of the indemnity another part of europe be in a state of revolutionary ferment and the entente power have by they attitude rather tend to aggravate than to improve the situation europe can only recover she peace of mind by remember that the war be over and do with unfortunately the treaty system not only prevent we from remember that the war be finish but determine a state of permanent war clemenceau bluntly declare to the french chamber that treaty be a means of continue the war he be perfectly right for war be be wage more bitterly than ever and peace be as remote as it ever be the problem with which modern statesman be confront be very simple : can europe continue in she decline without involve the ruin of civilization and be it possible to stop this process of decay without find some form of civil symbiosis which will ensure for all man a more human mode of living in the affirmative case what course should we take and be it presumable that there should be a immediate change for the better in the situation give the national and economic interest now openly and bitterly in conflict we have before we a problem or rather a series of problem which call for impartiality and calm if a satisfactory solution be to be arrive at perhaps if some fundamental truth be bring home to the people or to be more exact to the people now at loggerheads with each other a notion of the peril equally impend upon all concerned and the conviction that a indefinite prolongation of the present state of thing be impossible would prove decisive factor in restore a spirit of peace and in revive that spirit of solidarity which now appear spend or slumbering but in the first place it be necessary to review the situation such as it be at the present moment : firstly europe which be the creditor of all other continent have now become they debtor secondly she working capacity have greatly decrease chiefly owe to the negative change in she demographic structure in pre-war time the ancient continent supply new continent and new territory with a hardy race of pioneer and hold the record as regard population both adult and infantile the prevalence of woman over man be especially note by statistician all this have change considerably for the worse thirdly on the lose nation include germany which be generally understand to be the most culture nation in the world the victor have force a peace which practically amount to a continuation of the war the vanquish have have to give up they colony they ship they credit abroad and they transferable resource besides agree to the military and economic control of the ally moreover despite they desperate condition they be expect to pay a indemnity the amount of which although hitherto only vaguely mention surpass by its very absurdity all possibility of a even remote settlement fourthly considerable group of ex-enemy people chiefly german and magyar have be assign to population of a inferior civilization fifthly as a result of this state of thing while germany austrium and bulgarium have practically no army at all and have submit without the slightest resistance to the most stringent form of military control the victorious state have increase they army and fleet to proportion which they do not possess before the war sixthly europe cut up into thirty state daily see she buying capacity decrease and the rate of exchange rise menacingly against she seventhly the peace treaty be the most barefaced denial of all the principle which the entente power declare and proclaim during the war not only so but they be a fundamental negation of president wilson 's famous fourteen point which be suppose to constitute a solemn pledge and covenant not only with the enemy but with the democracy of the whole world eighthly the moral unrest derive from these condition have divide among themselves the various entente power : united state of america great britain italy and france not only in they aim and policy but in they sentiment the united state be anxious to get rid as far as possible of european complication and responsibility france follow method with which great britain and italy be not wholly in sympathy and it can not be say that the three great power of western europe be in perfect harmony there be still a great deal of talk about common end and ideal and the necessity of apply the treaty in perfect accord and harmony but everybody be convince that to enforce the treaty without attenuate or modify they term would mean the ruin of europe and the collapse of the victor after that of the vanquish ninthly a keen contest of nationalism land-grabbing and cornering of raw material render friendly relation between the thirty state of europe extremely difficult the most characteristic example of nationalist violence have arise out of the war as in the case of poland and other newborn state which pursue vain dream of empire while on the verge of dissolution through sheer lack of vital strength and energy and become every day more deeply engulf in misery and ruin finally continental europe be on the eve of a series of fresh and more violent war among people threaten to submerge civilization unless some means be find to replace the present treaty which be base on the principle that it be necessary to continue the war by a system of friendly agreement whereby winner and loser be place on a footing of liberty and equality and which while lay on the vanquish a weight they be able to bear will liberate europe from the present spectacle of a continent divide into two camp where one be arm to the tooth and threaten while the other unarmed and inoffensive be force to labor in slavish condition under the menace of a servitude even more severe ii the peace treaty and the continuation of the war the various peace treaty regulate the present territorial situation bear the name of the locality near pari in which they be sign : versaille saint-germain-en-laye trianon and sèvres the first deal with germany the second with austrium the third with hungary and the fourth with turkey the treaty of neuilly comparatively far less important concern bulgarium alone but the one fundamental and decisive treaty be the treaty of versaille inasmuch as it not only establish as a recognize fact the partition of europe but lay down the rule accord to which all future treaty be to be conclude history have not on record a more colossal diplomatic feat than this treaty by which europe have be neatly divide into two section : victor and vanquish the former be authorize to exercise on the latter complete control until the fulfilment of term which even at a optimistic point valuation would require at least thirty year to materialize although it be a matter of recent history we may as well call to mind that the entente power have always maintain that the war be want and be impose by germany that she alone with she ally repeatedly violate the rights of people that the world war could well be regard as the last war inasmuch as the triumph of the entente mean the triumph of democracy and a more human regime of life a society of nation rich in effect conducive to a lasting peace it be imperative to restore the principle of international justice in france in england in italy and later even more solemnly in the united state the same principle have be proclaim by head of state by parliament and government there be two document lay down and fix the principle which the entente power on the eve of that event of decisive importance the entry of the united state into the war bind themselves to sustain and to carry on to triumph the first be a statement by briand to the united state ambassador in the name of all the other ally date December 30 1916 briand speak in the name of all _ les gouvernements alliés unis pour la défense et la liberté des peuples _ briand 's second declaration date January 10 1917 be even more fundamentally important it be a collective note of reply to president wilson deliver in the name of all the ally to the united state ambassador the principle therein establish be very clearly enunciate accord to that document the entente have no idea of conquest and propose mainly to achieve the follow object : 1st restoration of belgium serbium and montenegro with the indemnity due to they 2nd evacuation of invade territory in france russium and rumanium and payment of just reparation 3rd reorganization of europe with a permanent regime base on the respect of nationality and on the right of all country both great and small to complete security and freedom of economic development besides territorial convention and international regulation capable of guarantee land and sea frontier from unjustified attack 4th restitution of the province and territory take in the past from the ally by force and against the wish of the inhabitant 5th liberation of italian slav rumanian and czeko-slovak from foreign rule 6th liberation of the people subject to the tyranny of the turk and expulsion from europe of the ottoman empire as be decidedly extraneous to western civilization 7th the intention of he majesty the emperor of russium in regard to poland be clearly indicate in the proclamation address to he army 8th the ally have never harbour the design of exterminate german people nor of bring about they political disappearance at that time the autocratic form of government still prevail in russium and the ally still consider themselves bind to russium 's aspiration moreover there exist in regard to italy the obligation establish by the pact of london that be why in the statement of the entente power of europe the restoration of montenegro be regard as a obligation mention be make of the necessity of drive the turk out of europe in order to enable russium to seize constantinople and as to poland there be only vague allusion namely the reference make to the tsar 's intention as outline in he proclamation the entente have win the war but russium have collapse under the strain have victory be achieve without the fall of russium the latter would have install herself as the predominate power in the mediterranean on the other hand to unite dalmatium to italy while separate she from italy accord to the pact of london by assign the territory of fiume to croatium would have mean set all the force of slav irredentism against italy these consideration be of no practical value inasmuch as event have take another course nobody can say what would have happen if the carthagenian have conquer the roman or if victory have remain with mithridate hypothesis be of but slight interest when truth follow another direction nevertheless we can not but repeat that it be a great fortune for europe that victory be not decide by russium and that the decisive factor prove the united state it be beyond all possible doubt that without the intervention of the united state of america the war could not have be win by the entente although the admission may prove humiliating to the european point of view it be a fact which can not be attenuate or disguise the united state throw into the balance the weight of its enormous economic and technical resource besides its enormous resource in man although its dead only amount to fifty thousand the united state build up such a formidable human reserve as to deprive germany of all hope of victory the announcement of america 's entry in the war immediately crush all germany 's power of resistance germany feel that the struggle be no longer limit to europe and that every effort be vain the united state besides give to the war enormous quantity of arm and money have practically inexhaustible reserve of man to place in the field against a enemy already exhaust and famine-stricken war and battle be two very different thing battle constitute a essentially military fact while war be a essentially political fact that explain why great leader in war have always be first and foremost great political leader namely man accustom to manage other man and able to utilize they for they purpose alexander julius caesar napoleon the three greatest military leader produce by aryan civilization be essentially political man war be not only a clash of arm it be above all the most convenient exploitation of man of economic resource and of political situation a battle be a fact of a purely military nature the roman almost constantly place at the head of they army personage of consular rank who regard and conduct the war as a political enterprise the rule of tactic and strategy be perfectly useless if those who conduct the war fail to utilize to the utmost all the means at they disposal it can not be deny that in the war germany and austria-hungary score the greatest number of victory for a long period they succeed in invade large tract of enemy territory and in recover those part of they own territory which have be invade besides always maintain the offensive they win great battle at the cost of enormous sacrifice in man and life and for a long time victory appear to shine on they arm but they fail to understand that from the day in which the violation of belgium 's neutrality determine great britain 's entry in the field the war from a general point of view could be regard as lose as i have say germany be especially lack in political sense : after bismarck she statesman have never rise to the height of the situation even von bülow who appear to be one of the cleverest never have a single manifestation of real intelligence the banal statement make about belgium and the united state of america by the man who direct germany 's war policy be precisely the sort of thing most calculate to harm the people from whom they come what be decidedly lack in germany while it abound in france be a political class now a political class consist of man of ability and culture can not but be the result of a democratic education in all modern state especially in those which have achieve a high standard of civilization and development it seem almost incredible that germany despite all she culture should have tolerate the political dictatorship of the kaiser and of he accomplice at the conference of pari and london in 1919 and 1920 i do all that be in my power to prevent the trial of the kaiser and i be convince that my firm attitude in the matter succeed in avoid it sound common sense save we from flounder in one of the most formidable blunder of the treaty of versaille to hold one man responsible for the whole war and to bring he to trial he enemy act as judge and jury would have be such a monstrous travesty of justice as to provoke a moral revolt throughout the world on the other hand it be also a moral monstrosity which would have deprive the treaty of versaille of every shred of dignity if the one responsible for the war be the kaiser why do the entente demand of the german people such enormous indemnity unprecedented in history one of the man who have exercise the greatest influence on european event during the last ten year one of the most intelligent of live statesman once tell I that it be he opinion that the kaiser do not want the war but neither do he wish to prevent it germany although under protest have be force to accept the statement of the versaille treaty to the effect that she be responsible for the war and that she provoke it the same charge have be level at she in all the entente state throughout the war when we country be engage in the struggle and we be at grip with a dangerous enemy it be we duty to keep up the _ morale _ of we people and to paint we adversary in the darkest color lay on they shoulder all the blame and responsibility of the war but after the great world conflict now that imperial germany have fall it would be absurd to maintain that the responsibility of the war be solely and wholly attributable to germany and that earlier than 1914 in europe there have not develop a state of thing fatally destine to culminate in a war if germany have the greatest responsibility that responsibility be share more or less by all the country of the entente but while the entente country in spite of they mistake have the political sense always to invoke principle of right and justice the statesman of germany give utterance to nothing but brutal and vulgar statement culminate in the deplorable mental and moral expression contain in the speech message and telegram of william ii he be a perfect type of the _ mile gloriosus _ not a harmless but a irritating and dangerous boaster who succeed in pile up more loathing and hatred against he country than the most active and intelligently manage enemy propaganda could possibly have do if the issue of the war could be regard as seriously jeopardize by england 's intervention it be practically lose for the central empire when the united state step in america 's decision definitely cripple germany 's resistance -- and not only for military but for moral reason in all he message president wilson have repeatedly declare that he want a peace base on justice and equity of which he outline the fundamental condition moreover he state that he have no quarrel with the german themselves but with the man who be at they head and that he do not wish to impose on the vanquished peace term such as might savor of oppression president wilson 's idea on the subject have be embody in a bulky volume -lrb- 1 -rrb- turn over the page of this book now we have the impression that it be a collection of literary essay by a man who have he eye on posterity and assume a pose most likely to attract the admiration of generation as yet unborn but when these same word be utter in the interval of mighty battle they fall on expectant and anxious ear : they be regard as a ray of light in the fearsome darkness of uncertainty and everybody listen to they not only because the president be the authorize exponent of a great nation of a powerful people but because he represent a inexhaustible source of vitality in the midst of the ravages of violence and death president wilson 's message have do as much as famine and cruel loss in the field to break the stubborn resistance of the german people if it be possible to obtain a just peace why go to the bitter end when defeat be manifestly inevitable obstinacy be the backbone of war and nothing undermine a nation 's power of resistance so much as doubt and faint-heartedness on the part of the govern class -lrb- footnote 1 : president wilson 's state speech and address new york 1918 -rrb- president wilson who say on January 2 1917 that a peace without victory be to be prefer -lrb- it must be a peace without victory -rrb- and that right be more precious than peace have also repeatedly affirm that we have no quarrel with the german people he only desire as the exponent of a great democracy a peace which should be the expression of right and justice evolve from the war a league of nation the first milestone in a new era of civilization a league destine to bind together ex-belligerent and neutral in one in germany where the inhabitant have to bear the most cruel privation president wilson 's word pronounce as a solemn pledge before the whole world have a most powerful effect on all class and greatly contribute towards the final breakdown of collective resistance democratic mind see a promise for the future while reactionary welcome any way out of they disastrous adventure after america 's entry in the war president wilson on

president wilson 's message have strangely enough be reproduce either incompletely or in a utterly mistaken form even in official document and in book publish by statesman who take a leading part in

calculate at vary figure commence from 350 billion have undergo considerable fluctuation i have give the general line of the treaty of versaille the other treaty far less important inasmuch as the situation of all the lose country be already well define especially as regard territorial question by the treaty of versaille be cast in the same mould and contain no essential variation now these treaty constitute a absolutely new fact and no one can affirm that the treaty of versaille derive even remotely from the declaration of the entente and from wilson 's solemn pledge utter in the name of those who take part in the war if the term of the armistice be deeply in contrast with the pledge to which the entente power have bind themselves before the whole world the treaty of versaille and the other treaty derive therefrom be a deliberate negation of all that have be promise amount to a debt of honor and which have contribute much more powerfully towards the defeat of the enemy than the entry in the field of many fresh division in the state of extreme exhaustion in which both conqueror and loser find themselves in 1918 in the terrible suffering of the germanic group of belligerent deprive for four year of sufficient nourishment and of the most elementary necessaries of life in the moral collapse which have take the place of boast and temerity the word of wilson who pledge himself to a just peace and establish its term proclaim they to the world have completely break down whatever force of resistance there still remain they be the most powerful instrument of victory and if not the essential cause certainly not the least important among the cause which bring about the collapse of the central empire germany have be deeply hit by the armistice oblige to hand over immediately 5000 locomotive and 150000 railway truck and carriage at the very time when she have to demobilize during the first month she find she traffic almost completely paralyse every war bring virulent germ of revolution in the vanquished country the war of 1870 give france the impulsive manifestation of _ la commune _ in exactly the same manner as war give rise in germany during the first month after the armistice to a violent revolutionary crisis overcome not without difficulty and still represent a grave menace force to surrender immediately a large quantity of live stock to demobilize when the best part of she railway material have go still hamper by the blockade germany against the interest of the ally themselves have be oblige to sacrifice she exchange because in the absence of sufficient help she have have to buy the most indispensable foodstuff in neutral country she paper currency which at the end of 1918 amount to twenty-two milliard mark not excessive as compare with that of other country immediately increase with a grow crescendo till it reach in a very short time the figure of eighty-eight milliard thus render from the very first the payment of indemnity in gold extremely difficult the most skilled man have be thrust into a absolute impossibility of produce to have deprive germany of she merchant fleet build up with so much care mean to have deprive the freight market of sixty thousand of the most skilled intelligent and hard-working seaman but what germany have lose as a result of the treaty surpass all imagination and can only be regard as a sentence of ruin and decay voluntarily pass over a whole people germany without take into account the country subject to plebiscite have lose 75 per cent of she population should the plebiscite prove unfavourable to she or as the tendency seem to be should these plebiscite be disregard germany would lose 135 per cent of she population purely german territory have be forcibly wrench from she what have be do in the case of the saar have no precedent in modern history it be a country of 650000 inhabitant of whom not even one hundred be french a country which have be german for a thousand year and which be temporarily occupy by france for purely military reason in spite of these fact however not only have the coal field of the saar be assign in perpetuity to france as compensation for the damages cause to the french mine in the north but the territory of the saar form part of the french custom regime and will be subject after fifteen year to a plebiscite when such a necessity be absolutely incomprehensible as the population be purely german and have never in any form or manner express the intention of change its nationality the ebb and flow of people in europe during the long war of nationality have often change the situation of frontier country sometimes it may still be regard as a necessity to include small group of alien race and language in different state in order to ensure strategically safe frontier but with the exception of the necessity for self-defence there be nothing to justify what have be do to the detriment of germany wilson have only say that france should receive compensation for the wrong suffer in 1871 and that belgium should be evacuate and reconstruct what have be destroy be to have be build up again but no one have ever think during the war of hand over to belgium a part however small of german territory or of surrender predominantly and purely german territory to poland the german colony cover a area of nearly 3000000 square kilometre they have reach a admirable degree of development and be manage with the greatest skill and ability they represent a enormous value nevertheless they have be assign to france great britain and in minor proportion to japan without figure at all in the reparation account it be calculate that as a result of the treaty owe to the loss of a considerable percentage of she agricultural area germany be twenty-five per cent the poorer in regard to the production of cereal and potato and ten to twelve per cent in regard to the breeding of live stock the restitution of alsace-lorraine -lrb- the only formal claim advance by the entente in its war program -rrb- have deprive germany of the bulk of she iron-ore production in 1913 germany could count on 21000000 ton of iron from lorraine 7000000 from luxemburg 138000 from upper silesium and 7344 from the rest of she territory this mean that germany be reduce to only 2041 per cent of she pre-war wealth in iron ore in 1913 the saar district represent 895 per cent of the total production of coal and upper silesium 2285 per cent have lose about eighty per cent of she iron ore and large stock of coal while she production be severely handicapped germany completely disorganize abroad after the suppression of all economic equilibrium be condemn to look on helplessly while the very source of she national wealth dry up and cease to flow in order to form a correct estimate of the fact we must hold in mind that one-fifth of germany 's total export before the war consist of iron and of tool and machinery mostly manufacture with german iron if we now consider the fourteen point of president wilson accept by the entente as a peace program compare the actual result obtain by the treaty of versaille we be face with the follow situation : 1 _ after loyal peace negotiation and the conclusion and signing of peace treaty secret diplomatic agreement must be regard as abolish _ say wilson on the contrary secret peace negotiation have be protracted for more than six month and no hearing be even grant to the german delegate who wish to expose they view by a system of treaty france have create a military alliance with belgium and poland thus completely corner germany 2 _ absolute freedom of the sea beyond territorial water _ nothing as a matter of fact have be change from the pre-war state of thing with the difference that the loser have have to surrender they mercantile fleet and be therefore no longer directly interested in the question 3 _ removal of all economic barrier and equality of trade condition _ the treaty impose on germany term without reciprocity and almost all entente country have already adopt protectionist and prohibitive tariff 4 _ adequate guarantee to be give and receive for the reduction of armament to a minimum compatible with home defense _ the treaty have compel the vanquished country to destroy or to surrender they navy and have reduce the standing army of germany to 100000 man include officer of bulgarium to 23000 of austrium to 30000 -lrb- in reality only 21000 -rrb- of hungary to 35000 the conquer state on the other hand maintain enormous army numerically superior to those which they have before the war france belgium and poland have between they about 1400000 man with the color germany austrium hungary and bulgarium altogether have only 179000 man under arm while rumanium alone have 206000 and poland more than 450000 man 5 _ loyal and straightforward settlement of colonial rights and claim base chiefly on the advantage of the people directly concerned _ all she colony have be take from germany who need they more than any other country of continental europe have a density of population of 123 inhabitant per square kilometre -lrb- italy have a density of 133 per square kilometre -rrb- while france have 74 spain 40 and european russium before the war have only 24 6 _ evacuation of all russian territory and cordial co-operation for the reconstruction and development of russium _ for a long time the entente have give its support to the military venture of koltchak judenic denikin and wrangel all man of the old regime 7 _ evacuation and reconstruction of belgium _ this have be do but to belgium have be assign territory which she never dream of claim before the war 8 _ liberation of french territory reconstruction of invade region and restitution of alsace-lorraine to france in respect of the territory take from she in 1871 _ france occupy a dominate position in the saar which constitute a absolute denial of the principle of nationality 9 _ rectification of the italian frontier accord to clearly define line of nationality _ as these line have never be clearly define or recognize the solution arrive at have be distasteful both to the italian and to they neighbor 10 _ the people of austria-hungary to be leave free to unite together or to form autonomous state in the manner best suit to they development _ as a matter of fact the treaty have take the greatest possible number of german from austrium and of magyar from hungary in order to hand they over to poland to czeko-slovakium to rumanium and to jugo-slavia namely to population for the most part inferior to the german 11 _ evacuation of rumanium serbium and montenegro _ this have be effect but whereas the entente power have always proclaim they fundamental duty for the reconstruction of montenegro they all contribute to its disappearance chiefly at the instigation of france 12 _ a limited sovereignty to the turkish part of the ottoman empire liberation of other nationality and freedom of navigation in the dardanelle place under international guarantee _ what really happen be that the entente power immediately try to possess themselves of asia minor but event render it necessary to adopt a regime of mandate because direct sovereignty would have be too perilous a experiment a sense of deep perturbation and unrest pervade the whole of islam 13 _ a independent polish state with population undoubtedly polish to be found as a neutral state with a free and secure outlet to the sea and whose integrity be to be guarantee by international accord _ in reality a polish state have be form with population undoubtedly non-polish have a markedly military character and aim at further expansion in ukranian and german territory it have a population of 31000000 inhabitant while it should not exceed 18000000 and propose to isolate russium from germany moreover the free state of danzig practically dependent from poland constitute a standing menace to germany 14 _ foundation of the league of nation for the sole purpose of re-establish order among nation and lay the basis of reciprocal guarantee of territorial integrity and political independence for all state both great and small _ after more than two year have elapse since the conclusion of peace and three since the armistice the league of nation be still nothing but a holy alliance the object of which be to guarantee the privilege of the conqueror after the vote of the senate deserving of all praise from every point of view the united state do not form part of the league nor do the lose country include germany it be therefore obvious that the most solemn pledge on which peace be base have not be maintain the noble declaration make by the entente during the war have be forget forget all the solemn collective pledge forget and disregard wilson 's proclamation which without be real contract or treaty be something far more solemn and bind a pledge take before the whole world at its most tragic hour to give the enemy a guarantee of justice without express any opinion on the treaty it can not be deny that the manner in which they have be apply have be even worse for the first time in civilized europe not during the war when everything be permissible in the supreme interest of defense but now that the war be over the entente power though maintain army more numerous than ever for which the vanquish must pay have occupy german territory inhabit by the most culture progressive and technically advanced population in the world as a insult and a slight with color troops man from darkest and most barbarous africa to act as defender of the rights of civilization and to maintain the law and order of democracy iii the peace treaty -- they origin and aim how after the solemn pledge undertake during the war a peace could have be conclude which practically negative all the principle profess during the war and all the obligation enter into be easily explain when the progress of event be note from the autumn of 1918 to the end of the spring of 1919 i take no direct part in those event as i have no share in the government of italy from January to the end of June 1919 the period during which the treaty of versaille and saint-germain-en-laye be be prepare the orlando ministry be resign when the treaty of versaille be draw up for signature and the situation which confront the ministry of which i be head be clearly define nevertheless i ask the minister of foreign affair and the delegate of the precede cabinet to put they signature to it sign be a necessity and it fall to I later on to put my signature to the ratification the treaty of versaille and those which have follow with austrium hungary bulgarium and turkey have be validly sign and they pledge the good faith of the country which have sign they but in the application of they there be need of great breadth of view there be need of dispassionate study to see if they can be maintain if the fulfilment of the impossible or unjust condition demand of the conquer country will not do more harm to the conqueror will not in point of actual fact pave the way to they ruin if there be one thing lloyd george have say which will never be forget or forgive it be arrogance and injustice in the hour of triumph we have never tire of say that germany be the most barbarous among civilized country that under she civilization be hide all the barbarism of mediaeval time that she put into practice the doctrine of might over right at the present moment it be we duty to ask ourselves if something of the principle which we have for so long be attribute to germany have not pass over to the other side if in we own heart there be not a bitterness of hatred clouding we judgment and rob we program of all action that can do real good prussium win the war against austria-hungary in 1866 and do not ask for or impose any really onerous term it be contented with have regain hegemony among the german people prussia conquer france in 1870 it be a unjust war and prussium lay down two unjust condition : alsace-lorraine and the indemnity of five milliard as soon as the indemnity be pay -- and it be a indemnity that could be pay in one lump sum -- prussium evacuate the occupied territory it do not claim of france its colony or its fleet it do not impose the reduction of its armament or control of its transport after the peace the treaty of frankfort be a humanitarian act compare with the treaty of versaille if germany have win the war -- germany to whom we have always attribute the worst possible intention -- what could it have do that the entente have not do it be possible that as it be gifted with more practical common sense it might have lay down less impossible condition in order to gain a secure advantage without ruin the conquer country there be about ninety million of german in europe and perhaps fifteen million in different country outside europe but in the heart of europe they represent a great ethnic unity they be the largest and most compact national group in that continent with all the good and bad point of they race too methodical and at the same time easily depress by a severe setback they be still the most cultivate people on earth it be impossible to imagine that they can disappear much less that they can reconcile themselves to live in a condition of slavery on the other hand the entente have build on a foundation of shift sand a europe full of small state poison with imperialism and in ruinous condition of economy and finance and a too great poland without a national basis and necessarily the enemy of russium and of germany no people have always be victorious the people who have fight most war in modern europe english french and german have have alternate victory and defeat a defeat often carry in its train reconsideration which be follow by renew energy : the greatness of england be largely due to its steadfast determination to destroy the napoleonic empire what elevate man be this steadfast and persevere effort and a series of such collective effort carry a nation to a high place there be nothing lasting in the exist grouping at the moment of common danger eternal union and unbreakable solidarity be proclaimed but both be mere literary expression great britain the country which have the least need to make war have be at war for century with nearly all the european country there be one country only against which it have never make war not even when a commercial challenge from the mercantile republic of italy seem possible that country be italy that show that between the action of italy there be not nor can there be contrast and indeed that between the two nation there be complete agreement in european continental policy it be the common desire of the two nation though perhaps for different reason that no one state shall have hegemony on the continent but between the year 1688 and 1815 great britain and france be at war for seventy year : for seventy year that be out of a hundred and twenty-seven there be a state of deadly hostility between the two country general progress evince in various way above all in respect for and in the autonomy of other people be a guarantee for all no people be always victorious none always conquer in the time of napoleon the first the french deride the lack of right spirit in the german people producer of any number of philosopher and writer they would have laugh at anyone who suggest the possibility of any early german military triumph after 1815 the country of the holy alliance would never have believe in the possibility of the revolutionary spirit recover they be sure of last peace in europe in 1871 the german have no doubt at all that they have surely smother france now the entente think that it have surely smother germany but civilization have gain something : it have gain that collection of rule moral condition sentiment international regulation which tend both to mitigate violence and to regulate in a form which be tolerable if not always just relation between conqueror and conquer above all a respect for the liberty and autonomy of the latter now the treaty which have be make be from the moral point of view immeasurably worse than any consummate in former day in that they carry europe back to a phase of civilization which be think to be over and do with century ago they be a danger too for as everyone who take vengeance do so in a degree greater than the damage suffer if one suppose for a moment that the conquer of to-day may be the conqueror of to-morrow to what length of violence degradation and barbarism may not europe be drag every effort then should now be make to follow the opposite road to that traverse up to now the more so in that the treaty can not be carry out and if it be desire that the conquer country shall pay compensation to the conqueror at least in part for the most serious damage then the line to be follow must be base on reality instead of on violence but before try to see how and why the treaty can not be carry out it may be well to consider how the actual system of treaty have be reach in complete opposition to all that be say by the entente during the war and to president wilson 's fourteen point at the same time ought to be examine the cause which lead in six month from the declaration of the entente and of president wilson to the treaty of versaille the most important cause for what have happen be the choice of pari as the meeting-place of the conference after the war pari be the least fit of any place for the holding of a peace conference and in the two french leader the president of the republic poincaré and the president of the council of minister clemenceau even if the latter be more adaptable in mind and more open to consideration of argument on the other side be two temperament drive inevitably to extreme victory have come in a way that surpass all expectation a people that live through every day the war have last have pass through every sorrow privation agony have now but one thought to destroy the enemy the atmosphere of pari be fiery the decision of the peace term to be impose on the enemy be to be take in a city which a few month before one might really say a few week before have be under the fire of the long-range gun invent by the german in hourly dread of enemy aeroplane even now it be inexplicable that president wilson do not realize the situation which must inevitably come about it be possible that the delirium of enthusiasm with which he be receive at pari may have give he the idea that it be in he alone that the people trust may have make he take the welcome give to the representative of the decide factor of the war as the welcome to the principle which he have proclaim to the world month later when he leave france amid general indifference if not distrust president wilson must have realize that he have lose not popularity but prestige the one sure element of success for the head of a government much more so for the head of a state it be inevitable that a peace conference hold in paris only a few month after the war with the direction and preparation of the work almost entirely in french hand and with clemenceau at the head of everything should conclude as it do conclude all the more so when italy hold apart right from the beginning and england though convinced of the mistake be make could not act freely and effectively the first duty of the peace conference be to restore a state of equilibrium and re-establish condition of life take europe as a economic unity break by the war it be necessary first of all and in the interest of all to re-establish condition of life which would make it possible for the crisis to be overcome with the least possible damage i do not propose to tell the story of the conference and it be as well to say at once that i do not intend to make use of any document place in my hand for official purpose but the story of the pari conference can now be tell with practical completeness after what have be publish by jm keyne in he noble book on the economic consequence of the war and by the american secretary of state robert lansing and after the statement make in the british and french parliament by lloyd george and clemenceau but from the political point of view the most interesting document be still andré tardieu 's book _ la paix _ to which clemenceau write a preface and which express from the point of view of the french delegation at the conference the program which france lay before itself and what it obtain this book explain how the principal decision be take and indeed can be fairly consider to show in a more reliable way than any other publication extant how the work of the conference proceed for not only be m tardieu one of the french delegate to the conference one of those who sign the versaille treaty but also he prepare the plan of work as well as the solution of the most important question in he capacity of trust agent of the prime minister the determination in the mind of president wilson when he come to paris be to carry through he program of the league of nation he be fickle in he infallibility but he have the firmest faith that he be work for the peace of the world and above all for the glory of the united state of european thing he be supremely ignorant we be bind to recognize he good faith but we be not in the least bind on that account to admit he capacity to tackle the problem which with he academic simplicity he set himself to solve when he arrive in europe he have not even prepare in outline a scheme of what the league of nation be to be the principal problem find he unprepared and the duty of the crowd of expert -lrb- sometimes not too expert -rrb- who follow he seem rather to be to demonstrate the truth of he idea than to prepare material for seriously think out decision he could have make no greater mistake than he do in come to europe to take part in the meeting of the conference he figure lose relief at once in a way it seem to lose dignity the head of a state be take part in meeting of head of government one of the latter preside it be a giant compel to live in a cellar and thereby sacrifice he height he be surround by formal respect and in some decision he exercise almost despotic authority but he work be none the less disorder there be a semblance of give in to he while he be give away he entire program without be aware of it in he ignorance of european thing he be bring without recognize it to accept a series of decision not superficially in opposition to he fourteen point but which do actually nullify they great britain be part of europe but be not on the continent of europe while germany france italy austria russium hungary holland belgium etc live the same life be one in think great britain life in she superb insularity if she have any moment of supreme anxiety during the war it be in the spring and summer of 1917 during the terrible threat of the destruction of she shipping by submarine and the inability of construction to keep pace with it but after the defeat of germany great britain find herself with a fleet far superior to those of all the rest of europe put together once more she break away from continental europe lloyd george with swiftly act brain and clear insight undoubtedly the most remarkable man at the pari conference find himself in a difficult situation between president wilson 's pronouncement some of they like that regard the freedom of the sea undefined and dangerous and the claim of france tend after the brutal attack it have have to meet not towards a true peace and the reconstruction of europe but towards the vivisection of germany in one of the first moment just before the general election lloyd george too promise measure of the greatest severity the trial of the kaiser the punishment of all guilty of atrocity compensation for all who have suffer from the war the widest and most complete indemnity but such pronouncement give way before he clear realization of fact and later on he try in vain to put the conference on the plane of such realization italy as m tardieu say very plainly carry no weight in the conference in the meeting of the prime minister and president wilson _ le ton était celuus de la conversation nul apparat nulle pose m orlando parlait peu l'activité de l'italie à la conference a été jusqu ' à l'excès absorbée par la question de fiume et sa part dans les débats a été de ce fait trop réduite restait un dialogue à troi : wilson clemenceau lloyd george _ the italian government come into the war in may 1915 on the basis of the london agreement of the precede April and it have never think of claim fiume either before the war when it be free to lay down condition or during the progress of the war the italian people have always be keep in ignorance of the principle establish in the london agreement one of the man chiefly responsible for the american policy openly complain to I that when the united state come into the war no notification be give they of the london agreement in which be define the future condition of part of europe a far worse mistake be make in the failure to communicate the london agreement to serbium which would certainly have accept it without hesitation in the terrible position in which it then be but the most serious thing of all be that italian minister be unaware of its provision till after its publication in london by the organ of the jugo-slav which have evidently receive the text from petrograd where the bolshevik have publish it in italy the london agreement be a mystery to everyone its text be know only to the president of the council and the minister for foreign affair of the war cabinet thus only four or five people know about it secrecy be strictly keep and moreover it can not possibly be say that it be in accordance either with national ideal or the current of public opinion much less with any intelligent conception of italy 's need and italy 's future the framer of the london agreement never think of fiume indeed they specifically express they willingness that it should go to croatia whether in the case of austria-hungary remain unite or of the detachment of croatium from it it be not true that it be through the opposition of russium or of france that the italian framer of the london agreement give up all claim to fiume there be no opposition because there be no claim the representative of russium and france have tell I officially that no renunciation take place through any action on the part of they government because no claim be ever make to they on the other hand after the armistice and when it become know through the newspaper that the london agreement give fiume to croatia a very strong movement for fiume arise fan by the government itself and a equally strong movement in fiume also if in the london agreement instead of claim large area of dalmatium which be entirely or almost entirely slav provision have be make for the constitution of a state of fiume place in a condition to guarantee not only the people of italian nationality but the economic interest of all the people in it and surround it there be no doubt that such a claim on the part of italy would have go through without opposition during the pari conference the representative of italy show hardly any interest at all in the problem concern the peace of europe the situation of the conquer people the distribution of raw material the regulation of the new state and they relation with the victor country they concentrate all they effort on the question of fiume that be to say on the one point in which italian action be fundamentally weak in that when it be free to enter into the war and lay down condition of peace at the moment when the entente be without america 's invaluable assistance and be begin to doubt the capacity of russium to carry on it have never even ask for fiume in its war treaty that it have make the inexplicable mistake of neglect to communicate that treaty to the united state when that country come into the war and to serbium at the moment when italy 's effort be most valuable for its help at the conference italy have no directing policy it have be a part of the system of the german alliance but it have leave its ally germany and austria-hungary because it recognize that the war be unjust and have remain neutral for ten month then enter into the war freely and without obligation there be one road for it to follow that of proclaim solemnly and defend the principle of democracy and justice indeed that be a moral duty in that the break with the two country with which italy have be in alliance for thirty-three year become a matter not only of honesty but of duty solely through the injustice of the cause for which they have proclaim a offensive war it be not possible for italy to go to war to realize the dream of unite the italian land to the nation for she have enter the system of alliance of the central empire and have stay there long year while have all the time italian territory unjustly subject to austria-hungary the annexation of the italian land to the kingdom of italy have to be the consequence of the affirmation of the principle of nationality not the reason for go to war in any case for italy which have lay on itself in the london agreement the most absurd limitation which have confine its war aim within exceedingly modest limit which have no share in the distribution of the wealth of the conquer country which come out of the war without raw material and without any share in germany 's colonial empire it be a matter not only of high duty but of the greatest utility to proclaim and uphold all those principle which the entente have so often and so publicly proclaimed as its war policy and its war aim but in the pari conference italy hardly count without any definite idea of its own policy it follow france and the united state sometimes it follow great britain there be no affirmation of principle at all the country which among all the european war power have suffer most severely in proportion to its resource and should have make the greatest effort to free itself from the burden impose on it take no part in the most important decision it have to be add that these be arrive at between march 24 and may 7 while the italian representative be absent from pari or have return there humble without have be recall after interminable discussion which decide very little especially with regard to the league of nation which arise before the nation be constitute and could live real vital question be tackle as be see from the report of the conference on march 24 and it be a fact that between that date and may 7 the whole treaty be put in shape : territorial question financial question economic question colonial question now at that very moment on account of the question of fiume and fiume alone for some inscrutable reason the italian delegate think good to retire from the conference to which they return later without be invite and during that time all the demonstration against president wilson take place in italy not without some grave responsibility on the part of the government italy receive least consideration in the peace treaty among all the conquer country it be practically put on one side it have to be note that both in the armistice and in the peace treaty the most serious decision be arrive at almost incidentally moreover they be always vitiate by slight concession apparently of importance on November 2 1917 when the representative of the different nation meet at paris to fix the term of armistice m tardieu relate the question of reparation for damages be decide quite incidentally it be worth while reproduce what he say in he book take from the official report : m clemenceau : _ je voudrai venir maintenant sur la question des réparations et des tonnage on ne comprenderait pa chez nous en france que nous n'inscrivion pas dans l'armistice une clause à cet effet ce que je vous demande c'est l'addition de trois mots : réparations des dommages sans autre commentaire le dialogue suivant s ' établit _ : m hyman : _ celum serait-il une condition d'armistice _ m sonnino : _ c'est plutôt une condition de paix _ m bonar law : _ il est inutile d'insérer dan les condition d'armistice une clause qui ne pourrait être exécutée dans un bref délai _ m clemenceau : _ je ne veux que mentionner le principe vous ne devez pas oublier que la population française est une de celles qui ont le plus souffert elle ne comprendrait pas que nous ne fission pas allusion à cette clause _ m lloyd george : _ si vous envisage le principe des réparations sur terre il faut mentionner aussi celui des réparations pour les navires coulés _ m clemenceau : _ je comprend tout celum dans mes trois mots réparations des dommages je supplie le conseil de se mettre dans l'esprit de la population française _ m vessitch : _ et serbe _ m hyman : _ et belge _ m sonnino : _ et italienne aussi _ m house : _ puisqu'est une question importante pour tous je propose l'addition de m clemenceau _ m bonar law : _ c'est deja dit dans notre lettre au président wilson qui la comuniquera à l'allemagne il est inutile de la dire deux fois _ m orlando : _ j' accepte en principe quoiqu'il n'en ait pas été fait mention dans les condition de l'armistice avec l'autriche _ _ l'addition réparations des dommages est alors adoptée m klotz propose de mettre en tête de cette addition les mots : sous réserve de toutes revendication et restaurations ultérieures de la part des alliés et des etats-unis il est ainsi décidé _ if i be at liberty to publish the official report of the doings of the conference while the various peace treaty be be prepare as mm poincaré and tardieu have publish secret act it would be see that the proceedings be very much the same in every case meanwhile we may confine ourselves to a examination of the report as give by m tardieu the question of reparation of damages be not a condition of the armistice it have not be accept clemenceau bring the question up again solely in homage to french public opinion the suggestion be to write in simply the three word : _ reparation of damages _ it be true that these three word determine a policy and that there be no mention of it in the claim of the entente in the fourteen point of president wilson or in the armistice between italy and austria-hungary in he fourteen point wilson confine himself in the matter of damages to the follow claim : -lrb- 1 -rrb- reconstruction of belgium -lrb- 2 -rrb- reconstruction of french territory invade -lrb- 3 -rrb- reparation for territory invade in serbium montenegro and rumanium there be no other claim or statement in the fourteen point on the other hand the pronouncement _ réparation des dommages _ include as in fact be afterwards include any claim for damage by land or sea the representative of belgium italy and great britain remark that it be a condition of peace not of armistice but clemenceau make it a question of regard and consideration for france france would not understand there be no mention of it there be no desire to define anything only just to mention it and in three simple word i ask you say clemenceau to put yourselve into the spirit of the people of france at once the british representative note the necessity of a clear statement regard reparation for loss at sea through submarine and mine and all the serbian the belgian and last of all the italian at once call attention to they own damages mr house not realize the wide and serious nature of the claim say that it be a important question for all while america have already state in the word of the president of the republic that it renounce all indemnity of any nature whatsoever so be establish quite incidentally the principle of indemnity for damages which give the treaty a complete turn away from the spirit of the pronouncement by the entente and the united state equally incidentally be establish all the declaration in the treaty the purpose of which be not easy to understand except in so far as it be see in the economic result which may accrue article 231 of the treaty of versaille state that the ally and associate government affirm and germany accept the responsibility of germany and she ally for cause all the loss and damage to which the ally and associate government and they people have be subject as a consequence of the war impose on they by the aggression of germany and she ally article 177 of the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye state in the same way that the ally and associate government affirm and austria-hungary accept the responsibility of austrium and she ally etc this article be common to all the treaty and it would have no more than historic and philosophic interest if it be not follow by another article in which the ally and associate government recognize that the resource of germany -lrb- and of austria-hungary etc -rrb- be not adequate after take into account permanent diminution of such resource which will result from other provision of the present treaty to make complete reparation for all such loss and damage the ally and associate government however require and germany undertake that she will make compensation for all damage do to the civilian population of the ally and associate power and to they property during the period of the belligerency of each as a ally or associate power against germany by such aggression by land by sea and from the air and in general all damage as define in the treaty comprise many of the burden of war -lrb- war pension and compensation to soldier and they family cost of assistance to family of those mobilize during the war etc -rrb- there be nothing more useless indeed more stupid than to take you enemy by the throat after you have beat he and force he to declare that all the wrong be on he side the declaration be of no use whatever either to the conqueror because no importance can be attribute to a admission extort by force or to the conquer because he know that there be no moral significance in be force to state what one do not believe or for third party because they be well aware of the circumstance under which the declaration be make it be possible that president wilson want to establish a moral reason -- i do not like to say a moral alibi -- for accept as he be constrain by necessity to accept all those condition which be the negation of what he have solemnly lay down the moral pledge of he people of the american democracy germany and the conquer country have accept the condition impose on they with the reserve that they feel that they be not bind by they even morally in the future the future will pour ridicule on this new form of treaty which endeavor to justify excessive and absurd demand which will have the effect of destroy the enemy rather than of obtain any sure benefit by use a forced declaration which have no value at all i have always detest german imperialism and also the phase of exaggerated nationalism which have grow up in every country after the war and have be eliminate one after the other through the simple fact of they be common to all country but only after have bring the greatest possible harm to all the people and i can not say that germany and she ally be solely responsible for the war which devastate europe and throw a dark shadow over the life of the whole world that statement which we all make during the war be a weapon to be use at the time now that the war be over it can not be look on as a serious argument a honest and thorough examination of all the diplomatic document all the agreement and relation of pre-war day compel I to declare solemnly that the responsibility for the war do not lie solely on the defeat country that germany may have desire war and prepare for it under the influence of powerful industrial interest metallurgic for instance responsible for the extreme view of newspaper and other publication but still all the war country have they share of responsibility in differ degree it can not be say that there exist in europe two group with a moral conception differ to the point of complete contrast on one side germany austria-hungary turkey and bulgarium responsible for the war which they impose by they aggression on the other all the free and independent nation by the side of england france italy and the united state there be russium which must bear if not the greatest a very great responsibility for what happen nor be it true that armament expense in the ten year precede the war be greater in the central empire or to put it better in the state form the triple alliance than in the country which later form the european entente it be not true that only in the case of germany be the war aim imperialist and that the entente country come in without desire of conquest put aside for the moment what one see in the treaty which have follow the war it be worth while consider what would have happen if russium have win the war instead of be tear to piece before victory come russium would have have all the poland of the eighteenth century -lrb- with the apparent autonomy promise by the tsar -rrb- nearly all turkey in europe constantinople and a great part of asia minor russium with already the greatest existing land empire and at least half the population not russian would have gain fresh territory with fresh non-russian population put the mediterranean people and above all italy in a very difficult situation indeed it can not be say that in the ten year precede the war russium do not do as much as germany to bring unrest into europe it be on account of russium that the serbian government be a perpetual cause of disturbance a perpetual threat to austria-hungary the unending strife in the balkan be cause by russium in no less degree than by austria-hungary and all the great european nation share with oppose view in the policy of eastern expansion the judgment of people and of event give the uncertainty of policy as express in parliament and newspaper be variable to the last degree it will be enough to recall the vary judgment upon serbium during the last ten year in the press of great britain france and italy : the people of serbium have be describe as criminal and hero assassin and martyr no one would have anything to do with serbium later serbium be raise to the sky the document publish by kautsky in germany and those reveal from time to time by the moscow government prove that the preparation for and conviction of war be not only on the part of the central empire but also and in no less degree on the part of the other state one point will always remain inexplicable : why russium should have take the superlatively serious step of general mobilization which could not be and be not a simple measure of precaution it be beyond doubt that the russian mobilization precede even that of austrium after a close examination of event after the bitter feeling of war have pass in he speech of December 23 1920 lloyd george say justly that the war break out without any government have really desire it all in one way or another slither into it stumble and trip there be three monarchy in europe the russian german and austro-hungarian empire and the fact that they be divide into two group necessarily lead to war it be inevitable sooner or later russium be the greatest danger the greatest threat to europe what happen have to happen under one form or another the crazy giant be under the charge of one man without intelligence and a band of man the man of the old regime largely without scruple each country of europe have its share of responsibility italy not exclude it be difficult to explain why italy go to tripolus in the way in which she do in 1911 bring about the italo-turkish war which bring about the two balkan war and the policy of adventure of serbium which be the incident though not the cause of the european war the libyan adventure consider now in the serene light of reason can not be look on as anything but a aberration libya be a immense box of sand which never have any value nor have it now tripolitania cyrenaica and fezzan cover more than one million one hundred thousand square kilometre and have less than nine hundred thousand inhabitant of whom even now after ten year less than a third be under the effective control of italy with the war and expense of occupation libya have cost italy about seven milliard lira and for a long time yet it will be on the debit side in the life of the nation with the same number of milliard most of which be spend before the european war italy could have put in order and utilize she immense patrimony of water-power and to-day would be free from anxiety about the coal problem by which it be actually enslave the true policy of the nation be to gain economic independence not a barren waste ignorant people speak of libya in italy as a promised land in one official speech the king be even make to say that libya could absorb part of italian emigration that be just a phenomenon of madness for libya have no value at all from the agricultural commercial or military point of view it may pay its way one day but only if all expense be cut down and the administrative system be completely change it may be that if only from a feeling of duty towards the inhabitant italy can not abandon libya now that she have take it but the question will always be ask why she do take it why she take it by violence when a series of concession could have be obtain without difficulty from the turkish government the libyan enterprise undertake on a impulse against the opinion of italy 's ally austrium and germany against the wish of england and france be a very serious political responsibility for italy the european war be the consequence of a long series of movement aspiration agitation it can not be deny and it be recognize by clear-thinking man like lloyd george that france and england too have by they action take on themselves they part in the serious responsibility to say that in the past they have never think of war be to say a thing not true and there be no doubt that all the diplomatic document publish before and during the war show in russium above all a situation which inevitably would soon lead to war in the balkan especially in serbium russium be pursue a cynical and shameless policy of corruption nourishing and exciting every ferment of revolt against austria-hungary russian policy in serbium be really criminal everyone in germany be convince that russium be prepare for war the tsar 's pacificist idea be of no importance whatever in absolute monarchy it be a illusion to think that the sovereign though apparently a autocrat act in accordance with he own view he view be almost invariably those of the people round he he do not even receive news in its true form but in the form give it by official russium be a unwieldy giant who have show sign of madness long before the actual revolution it be impossible that a collective madness such as that which have have possession of russium for three year could be produce on the spur of the moment the regime of autocracy contain in itself the germ of bolshevism and violence bolshevism can not properly be judge by western notion it be not a revolutionary movement of the people it be as i have say before the religious fanaticism of the eastern orthodox rise from the dead body of tsarist despotism bolshevism centralize and bureaucratic follow the same line as the imperial policy of almost every tsar undoubtedly the greatest responsibility for the war lie on germany if it have not to bear all the responsibility as the treaty claim it have to bear the largest share and the responsibility lie rather than on the shoulder of the emperor and the quite ordinary man who surround he on those of the military caste and some great industrial group the crazy writings of general von bernhardus and other scandalous publication of the same sort express more than just theoretical view the real hope and tendency of the whole military caste it be true enough that there exist in germany a real democratic society under the control of the civil government but there be the military caste too with privilege in social life and a special position in the life of the state this caste be educate in the conception of violence as the means of power and grandeur when a country have allow the military and social theory of general von bernhardus and the senselessly criminal pronouncement of the emperor william ii to prevail for so many year it have put the most formidable weapon possible into the hand of its enemy the people who govern germany for so long have no right to complain now of the condition in which they country be place but the great german people hardwork and persevere have full right to look on such condition as the negation of justice the head of a european state a man of the clearest view and calmest judgment speak to I of the emperor william of whose character and intellect he think very little express the view that the emperor do not want war but that he would not avoid it when he have the chance the truth be that germany trouble itself very little about france kinderlen wächter the most intelligent of the german foreign minister and perhaps the one most oppose to the war when he outline to I the situation as it be ten year ago show no anxiety at all except in regard to russium russium might make war and it be necessary to be ready or to see that it come about at a moment when victory be certain if condition do not change germany have no reason at all for make war on france from the time that it have get well ahead of that country in industry commerce and navigation it be true that there be a certain number of unbalanced people in the metal industry who talk complacently of french iron and stir up the yellow press just as in france to-day there be many industrial with they eye fix on german coal which they want to seize as far as possible but the intellectual the politician even military circle have no anxiety at all except with regard to russium there be mistaken view in german policy no doubt but at the same time there be real anxiety about she national existence with a huge population and limited resource with few colony owe to she late arrival in the competition for they germany look on the never-ceasing desire of russium for constantinople as the ruin of she policy of expansion in the east and in actual fact there be but one way by which the three great empire which in population and extension of territory dominate the greater part of europe could avoid war and that be to join in alliance among themselves or at least not to enter other alliance the three great empire divide themselves into two ally group from that moment give the fact that in each of they the military caste hold power that the principal decision lay in the hand of a few man not responsible to parliament give the fact that russium faithful to she traditional policy aim to draw into she political orbit all the slav people right down to the adriatic and the aegean and austrium be lean toward the creation of a third slav monarchy in the dual kingdom it be inevitable that sooner or later the violence intrigue and corruption with which we be familiar should culminate in open conflict bismarck always see that put russium and germany up against each other mean war people like individual be far from represent with anything approach completeness such social conception as we call violence and right honesty and bad faith justice and injustice each people have its different characteristic but no one people represent good or another bad no one represent brutality or another civilization all these meaningless phrase be bring out during the war accord to which as be say by one of the prime minister of the entente the war be the decisive struggle between the force of autocracy and liberty between the dark power of evil and violence and the radiant power of good and right to-day all this cause nothing but a smile such thing be just speechify and banal at that perhaps they be a necessity of war-time which might well be make use of when you be fight for you very life you use every means you have when you be in imminent danger you do not choose you weapon you use everything to hand all the war propaganda against the german empire recount sometimes exaggerate all the crime of the enemy claim that all the guilt be on the side of germany describe german atrocity as a habit almost a characteristic of the german people deride german culture as a species of liquid in which be breed the microbe of moral madness -- all this be legitimate perhaps necessary during the war the reply to the asphyxiate gas of the enemy be not only the same gas but a propaganda calculate to do more damage and which in fact do do as much damage as tank and blockade but when war be over nothing should be put into a peace treaty except such thing as will lead to a lasting peace or the most lasting peace compatible with we degree of civilization on January 22 1917 president wilson explain the reason why he make the proposal to put a end to the war he say in the american senate that the greatest danger lay in a peace impose by conqueror after victory at that time it be say that there must be neither conqueror nor conquer a peace impose after victory would be the cause of so much humiliation and such intolerable sacrifice for the conquered side it would be so severe it would give rise to so much bitter feeling that it would not be a lasting peace but one found on shift sand in the spring of 1919 just before the most serious decision be to be take lloyd george put before the conference a memorandum entitle _ some consideration for the peace conference before they finally draft they term _ with he marvellously quick insight after have listen to the speech of which force be the lead motive -lrb- the tendency round he be not to establish a lasting peace but to vivisect germany -rrb- lloyd george see that it be not a true peace that be be prepare on march 25 1919 lloyd george present the follow memorandum to the conference : i when nation be exhaust by war in which they have put forth all they strength and which leave they tired bleeding and break it be not difficult to patch up a peace that may last until the generation which experience the horror of the war have pass away picture of heroism and triumph only tempt those who know nothing of the suffering and terror of war it be therefore comparatively easy to patch up a peace which will last for thirty year what be difficult however be to draw up a peace which will not provoke a fresh struggle when those who have have practical experience of what war means have pass away history have prove that a peace which have be hail by a victorious nation as a triumph of diplomatic skill and statesmanship even of moderation in the long run have prove itself to be short-sighted and charge with danger to the victor the peace of 1871 be believe by germany to ensure not only she security but she permanent supremacy the fact have show exactly the contrary france itself have demonstrate that those who say you can make germany so feeble that she will never be able to hit back be utterly wrong year by year france become numerically weaker in comparison with she victorious neighbor but in reality she become ever more powerful she keep watch on europe she make alliance with those whom germany have wrong or menace she never cease to warn the world of its danger and ultimately she be able to secure the overthrow of the far mightier power which have trample so brutally upon she you may strip germany of she colony reduce she armament to a mere police force and she navy to that of a fifth-rate power all the same in the end if she feel that she have be unjustly treat in the peace of 1919 she will find means of exact retribution from she conqueror the impression the deep impression make upon the human heart by four year of unexampled slaughter will disappear with the heart upon which it have be mark by the terrible sword of the great war the maintenance of peace will then depend upon there be no cause of exasperation constantly stir up the spirit of patriotism of justice or of fair play to achieve redress we term may be severe they may be stern and even ruthless but at the same time they can be so just that the country on which they be impose will feel in its heart that it have no right to complain but injustice arrogance display in the hour of triumph will never be forget nor forgive for these reason i be therefore strongly averse to transfer more german from german rule to the rule of some other nation than can possibly be help i can not conceive any greater cause of future war than that the german people who have certainly prove themselves one of the most vigorous and powerful race in the world should be surround by a number of small state many of they consist of people who have never previously set up a stable government for themselves but each of they contain large mass of german clamour for reunion with they native land the proposal of the polish commission that we should place 2100000 german under the control of a people of a different religion and which have never prove its capacity for stable self-government throughout its history must in my judgment lead sooner or later to a new war in the east of europe what i have say about the german be equally true about the magyar there will never be peace in south-eastern europe if every little state now come into be be to have a large magyar irredenta within its border i would therefore take as a guide principle of the peace that as far as be humanly possible the different race should be allocate to they motherland and that this human criterion should have precedence over consideration of strategy or economics or communication which can usually be adjust by other means secondly i would say that the duration for the payment of reparation ought to disappear if possible with the generation which make the war but there be a consideration in favor of a long-sighted peace which influence I even more than the desire to leave no cause justify a fresh outbreak thirty year hence there be one element in the present condition of nation which differentiate it from the situation as it be in 1815 in the napoleonic war the country be equally exhaust but the revolutionary spirit have spend its force in the country of its birth and germany have satisfy the legitimate popular demand for the time be by a series of economic change which be inspire by courage foresight and high statesmanship even in russium the tsar have effect great reform which be probably at that time even too advance for the half-savage population the situation be very different now the revolution be still in its infancy the extreme figure of the terror be still in command in russium the whole of europe be fill with the spirit of revolution there be a deep sense not only of discontent but of anger and revolt among the workman against pre-war condition the whole exist order in its political social and economic aspect be question by the mass of the population from one end of europe to the other in some country like germany and russium the unrest take the form of open rebellion in other like france great britain and italy it take the shape of strike and of general disinclination to settle down to work symptom which be just as much concern with the desire for political and social change as with wage demand much of this unrest be healthy we shall never make a lasting peace by attempt to restore the condition of 1914 but there be a danger that we may throw the mass of the population throughout europe into the arm of the extremist whose only idea for regenerate mankind be to destroy utterly the whole exist fabric of society these man have triumph in russium they have do so at a terrible price hundred and thousand of the population have perish the railway the road the town the whole structural organization of russium have be almost destroy but somehow or other they seem to have manage to keep they hold upon the mass of the russian people and what be much more significant they have succeed in create a large army which be apparently well direct and well disciplined and be as to a great part of it prepare to die for its ideal in another year russium inspire by a new enthusiasm may have recover from she passion for peace and have at she command the only army eager to fight because it be the only army that believe that it have any cause to fight for the greatest danger that i see in the present situation be that germany may throw in she lot with bolshevism and place she resource she brain she vast organize power at the disposal of the revolutionary fanatic whose dream it be to conquer the world for bolshevism by force of arm this danger be no mere chimera the present government in germany be weak its authority be challenge it linger merely because there be no alternative but the spartacist and germany be not ready for spartacism as yet but the argument which the spartacist be use with great effect at this very time be that they alone can save germany from the intolerable condition which have be bequeath she by the war they offer to free the german people from indebtedness to the ally and indebtedness to they own richer class they offer they complete control of they own affair and the prospect of a new heaven and earth it be true that the price will be heavy there will be two or three year of anarchy perhaps of bloodshed but at the end the land will remain the people will remain the greater part of the house and the factory will remain and the railway and the road will remain and germany have throw off she burden will be able to make a fresh start if germany go over to the spartacist it be inevitable that she should throw in she lot with the russian bolshevist once that happen all eastern europe will be sweep into the orbit of the bolshevik revolution and within a year we may witness the spectacle of nearly three hundred million people organize into a vast red army under german instructor and german general equip with german cannon and german machine gun and prepare for a renewal of the attack on western europe this be a prospect which no one can face with equanimity yet the news which come from hungary yesterday show only too clearly that this danger be no fantasy and what be the reason allege for this decision they be mainly the belief that large number of magyar be to be hand over to the control of other if we be wise we shall offer to germany a peace which while just will be preferable for all sensible man to the alternative of bolshevism i would therefore put it in the forefront of the peace that once she accept we term especially reparation we will open to she the raw material and market of the world on equal term with ourselves and will do everything possible to enable the german people to get upon they leg again we can not both cripple she and expect she to pay finally we must offer term which a responsible government in germany can expect to be able to carry out if we present term to germany which be unjust or excessively onerous no responsible government will sign they certainly the present weak administration will not if it do i be tell that it would be sweep away within twenty-four hour yet if we can find nobody in germany who will put he hand to a peace treaty what will be the position a large army of occupation for a indefinite period be out of the question germany would not mind it a very large number of people in that country would welcome it as it would be the only hope of preserve the exist order of thing the objection would not come from germany but from we own country neither the british empire nor america would agree to occupy germany france by itself could not bear the burden of occupation we should therefore be drive back on the policy of blockade the country that would inevitably mean spartacism from the ural to the rhine with its inevitable consequence of a huge red army attempt to cross the rhine as a matter of fact i be doubtful whether public opinion would allow we deliberately to starve germany if the only difference between germany and ourselves be between onerous term and moderate term i very much doubt if public opinion would tolerate the deliberate condemnation of million of woman and child to death by starvation if so the ally would have incur the moral defeat of have attempt to impose term on germany which germany have successfully resist from every point of view therefore it seem to I that we ought to endeavor to draw up a peace settlement as if we be impartial arbiter forgetful of the passion of the war this settlement ought to have three end in view first of all it must do justice to the ally by take into account germany 's responsibility for the origin of the war and for the way in which it be fight secondly it must be a settlement which a responsible german government can sign in the belief that it can fulfil the obligation it incur thirdly it must be a settlement which will contain in itself no provocation for future war and which will constitute a alternative to bolshevism because it will commend itself to all reasonable opinion as a fair settlement of the european problem ii it be not however enough to draw up a just and far-sighted peace with germany if we be to offer europe a alternative to bolshevism we must make the league of nation into something which will be both a safeguard to those nation who be prepare for fair deal with they neighbor and a menace to those who would trespass on the rights of they neighbor whether they be imperialist empire or imperialist bolshevist a essential element therefore in the peace settlement be the constitution of the league of nation as the effective guardian of international right and international liberty throughout the world if this be to happen the first thing to do be that the lead member of the league of nation should arrive at a understanding between themselves in regard to armament to my mind it be idle to endeavor to impose a permanent limitation of armament upon germany unless we be prepared similarly to impose a limitation upon ourselves i recognize that until germany have settle down and give practical proof that she have abandon she imperialist ambition and until russium have also give proof that she do not intend to embark upon a military crusade against she neighbor it be essential that the lead member of the league of nation should maintain considerable force both by land and sea in order to preserve liberty in the world but if they be to present a unite front to the force both of reaction and revolution they must arrive at such a agreement in regard to armament among themselves as would make it impossible for suspicion to arise between the member of the league of nation in regard to they intention towards one another if the league be to do its work for the world it will only be because the member of the league trust it themselves and because there be no rivalry and jealousy in the matter of armament between they the first condition of success for the league of nation be therefore a firm understanding between the british empire and the united state of america and france and italy that there will be no competitive building up of fleet or army between they unless this be arrive at before the covenant be sign the league of nation will be a sham and a mockery it will be regard and rightly regard as a proof that its principal promoter and patron repose no confidence in its efficacy but once the lead member of the league have make it clear that they have reach a understanding which will both secure to the league of nation the strength which be necessary to enable it to protect its member and which at the same time will make misunderstanding and suspicion with regard to competitive armament impossible between they its future and its authority will be assure it will then be able to ensure as a essential condition of peace that not only germany but all the smaller state of europe undertake to limit they armament and abolish conscription if the small nation be permit to organize and maintain conscript army run each to hundred of thousand boundary war will be inevitable and all europe will be draw in unless we secure this universal limitation we shall achieve neither lasting peace nor the permanent observance of the limitation of german armament which we now seek to impose i should like to ask why germany if she accept the term we consider just and fair should not be admit to the league of nation at any rate as soon as she have establish a stable and democratic government would it not be a inducement to she both to sign the term and to resist bolshevism might it not be safer that she should be inside the league than that she should be outside it finally i believe that until the authority and effectiveness of the league of nation have be demonstrate the british empire and the united state ought to give france a guarantee against the possibility of a new german aggression france have special reason for ask for such a guarantee she have twice be attack and twice invade by germany in half a century she have be so attack because she have be the principal guardian of liberal and democratic civilization against central european autocracy on the continent of europe it be right that the other great western democracy should enter into a undertaking which will ensure that they stand by she side in time to protect she against invasion should germany ever threaten she again or until the league of nation have prove its capacity to preserve the peace and liberty of the world iii if however the peace conference be really to secure peace and prove to the world a complete plan of settlement which all reasonable man will recognize as a alternative preferable to anarchy it must deal with the russian situation bolshevik imperialism do not merely menace the state on russium 's border it threaten the whole of asia and be as near to america as it be to france it be idle to think that the peace conference can separate however sound a peace it may have arrange with germany if it leave russium as it be to-day i do not propose however to complicate the question of the peace with germany by introduce a discussion of the russian problem i mention it simply in order to remind ourselves of the importance of deal with it as soon as possible the memorandum be follow by some proposal entitle general line of the peace condition which would tend to make the peace less severe it be hardly worth while reproduce they as in many point the decision take be in the opposite sense it be better not to go beyond the general consideration mr lloyd george 's memorandum be a secret document but as the english and american press have already print long passage from it it be practically possible to give it in its entirety without add anything to what have already be print m tardieu have publish m clemenceau 's reply draw up by m tardieu himself and represent the french point of view : i the french government be in complete agreement with the general purpose of mr lloyd george 's note : to make a lasting peace and for that reason a just peace but on the other hand it do not think that this principle which be its own really lead to the conclusion arrive at in the note in question ii the note suggest that the territorial condition lay down for germany in europe shall be moderate in order that she may not feel deeply embittered after peace the method would be sound if the recent war have be nothing but a european war for germany but that be not the case previous to the war germany be a great world power whose _ future be on the sea _ this be the power of which she be so inordinately proud for the loss of this world power she will never be console the ally have take from she -- or be go to take from she -- without be deter by fear of she resentment all she colony all she ship of war a great part of she commercial fleet -lrb- as reparation -rrb- the foreign market which she control that be the worst blow that could be inflict on she and it be suggest that she can be pacify by some improvement in territorial condition that be a pure illusion the remedy be not big enough for the thing it be to cure if there be any desire for general reason to give germany some satisfaction it must not be seek in europe such help will be vain as long as germany have lose she world policy to pacify she -lrb- if there be any interest in so do -rrb- she must have satisfaction give she in colony in ship in commercial expansion the note of march 26 think of nothing but satisfaction in european territory iii mr lloyd george fear that unduly severe territorial condition impose on germany will play into the hand of bolshevism be there not cause for fear on the other hand that the method he suggest will have that very result the conference have decide to call into be a certain number of new state be it possible without be unjust to they to impose on they inacceptable frontier towards germany if these people -- poland and bohemia above all -- have resist bolshevism up to now it be through national sentiment if this sentiment be violate bolshevism will find a easy prey in they and the only existing barrier between russian and german bolshevism will be break the result will be either a confederation of eastern and central europe under the direction of a bolshevik germany or the enslavery of those country to a germany become reactionary again thanks to the general anarchy in either case the ally will have lose the war the policy of the french government on the other hand be to give the fullest aid to those young people with the support of everything liberal in europe and not to try to introduce at they expense abatement -- which in any case would be useless -- of the colonial naval and commercial disaster which the peace impose on germany if it be necessary in give these young people frontier without which they can not live to transfer under they sovereignty some german son of the man who enslave they we may regret the necessity and we should do it with moderation but it can not be avoid further when all the german colony be take from she entirely and definitely because she ill-treat the native what right be there to refuse normal frontier to poland and bohemia because german install themselves in those country as precursor of the tyrant pan-germanism iv the note of march 26 insist on the necessity of a peace which will appear to germany as a just peace and the french government agree it may be observe however that give the german mentality they conception of justice may not be the same as that of the ally and also surely the ally as well as germany even before germany should feel this impression of justice the ally who fight together should conclude the war with a peace equal for all now follow the method suggest in the note of march 26 what will be the result a certain number of total and definite guarantee will be give to maritime nation whose country be not invade total and definite the surrender of the german colony total and definite the surrender of the german war fleet total and definite the surrender of a large part of the german commercial fleet total and last if not definite the exclusion of germany from foreign market for the continental country on the other hand -- that be to say for the country which have suffer most from the war -- would be reserve partial and transitory solution : partial solution the modify frontier suggest for poland and bohemia transitory solution the defensive pledge offer france for the protection of she territory transitory solution the regime propose for the saar coal there be a evident inequality which might have a bad influence on the after-war relation among the ally more important than the after-war relation of germany with they it have be show in paragraph i that it would be a illusion to hope that territorial satisfaction offer to germany would compensate she sufficiently for the world disaster she have suffer and it may surely be add that it would be a injustice to lay the burden of such compensation on the shoulder of those country among the ally which have have to bear the heaviest burden of the war after the burden of the war these country can not bear the burden of the peace it be essential that they should feel that the peace be just and equal for all and unless that be assure it be not only in central europe that there will be fear of bolshevism for nowhere do it propagate so easily as have be see as amid national disillusionment v the french government desire to limit itself for the moment to these observation of a general character it pay full homage to the intention which inspire mr lloyd george 's memorandum but it consider that the induction that can be draw from the present note be in consonance with justice and the general interest and those be the consideration by which the french government will be inspire in the come exchange of idea for the discussion of condition suggest by the prime minister of great britain these two document be of more than usual interest the british prime minister with he remarkable insight at once note the seriousness of the situation he see the danger to the peace of the world in german depression germany oppress do not mean germany subject every year france become numerically weaker germany stronger the horror of war will be forget and the maintenance of peace will depend on the creation of a situation which make life possible do not cause exasperation to come into public feeling or into the just claim of german desirous of independence injustice in the hour of triumph will never be pardon can never be atone so the idea of hand over to other state number of german be not only a injustice but a cause of future war and what can be say of german be also true of magyar no cause of future war must be allow to remain put million of german under polish rule -- that be under a inferior people which have never show any capacity for stable self-government -- must lead to a new war sooner or later if germany in exasperation become a country of revolution what would happen to europe you can impose severe condition but that do not mean that you can enforce they the condition to be impose must be such that a responsible german government can in good faith assume the obligation of carry they out neither great britain nor the united state of america can assume the obligation of occupy germany if it do not carry out the excessively severe condition which it be desire to impose can france occupy germany alone from that moment lloyd george see the necessity of admit germany into the league of nation _ at once _ and propose a scheme of treaty contain condition which while very severe be in part tolerable for the german people clemenceau 's reply issue a few day later contain the french point of view and have a ironical note when it touch on the weak point in lloyd george 's argument the war say the french note be not a european war germany 's eye be fix on world power and she see that she future be on the sea there be no necessity to show consideration regard territorial condition in europe by take away she commercial fleet she colony and she foreign market more harm be do to germany than by take european territory to pacify she -lrb- if there be any occasion for do so -rrb- she must be offer commercial satisfaction at this point the note in consider question of justice and of mere utility become distinctly ironical have decide to bring to life new state especially poland and czeko-slovakium why not give they safe frontier even if some german or magyar have to be sacrifice one of clemenceau 's fix idea be that criterion of justice must not be apply to german the note say explicitly that give the german mentality it be by no means sure that the conception of justice of germany will be the same as that of the ally on another occasion after the signing of the treaty when lloyd george point out the wisdom of not claim from germany the absurdity of hand over thousand of officer accuse of cruelty for judgment by they late enemy and recognize frankly the impossibility of carry out such a stipulation in england clemenceau reply simply that the german be not like the english the delicate point in clemenceau 's note be the contradiction in which he try to involve the british prime minister between the clause of the treaty concern germany outside europe in which no moderation have be show and those regard germany in europe in which he himself do not consider moderation either necessary or opportune there be a evident divergence of view clear the way for a calm review of the condition to be impose and here two country could have exercise decisive action : the united state and italy but the united state be represent by wilson who be already in a difficult situation by successive concession the gravity of which he have not realize he find himself confront by draft of treaty which in the end be contradiction of all he proposal the absolute antithesis of the pledge he have give it be quite possible that he have not see where he be go but he frequent irritation be the sign of he distress still in the ship-wreck of he whole program he have succeed in save one thing the statute of the league of nation which be to be preface to all the treaty he want to go back to america and meet the senate with at least something to show as a record of the great undertaking and he hope and believe in good faith that the covenant of the league of nation would sooner or later have bring about agreement and modify the worst of the mistake make he conception of thing be academic and he have not realize that there be need to constitute the nation before lay down rule for the league he trust that bring they together with mutual pledge would further most efficiently the cause of peace among the people on the other hand there be diffidence share by both between wilson and lloyd george and there be little likelihood of the british prime minister 's move check the course the conference have take italy might have do a great work if its representative have have a clear policy but as m tardieu say they have no share in the effective doings of the conference and they activity be almost entirely absorb in the question of fiume the conference be a three-sided conversation between wilson clemenceau and lloyd george and the latter have hostility and diffidence on each side of he with italy -- as earlier state -- for the most part absent also it be just then that the divergence between wilson and the italian representative reach its acute stage the essential part of the treaty be decide in April and the beginning of may on April 22 the question of the right bank of the rhine on the 23rd or 24th the agreement about reparation italy be absent and when the italian delegate return to pari without be ask on may 6 the text of the treaty be complete in print in actual fact only one person do really effective work and direct the trend of the conference and that person be clemenceau the fact that the conference meet in paris that everything that be do by the various delegation be know even foresee so that it could be oppose discredit even destroy by the press beforehand -- a thing which annoy lloyd george so much that at one time he think seriously of leave the conference -- all this give a enormous advantage to the french delegation and especially to clemenceau who direct the conference 's work all he life clemenceau have be a tremendous destroyer for year and year he have do nothing but overthrow government with a sort of obstinate ferocity he be a old man when he be call to lead the country but he bring with he all he fighting spirit no one detest the church and detest socialism more than he both of these moral force be equally repulsive to he individualistic spirit i do not think there be any man among the politician i have know who be more individualistic than clemenceau who remain to-day the man of the old democracy in time of war no one be better fitted than he to lead a fight ministry fighting at home fight abroad with the same feeling the same passion when there be one thing only necessary in order to beat the enemy never to falter in hatred never to doubt the sureness of victory no one come near he no one could be more determine no one more bitter but when war be over when it be peace that have to be ensure no one could be less fit for the work he see nothing beyond he hatred for germany the necessity for destroy the enemy sweeping away every bit of he activity bring he into subjection on account of he age he could not visualize the problem of the future he could only see one thing necessary and that be immediate to destroy the enemy and either destroy or confiscate all he means of development he be not nationalist or imperialist like he collaborator but before all and above all one idea live in he hatred for germany she must be render barren disembowel annihilate he have say in the french parliament that treaty of peace be nothing more than a way of go on with war and in September 1920 in he preface to m tardieu 's book he say that france must get reparation for waterloo and sedan even waterloo : _ waterloo et sedan pour ne pa remonter plus haut nous imposaient d'abord les douloureux soucis d'une politique de réparation _ tardieu note as we have see that there be only three people in the conference : wilson clemenceau and lloyd george orlando he remark speak little and italy have no importance with subtle irony he note that wilson talk like a university don criticize a essay with the didactic logic of the professor the truth be that after have make the mistake of stay in the conference he do not see that he whole edifice be tumble down and he let mistake accumulate one after the other with the result that treaty be frame which as already point out actually destroy all the principle he have declare to the world thing be as they be in paris clemenceau 's temperament the pressure of french industry and of the newspaper the real anxiety to make the future safe and the desire on that account to exterminate the enemy france naturally demand through its representative the severest sanction england give the realistic nature of its representative and the calm clear vision of lloyd george always favor in general the more moderate solution as those which be more likely to be carry out and would least disturb the equilibrium of europe so it come about that the decision seem to be a compromise but be on the other hand actually so hard and so stern that they be impossible of execution without commit any indiscretion it be possible to see now from the publication of the french representative at the conference themselves what france 's claim be let we try to sum they up as regard disarmament and control there could have be and there ought to have be no difficulty about agreement i be in favor of the reduction of all armament but i regard it as a perfectly legitimate claim that the country principally responsible for the war and in general the conquer country should be oblige to disarm no one would regard it as unfair that germany and the conquer country should be compel to reduce they armament to the measure necessary to guarantee internal order only but a distinction must be draw between military sanction mean to guarantee peace and those which have the end of ruin the enemy in actual truth in he solemn pronouncement after the entry of the united state into the war president wilson have never speak of a separate disarmament of the conquer country but of adequate guarantee _ give and receive _ that national armament should be reduce to the smallest point compatible with internal order assurance give and receive : that be to say a identical situation as between conqueror and conquer no one can deny the right of the conqueror to compel the conquered enemy to give up he arm and reduce he military armament at any rate for some time but on this point too there be useless excess i should never have think of publishing france 's claim bitterness come that way responsibility be incur in future it may be a argument in you adversary 's hand but m tardieu have take this office on himself and have tell we all france do recount she claim from the act of the conference itself reference be easy to the story write by one of the representative of france possibly the most efficient through have be in america a long time and have fuller and more intimate knowledge of the american representative particularly colonel house generally speak in every claim the french representative start from a extreme position and that be not only a state of mind it be a tactical measure later on if they give up any part of they claim they have the air of yielding of accept a compromise when they claim be of such a extreme nature that the anxiety they cause the opposition they raise be evident clemenceau put on a air of moderation and give way at once sometimes too he show moderation himself when it suit he purpose but in reality he only give way when he see that it be impossible to get what he want in point where english and american interest be not involve give the difficult position in which lloyd george be place and wilson 's utter ignorance of all european question with italy keep almost entirely apart the french point of view always come out on top if slightly modify but the original claim be always so extreme that the modification leave stand the most radically severe measure against the conquer country many decision affect france be not sufficiently criticize on account of the relation in which the english and american stand to france objection would have look like ill-will plead the enemy 's cause previously in nearly every case when peace be be make the representative of the conquer country have be call to state they case opportunity be give for discussion the russo-japanese peace be a example undoubtedly the aggression of russium have be unscrupulous and premeditated but both party participate in draw up the peace treaty at pari possibly for the first time in history the destiny of the most culture people in europe be decide -- or rather it be think that it be be decide -- without even listen to what they have to say and without hear from they representative if the condition impose could or could not possibly be carry out later on a exception if only a purely formal one be make in the case of hungary whose delegate be hear but it will remain for ever a terrible precedent in modern history that against all pledge all precedent and all tradition the representative of germany be never even hear nothing be leave to they but to sign a treaty at a moment when famine and exhaustion and threat of revolution make it impossible not to sign it if germany have not sign she would have suffer less loss but at that time condition at home with latent revolution threaten the whole empire make it imperative to accept any solution and all the more as the german consider that they be not bind by they signature the decision have be impose by violence without any hearing be give to the conquer party and the most serious decision be take without any real examination of the fact in the old law of the church it be lay down that everyone must have a hearing even the devil : _ etiam diabulus audiatur _ -lrb- even the devil have the right to be hear -rrb- but the new democracy which propose to install the society of the nation do not even obey the precept which the dark middle age hold sacred on behalf of the accuse condition in germany be terribly difficult and a army of two hundred thousand man be consider by the military expert the minimum necessary the military commission preside over by marshal foch leave germany a army of two hundred thousand man recruit by conscription a staff in proportion service of one year fifteen division 180 heavy gun 600 field-gun that be less than what little state without any resource have now three year after the close of the war but france at once impose the reduction of the german army to 100000 man no conscription but a twelve year ' service of pay soldier artillery reduce practically to nothing no heavy gun at all very few field-gun no opportunity be give for discussion nor be there any clemenceau put the problem in such a way that discussion be out of the question : _ c'est la france quus demain comme hier serum face à l'allemagne _ lloyd george and colonel house confine themselves to say that on this point france formally express they view great britain and the united state have no right to oppose lloyd george be convince that the measure be too extreme and have try on may 23 1919 to modify they but france insist on impose on germany this situation of tremendous difficulty i have refer to the military condition impose on germany : destruction of all war material fortress and armament factory prohibition of any trade in arm destruction of the fleet occupation of the west bank of the rhine and the bridgehead for fifteen year ally control with wide power over the execution of the military and naval clause of the treaty with consequent subjection of all public administration and private company to the will of a foreigner or rather of a enemy keep at the expense of germany itself and at no small expense etc in some of the inter-allied conference i have have to take note of what these commission of control really be and they absurd extravagance base on the argument that the enemy must pay for everything the purport of france 's action in the conference be not to ensure safe military guarantee against germany but to destroy she at any rate to cut she up and indeed when she have get all she want and germany be helpless she continue the same policy even intensify it every bit of territory possible must be take german unity must be break and not only military but industrial germany must be lay low under a series of control and a impossible number of obligation all know how in article 428 of the treaty it be lay down as a guarantee of the execution of the treaty term on the part of germany or rather as a more extended military guarantee for france that german territory on the west bank of the rhine and the bridgehead be to be occupy by ally and associate troops for fifteen year method and regulation for such occupation follow in article 429 and 432 this occupation not only give deep offence to germany -lrb- france have always look back with implacable bitterness on the few month ' military occupation by she prussian conqueror in the war of 1870 -rrb- but it paralyse all she activity and be generally judge to be completely useless all the ally be ready to give france every military guarantee against any unjust aggression by germany but france want in addition the occupation of the left bank of the rhine it be a very delicate matter and the note present to the conference by great britain on march 26 and April 2 by the united state on march 28 and April 12 show how embarrassed the two government be in consider a question which france regard as essential for she future it have to be add that the action of marshal foch in this matter be not entirely constitutional he claim that independently of nationality france and belgium have the right to look on the rhine as the indispensable frontier for the nation of the west of europe _ et par là de la civilisation _ neither lloyd george nor wilson could swallow the argument of the rhine a frontier between the civilization of france and belgium all civilization indeed and germany in the treaty the occupation of the left bank of the rhine and the bridgehead by the ally and associate power for fifteen year be introduce as a compromise such district will be evacuate by degree every five year if germany shall have faithfully carry out the term of the treaty now the condition of the treaty be in large measure impossible of execution and in consequence no execution of they can ever be describe as faithful further the occupying troops be pay by germany it follow that the conception of the occupation of the left bank of the rhine be of a fact of unlimited duration the harm that would result from the occupation be point out at the conference by the american representative and even more strongly by the english what be the use of it they ask if the german army be reduce to 100000 man m tardieu himself tell the story of all the effort make especially by lloyd george and bonar law to prevent the blunder which later on be endorse in the treaty as article 428 lloyd george go so far as to complain of political intrigue for create disorder on the rhine but clemenceau take care to put the question in such a form that no discussion be possible in the matter of the occupation he say to the english you do not understand the french point of view you live in a island with the sea as defense we on the continent with a bad frontier we do not look for a attack by germany but for systematic refusal to carry out the term of the treaty never be there a treaty with so many clause with consequently so many opportunity for evasion against that risk the material guarantee of occupation be necessary there be two method in direct contrast : _ en angleterre on croit que le moyen d' y réussir est de faire des concession en france nous croyon que c'est de brusquer _ on march 14 lloyd george and wilson have offer france the fullest military guarantee in place of the occupation of the left bank of the rhine france want and in fact get the occupation as well as the alliance _ notre but _ say tardieu _ sceller la garantie offerte mais y ajouter l'occupation _ outside the versaille treaty the united state and great britain have make several treaty of alliance with france for the event of unprovoked aggression by germany later on the french-english treaty be approve by the house of common the french-american undergo the same fate as the versaille treaty but the treaty with great britain fall through also on account of the provision that it should come into force simultaneously with the american treaty in a paris newspaper poincaré publish in September 1921 some strictly reserve document on the question of the military guarantee and the occupation of the left bank of the rhine he wish to get the credit of have stand firm when clemenceau himself hesitate at the demand for a occupation of the left bank of the rhine for even a longer period than fifteen year he have publish the letter he send to clemenceau to be show to wilson and lloyd george and the latter 's reply he say that there must be no thought of give up the occupation and renounce a guarantee until every obligation in the treaty should have be carry out he go so far as to claim that in occupation regard as a guarantee of a credit represent a indemnity for damages there be nothing contrary to the principle proclaim by president wilson and recognize by the ally nor would it suffice even to have the faculty of reoccupation because this faculty could never be a valid substitute for occupation as regard the suggestion that a long occupation or one for a indeterminate period would cause bad feeling m poincaré be convince that this be a exaggeration a short occupation cause more irritation on account of its arbitrary limit everyone understand a occupation without other limit than the complete carry out of the treaty the longer the time that pass the better would become the relation between the german population and the army of occupation clemenceau communicate poincaré 's letter to lloyd george the british prime minister reply on may 6 in the clearest term in he eye force germany to submit to the occupation of the rhine and the rhine province for a unlimited period be a provocation to renew the war in europe during the conference france put forward some proposal the aim of which be nothing less than to split up germany a typical example be the memorandum present by the french delegation claim the annexation of the saar territory this be completely german in the six hundred and fifty thousand inhabitant before the war there be not a hundred french not a word have ever be say about annexation of the saar either in government pronouncement or in any vote in the french parliament nor have it be discuss by any political party no one have ever suggest such annexation which certainly be a far more serious thing than the annexation of alsace-lorraine to germany as there be considerable german population in alsace-lorraine there be no french population at all in the saar and the territory in question could not even be claim for military reason but only for its economic resource reason of history could not count for they be all in germany 's favor nevertheless the request be put forward as a matter of sentiment have not the saar belong in other day entirely or in part to france politics and economics be not everything say clemenceau history also have great value for the united state a hundred and twenty year be a long time for france they count little material reparation be not enough there must be moral reparation too and the conception of france can not be the same as that of she ally the desire for the saar respond accord to clemenceau to a need of moral reparation on this point too the extreme french claim be modify the saar mine be give to france not provisionally as a matter of reparation but permanently with full right of possession and full guarantee for they work for fifteen year from the date of the treaty the government of the territory be put in the hand of the league of nation as trustee after fifteen year the population entirely german should be call to decide under what government they desire to live in other word in a purely german country which no one in france have ever claim of which no one in france have ever speak during the war the most important property be hand to a conquer state the country be put under the administration of the conqueror -lrb- which be what the league of nation actually be at present -rrb- and after fifteen year of torment the population be to be put through a plebiscite meanwhile the french douane rule in the saar it be open to the treaty to adopt or not to adopt the system of plebiscite when it be a case of hand over great mass of german population a plebiscite be imperative -- at any rate where any doubt exist and the more so in concession which form no part of the war aim and be not find in any pronouncement of the ally on the other hand in all cession of german territory to poland and bohemia no mention be make of a plebiscite because it be a question of military necessity or of land which have be historically victim of germany but only for schleswig upper silesium marienwerder allenstein klagenfurth and the saar be plebiscite lay down -- and with the exception that the plebiscite itself when as in the case of upper silesium it result in favor of germany be not regard as conclusive but where the most extreme view clash be in the matter of reparation and the indemnity to be claim from the enemy we have already see that the theory of reparation for damage find its way incidentally even before the treaty be consider into the armistice term no word have be say previously of claim from the conquered enemy anything beyond restoration of devastate territory but after the war another theory be produce if germany and she ally be solely responsible for the war they must pay the whole cost of the war : damage to property person and war work when damage have be do he who have do the wrong must make reparation for it to the utmost limit of he resource the american delegation strike a note of moderation : no claim should be make beyond what be establish in the peace condition reparation for action which be a evident violation of international law restoration of invade country and reparation for damage cause to the civil population and to its property during the war there be a number of exaggerated pronouncement on the immense resource of germany and she capacity for payment besides all the burden with which germany be load there be a discussion on the sum which the ally should claim the war have cost 700 milliard franc and the claim for damage to person and property amount to at least 350 milliard for all the ally together whatever the sum might be when it have be lay down in the treaty what damage be to be indemnify the french negotiator claim sixty-five per cent leave thirty-five per cent for all the other what be necessary be to lay down proportion not the actual amount of the sum it be impossible to say at once what amount the damages would reach : that be the business of the reparation commission instead of insert in the treaty the enormous figure speak of the quality not the quantity of the damages to be indemnify be lay down but the standard of reckoning lead to fantastic figure a impossible amount have to be pay and the delegation be discuss then the very same thing that be be discuss now the american expert see the gross mistake of the other delegation and put down as the maximum payment 325 milliard mark up to 1951 the first payment to be 25 milliard mark in 1921 so be invent the reparation commission machine a thing which have no precedent in any treaty be a commission with sovereign power to control the life of the whole of germany in actual truth no serious person have ever think that germany can pay more than a certain number of milliard a year no one believe that a country can be subject to a regime of control for thirty year but the direct line of work of the treaty have be to break down germany to cut she up to suffocate she france have but one idea and later on do not hesitate to admit it : to dismember germany to destroy she unity by create intolerable condition of life take away territory on the frontier put large district under military occupation delaying or not make any diplomatic appointment and carry on communication solely through military commission a state of thing be bring about which must inevitably tend to weaken the constitutional unity of the german empire take away from germany 84 thousand kilometre of territory nearly eight million inhabitant and all the most important mineral resource prevent the unity of the german people and the six million and five hundred thousand of german austrian to which austrium be then reduce put the whole german country under a interminable series of control -- all this do more harm to german unity than would have be do by take the responsibility of a forcible and immediate division to which the german could not have consent and which the ally could not have claim to impose what have be say about germany and the versaille treaty can be say about all the other conquered country and all the other treaty with merely vary proportion in each case the verdict that have to be pass on they will very soon be show by fact -- if indeed fact have not show already that in great measure what have be lay down can not be carry out one thing be certain that the actual treaty threaten to ruin conqueror and conquer that they have not bring peace to europe but condition of war and violence in clemenceau 's word the treaty be a way of go on with war but even if it be possible to dispute that as man 's mind can not yet frame a impartial judgment and the danger be not see by all there be one thing that can not be deny or dispute and that be that the treaty be the negation of the principle for which the united state and italy without any obligation on they enter the war they be a perversion of all the entente have repeatedly proclaim they break into piece president wilson 's fourteen point which be a solemn pledge for the american people and to-morrow they will be the greatest moral weapon with which the conquer of to-day will face the conqueror of to-day iv the conqueror and the conquer how many be the state of europe before the war the political geography of europe be almost tradition to-day every part of europe be in a state of flux the only absolute certainty be that in continental europe conqueror and conquer be in a condition of spiritual as well as economic unrest it be difficult indeed to say how many political unity there be and how many be lasting and what new war be be prepare if a way of salvation be not find by some common endeavor to install peace which the peace of paris have not do how many think man can without perplexity remember how many state there be and what they be : arbitrary creation of the treaty creation of the moment territorial limitation impose by the necessity of international agreement the situation of russium be so uncertain that no one know whether new state will arise as a result of she continuous disintegration or if she will be reconstruct in a solid unified form and other state amongst those which have arise will fall without take into account those traditional little state which be merely historical curiosity as monaco san marino andorra monte santo not count iceland as a state apart not include the saar which as a result of one of the absurdity of the treaty of versaille be a actual state outside germany but consider montenegro as a existing state europe probably comprise thirty state some of they be however in such a condition that they do not give promise of the slightest guarantee of life or security europe have rather balkanized herself : not only the war come from the balkan but also many idea which have be largely exploit in parliamentary and newspaper circle listen to many speech and be present at many event to-day leave the sensation of be in belgrade or at sarajevo europe include russium and include also the polar archipelago cover a area of a little more than ten million square kilometre canada be of almost the same size the united state of america have about the same territory the historical procedure before the war be towards the formation of large territorial unity the _ post-bellum _ procedure be entirely towards a process of dissolution and the fractionize result a little from necessity and a little also from the desire to dismember the old empire and to weaken germany have assume proportion almost impossible to foresee in the relation between the various state good and evil be not abstract idea : political action can only be judge by they result if the treaty of peace which have be impose on the conquer would be capable of application we could from a ethnical point of view regret some or many of the decision but we should only have to wait for the result of time for a definite judgment the evil be that the treaty which have be sign be not applicable or can not be apply without the rapid dissolution of europe so the balance-sheet of the peace after three year from the armistice -- that be three year from the war -- show on the whole a worsening of the situation the spirit of violence have not die out and perhaps in some country not even diminish on the other hand the cause of material disagreement have increase the inequality have augment the division between the two group have grow and the cause of hatred have be consolidate a analysis of the foreign exchange indicate a process of undoing and not a tendency to reconstruction we have refer in a general manner to the condition of germany as a result of the treaty of versaille even worse be the situation of the other conquered country in so far that either they have not be treat with due regard or they have lose so much territory that they have no possibility of reconstruct they national existence such be the case with austrium with turkey and with hungary bulgarium which have a tenacious and compact population compose of small agriculturist have less difficult condition of reconstruction germany have fulfil loyally all the condition of the disarmament after she have hand over she fleet she destroy she fortification she destroy all the material up to the extreme limit impose by the treaty she disband she enormous army if in any one of the work of destruction she have proceed with a bad will if she have try to delay they it would be perfectly understandable a different step carry one to a dance or to a funeral at the actual moment germany have no fleet no army no artillery and be in a condition in which she could not reply to any act of violence this be why all the violence of the pole against germany have find hardly any opposition all this be so evident that no one can raise doubt on the question everyone remember say hindenburg the difficult task that the united state have to put in the field a army of a million man nevertheless they have the protection of the ocean during the period when they be prepare they artillery and they aerial material germany for she aviation for she heavy artillery for she armament be not even separate by the ocean from she ally and on the contrary they be firmly establish in german territory it would require many month to prepare a new war during which france and she ally would not be rest quietly general ludendorff recently make certain declaration which have a capital importance since they fit the fact exactly he declare that a war of reconquest by germany against the ally and especially against france be for a indefinite time completely impossible from the technical and military point of view france have a army largely supply with all the means of battle ready to march at any time which could smash any german military organization hostile to france the more so since by the destruction of the german war industry germany have lose every possibility of arm herself afresh it be absurd to believe that a german army ready for modern warfare can be organize and put on a war footing secretly a german army which could fight with the least possible hope of success against a enemy army arm and equip in the most modern manner would first of all have to be base on a huge german war industry which naturally could not be improvise or build up in secret even if a third power wish to arm germany it would not be possible to arm she so quickly and mobilize she in sufficient time to prevent the enemy army from obtain a immediate and decisive victory it would be necessary as everyone realize even in france that germany should wish to commit suicide in consequence of the treaty there be the maximum of obstacle which mind can conceive to guard against any german peril and against germany there have be accumulate _ such guarantee that never before have history record the like _ -lrb- tardieu -rrb- and germany can not do anything for many year mobilization require year and year for preparation and the greatest publicity for its execution wilson speak of guarantee _ give and receive _ for the reduction of armament instead after the treaty have be conclude if the conquer be completely disarm the conquer nation have continue to arm almost all the conquer nation have not only high expense but more numerous army if the condition of peace impose by the treaty be consider supportable remember the fact that the late enemy be harmless against whom be these continuous increase of armament we have already see the military condition impose on germany -- a small mercenary army no obligatory conscription no military instruction no aviation no artillery except a minimum and insignificant quantity require by the necessity of interior order austrium bulgarium and hungary can only have insignificant army austrium may maintain under arm 30000 man but she ruin finances only permit she accord to the latest report to keep 21700 bulgarium have 20000 man plus 3082 gendarme hungary accord to the treaty of trianon have 35000 turkey in europe which hardly exist any more as a territorial state except for the city of constantinople where the sovereignty of the sultan be more apparent than real have not a actual army take all together the state which form the powerful nucleus of war of germany as they be now reduce territorially have under arm fewer than 180000 man not include naturally those new state rise on the ruin of the old central empire and which arm themselves by the request and sometimes in the interest of some state of the entente the old enemy therefore be not in a condition to make war and be place under all manner of control sometimes the control be even of a very singular nature all have be occupy in give the sea to the victor poland have obtain the absurd paradox of the state of danzig because it have the sea the constant aim of the ally even in opposition to italy have be to give free and safe outlet on the sea coast to the serb-croat-slovene state at the conference of london and san remo i repeatedly refer to the expense of these military mission of control and often they outrageous imposition on the conquer who be suffer from hunger there be general who be assign as indemnity and expense of all sort salary which be much superior to that of the president of the united state of america it be necessary to look at vienna and budapest where the people be die of hunger to see the carnival of the danube commission for the rest it be only necessary to look at the expense account of the reparation commission to be convince that this sad spectacle of greed and luxury humiliate the victor more than the conquer german-austrium have lose every access to the sea she can not live on she resource with she enormous capital in ruin she can not unite with germany though she be a purely german country because the treaty require the unanimous consent of the league of nation and france have refuse it be therefore impossible she can not unite with czeko-slovakium with hungary and other country which have be form from the austrian empire because that be against the aspiration of the german population and it would be the formation anew of that danube state which with its numerous contrast be one of the essential cause of the war austrium have lose every access to the sea have consign she fleet and she merchant marine but in return have have the advantage of numerous inter-allied commission of control to safeguard the military naval and aeronautic clause but there be clause which can no longer be justify as for instance when austrium no longer have a sea coast -lrb- art 140 of the treaty of st germain which forbid the construction or acquisition of : any sort of submersible vessel even commercial -rrb- it be impossible to understand why -lrb- art 143 -rrb- the wireless high-power station of vienna be not allow to transmit other than commercial telegram under the surveillance of the ally and associate power who take the trouble to determine even the length of the wave to be use before the war in 1914 france desire to bring she army to the maximum of efficiency opposite a great german army be to be find a great french army germany have in 1913 accord to the budget present to the reichstag a standing army of 647000 soldier of all arm of which 105000 be non-commissioned officer and 30000 officer it be the greatest army of europe and of the world take into account its real efficiency whilst germany have no longer a army france on July 1 1921 have under arm 810000 man of which 38473 be officer therefore many more than germany have before the war give its demographic character it be the greatest military force which have be see in modern time and can only have two reason -- either military domination or ruin the military budget propose for the present year in the ordinary section be for 2782 million of franc besides that portion pay by germany for the army of occupation the extraordinary section of the same budget be for 1712 million of franc besides 635 million for expense repayable for the maintenance of troops of occupation in foreign country austria-hungary have in 1913 a total of 34000 officer and 390249 man the state which have arise from she ruin have a good many more whilst german-austrium have as a matter of fact only 21700 man and hungary have only 35000 czeko-slovakium have 150000 man of which 10000 be officer jugo-slavium have about 120000 of which 8000 to 10000 be officer but the two ally of france -- belgium and poland belgium no longer neutral poland always in disorder and in a state of continual provocation abroad and of increase anarchy at home -- have in they turn army which previous to the war could have be maintain only by a first-class power belgium have double she peace effective which now amount to 113500 man a enormous army for a population which be about equal to that of the city of new york or london poland whose economic condition be completely disastrous and may be describe as have neither money nor credit any more but which maintain more employee than any other country on earth have under arm not fewer than 430000 man and often many more and possibly have to-day many more -- about 600000 she treaty with france impose on she military obligation the extension of which can not be compatible with the policy of a country desire peace poland have besides vast dream of greatness abroad and grow ruin in the interior she enslave herself in order to enslave other and pretend in she disorder to control and dominate much more intelligent and culture people rumanium have under arm 160000 man besides 80000 carabineer and 16000 frontier guard greece have particularly on account of she undertaking in asia minor which only the lesser intelligence of she national exaltation can explain more than 400000 man under arm she be suffocate under the weight of heavy armament and can move only with difficulty the two pupil of the entente greece and poland exactly like naughty child have a policy of greed and capriciousness poland be not the outcome of she own strength but of the strength of the entente greece never find the way to contribute heavily to the war with a strong army and after the war have the most numerous army which she have ever have in she history great britain and italy be the only two country which have largely demobilize great britain in the much greater measure it be calculate that great britain have under arm 201000 man of which 15030 be officer in this number however be not include 75896 man in indium and the personnel of the air force in italy on July 31 1921 there be under arm 351076 soldier and 18138 officer in all 369214 of which however 56529 be carabineer carry out duty almost exclusively of public order under the pressure and as a result of the example of the state which have come through the war those state which do not take part have also largely augment they army so whilst the conquer have cease every preoccupation the neutral of the war have develop they armament and the conqueror have develop theirs beyond measure no one can say what may be the position of bolshevik russium probably she have not much less than a million of man under arm also because in a communist regime the vagabond and the violent find the easiest occupation in the army the conqueror have disarm the conquer have impose they economic condition they absurd morality and territorial humiliation as those impose on bulgarium turkey and hungary condition which be sufficiently difficult to be maintain and as the ferment of hate develop the conqueror do not disarm above all the little state do not disarm who have want too much have obtain too much and now do not know how to maintain what they have in many country for certain social reason war have become a industry they live by the state of war what would they do without a state of war in general then europe have considerably more man under arm than in 1913 not only have it not disarm as the entente always declare would be the consequence of the victory of the principle of democracy but the victor be always lean toward further armament the more difficult it become to maintain the condition of the peace because of they severity and they absurdity the more necessary it be to maintain army the conquer have not army the conqueror be or perhaps up to a short time ago be sure that the big army would serve to enforce the payment of the indemnity now in fact they would not serve for anything else at the conference of london after a long discussion in February 1920 the economic manifesto be draw up which warn europe of the peril of the economic situation lloyd george and myself be easily agree in denounce it as the gravest danger as the principal cause of high price and of economic disorder both as to the maintenance of large army and in the continuation of the state of war a europe divide distinctly into two part can not be pacific even after the conquer have yield up they arm the conqueror be bind to arm themselves because of they own inquietude from the conviction that the only salvation be in force which allow if not a true peace at least a armed peace if not the development of production and exchange at least the possibility of cut off from the market the very fountain of riches violence beget new violence if the condition of the peace can not be fulfil other heavier condition can be impose in france irresponsible people be support already the necessity of occupy permanently the ruhr that be to say the greatest german center for the production of coal and of not respect the plebiscite of upper silesium what have be say about the army be true also about the fleet there be a race towards the increase of naval armament if first that be the preoccupation of the conquer now it be the preoccupation of the conqueror in the exchange of doubt into which they have fall after the war the state of mind which have be create between great britain the united state of america and japan deserve to be seriously examine the race for naval armament into which these three country enter not many month ago and the competition between the two great anglo-saxon people can not be other than very damaging for civilization the great war which have be fight be at bottom the fight between the germanic race and the slav race it be the doubt in regard to the last and not in regard to france which push germany to war and precipitated event the result of the continental war however be the suppression of germany which lose as well as of russium which have not resist and france alone have gather the fruit of the situation if they can be call that from amongst the thorn which everywhere surround the victory but the war be decide above all by the intervention of the anglo-saxon people great britain she dominion and the united state of america nothing but the small political intelligence of the german statesman could have unite in the same group the people who have the greatest contrast of interest among themselves -- great britain russium the united state of america japan france and italy but now the situation of europe and especially that of asia be create fresh competition the expense for the navy accord to the figure of the various budget from 1914 to 1921 have rise in the united state of america from 702 million of lira to 2166 in great britain from 1218 million to 2109 in japan from 249 million to 1250 in france from 495 million to 1083 in italy from 250 million to 402 the sum propose for new construction in the year 1921-22 be 450 million in the united state of america 475 million for great britain 281 million for japan 185 million for france and 61 million for italy the united state of america and great britain be country of great resource : they can stand the effort but can japan which have but limited resource support these for any length of time or have she some immediate intention a comparative table of the navy in 1914 and 1921 show that the fleet of the conquer country be very much more powerful than they be before the war nevertheless russium and austria-hungary and the people arise in they territory be not naval power germany have lose all she fleet the race for naval armament regard especially the two anglo-saxon power and japan the race for land armament regard all the conqueror of europe and especially the small state this situation can not but be the cause of great preoccupation but the greater preoccupation arise from the fact that the minor state especially those which take no part in the war become every day more exigent and display fresh aspiration the whole system of the treaty of versaille have be erect on the error of poland poland be not create as the noble manifestation of the rights of nationality ethnical poland be not create but a great state which as she be can not live long because there be not great foreign minority but a whole mass of population which can not co-exist poland which have already the experience of a too numerous israelitic population have not the capacity to assimilate the german the russian and the ukranian which the treaty of versaille have unjustly give to she against the very declaration of wilson so that after with the aid of the entente have have the strength to resist the bolshevik troops poland be now in a state of permanent anarchy consume and do not produce pay debt with a fantastic bigness and do not know how to regulate the incoming no country in the world have ever more abused paper currency she paper money be probably the most greatly depreciate of any country on earth she have not succeed in organize she own production and now tend to dissolve the production of she neighbor the whole treaty of versaille be base on a vigorous and vital poland a harmless germany unable to unite with a equally harmless german-austrium should be under the military control of france and belgium on the west and of poland on the east poland separate germany from russium besides impose on germany the territorial outrage of the danzig corridor cut she off from any possibility of expansion and development in the east poland have be conceive as a great state a polish nation be not constitute a polish military state be constitute whose principal duty be that of disorganize germany poland the result of a miracle of the war -lrb- no one could foretell the simultaneous fall of the central empire and of the russian empire -rrb- be form not from a tenacious endeavor but from a unforeseen circumstance which be the just reward for the long martyrdom of a people the border of poland will reach in time to the baltic sea in the north the carpathian and the dniester in the south in the east the country almost as far as smolensk in the west to the part of germany brandenburg and pomeranium the new patriot dream of a immense poland the old poland of tradition and then to descend into the country of the ukraine and dominate new territory it be easy to see that sooner or later the bolshevik degeneration over russium will be recompose germany in spite of all the attempt to break she up and crush she unity within thirty or forty year will be the most formidable ethnical nucleus of continental europe what will then happen to a poland which pretend to divide two people who represent numerically and will represent in other field also the greatest force of continental europe of to-morrow amongst many in france there be the old conception of napoleon i who consider the whole of european politics from a erroneous point of view that of a lasting french hegemony in europe when the lasting hegemony of people be no longer possible in the sad solitude of he exile at saint helena napoleon i say that not to have create a powerful poland keystone of the roof of the european edifice not to have destroy prussium and to have be mistake in regard to russium be the three great error of he life but all he work have as a end to put the life of europe under the control of france and be necessarily wreck by reality which do not permit the lasting mistake of a single nation which place herself above all the other in a free and progressive europe if the policy of the entente towards germany and towards the conquer country do not correspond either to collective declaration make during the war or to the promise solemnly make by wilson the policy towards russium have be a whole series of error in fact one can not talk of a policy of the entente in so far that with the exception of a few error commit in common great britain france and italy have each follow they own policy in he sixth point among the fourteen point no longer pure but violate and outrage worse than the woman of a conquer race by a tribe of kurd wilson say on January 8 1918 that the treatment mete out to russia by the sister nation and therefore they loyalty in assist she to settle herself should be the stern proof of they goodwill they should show that they do not confound they own interest or rather they egoism with what should be do for russium the proof be most unfortunate the attitude of the entente towards russium have have different phase in the first phase the prevail idea especially on the part of one of the ally be to send military expedition in conjunction especially with rumanium and poland this idea be immediately abandon on account of its very absurdity in the second phase the greatest hope be place in the blockade of isolate russium completely cut off from she -lrb- and for the rest she no longer have it -rrb- every facility of trade exchange at the same time war on the part of poland and rumanium be encourage to help the attempt which the man of the old regime be make in the interior france alone reach the point of officially recognize the tsarist undertaking of general wrangel lloyd george with the exception of some initial doubt always have the clearest idea in regard to russium and i never find myself in disagreement with he in value the man and the russian situation it be easy for a broad and serene mind to judge the position of the rest for my part i always try to follow that policy which would best bring about the most useful result with the least damage after the war the work mass in europe have the greatest illusion about russian communism and the bolshevik organization every military expedition against russium signify give the people the conviction that it be desire not to fight a enemy but to suffocate in blood a attempt at a communist organization i have always think that the dictatorship of the proletariat that be the dictatorship of ignorance and incapacity would necessarily lead to disaster and that hunger and death would follow violence there be for the people great error which must be carry out in the very effort to benefit civilization we propaganda would have serve nothing without the reality of ruin only the death by hunger of million of man in communist russium will convince the work mass in europe and america that the experiment of russium be not to be follow rather be it to be avoid at any cost to exterminate the communist attempt by a unjust war even if it be possible would have mean ruin for western civilization on repeat occasion i have counsel rumanium and poland not to make any attempt against russium and to limit themselves to defense every unjust aggression on the part of bolshevik russium would have find the entente dispose to further sacrifice to save two free nation but any provocation on they part could not create secure solidarity when i assume the direction of the government in June 1919 a italian military expedition be under order for georgium the english troops who be in small number be withdraw italy have with the consent of the ally and partly by she own desire prepare a big military expedition a considerable number of division be ready as also be the ship to commence the transport georgium be a country of extraordinary natural resource and it be think that she would be able to furnish italy with a great number of raw material which she lack what surprise I be that not only man of the government but intelligent financier and man of very advanced idea be convinced supporter of this expedition however confront by much opposition i immediately renounce this undertaking and renounce it in a definite form limit myself to encourage every commercial enterprise certainly the ally could not suggest anything unfriendly to italy but the effect of the expedition be to put italy directly at variance with the government of moscow to launch she upon a adventure of which it be impossible to tell the consequence in fact not long afterwards georgium fall into the hand of the bolshevik who send there a army of 125000 man and since then she have not be able to liberate herself if italy have make that expedition she would have be engage in a frightful military adventure with most difficult and costly transport in a theater of war of insuperable difficulty to what end georgium before the war form part of the russian empire and no country of the entente have consider that unjust further as though the vast empire and the dominion of the caucasus be not enough for russium the entente with monstrous condescension have give to russia constantinople and the strait and a huge zone in asia minor how could you take away from russia a territory which be legitimately hers and _ vice versa _ if georgium and the other state of the caucasus have sufficient strength to live autonomously how can you dominate aryan people who have rise to a notable state of development to go to georgia inevitably mean war with russium for italy and one moreover fraught with extraordinary difficulty in fact later the government of moscow as we have say succeed in invade as well as georgium almost all the republic of the caucasus and at san remo discuss the possibility of a expedition on the part of great britain france and italy to defend at least the oil production after the report of a military committee preside over by marshal foch the conclusion be quickly and easily arrive at that it be better to leave the matter alone italy have already make a expedition into albanium the reason for which beyond the military necessity for the period of the war have never be understand except that of spend a huge sum without receive the gratitude of the albanian a expedition in georgium would have do harm the consequence of which can not be readily measure it could indeed have mean ruin even those mind that be most blind by prejudice and hate recognize the complete failure of the russian communist system the so-called dictatorship of the proletariat be reduce in practice to a military dictatorship of a communist group which represent only a fraction of the work class and that not the best the bolshevik government be in the hand of a small minority in which fanaticism have take the place of character everything which represent the work of the past have be destroy and they have not know how to construct anything the great industry have fall and production be paralyse russium have live for a long time on the residue of she capitalistic production rather than on new production the productivity of she agricultural and industrial work have be kill by communism and the force of work have be reduce to a minimum the russian people be in strait which have no comparison and entire territory be die of hunger the communist regime in a short time have precipitate such damage and such misery as no system of oppression could achieve in century it be the proof if any be necessary that the form of communist production be not only harmful but not even last the economist say that it be absurd but give the collective madness which have attack some people nothing be absurd beyond hope in the rapid recovery of the most excited nation if any country could be the scene of a communist experiment it be russia imperial russium represent the most vast continuative territory which a state ever occupy in all history 's record of vast empire under the tsar a territory which be almost three time the size of the united state of america be occupy by a people who with the exception of a few case of individual revolt be accustom to the most servile obedience under nichola ii a few man exercise rule in a most despotic form over more than 180000000 individual spread over a immense territory all obey blindly centralization be so great and the obedience to the central power so absolute that no hostile demonstration be tolerate for long the communist regime therefore be able to count not only on the apathy of the russian people but also upon the blindest obedience to this fundamental condition of success to a government which must regulate production despotically be join another even greater condition of success russium be one of those country which like the united state of america china and brazil -lrb- the four greatest country of the earth not count the english dominion with much thinner population -rrb- possess within they own territory everything necessary for life imagine a country of self-contained economy that live entirely upon she own resource and trade with no one -lrb- and that be what happen in russium as a result of the blockade -rrb- russium have the possibility of realize within herself the most prosperous condition of existence she have in she territory everything : grain textile fiber combustible of every sort russium be one of the greatest reserve if not the greatest reserve in the world well the communist organization be sufficient the bureaucratic centralization which communism must necessarily carry with it to arrest every form of production russium which before could give grain to all be die of hunger russium which have sufficient quantity of coal for herself and could give petroleum to all europe can no longer move she railway russium which have wool flax linen and could have easily increase she cotton cultivation in the caucasus can not even clothe the soldier and functionary of the bolshevik state cease be the stimulus of individual interest few work the peasant work only to produce what they family need the worker in the city be chiefly engage in meeting and political reunion all wish to live upon the state and production organize autocratically and bureaucratically every day dry up and withers a bit more to those who read the collection of law issue by the bolshevik government many institution appear not only reasonable but also full of interest and justice also many law of the absolute government of past regime appear intelligent and noble but the law have not in itself any power of creation it regulate relation do not create they it can even take away wealth from some and give it to other but can not create the wealth when the individual interest begin to lack work which be sorrow and pain lag and do not produce to begin with it weaken in the short day when energy be avoid and then it stop through incapacity for energy the old fundamental truth be that in all the aryan tongue the word which indicate work have the same root as the word which denote pain among the great mass of man work be only do by necessity or under the stimulus of individual interest which excite the production of wealth they work for wealth and therefore in the aryan tongue wealth mean dominion and power two year ago i want in spite of the opinion of other to consent to the italian socialist visit russium i be convince that nothing would have serve better to break in italy the sympathy for russium or rather the illusion of the revolutionary as the spectacle of famine and disorder would never do the press of my country or the greater part of it criticize with more violence a proposal which i consider to be both wise and prudent i be glad to state that i be right and that maybe through the uncertainty and the lesson of those who have spread the illusion the italian socialist return from russium be bind to recognize that the communist experiment be the complete ruin of the russian people no conservative propaganda could have be more efficacious than the vision of the truth i be convince that the hostile attitude and almost persecution on the part of the entente rather help the bolshevik government whose claim to discredit be already so numerous that it be not necessary to nullify it by a unjust and evident persecution the bolshevik government could not be recognize : it give no guarantee of loyalty and too often its representative have violate the rights of hospitality and intrigue through fanatic and excited people to extend the revolution revolution and government be two term which can not co-exist but not to recognize the government of the soviet do not mean that the condition of such recognition must include that the war debt shall be guarantee and worse still the pre-war debt or that the gold resource and the metal of russium shall be give as a guarantee of that debt this morality exclusively financial and plutocratic can not be the base of international relation in a period in which humanity after the sorrow of the war have the annoyance of a peace which no one foresaw and of which very few in the early day understand the danger even when there be a tendency favourable to the recognition of the republic of the soviet i be always decidedly against it it be impossible to recognize a state which base all its relation on violence and which in its relation with foreign state seek or have almost always seek to carry out revolutionary propaganda even when yield to a impulse which it be not possible to avoid -- in the new italian chamber after the election of 1919 not only the socialist but above all the catholic popular party and the party of rinnovamento of which the ex-soldier especially form part vote unanimously a order of the day for the recognition of the actual government of russium -- i do not think it right to give and do not give effect to that vote impulsively generous which would have invest italy with the responsibility of recognize even if it be _ de facto _ the government of the soviet i have always however rebel and would never give my consent to any military undertaking against russium not even to a participation in the undertaking of man of the old regime it be easy to foresee that the population would not have follow they and that the undertaking be doom to failure however all the attempt at military revolt and counter-revolution be encourage with supplies of arm and material but in 1920 all the military undertaking in spite of the help give fail one after another in February the attempt of admiral koltchak fail miserably and in march that of general judenic fail have the attempt of denikin all the hope of the restoration be centre in general wrangel the only grand duke with any claim to military authority also send to tell I that this be a serious attempt with probability of success general wrangel in fact reunite the scattered force of the old regime and occupy a large territory in power france not only recognize in the government of wrangel the legitimate representative of russium but nominate she official representative with he in November 1920 even the army of wrangel which appear to be of granite be scatter poland through alternate vicissitude claim the power of resistance but have show that she have no offensive power against russium so all the attempt at restoration have break one after another one of the greatest error of the entente have be to treat russium on many occasion not as a fall friend but as a conquered enemy nothing have be more deplorable than to have consider as russium the man of the old regime who have be treat for a long time as the representative of a existing state when the state no longer exist let we suppose that the bolshevik government transform itself and give guarantee to the civilized nation not to make revolutionary agitation in foreign country to maintain the pledge she assume and to respect the liberty of citizen the united state of america great britain and italy would recognize she at once but france have a entirely different point of view she will not give any recognition unless the creditor of the old regime be guarantee in June 1920 the government of moscow send some gold to sweden to purchase indispensable goods millerand president of the council of minister and minister of foreign affair declare to the minister of sweden at paris that if he government consent to receive russian gold _ ferait acte de receleur _ he then telegraph to the minister of finance at stockholm regret that the government and public opinion in sweden be tend to consider the _ revendication juridique _ of the french creditor of the ancient russian regime to be such that they do not stop the consignment of swedish goods against russian gold he add at the end that the syndicate of creditor could utilize the news in telegram no 355 in which the swedish government give notice of the trade and put a sequestration on russian gold send to sweden this telegram better than any speech show the diversity of conception the bolshevik government may be so immoral that we can not recognize it until it give serious guarantee but if the government of moscow send a little of the gold that remain or have remain to buy goods what right have we to sequestrate the gold in the interest of the creditor of the old regime the new regime bear after the revolution can also not recognize the debt of the old regime and annul they it be not for that that we have no relation with it we have push germany by absurd demand to ruin she circulation it be already at about 100 milliard of mark if to-morrow it go to 150 or to 200 it will be necessary to annul it nearly the same as be do for bill of exchange and for this should we not treat with germany the new plutocratic conception which mark the policy of a section of the entente be not lasting and the people have a justifiable diffidence towards it bolshevism as i have repeatedly state can not be judge by we western eye : it be not a popular and revolutionary movement it be a religious fanaticism of the orthodox of the east hoist on the throne of tsarist despotism italy be the country which suffer most from the lack of continuous relation with russium in so far that almost all italian commerce and in consequence the price of freight and goods have be for almost half a century regulate by the traffic with the black sea ship which leave england fully laden with goods for italy generally continue to the black sea where they fill up with grain petroleum etc and then return to england after have take fresh cargo in italy and especially iron in spain it be possible in italy for long period of time to obtain most favourable freight and have coal at almost the same price as in england the voyage of the ship be make both come and go fully laden the situation of russium therefore hurt especially italy great britain have mediterranean interest france be partly a mediterranean nation italy alone be a mediterranean nation although italy have a particular interest in reopen relation with russium the italian government have understand that the best and shortest way be not to recognize the government of moscow but italy will never subordinate she recognition to plutocratic consideration whatever government there may be in italy it will never associate itself with action direct to compelling russium in order to be recognize to guarantee the payment of obligation assume previous to the war and the revolution civilization have already suppress corporal punishment for insolvent debtor and slavery from which individual be release should not be impose on nation by democracy which say they be civilized the fall of the communistic organization in russium be inevitable very probably from the immense revolutionary catastrophe which have hit russium there will spring up the diffusion of a regime of small land proprietor whatever be contrary to human nature be not lasting and communism can only accumulate misery and on its ruin will arise new form of life which we can not yet define but bolshevik russium can count still on two element which we do not habitually take into account : the apathy and indolence of the people on the one hand and the strength of the military organization on the other no other people would have resign itself to the intense misery and to the infinite suffering which ten of million of russian endure without complaint but still in the midst of so much misery no other people would have know how to maintain a powerful and disciplined army such as be the army of revolutionary russium the russian people have never have any sympathy for the military undertaking which the entente have aid during some of the meeting of premier at pari and london i have occasion in the sitting of the conference to speak with the representative of the new state especially those from the caucasus they be all agree in consider that the action of the man of the old regime and especially denikin be direct at the suppression of the independent state and to the return of the old form and they attribute to this the aversion of the russian people to they certainly it be difficult to speak of russium where there exist no longer a free press and the people have hardly any other preoccupation than that of not die of hunger although it be a disastrous organization the organization of the soviet remains still the only one which it be not possible to substitute immediately with another although the russian people can re-enter slowly into international life and take up again its thread a long time be necessary but also it be necessary to change tactic the peasant who form the enormous mass of the russian people look with terror on the old regime they have occupy the land and will maintain that occupation they do not want the return of the great russian prince who possess land cover province and be even ignorant of they possession one of the cause which have permit bolshevism to last be as i have say the attitude of the entente which on many occasion have show the greatest sympathy for the man of the old regime the tsar of russium be a insignificant man all the grand duke be person without dignity and without credit and the court and government abound with man without scruple -- violent thief and drunkard if bolshevik government have be ruin no one can deny but that a great part of the blame belong to the old regime the return of which no honest man desire a error not less serious be to allow poland to occupy large tract of purely russian territory there remain in europe therefore so many state of unrest which do not only concern the condition of the conquer country but also those of the conquer country we have already see how germany and the state which form part of she group can not now any longer represent a danger of war for many year to come and that none the less the victorious country and the new state continue to arm themselves in a most formidable manner we have see what a element of disorder poland have become and how the policy of the entente towards russium have constitute a permanent danger but all europe be still uncertain and the ground be so movable that any new construction threaten ruin austrium hungary bulgarium turkey can not live under the condition impose on they by the treaty but the new state for the most part be themselves in a sufficiently serious position with the exception of finland all the other state which have arise on the ruin of the russian empire be in serious difficulty if esthonium and lithuanium be in a fairly tolerable situation lettonium be in real ruin and hunger and tuberculosis rule almost everywhere as in many district of poland and russium at riga hunger and sickness have cause enormous loss amongst the population recently 15000 child be in a extremely serious physical and mental condition in a single dispensary of 663 child who be bring for treatment 151 be under-nourished 229 be scrofulous 66 anaemic and 217 suffer from rickets the datum publish in england and the united state and those of the red cross of geneva be terrible even with the greatest imagination it be difficult to think how hungary and austrium can live and carry out even in the smallest degree the obligation impose by the treaty by a moral paradox besides live they must indemnify the victor accord to the treaty of st germain and the trianon for all the damages which the war have bring on themselves and which the victor have suffer hungary have undergo the greatest occupation of she territory and she wealth this poor great country which save both civilization and christianity have be treat with a bitterness which nothing can explain except the desire of greed of those surround she and the fact that the weaker people see the stronger overcome wish and insist that she shall be reduce to impotence nothing in fact can justify the measure of violence and the depredation commit in magyar territory what be the rumanian occupation of hungary : a systematic rapine and the systematic destruction for a long time hidden and the stern reproach which lloyd george address in london to the premier of rumanium be perfectly justified after the war everyone want some sacrifice from hungary and no one dare to say a word of peace or goodwill for she when i try it be too late the victor hate hungary for she proud defense the adherent of socialism do not love she because she have to resist under more than difficult condition internal and external bolshevism the international financier hate she because of the violence commit against the jew so hungary suffer all the injustice without defense all the misery without help and all the intrigue without resistance before the war hungary have a area almost equal to that of italy 282870 square kilometre with a population of 18264533 inhabitant the treaty of trianon reduce she territory to 91114 kilometre -- that be 323 per cent -- and the population to 7481954 or 41 per cent it be not sufficient to cut off from hungary the population which be not ethnically magyar without any reason 1084447 magyar have be hand over to czeko-slovakia 457597 to jugo-slavia 1704851 to rumania also other nucleus of population have be detach without reason amongst all the belligerent hungary perhaps be the country which in comparison with the population have have the greatest number of dead the monarchy of the habsburg know that they could count on the bravery of the magyar and they send they to massacre in all the most bloody battle so the little people give over 500000 dead and a enormous number of injured and sick the territory take from hungary represent two-third of she mineral wealth the production of three million quintalus -lrb- 300000 ton -rrb- of gold and silver be entirely lose the great production of salt be also lose to she -lrb- about 250000 ton -rrb- the production of iron ore be reduce by 19 per cent of anthracite by 14 per cent of lignite by 70 per cent of the 2029 factory hardly 1241 have remain to hungary more than three-quarter of the magnificent railway wealth have be give away hungary at the same time have lose she greater resource in agriculture and cattle breed the capital henceforth too large for a too small state carry on amidst the greatest difficulty and there congregate the most pitiable of the transylvanian refugee and those from other lose region the demographic structure of hungary which up to a few year ago be excellent be now threaten the mortality among the child and the mortality from tuberculosis have become alarming at budapest even after the war the number of death surpass the number of birth the statistics publish by dr ferenczus prove that the number of child afflict with rickets and tuberculosis reach in budapest the terrific figure of 250000 in a population of about two million it be say that practically all the new-born in recent year partly through the privation of the mother and partly from the lack of milk be tuberculous the condition of life be so serious that there be no comparison some price have only rise five to tenfold but very many from thirty to fifty and even higher grain which before the war cost 31 crown cost now 500 crown corn have pass from 17 to 220 and 250 crown a kilogram of rice which use to cost 70 centime can be find now only at 80 crown sugar coffee and milk be at price which be absolutely prohibitive of the financial situation it be almost useless to speak the document present to the conference of brussels be sad evidence and a sure index be the course of the crown now so reduce as to have hardly any value in international relation the effective income be more than a fourth part of the effective expense and the rest be cover especially by the circulation such be the situation of hungary which have lose everything and which suffer the most atrocious privation and the most cruel pang of hunger in this condition she should accord to the treaty of trianon not only have sufficient for herself but pay indemnity to the enemy the hungarian deputy at the sit which approve the treaty of trianon be clothe in mourning and many be weep at the close they all rise and sing the national hymn a people which be in the condition of mind of the magyar people can accept the actual state of affair as a temporary necessity but have we any faith that it will not seek all occasion to retake what it have unjustly lose and that in a certain number of year there will not be new and more terrible war i can not hide the profound emotion which i feel when count apponyus on January 16 1920 before the supreme council at paris give the reason of hungary you gentleman -lrb- he say -rrb- whom victory have permit to place yourselve in the position of judge you have pronounce the culpability of you late enemy and the point of view which direct you in you resolution be that of make the consequence of the war fall on those who be responsible for it let we examine now with great serenity the condition impose on hungary condition which be inacceptable without the most serious consequence take away from hungary the larger part of she territory the greater part of she population the greater portion of she economic resource can this particular severity be justify by the general principle which inspire the entente hungary not have be hear -lrb- and be not hear except to take note of the declaration of the head of the delegation -rrb- can not accept a verdict which destroy she without explain the reason the figure furnish by the hungarian delegation leave no doubt behind : they treat of the dismemberment of hungary and the sacrifice of three million and a half of magyar and of the german population of hungary to people certainly more ignorant and less advance at the end apponyus and the hungarian delegation do not ask for anything more than a plebiscite for the territory in dispute after he have explain in a marvellous manner the great function of historic hungary that of have save on various occasion europe from barbaric invasion and of have know how to maintain its unity for ten century in spite of the many difference amongst nation count apponyus show how important it be for europe to have a solid hungary against the spread of bolshevism and violence you can say -lrb- add apponyus -rrb- that against all these reason there be only one -- victory the right of victory we know it gentleman we be sufficient realist in politics to count on this factor we know what we owe to victory and we be ready to pay the price of we defeat but should this be the sole principle of construction : that force alone should be the basis of what you would build that force alone should be the base of the new building that material force alone should be the power to hold up those construction which fall whilst you be try to build they the future of europe would then be sad and we can not believe it we do not find all that in the mentality of the victorious nation we do not find it in the declaration in which you have define the principle for which you have fight and the object of the war which you have propose to yourselve and after have refer to the tradition of the past count apponyus add : we have faith in the sincerity of the principle which you have proclaim : it would be do you injustice to think otherwise we have faith in the moral force with which you have wish to identify you cause and all that i wish to hope gentleman be that the glory of you arm may be surpass by the glory of the peace which you will give to the world the hungarian delegation be simply hear but the treaty which have be previously prepare and be the natural consequence of the treaty of versaille be in no way modify a examination of the treaty of trianon be superfluous by a stroke of irony the financial and economic clause inflict the most serious burden on a country which have lose almost everything : which have lose the greatest number of man proportionately in the war which since the war have have two revolution which for four month suffer the sacking of bolshevism -- lead by belum kun and the worst element of revolutionary political crime -- and finally have suffer a rumanian occupation which be worse almost than the revolution or bolshevism it be impossible to say which of the peace treaty impose on the conquer be lasting and which be the least supportable : after the treaty of versaille all the treaty have have the same tendency and the same conformation the situation of german-austrium be now such that she can say with andromache : let it please god that i have still something more to fear austrium have lose everything and she great capital which be the most joyous in europe shelter now a population whose resource be reduce to the minimum the slump in she production which be carry on amidst all the difficulty the fall in she credit the absolute lack of foreign exchange the difficulty of trading with the hostile population which surround she put austrium in a extremely difficult position and in progressive and continuous decadence the population especially in the city be compel to the hardest privation the increase of tuberculosis be continuous and threatening bulgarium have have rather less loss and although large tract of bulgarian territory have be give without any justifiable motive to greece and jugo-slavium and although all outlet on the aegean have be take from she by assign to greece land which she can not maintain on the whole bulgarium after the treaty of neuilly have less sharp suffering than the other conquered country bulgarium have a territorial extension of 113809 square kilometre she have now lose about 9000 square kilometre she have a population of 4800000 and have lose about 400000 as for turkey if the treaty should continue to exist she can be consider as disappear from europe and on the road to disappear from asia the turkish population have be distribute haphazard especially to greece or divide up under the form of mandate to country of the entente accord to the treaty of sèvres of August 10 1920 turkey abandon all she territory in europe withdraw she frontier to the ciatalgium line turkey in europe be limited therefore to the surroundings of constantinople with little more than 2000 square kilometre and a population which be rather hard to estimate but which be that only of the city and the surroundings -- perhaps a million and a half man in asia minor turkey lose the territory of the sanjak of smyrna over which however she retain a purely nominal sovereignty the territory still undefined of the armenian republic : syrium cilicium palestine and mesopotamium which become independent under mandatory power in arabium the territory of the hedjaz whilst the remainder of the peninsula will enjoy almost complete independence besides constantinople and the strait be subject to international control and the three state now the most closely interested -- great britain france and italy -- assume the control of the finances and other aspect of the ottoman administration every program have ignore turkey except when the entente have have opportunity to favor greece the greece of venezelo be the ward of the entente almost more than poland itself have participate in the war to a very small extent and with almost insignificant loss she have after the war almost treble she territory and almost double she population turkey be put entirely or almost so outside europe greece have take almost everything reject be the idea of fix the frontier on the eno medea line and the frontier fix at ciatalgium constantinople be under the fire of the greek artillery and constantinople be nominally the only city which remain to turkey the sanjak of smyrna in asia minor be the true wealth of turkey it represent forty-five per cent of the import of the turkish empire although the population of the whole vilayet of audin and the majority of the sanjak of smyrna be mussulman greece have the possession the whole of thrace be assign to greece adrianople a city sacred to islam which contain the tomb of the caliph have pass to the greek the entente despite the resistance of some of the head of government always yield to the request of greece there be a sentiment of antipathy for the turk and there be a sympathy for the greek : there be the idea to put outside europe all mussulman dominion and the remembrance of the old propaganda of gladstone and there be the threat of wilson who in one of he proposal desire exactly to put turkey outside europe but above all there be the personal work of venezelo every request without be even examine thoroughly be immediately justify by history statistics ethnography in any discussion he take care to _ solliciter doucement les textes _ as often the learn with few scruple do i have meet few man in my career who unite to a exalted patriotism such a profound ability as venezelo every time that in a friendly way i give he counsel of moderation and show he the necessity of limit the request of greece i never find a hard or intemperate spirit he know how to ask and obtain to profit by all the circumstance to utilize all the resource better even than the professional diplomat in ask he always have the air of offering and obtain he appear to be concede something he have at the same time a supreme ability to obtain the maximum force with the minimum of means and a mobility of spirit almost surprising he see no difficulty convince as he be of erect a greek empire on the remnant of turkey every time that doubt be express to he or he be show datum which should have moderate the position he deny the most evident thing he recognize no danger and see no difficulty he affirm always with absolute calm the certainty of success it be he opinion that the balkan peninsula should be in the north under the action of the serb-croat-slovene state and of rumanium and in the south of greece but greece have almost all the island of the aegean a part of the territory of turkey and all the port in the aegean and have the sanjak of smyrna should form a littoral empire of the east and chase the turk into the poorer district of anatolium in the facility with which the demand of greece be accept -lrb- and in spite of everything they be accept even after the fall of venezelo -rrb- there be not only a sympathy for greece but above all the certainty that a large greek army at smyrna would serve principally towards the security of those country which have and wish to consolidate great interest in asia minor as long as the turk of anatolium be think specially about smyrna and could not use she force elsewhere for the same motive in the last few year all the blame be attribute to the turk if they have err much the error even the minor one have be transform into crime the atrocity of the turk have be describe illustrated exaggerate all the other atrocity often no less serious have be forget or ignore the idea of a hellenic empire which dominate all the coast of the aegean in europe and asia encounter one fundamental difficulty to dominate the coast it be necessary to have the certainty of a large hinterland the roman in order to dominate dalmatium be oblige to go as far as the danube alexander the great to have a greek empire have above all to provide for land dominion commercial colony or penetration in isolation be certainly possible but vast political organization be not possible it be not sufficient to have territory it be necessary to organize it and regulate the life mankind do not nourish itself on what it eat and even less on what it digest but on what it assimilate historian of the future will be profoundly surprise to learn that in the name of the principle of nationality the vilayet of adrianople which contain the city dearest to the heart of islam after mecca be give to the greek accord to the very datum supply by venezelo there be 500000 turk 365000 greek and 107000 bulgarian in truth the turk be in much greater superiority the grand vizier of turkey in April 1920 present a note to the ambassador of the entente to revindicate the rights on certain vilayet of the turkish empire accord to this note in western thrace there be 522574 inhabitant of which 362445 be mussulman in the vilayet of adrianople out of 631000 inhabitant 360417 be mussulman the population of the vilayet of smyrna be 1819616 inhabitant of which 1437983 be mussulman perhaps these statistics be bias but the statistics present by the oppose party be even more fantastic after have have so many territorial concession greece -- who during the war have enrich herself by commerce -- be oblige even after the return of constantine who do not know how to resist the pressure to undertake most risky undertaking in asia minor and have no way of save herself except by a agreement with turkey in the illusion of conquer the turkish resistance she be now oblige to maintain a army twice as big as that of the british empire the dream of greatness increase : some little military success have give greece the idea also that the treaty of sèvres be only a foundation regulate the relationship with the ally and with the enemy and constitute for greece a title of rights the full possession of which can not be modify the war determine new rights which can not invalidate the concession already give which on the contrary be reinforce and become intangible but render necessary new concession what will happen whilst greece dream of constantinople and we have dispose of constantinople and the strait turkey seem resign to constantinople itself to-day a very poor international city rather than a turkish city the treaty of sèvres say that it be true that the contracting state be in agreement in not offend any of the rights of the ottoman government on constantinople which remain the capital of the turkish empire always under the reserve of the disposition of the treaty that be equivalent to say of a political regime that it be a controlled liberty just as in the time of the tsar it be say that there exist a _ monarchie constitutionnelle sous un autocrate _ constantinople under the treaty of sèvres be the free capital of the turkish empire under the reserve of the condition which be contain in the treaty and limit exactly that liberty the force of turkey have always be in she immense power of resistance win by resist wear out with the aid of time which the turk have consider not as a economic value but as they friend to conquer the resistance of turkey both in the new territory of europe and in asia minor greece will have to exhaust the greater part of she limited resource the turk have always bring to a standstill those who would dominate she by a stubborn resistance which be fanaticism and national dignity on the other hand the treaty of sèvres which have systematize in part eastern europe be conclude in the absence of two personage not to be unconsidered russium and germany the two state which have the greatest interest there germany the war win as she could not give she explanation on the conclusion of peace be not able to intervene in the solution of the question of the orient russium be absent wear out with the force of a war superior to she energy she fall into convulsion and be now struggle between the two misfortune of communism and misery of which it be hard to say whether one or which of the two be the consequence of the other one of the most characteristic fact concern armenia the entente never speak of armenia in he fourteen point wilson neither consider nor mention it it be a argument difficult for the entente in so far that russium be strain in reality -lrb- under the necessity of protect the christian -rrb- to take turkish armenia without leave russian armenia but suddenly some religious society and some philanthropic people institute a vast movement for the liberation of armenia nothing could be more just than to create a small armenian state which would have allow the armenian to group themselves around lake van and to affirm they national unity in one free state but here also the hatred of the turk the agitation of the greek the dimly illuminate philanthropy determine a large movement to form a great state of armenia which should have outlet on the sea and great territory so that no longer do people talk of a small state a refuge and safe asylum for the armenian but of a large state president wilson himself during the conference of san remo send a message in the form of a recall to mind if not a reproof to the european state of the entente because they do not proceed to the constitution of a state of armenia it be suggest to bring it down to trebizond to include erzeroum in the new armenia a vast state of armenia in which the armenian would have be in the minority and all that in homage to historical tradition and for dislike of the turk a great armenia create also a series of difficulty amongst which be that of the relation between armenia georgium and azerbajan supposing that in the future these state cut themselves off definitely from russium the great armenia would include the vilayet of erzeroum which be now the center of turkish nationalism and contain more mussulman than armenian as a matter of fact the vilayet of erzeroum have 673000 mussulman 1800 greek and 135000 armenian when it be a question of give greece territory in which the greek be in a minority it be say that the population be so badly govern by the turk that they have the right to pass under a better regime whatever it might be but for a large part of the territory of the so-called great armenia it be possible to commit the error of put large majority of mussulman people under a hostile armenian minority the armenian would have to fight at the same time against the kurd and against azerbajan they be surround by enemy on all side but the whole of the discussion of give the vilayet of erzeroum to armenia or leave it to turkey be entirely superfluous for it be not a question of attribute territory but of determine actual situation if it be desire to give to the armenian the city of erzeroum it be first of all necessary that they shall be able to enter and be able to remain there now since the armenian have not show with a few exception a great power of resistance and be rather a race of merchant than warrior it would be necessary for other to undertake the charge of defend they none of the european state desire a mandate for armenia and no one wish to assume the serious military burden of protect the armenian the united state after have in the message of wilson back a great armenia wish even less than the other state to interest themselves in it probably proposal of a more reasonable character and mark by less aversion for the turk would have permit the turk not only to recognize which be not difficult for they but in fact to respect the new state of armenia without the dream of a sea coast and the madness of erzeroum if the condition of the conquer be sufficiently serious the situation of the people most favor by the entente in europe -- poland and greece who have obtain the greatest and most unjust increase in territory have give for a diversity of reason extremely little during the war -- be certainly not less so each of these country be suffocate under the weight of the concession and seek in vain a way of salvation from the burden which they be not able to support and from the mania of conquest which be the fruit of exaltation and error have obtain much have obtain far more than they think or hope they believe that they advantage lie in new expansion poland violate treaty offend the law of international usage and be protect in everything she undertake but every one of she undertaking can only throw she into greater discomfort and augment the total of ruin all the violence in upper silesium to prevent the plebiscite go in favor of germany be not only tolerate but prepare far ahead when i be head of the italian government the representative of the german government in rome von herf give documentary evidence on what be be prepare and on April 30 1920 in a audience which i give he as head of the council he furnish I with proof of what be the polish organization what be its object and the source of its fund as everyone know the plebiscite of march 20 1921 in spite of the violence and notwithstanding the officially protect brigandage result favourably to germany out of 1200636 voter 717122 be for germany and 483514 for poland the 664 richest most prosperous and most populous commune give a majority for the german 597 commune give a majority for poland the territory of upper silesium accord to the treaty accord to the plebiscite accord to the most elementary international honesty should be immediately hand over to germany but as they do not wish to give the coal of upper silesium to germany and the big interest of the new great metallurgical group press and trick the treaty of versaille have here also become a _ chiffon de papier _ instead of accept as be the first duty the result of the plebiscite people have resort to sophism of incomparable weakness : article 88 of the treaty of versaille say only that the inhabitant of upper silesium shall be call to designate by means of a plebiscite if they desire to be unite to germany or to poland it be necessary to find a sophism the addendum of section 8 establish how the work of scrutiny shall be carry out and all the procedure of the election there be six article of procedure paragraph 4 say that each one shall vote in the commune where he be domicile or in that where he be bear if he have not a domicile in the territory the result of the vote shall be determine commune by commune accord to the majority of vote in each commune this mean then that the result of the voting as be do in political question in all country should be control commune by commune : it be the form of the scrutiny which the appendix define instead in order to take the coal away from germany it be attempt and be be still attempt not to apply the treaty but to violate the principle of the indivisibility of the territory and to give the mining district to poland the violation of the neutrality of belgium be not a offence to a treaty more serious than this attempt the treaty of 1839 can not be consider a _ chiffon de papier _ more than the treaty of versaille only the party be invert it be not france noble and democratic which inspire these movement but a plutocratic situation which have take the same position but on worse grounds as the german metallurgist before the war it be the same current against which lloyd george have several time bitterly protest and for which he have have very bitter word which it be not necessary to recall it be the same movement which have create agitation in italy by means of its organ and which attempt one thing only : to ruin the german industry and have the control of the coal to monopolize in europe the iron industry and those which be derive from it first of all in order to indemnify france for the _ temporary _ damage do to the mine in the north there be the cession _ in perpetuo _ of the mine of the saar then there be the repeat attempt to occupy the territory of the ruhr to control the coal last of all there be the wish not to apply the plebiscite and to violate the treaty of versaille by not give upper silesium to germany but give it abusively to poland germany produce before the war about 190000000 ton of coal in 1913 191500000 the consumption of these mine themselves be about a tenth 19000000 ton whilst for exportation be 83500000 ton and for internal consumption be 139000000 now germany have lose and justly alsace-lorraine 3800000 ton she have lose and it be not just the saar 13200000 ton she be bind by the obligation of the treaty to furnish france with 20000000 ton and to belgium and italy and france again another 25000000 ton if she lose the excellent coal of upper silesium about 43800000 ton per year she will be completely paralyse it be needless to lose time in demonstrate for what geographic ethnographic and economist reason upper silesium should be unite with germany it be a useless procedure and also after the plebiscite a insult to the reasoning power if the violation of treaty be not a right of the victor after the plebiscite in which notwithstanding all the violence three-quarter of the population vote for germany then there be no reason for discussion the word use by lloyd george on may 18 1921 in the house of common be a courteous abbreviation of the truth from the historical point of view he say poland have no rights over silesium the only reason for which poland could claim upper silesium be that it possess a numerous polish population arrive there in comparatively recent time with the intention of finding work and especially in the mine that be true and be more serious than would be a agitation of the italian in the state of san paulo of brazil claim that they have a majority of the population the polish insurrection say lloyd george justly be a challenge to the treaty of versaille which at the same time constitute the charter of polish liberty poland be the last country in europe which have the right to deplore the treaty because poland do not conquer the treaty poland do not gain she liberty and more than any other country should respect every comma of the treaty she owe she liberty to italy great britain and france in the future -lrb- say the english prime minister -rrb- force will lose its efficiency in regard to the treaty of versaille and the maintenance of the undertaking on the part of germany on the basis of she signature place to the treaty will count increasingly we have the right to everything which she give we : but we have the right also to leave everything which be leave to she it be we duty of impartiality to act with rigorous justice without take into account the advantage or the disadvantage which may accrue therefrom either the ally must demand that the treaty shall be respect or they should permit the german to make the pole respect it it be all very well to disarm germany but to desire that even the troops which she do possess should not participate in the re-establishment of order be a pure injustice russium -lrb- add lloyd george -rrb- to-day be a fall power tire a prey to a despotism which leave no hope but be also a country of great natural resource inhabit by a people of courage who at the beginning of the war give proof of its courage russium will not always find herself in the position in which she be to-day who can say what she will become in a short time she may become a powerful country which can say its word about the future of europe and the world to which part will she turn with whom will she unite there be nothing more just or more true than this but poland want to take away upper silesium from germany notwithstanding the plebiscite and against the treaty and which have in this action the aid of the metallurgical interest and the great interest of a large portion of the press of all europe poland which have large nucleus of german population after have be enslave claim the right to enslave population which be more culture richer and more advanced and besides the german it claim the right to enslave even russian people and further to occupy entire russian territory and wish to extend into ukraine there be then the political paradox of wilna this city which belong accord to the regular treaty to lithuanium have be occupy in a arbitrary manner by the pole who also claim kowno in short poland which obtain she unity by a miracle be work in the most feverish manner to create she own ruin she have no finance she have no administration she have no credit she do not work and yet consume she occupy new territory and ruin the old one of the 31000000 inhabitant as we have see 7 million be ukranian 22 russian 21 german and nearly half a million of other nationality but among the eighteen or nineteen million pole there be at least four million jew -- polish jew without doubt but the greater portion do not love poland which have not know how to assimilate they the treaty of versaille have create the absurd position that to go from one part to the other of germany it be necessary to traverse the danzig corridor in other term germany be cut in two part and to move in prussium herself from berlin to one of the oldest german city the home of emanuel kant konigsberg it be necessary to traverse polish territory so poland separate the two most numerous people of europe : russium and germany the biblical legend let we suppose that the water of the red sea open to let the choose people pass : but immediately afterwards the water close up again be it possible to suppose that such a arbitrary arrangement as this will last for long if it have last as long as it have it be because it be at least from the part of one section of the entente not the road to peace but because it be a method of crush down germany if a people have condition for develop rapidly it be czeko-slovakia but also with the intention of hurt germany and the german people a czeko-slovak state be create which have also its own tremendous crisis of nationality a czeko-slovakium with a population of eight to nine million people represent a compact ethnical unity instead they have add five and a half million people of different nationality amongst whom about 4000000 german with city which be the most german in the world as pilsen karlsbad reichenberg etc what be even more serious be that the 4000000 german be attach to germany and have a superior culture and civilization will never resign themselves to be place under the czek czeko-slovakium have mineral riches industrial concern and solid agriculture and a culture spread among the people -- all the condition for rise rapidly all these advantage risk be annul by the grave and useless insult to the german and magyar not only be the situation of europe in every way uncertain but there be a tendency in the group of the victor on the continent of europe to increase the military budget the relationship of trade be be restore only slowly commerce be speak of as a aim in italy the danger and peril of reopen trade with germany have be seriously discuss custom duty be raise every day the industrial group find easy propaganda for protection any limitation of competition be a duty whether it be the enemy of yesterday or the enemy of to-day and so the greatest evil of protection be camouflage under patriotism none of the country which have come out of the war on the continent have a financial position which help toward a solid situation all the financial document of the various country which i have collect and study with great care contain enormous mass of expense which be the consequence of the war those of the conquer country also contain enormous aggregation of expense which be or can become the cause of new war the conquered country have not actually any finance germany have a increase of expense which the fall of the mark render more serious in 1920 she spend not less than ninety-two milliard ruin she circulation how much have she spend in 1921 austrium and hungary have budget which be simply hypothesis the last austrian budget for 1921 assign a sum of seventy-one milliard of crown for expense and this for a poor country with 7000000 inhabitant a detailed examination of the financial situation of czeko-slovakium of rumanium and of the serbo-croat state give result which be at the least alarming even greece which until yesterday have a solid structure gallop now in a madness of expenditure which exceed all she resource and if she do not find a means to make peace with turkey she will find she credit exhaust the most ruinous of all be the situation of poland whose finance be certainly not better regulate than that of the bolshevik of moscow to judge from the course of the polish mark and the russian rouble if anyone get the idea of buy they on a international market the situation of the exchange since the war have not sensibly better even for the great country and it be extraordinarily worse for the other country in June 1921 france have a circulation of about thirty-eight milliard of franc belgium six milliard of franc italy of about eighteen milliard great britain between state note and bank of england note have hardly # 434000000 sterling actually among the continental country survive the war italy be the country which have make the greatest effort not to augment the circulation but to increase the duty also because she have no illusion of rebuild she finance and she national economy on a enemy indemnity but the conquer country have so abused they circulation that they almost live on the thought of it -- as in fact not a few of the conquer country and those come out from the war do germany have pass eighty-eight milliard and be rapidly approach one hundred milliard now when one think that the united state after so many loan and after all the expense of the war have only a circulation of 4557000000 dollar one understand what difficulty germany have to produce to live and to refurnish herself with raw material only great britain of all the country in europe which have issue from the war have have a courageous financial policy public opinion instead of push parliament to financial dissipation have insist on economy if the situation create by the war have transform also the english circulation into unconvertible paper money this be merely a pass fact if the sterling lose on the dollar -- that be on gold -- give the fact that the united state of america alone now have a money at par almost a quarter of its value this be also merely a transitory fact great britain have the good sense to curtail expense and the sterling tend always to improve france and italy be in a intermediate position they money can be save but it will require energetic care and great economy stern finance a greater development of production limitation of consumption above all of what be purchase from abroad at the date of which i be write express on a percentual basis the french franc be worth 47 centime of the sterling and 36 of the dollar -- that be to say of gold the italian lira be worth 28 centime of the sterling and 21 of the dollar here be still two country in which tenacious energy can save and with many sacrifice they can arrive at good money france have a good many more resource than italy she have a smaller need of importation and a greater facility for exportation but she public debt have reach 265 milliard the circulation have well pass thirty-eight milliard and they still fear to calculate amongst the extraordinary income of the budget the fifteen milliard a year which should come from germany italy with great difficulty of production and less concord inside the country have a more true vision and do not reckon any income which be not derive from she own resource she circulation do not pass eighteen milliard and she debt exceed by a little one hundred milliard with prudence and firmness france and italy will be able to balance they account but the financial situation and the exchange of the conquer country even that of germany may be call desperate if express in percentage the german mark be worth 511 per cent in comparison with the pound sterling and 398 per cent of the dollar what possibility be there of systematize the exchange germany be compel this year to carry she expense to 130 milliard of mark as she circulation have exceed eighty-eight milliard how can she straighten out she money as for the austrian and hungarian crown the jugo-slav crown the rumanian lei and all the other depreciate money they fate be not doubtful as they value be always descend and the gold equivalent become almost indeterminable they will have a common fate as for the polish mark it can be say that before long it will not be worth the paper on which it be print there be then the fantastic position of the public debt they have reach now such figure that no imagination could have forecast france alone have a debt which of itself exceed by a great deal all the debt of all the european state previous to the war : 265 milliard of franc and germany the conquer country have in she turn a debt which exceed 320 milliard of mark and which be rapidly approach 400 milliard the debt of many country be only record by feat of memory because there be no practical interest in know whether austrium hungary and especially poland have one debt or another since the situation of the creditor be not a situation of reality the whole debt of the united state of america be after so much war only 23982000000 dollar but the united state be creditor of the entente for 9500000000 dollar also england against a debt of # 9240000000 sterling have a credit of # 1778000000 these serious figure whilst they increase the condition of discomfort render even more serious by the scarcity of commercial exchange indicate also what necessity may be superior to all in every country to preserve internal peace : produce more consume less put the finances in order and reconquer the credit instead the conquer country be go downward every day and the conquer country be maintain very big army exhaust they resource whilst they be spread the conviction that the indemnity from the enemy will compensate sufficiently or at least partially for the work of restoration in fact the cause of discontent and diffidence be augment nothing be more significant than the lack of conscience with which program of violence and of ruin be lightly accept nothing be more deplorable than the thoughtlessness with which the germ of new war be cultivate germany have disarm with a swiftness which have even astonish the military circle of the entente but the bitter result of the struggle be not only not finish against germany not even to-day do she form part of the league of nation -lrb- which be rather a sign of a state of mind than a advantage -rrb- but the attitude towards she be even more hostile two year after the end of the war r poincaré write that the league of nation would lose its best possibility of last if _ un jour _ it do not reunite all the nation of europe but he add that of all the conquer nation -- austrium hungary bulgarium turkey and germany -- the last-mentioned by she conduct during the war and after the peace justified least a near right of entry it would be _ incontestablement plus naturel _ -lrb- of how many thing do nature occupy herself -rrb- to let austrium enter first if she will disavow the policy of reattachment -- that be be purely german renounce against the principle of nationality in spite of the principle of auto-decision when she can not live alone to unite herself to germany bulgarium and turkey as long as they have a loyal and courteous attitude towards greece rumanium and serbium the turn of germany will come but only after turkey when she will have give proof of execute the treaty which no reasonable and honest person consider any more executable in its integrity the most characteristic fact of this peace which continue the war can be recapitulate as follow : 1 europe on the whole have more man under arm than before the war the conquered state be force to disarm but the conquer state have increase the armament the new state and the country which have come through the war have increase they armament 2 production be very tardily be take up again because there be everywhere if in a different degree a lesser desire for work on the part of the work class join with a need for higher remuneration 3 the difficulty of trade instead of decrease in many country of europe be increase and international commerce be very slowly recover between the state of europe there be not a real commerce which can compare with that under normal condition consider actual value with value before the war the product which now form the substance of trade between european country do not represent even the half of that before the war as the desire for consumption if not the capacity for consumption have greatly increase and the production be greatly decrease all the state have increase they function so the discredit of the paper money and the treasury bill which permit these heavy expense be in all the country of europe even if in different degree very great the conquer country from the moment that they have obtain in the treaty of peace the acknowledgment of the conquer that the war be cause by they hold it to be legitimate that they should lose all they disposable goods they colony they ship they credit and they commercial organization abroad but that the conquer should also pay all the damages of the war the war therefore should be pay for by the conquer who recognize -lrb- even if against they will -rrb- that they be alone responsible that form henceforth a certain canon of foreign politics the less a thing appear true the more it be repeat although the treaty oblige austrium hungary bulgarium and turkey to pay the damages of the war it be however certain that they be not able to pay anything and not even the expense of the victor on they territory _ cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator _ say juvenal -lrb- who have nothing can give nothing -rrb- and austrium for she part instead of give be implore food succor so the problem remain limited to germany can she pay the indemnity indicate in the treaty can she pay for the damages and indemnify the victor after have give up she colony she ship she railway material all she disposable credit abroad in what form can she pay the fundamental controversy reduce itself henceforth only to this point which we shall try if possible to make clear since we desire that this matter shall be present in the clearest and most evident form from now on it be not the chancellery which must impose the solution of great problem but it be the mass of the public in europe and america v the anxiety of the victor we have see the process by which the idea of the indemnity for damages which be not contain either in the peace declaration of the entente nor in the manifestation of the various parliament nor in the first armistice proposal nor in the armistice between italy and austrium be introduce in the armistice with germany out of pure regard for france without take heed of the consequence three word say clemenceau only three word need be add word which compromise nothing and be a act of deference to france the entire construction of the treaty after all be base on those three word and how fantastic the demand for compensation have become a old italian proverb say in time of war there be more lie than earth ancient and modern pottery reproduce the motto which be widespread and whose truth be not understand until some year ago so many foolish thing be say about the almost mysterious maneuver of germany about she vast expansion she great resource and accumulate capital that the reality tend to become lose to sight these absurd legend form during the war be not forget and there be even now many who believe in good faith that germany can pay if not twenty or twenty-five milliard a year at least eight or nine without any difficulty france 's shrewdest politician however well know that the demand for a enormous and unlimited indemnity be only a means of put germany under control and depress she to the point of exhaustion but the other maintain this proposal more out of rancor and hatred than from any actual political concept it may be say that the problem of the indemnity have never be seriously study and that the calculation the valuation the procedure have all form a series of impulsive act co-ordinate by a single error the error of the french politician who have the one aim of hold germany down the procedure be simple in the first phase the indemnity come into be from three word insert almost by chance into the armistice treaty on November 2 1918 _ réparation des dommages _ it be merely a matter of a simple expression to content public feeling : _ je supplie le conseil de se mettre dans l'esprit de la population française _ it be a moral concession a moral satisfaction but afterwards as thing go on all be alter when it come to prepare the treaty for a while the idea not only of a reparation of damages but of the payment of the cost of the war be entertain it be maintain that the practice of make the vanquish reimburse the cost of the war be permit by international law since germany have provoke the war and lose it she must not only furnish a indemnity for the loss but also pay the cost the cost be calculate roughly at seven hundred milliard of franc at par further there be the damage to assess in the aggregate war cost damage to property damage to person come to at least one thousand milliard but since it be impossible to demand immediate payment and be necessary to spread the sum over fifty year take into consideration sinking fund and interest the total come to three thousand milliard the amount be publish by the illustrated papers with the usual diagram drawing of golden globe length of paper money if stretch out height of metal if all pile up together etc etc these figure be discuss for the first few month by a public accustomed to be surprise at nothing they merely help to demonstrate that a indemnity of 350 milliard be a real sacrifice for the ally thus a whole series of principle come to be establish which be a contradiction of reality a great share in the responsibility in this matter lie with great britain who not only follow france 's error but in certain way make it worse by a number of intemperate request italy have no influence on the proceedings owe to she indecisive policy only the united state notwithstanding the banality of some of she expert -lrb- _ lucus a non lucendo _ -rrb- speak a occasional word of reason when lloyd george understand the mistake commit in the matter of the indemnity it be too late the english public find itself face to face with the election almost the day after the conclusion of the war in the exist state of exaltation and hatred the candidate find a convenient plank in promise the extermination of germany the trial of the kaiser as well as of thousand of german officer accuse of cruelty and last but not least the end of german competition the prime minister of australium william morris hughe a small-minded insensitive violent man direct a furious campaign in favor of a huge indemnity lord northcliffe lend the aid of he numerous papers to this campaign which stir up the elector lloyd george with he admirable intelligence perceive the situation clearly he do not believe in the usefulness or even in the possibility of try the kaiser and the german officer he do not believe in the possibility of a enormous indemnity or even a very large one he first statement like those of bonar law a serious honest well-balanced man a idealist with the appearance of a practical person reveal nothing on the eve of the dissolution of parliament lloyd george speak at wolverhampton November 24 1918 do not even hint at the question of the reparation or indemnity he be impel along that track by the movement come from france by the behavior of the candidate by hughe 's attitude and by the press generally especially that of northcliffe a most vulgar spectacle be offer by many of the english candidate among whom be several member of the war cabinet who use language worthy of rave dervish before crowd hypnotize by promise of the most impossible thing to promise the elector that germany should pay the cost of the war to announce to those who have lose they sens that the kaiser be to be hang to promise the arrest and punishment of the most guilty german officer to prophesy the reduction to slavery of a germany compete on sea and land be certainly the easiest kind of electoral program the numerous war-mutilated accept it with much enthusiasm and the people listen open-mouthed to the endless series of promise hughe who be at bottom in good faith develop the thesis which he afterwards uphold at pari with logical precision it be germany 's duty to reimburse without any limitation the entire cost of the war : damage to property damage to person and war-cost he who have commit the wrong must make reparation for it to the extreme limit of he resource and this principle recognize by the jurist require that the total of the whole cost of the war fall upon the enemy nation later on hughe who be a sincere man recognize that it be not possible to go beyond ask for reparation of the damages lloyd george be drag along by the necessity of not draw away the mass of the elector from the candidate of he party thus he be oblige on December 11 in he final manifesto to announce not only the kaiser 's trial and that of all those responsible for atrocity but to promise the most extensive kind of indemnity from germany and the compensation of all who have suffer by the war speak the same evening at bristol he promise to uphold the principle of the indemnity and assert the absolute right to demand from germany payment for the cost of the war in england where the illusion soon pass away in france where it have not yet be dissipate the public have be allow to believe that germany can pay the greater part if not the entire cost of the war or at least make compensation for the damage for many year i have study the figure in relation to private wealth and the wealth of nation and i have write at length on the subject i know how difficult it be to obtain by means of even approximate statistics result more or less near to the reality nothing pained I more than to hear the facility with which politician of repute speak of obtain a indemnity of hundred of milliard when germany express she desire to pay a indemnity in one agree lump sum -lrb- _ à forfait _ -rrb- of one hundred milliard of gold mark -lrb- a indemnity she could never pay so enormous be it -rrb- i see statesman whom i imagine not deprive of intelligence smile at the paltriness of the offer a indemnity of fifty milliard of gold mark such as that propose by keyne appear absurd in its smallness when the peace conference reassemble in paris the situation concern the indemnity be as follow the entente have never during the war speak of indemnity as a condition of peace wilson in he proposal have speak only of reconstruction of invade territory the request for _ réparation des dommages _ have be include in the term of the armistice merely to afford a moral satisfaction to france but the campaign wage in france and during the election in england have exaggerate the demand so as to include not only reparation for damage but reimbursement of the cost of the war only the united state maintain that the indemnity should be limit to the reparation of the damages : a reparation which in later phase include not only reconstruction of destroy territory and damage do to private property but even pension to the family of those dead in the war and the sum in grant pay during it when prussium beat france in 1870 she ask for a indemnity of five milliard the entente could have demand from the vanquish a indemnity and then have reassume relation with they provide it be a indemnity which they could pay in a brief period of time instead it be impossible to demand a enormous sum of 300 or 400 milliard a difficult figure to fix definitely recourse be have to another expedient from the moment that the phrase _ réparation des dommages _ be include in the armistice treaty as a claim that could be urge it become impossible to ask for a fix sum what be to be ask for be neither more nor less than the amount of the damages hence a special commission be require and the reparation commission appear on the scene to decide the sum to demand from germany and to control its payment also even after germany be disarm a portion of she territory must remain in the ally ' hand as a guarantee for the execution of the treaty the reason why france have always be oppose to a rapid conclusion of the indemnity question be that she may continue to have the right in view of the question remain still open to occupy the left bank of the rhine and to keep the bridgehead indicate in the treaty the thesis support by clemenceau at the conference be a simple one : germany must recognize the total amount of she debt it be not enough to say that we recognize it i demand in the name of the french government and after have consult my colleague that the peace treaty fix germany 's debt to we and indicate the nature of the damages for which reparation be due we will fix a period of thirty year if you so wish it and we will give to the commission after it have reduce the debt to figure the mandate to make germany pay within these thirty year all she owe we if the whole debt can not be pay in thirty year the commission will have the right to extend the time for payment this scheme be agree and the thesis of the compensation of damages instead of that for the payment of the cost of the war prevail for a very simple reason if they propose to demand for all integral reparation and therefore the reimbursement of the cost of the war the figure would have be enormous it become necessary to reduce all the credit proportionally as in the case of a bankruptcy now since in the matter of the indemnity france occupy the first place -lrb- to begin with she ask sixty-five per cent of all sum pay by germany -rrb- she take the greater part of the indemnity while on the sum pay for reimbursement of cost of war she would only have get less than twenty per cent germany have therefore be put under control for all the time she will be pay the indemnity -- that be for a indefinite time the valuation of the expense for the reconstruction of the ruin territory have to be carry out accord to the regulation of the treaty and the price have increase the french government present in July 1920 a first approximate valuation : damages 152 milliard pension 58 milliard in all 210 milliard in November 1920 the damages have increase to 218 milliard even these figure represent something less absurd than the first demand and figure on September 5 1919 the french minister of finance speaking in the french chamber calculate the total of the german indemnity arise from the treaty at 375 milliard whose interest would accumulate until 1921 after which date germany would begin to pay she debt in thirty-four annual rate of about 25 milliard each and 13750 milliard a year would go to france again in November 1920 ogier minister of the liberate region put before the reparation commission in the name of france a detailed memorial which make the value of the territory to be reconstruct only for the case of private individual come to 140 milliard not include the pension damage to railway and mercantile marine which total 218 milliard of which 77 milliard be for pension and 141 milliard for damages of late the sense of reality have begin to diffuse itself the minister loucheur himself have laugh at the earlier figure and have state that the damages do not exceed eighty milliard but the french public have be accustom for some time to take the figure of klotz seriously and to discuss indemnity of 150 200 and 250 milliard the public however be not yet aware of the real position and will not be able to arrive at a just realization of it without pass through a serious moral crisis which will be the first secure element of the real peace set aside all question of indemnity from austria-hungary turkey and bulgarium -lrb- they have nothing to give can give nothing on the contrary they ask and merit assistance -rrb- it be clear that all the indemnity must be pay by germany the french total of the material damage claim in the invade district have be absolutely fantastic and more exaggerated than in the case of belgium whose indemnity claim would lead one to suppose the total destruction of at least the third part of she territory almost as if she have undergo the submersion of say ten thousand square metre of she small territory this problem of the indemnity limit to the reparation of damages and in accordance with the cost contemplate in the treaty of versaille have never be seriously tackle one may even say it have not be seriously examine and it be deplorable that there have be create among the public or among a large part of it the conviction that germany will repair the damage of the war by she own effort this idea however find no acceptance in england among serious person and in italy no one believe in it but in france and belgium the idea be widely diffused and the wish to spread the belief be lively in several section of opinion not because intelligent people believe in the possibility of effective payment but with the idea of put germany in the light of not maintain the clause of the peace thus extend the right to prolong the military occupation and even to aggravate it germany thereby be keep out of the league of nation and she dissolution facilitate john maynard keyne ever since the end of 1919 have show in he admirable book the absurdity of ask for vast indemnity germany 's impossibility of pay they and the risk for all europe of follow a road lead to ruin thus at the same time accentuate the work of disintegration start by the treaty that book have awaken a wide-sounding echo but it ought to have have a still wider one and would have do but for the fact that unfortunately the press in free country be anything but free the great industrial syndicate especially in the steel-making industry which control so large a part of the press among the majority of the state of europe and even beyond europe find easy ally in the inadequate preparation of the major part of the journalist to discuss the most important problem and the indisposition on the part of the public to examine those question which present difficulty and be so render less convenient for discussion i know keyne during the war when he be attach to the british treasury and chief of the department charge to look after the foreign exchange and the financial relation between great britain and she ally a serious writer a teacher of economics of considerable value he bring to he difficult task a scrupulousness and a exactness that border on mistrust be at that time chancellor of the exchequer in italy in the bitterest and most decisive period of the war i have frequent contact with mr keyne and i always admire he exactness and he precision i could not always find it in myself to praise he friendly spirit but he have a almost mystic force of severity and those enormous squandering of wealth that facile assumption of liability that characterize this period of the war must have doubtless produce in he a sense of infinite disgust this state of mind often make he very exigent and sometimes unjustifiably suspicious he word have a decisive effect on the action of the english treasury when the war be finish he take part as first delegate of the english treasury at the peace conference of pari and be substitute by the chancellor of the exchequer in the supreme economic council he quit he office when he have come to the conclusion that it be hopeless to look for any fundamental change of the peace treaty he book be not only a document of political uprightness but the first appeal to a sense of reality which after a orgy of mistake menace a succession of catastrophe in my opinion it merit a serious reconsideration as the expression of a new conscience as well as a expression of the truth which be only disguise by the exist state of exasperation and violence after two year we must recognize that all the forecast of keyne have be bear out by the fact : that the exchange question have grow worse in all the country who have be in the war that the absurd indemnity impose on the enemy can not be pay that the depressed condition of the vanquish be harmful to the victor almost in equal measure with the vanquish themselves that it menace they very existence that in fine the sense of dissolution be more widespread than ever the moment have come to make a objective examination of the indemnity question and to discuss it without any hesitation let we lay aside all sentiment and forget the undertaking of the peace treaty let we suppose that the entente 's declaration and wilson 's proposal never happen let we imagine that we be examine a simple commercial proposition strip of all sentiment and moral idea after a great war it be useless to invoke moral sentiment : man while they be blind by hatred recognize nothing save they passion it be the nature of war not only to kill or ruin a great number of man not only to cause considerable material damage but also necessarily to bring about state of mind full of hate which can not be end at once and which be even refractory to the language of reason for a long time i myself have look upon the german with the profoundest hatred when i think of all the person of my race dead in the war when i look back upon the fifteen month of anguish when my first-born son be a prisoner of war in germany i be quite able to understand the state of mind of those who make the peace and the mental condition in which it be make what determine the atmosphere of the peace treaty be the fact that there be a conference preside over by clemenceau who remember the prussian in the street of pari after the war of 1870 who desire but one thing : the extermination of the german what create this atmosphere or help to create it be the action of marshal foch who have lose in the war the two person dearest to he in life the person who attach he to existence but now we must examine the question not in the light of we sentiment or even of we hatred we must see quite calmly if the treaty be possible of application without cause the ruin of the vanquish then we must ask ourselves if the ruin of the vanquish do not bring in its train the ruin of the victor put aside then all moral consideration let we examine and value the economic fact there be no question that the reparation problem exist solely in the case of germany who have still a powerful statal framework which allow she to maintain great effort capable not only of provide she with the means of subsistence but also of pay a large indemnity to the victor the other vanquished state be more in need of succor than anything else what be the reparation let we follow the _ précis _ of they which a representative of france make at the signing of the treaty of versaille they be as follow : 1 germany be responsible for the total of the loss and damages sustain by she victor inasmuch as she cause they 2 germany in consideration of the permanent diminution of she resource result from the peace treaty be only oblige -lrb- but be oblige without restitution or reserve -rrb- to reimburse the direct damages and the pension as precised in schedule i of clause viii of the treaty 3 germany must pay before may 1 1921 not less than twenty milliard of gold mark or make equivalent payment in kind 4 on may 1 the reparation commission will fix the total amount of the german debt 5 this debt must be liquidate by annual payment whose total be to be fix by the commission 6 the payment will continue for a period of thirty year or longer if by that time the debt be not extinguish 7 germany will issue one hundred milliard of gold mark of bearer bond and afterwards all such issue as the reparation commission shall demand until the amount of the debt be reach in order to permit the stabilization of credit 8 the payment will be make in money and in kind the payment in kind will be make in coal live stock chemical product ship machine furniture etc the payment _ in specie _ consist of metal money of germany 's credit public and private abroad and of a first charge on all the effect and resource of the empire and the german state 9 the reparation commission charge with see to the execution of this clause shall have power of control and decision it will be a commission for germany 's debt with wider power call upon to decide accord to equity justice and good faith without be bind by any codex or special legislation it have obtain from germany a irrevocable recognition of its authority its duty be to supervise until the extinction of the debt germany 's situation she financial operation she effect she capacity for production she provision she production this commission must decide what germany can pay each year and must see that she payment add to the budget fall upon she taxpayer at least to the extent of the ally country most heavily tax its decision shall be carry out immediately and receive immediate application without any other formality the commission can effect all the change deem necessary in the german law and regulation as well as all the sanction whether of a financial economic or military nature arise from establish violation of the clause put under its control and germany be oblige not to consider these sanction as hostile act in order to guarantee the payment a inter-allied army -- in reality a franco-belgian army -- occupy the left bank of the rhine and be station at the bridgehead germany be completely helpless and have lose all the feature of a sovereign state inasmuch as she be subject to control in a way that turkey never be in modern history we can find no parallel for this state of thing these be condition which alter the very basis of civilization and the relation between people such procedure have be unknown in europe for century the public have become accustomed in certain country to consider responsible for the war not the government that wish it or the german people but the future generation thus the indemnity be to be pay -- be such condition possible -- in thirty year and for at least twenty year afterwards by people still unborn at the time of the war this cursing of the guilty people have no parallel in modern history we must go back to the early age of humanity to find anything of the kind but even the most inhuman policy such as germany have never adopt in she victory although she have be accuse of every cruelty can find at least some justification if they have a useful effect on the country which have wish and accept responsibility for they the conqueror have he rights julius caesar kill million of german and retard perhaps for some century the invasion of rome but the practice establish by the treaty of versaille be in effect equally harmful to victor and vanquish though maybe in unequal measure and in any case prepare the dissolution of europe i have my share in arrange at san remo the spa conference in the hope and with the desire of discuss frankly with the german what sum they could pay by way of indemnity without upset they economy and damaging severely that of the ally but the ministerial crisis which take place in June 1920 prevent I from participate at the spa conference and the profitable action which great britain have agree to initiate in the common interest ours as well as france 's could not be proceed with the old mistake continue to be repeat though many attenuation have come about and the truth begin to appear even for those most responsible for past error we shall have to examine with all fair-mindedness if germany be in a position to pay in whole or in part the indemnity establish or rather result from the treaty france especially believe or have say on several occasion she believe that germany can pay without difficulty 350 milliard after many stupidity and many exaggeration which have help considerably to confuse the public in face of the new difficulty which have arise new arrangement for the payment of the indemnity have be establish on may 11 in face of the situation which have arise the ally propose and germany accept a fresh scheme for the payment of the reparation germany be constrain to pay every year in cash and in kind the equivalent of 500 million dollar plus 26 per cent of the total of she export the rest of the accord refer to the procedure for the issue of bond guarantee on the indicated payment to the constitution of a guarantee committee and to the date of payment probably germany will have be able to get through the year 1921 without insurmountable difficulty at spa on April 27 1921 the proportionate sum assess for each of the conquer power be establish on a total indemnity notably reduce in comparison with the earlier absurd demand but leave alone the idea of a indemnity of 250 150 or even 100 milliard of gold mark it will be well to see in a concrete form what germany can be make to pay and whether the useless and elaborate structure of the reparation commission which with its power of regulate the internal life of germany for thirty year or more ought not to be substitute by a simpler formulum more in sympathy with civilized notion shortly before the war accord to successive statistics the private wealth of france do not amount to more than 250 milliard the wealth of france accord to successive valuation be calculate at 208 milliard of franc in 1905 -lrb- de foville -rrb- at 214 milliard in 1908 -lrb- turquan -rrb- at about 250 milliard accord to other author the wealth of belgium accord to official statistics publish by the belgian ministry of finance in 1913 amount to rather less than 30 milliard of franc the estimate be perhaps a trifle low but this official figure must not be consider as be a long way from the truth at certain moment belgium 's demand have surpass even the total of she national wealth while the damages have not be more than some milliard the value of the land in france be calculate before the war at between 62 and 78 milliard the value of the building accord to _ l'annuaire statistique de la france _ at 59-1\/2 milliard the territory occupy by the german be not more than a tenth of the national territory even take into consideration the loss of industrial building it be very difficult to arrive at the figure of 15 milliard at the same time it be true that the minister loucheur declare on February 17 1919 in the french chamber that the reconstruction of the devastate region in france require 75 milliard -- that be very much more than double the private wealth of all the inhabitant of all the occupied region in all the demand for compensation of the various state we have see not so much a real and precise estimate of the damages as a kind of fix of credit in the largest measure possible in order that in the successive reduction each state should still have proportionally a advantageous position make he calculation with a generosity which i assert to be excessive -lrb- and i assert this as a result of a accurate study of the question which perhaps i may have occasion to publish -rrb- keyne maintain that the damages for which germany should be make to pay come to 53 milliard for all loss on land and sea and for the effect of aerial bombardment -- 53 milliard of franc all tell include the damages of france great britain italy belgium serbium etc i do not believe that the damages reach 40 milliard of gold mark unless of course we calculate in they the pension and allowance but these figure have but small interest since the demand have be almost entirely purely arbitrary what we must see be if germany can pay and if with a regime of restriction and violence she can hand over not the many milliard which have be announce and which have be a deplorable speculation on the ignorance of the public but a considerable sum such as be that which many folk still delude themselves it be possible to have germany have already consign all she transferable wealth the gold in she bank she colony she commercial fleet a large and even the best part of she railway material she submarine cable she foreign credit the property of she private citizen in the victorious country etc everything that could be hand over even in opposition to the rights of nation as such be know in modern civilized state germany have give she have also hypothecate all she national goods what can she give now germany can pay in three way only : 1 merchandise and food product on account of the indemnity : coal machine chemical product etc 2 credit abroad come from the sale of merchandise if germany export that be sell eight milliard mark ' worth of goods abroad she pay two milliard to the reparation commission 3 property of private citizen germany can enslave herself cede the property of she private citizen to foreign state or citizen to be dispose of as they wish exclude this last form which would constitute slavery pure and simple as useless as impossible and calculate to parallel the method in use among barbarous people there only remain the first two method of payment which we will examine briefly it must be remember that germany even before the war be in difficulty for insufficient avenue of development give the restricted nature of she territory and the exuberance of she population she territory smaller than that of france and much less fertile must now nourish a population which stand to that of france as three to two if we have have gigantic war loss germany who fight on all the front have have loss certainly not inferior to ours she too have have in larger or smaller proportion she dead and she mutilate she have know the most atrocious suffering from hunger thus she productive power be much diminish not only on account of the grave difficulty in which she people find themselves -lrb- and the development of tuberculosis be a terrible index -rrb- but also for the lowered productive capacity of she working class the statistics publish by the office of public health of the empire -lrb- _ reichsgesundheitsamt _ -rrb- and those give in england by professor starling and lay before the british parliament leave no doubt in the matter germany have have more than 1800000 dead and many more than 4000000 of wound she have she mass of orphan widow and invalid take altogether the structure of she people have become much worse what constitute the great productive force of the german people be not only its capacity to work but the industrial organization which she have create with fifty year of effort at home and abroad with many sacrifice now germany have not only lose 8 per cent of she population but _ 25 _ per cent of she territory from which cereal and potato be produce and 10 to 12 per cent of she live stock etc we have already see the enormous loss sustain by germany in coal iron and potash the most intelligent and able work class create by the most patient effort have be reduce to the state of become revolutionary element by take away from germany at a stroke she mercantile marine about 60000 sailor have be throw on the street and they skill make useless germany therefore impoverish in she agricultural territory deprive of a good part of she raw material with a population weaken in its productive quality have lose a good part of she productive capacity because all she organization abroad have be break and everything which serve as a means of exchange of product such as she mercantile fleet have be destroy moreover germany encounter everywhere obstacle and diffidence impede from develop herself on the sea hold up to ridicule by the absurd corridor of danzig whereby there be a polish state in german territory she can not help seek life and raw material in russium in these condition she must not only nourish she vast population not only produce sufficient to prevent she from fall into misery but must also pay a indemnity which fertile fantasy have make a deceive europe believe should amount even to 350 milliard of gold mark and which even now be suppose by seemingly reasonable people to be able to surpass easily the sum of a hundred milliard could france or italy by any kind of sacrifice have pay any indemnity after end the war germany have not only to live and make reparation but to maintain a inter-allied army of occupation and the heavy machinery of the reparation commission and must prepare to pay a indemnity for thirty year france and italy have preserve they colony -lrb- italy 's do not amount to much -rrb- they mercantile fleet -lrb- which have much increase -rrb- they foreign organization germany without any of these thing be to find herself able to pay a indemnity which a brazen-faced and ignorant press deceive the public into believe could amount to twenty or twenty-five milliard a year take by chance helferich 's book which value the annual capitalization at ten milliard the difference between a annual production of forty-three milliard and a consumption of thirty-three milliard inexpert person have say that germany can pay without difficulty ten milliard plus a premium on she export plus a sufficient quantity of goods and product one become humiliate when one see newspaper of serious reputation and politician deem not to be unimportant reasoning in language so false the estimate of private wealth about which the economist make experiment and on which i myself have write much in the past have a relative value it may be argue that before the war the total of all private patrimony in germany surpass but by little three hundred milliard of mark and this be a valuation make upon generous criterion but when it be say that the annual capitalization of germany be ten milliard that be not to say that ten milliard of capital be deposit in the bank ready to be transfer at will capitalization mean the creation of instrument of production the national capital increase in proportion as these be increase therefore the best way of examine the annual capitalization of a country be to see how many new industry have arise to what extent the old one have be improve what improvement have be introduce into agriculture what new investment have be make etc if the capitalization of germany before the war be scarcely ten milliard of mark it be too small for a empire of some 67000000 person i believe that in reality it be larger but even if it come to fifteen milliard it represent a very small figure the population in the progressive country augment every year in germany before the war in the period 1908-1913 the population increase on a average by 843000 person a year the difference between the people bear alive and the dead in other word the annual increase of the population per annum be at the rate of 130 per thousand as in certain district of italy the peasant plant a row of tree on the birth of every son so among nation it be necessary to increase the national wealth at least in proportion to the newly arrive suppose that the private wealth of the german citizen be from 300 to 350 milliard of mark -lrb- a exaggeration doubtless -rrb- it would mean that the wealth increase each year by a thirteenth part or rather more the difference between the increase in population and the increase in wealth constitute the effective increase in wealth but always in a form not capable of be immediately handle to plant tree build workshop utilize water-power : all this stand for the output of so much force one may undertake such work or not but in any case the result can not immediately be give to the enemy this be so obvious as to be banal to seek to propagate the idea that germany can give that which constitute she annual capitalization either wholly or in great part be a example of extreme ignorance of economic fact it be positively painful to listen to certain type of argument a french minister have say that the success of the war loan for 151 milliard in germany and the increase of bank deposit for a sum of 28 milliard coincide with a increase of capital of 45 milliard in limited company demonstrate that germany have save at least 180 milliard in four year leave aside the exactness of these figure it be really sad to observe reasoning of this type how can the public have a idea of the reality let we apply the same reasoning to france we must say that inasmuch as france before the war have a public debt of 32 milliard and now have a debt of 265 milliard without calculate what she owe to great britain and the united state france by reason of the war have immensely enriched herself since leave aside the debt contract abroad and the previous debt she have save during the war 200 milliard quite apart from the increase in bank deposit and the increase in capital of limited company the war have therefore immensely enriched she in reality we be face to face with one of the phenomenon of the intoxication bring about by paper money by means of which it have be possible at certain time for the public to believe that the war have increase wealth other feature of this phenomenon we have in the wretched example of the capitalist class after which it be not unnatural that the people should give way to a great increase in consumption should demand high wages and offer little work in return at the very time when it be most necessary to work more and consume less there be small cause for wonder that certain erroneous idea be diffuse among the public when they have they be in those very sophisms accord to which the indemnity to be pay by the beaten enemy will pay all the debt and loss of the conquer nation we be tell that germany be responsible for the war must impose on herself a regime of restriction and organize herself as a export nation for the payment of the reparation debt here again the question can be consider in two way accord as it be propose to allow germany a free commerce or to impose on she a series of forced cession of goods in payment of the reparation both hypothesis can be entertain but both as we shall see lead to economic disorder in the conquer state if these relation be to be regulate by violence it be useless to dilate on the other aphorism or rather sophism which be seriously discuss at the pari conference and which have even the honor of be sustain by the technical expert : 1 that it be not important to know what germany can pay but it be sufficient to know what she ought to pay 2 that no one can foresee what immense resource germany will develop within thirty or forty year and what germany will not be able to pay will be pay by the ally 3 that germany under the stimulus of a military occupation will increase she production in a unheard-of manner 4 the obligation arise from the treaty be a absolute one the capacity to pay can only be take into consideration to establish the number and amount of the annual payment the total must in any case be pay within thirty year or more 5 _ elle ou nous _ germany must pay if she do not the ally must pay it be not necessary that germany free herself by a certain date it be only necessary that she pay all 6 germany have not to discuss only to pay let time illustrate what be at present unforeseeable etc etc if we exclude the third means of payment germany have two way open to she first of all she can give goods what goods when we speak of goods we really mean coal now as we have see accord to the treaty germany must furnish for ten year to belgium italy and france especially quantity of coal which in the first five year run from 39-1\/2 to 42 million of ton and in the follow five year come to a maximum of about 32 million and all this when she have lose the saar coalfield and be face with the threatening situation in upper silesium germany 's export reach they maximum in 1913 when the figure touch 10097 million of mark exclude precious metal group export and import in category the million of mark be distribute as follow : import export foodstuff 2759 1035 live animal 289 74 raw material 5003 1518 semi-manufactured goods 5003 1139 manufacture goods 1478 6395 about one-fifth of the entire export be in iron and machine product -lrb- 1337 -lrb- mil -rrb- article in iron 680 machine -rrb- 722 million from coal -lrb- as against import of other quality of 289 -rrb- 658 million of chemical product and drug 446 from cotton 298 paint 290 techno-electrical production etc what goods can germany give in payment of the indemnity we have see how she have lose a very large part of she iron and a considerable quantity of she coal all the economic force of germany be base upon : -lrb- a -rrb- the proper use of she reserve of coal and iron which allow she to develop enormously those industry which be base on these two element -lrb- b -rrb- on she transport and tariff system which enable she to fight any competition -lrb- c -rrb- on she potent overseas commercial organization now by effect of the treaty these three great force have be entirely or in part destroy what goods can germany give in payment of the indemnity and what goods can she offer without ruin the internal production of the entente country let we suppose that germany give machine color wagon locomotive etc then for this very fact the country of the entente already suffer by unemployment would soon see they factory oblige to shut down germany must therefore above all give raw material but since she be herself a country that import raw material and have a enormous and dense population she be herself oblige to import raw material for the fundamental need of she existence if we examine germany 's commerce in the five year prior to the war -- that be in the five year of she greatest boom -- we shall find that the import always exceed the export in the two year before the war 1912 and 1913 the import be respectively 10691 and 10770 million and the export 8956 and 10097 million in some year the difference even exceed two milliard and be compensate by credit abroad with the payment of freight and with the remittance -lrb- always considerable -rrb- of the german emigrant all this be lose export goods can yield to the exporter a profit of let we suppose ten twelve or twenty per cent for the ally to take a income from the custom return mean in practice reduce the export in fact in germany production must be carry on at such low price as to compensate for the difference or the export must be reduce in the first case -lrb- which be not likely since germany succeed only with difficulty owe to she exchange in obtain raw material and must encounter worse difficulty in this respect than other country -rrb- germany would be prepare the ruin of the other country in organize form of production which be superior to those of all she rival germany would therefore damage all she creditor especially in the foreign market in the second case -- the reduction of export one would have the exactly opposite effect to that imagine in the program propose -- that be the indemnity would become unpayable in term of franc or lira at par with the dollar germany 's exportation in 1920 have amount to 7250 million in 1921 a increase may be foresee if germany have to pay in cash and kind 2500 million of mark at par plus 26 per cent of the total of she export then suppose a export trade of eight milliard she will have to give 1840 million or in all 4540 million of mark thus we arrive by stage at less hyperbolical figure come down from the twenty-five milliard a year to something less than a fifth but to come to grip with reality germany in all way it must be admit can not give more than two milliard a year if indeed it be desire that a indemnity be pay notwithstanding she great resource france would not be in a condition to pay abroad two milliard a year without ruin she exchange which would drop at once to the level of germany 's italy with difficulty could pay one milliard france and italy be honest country yet they can not pay they war creditor and have not be able and be not able to pay any share of they debt either to the united state of america or to great britain as a matter of fact up till now they have pay nothing and the interest continue to accumulate with the capital why have neither france nor italy yet start to pay some of they debt have win the war france have have all she could have -- fertile territory new colony a abundance of raw material and above all iron and potash the simple explanation be that which i have give above can then germany who be in a terrible condition whose circulation promise ruin who have no longer credit nor organization abroad who have a great shortage in raw material can germany pay four or five milliard a year we must also remember that germany in addition to the indemnity must pay the cost of the army of occupation which up to now have amount to twenty-five milliard of paper mark a year or more than 1600 million of franc at par that be germany have to bear for the support of the ally troops a charge equal to the cost of maintain the army of france italy and belgium before the war no financier seriously believe that the issue of bond authorize by the treaty for the credit of the reparation commission have now any probability of success germany 's monetary circulation system be fall to the stage of _ assignat _ and the time be not distant when if intelligent provision be not make germany will not be in a position to pay any indemnity oblige to pay only one milliard of gold mark germany have not be able to find this modest sum -lrb- modest that be in comparison with all the dream about the indemnity -rrb- without contract new foreign debt and increase she already enormous paper circulation each new indemnity payment each new debt incur will only place germany in the position of be unable to make payment abroad many capitalist even in italy inspire they press to state that germany derive a advantage from the depreciation of she mark or in other word be content with its low level but the high exchange -lrb- and in the case of germany it amount to ruin -rrb- render almost impossible the purchase of raw material of which germany have need with what mean must she carry out she payment if she be oblige to cede a large part of she custom receipt that be of she best form of monetary value and if she have no longer either credit or freight abroad if what be happen injured germany only it would be more possible to explain it if not to justify it but on the contrary germany 's fall which be also the decadence of europe profoundly disturb not only the european continent but many other produce country though the united state and great britain partially escape the effect they too feel the influence of it not only in they political serenity but in the market of goods and value germany 's position be bind up with that of europe she conqueror can not escape dire consequence if the erstwhile enemy collapse we must not forget that before the war in the year 1912 and 1913 the larger part of germany 's commerce be with the united state with great britain with russium and with austria-hungary in 1913 she commerce with the united state represent alone little less than two milliard and a half of mark accord to the statistics of the german empire and 520 million of dollar accord to the figure of america if we except canada which we may consider a territorial continuation the two best customer of the united state be great britain and germany they be moreover the two customer whose import largely exceed the export the downfall of germany will bring about inevitably a formidable crisis in the anglo-saxon country and consequent ruin in other country up to now germany have give all she could any further payment will cause a downfall without change the actual monetary position germany after a certain point will not pay but will drag down in she fall the economic edifice of the victorious country of the continent all attempt at force be useless all imposition be sterile all this be true and can not be deny but at the same time it must be recognize that in the first move for the indemnity there be a reasonable cause for anxiety on the part of the ally if germany have have to pay no indemnity this absurd situation would have come about that although exhaust germany would have issue from the war without debt abroad and could easily have get into she stride again while france italy and in much less degree great britain would have come out of the war with heavy debt this anxiety be not only just and well found but it be easy to see why it give ground for a feeling of grave disquiet france and italy the two big victor state of the continent be only able to carry on the war through the assistance of great britain and the united state the war would not have last long without the aid of the anglo-saxon which have a decisive effect france have obtain all she ask for and indeed more than all she prevision warrant italy have find herself in a difficult position she too have realize she territorial aspiration though not completely and the assistance of she ally have not always be cordial i have have as head of the government to oppose all the agitation and especially the adriatic adventure which have cause a acute party division in italy from a sense of duty i have also assume all responsibility but the rigidness of wilson in the fiume and adriatic question and the behavior of some of the european ally have be perfectly unjustifiable in certain message to wilson during my term of government i do not fail to bring this fact forward certainly jugo-slavium 's demand must be consider with a sense of justice and it would have be a error and a injustice to attribute to italy large tract of territory in dalmatium but it would have be possible to find a more reasonable settlement for a country which have have such suffering and know such loss during the war in any case when by the absurd system follow in the treaty so many million of german magyar turk and bulgarian have be hand over to state like serbium whose intemperate behavior precipitate the war or to state like greece which take only a small and obligatory part in it when state like poland have win they unity and independence without make war when germany have be dismember in order to give poland a access to the sea and the ridiculous situation of danzig have be create when the moral paradox of the saar which now become a german alsace-lorraine have be set up when so many million of man have be parcel out without any criterion it be particularly invidious to contest so bitterly italy 's claim i can freely affirm this inasmuch as risk all popularity i have always do my duty as a statesman point out that solution which time have prove to be inevitable no one can deny that italy be pass through a period of crisis and political ill-health such state of public psychology be for people what neurasthenia be for individual on what do it depend often enough on reason which can not be isolate or define it be a state of mind which may come to a end at any minute and be consequent upon the after-effect of the war rather than come from the economic disorder it derive from a malady of the temperament i have never believe in spite of the agitation which have be see at certain period in the possibility of a revolutionary movement in italy italy be the only country which have never have religious war the only country which in twenty century have never have a real revolution land of a ancient civilization prone to sudden burst of enthusiasm susceptible to rapid mood of discouragement italy with all the infinite resource of the latin spirit have always overcome the most difficult crisis by she wonderful adaptive power in human history she be perhaps the only country where three great civilization have rise up one after another in she limited soil if italy can have the minimum of coal cereal and raw material necessary to she existence and she economic revival the traditional good sense of the italian people will easily overcome a crisis which be grave but which affect in various measure all the victor and be especially temperamental it can not be deny that if all europe be sick italy have its own special state of mind those who wish the war and those who be against it be both dissatisfied : the former because after the war italy have not have the compensation she expect and have have suffering far greater than could have be imagine the latter because they attribute to the war and the conduct of the war the great trial which the nation have now to face this sickness of the spirit be the greatest cause of disorder since malcontent be always the worst kind of leaven four great country decide the war : great britain france italy and the united state of america russium fall to piece soon and fall rather on account of she own internal condition than from enemy pressure the action of the united state arrive late but be decisive each country however act from a different state of mind france have of necessity to make war she territory be invade and all hope of salvation lay in moral resistance alone great britain have to wage the war out of sense of duty she have guarantee the neutrality of belgium and could not fail to keep she word of honor two country alone choose freely the sorrowful way of the war : italy and the united state but they sacrifice suffering and loss have be very different during the war the united state have be able to develop they immense resource and notwithstanding some crisis they have come out of it much richer than before from be debtor to europe they have become creditor they have few loss in man and a great development in wealth italy who after many difficulty have develop in she famous but too narrow territory the germ of a greater fortune have have together with very heavy loss in man heavy loss in she wealth italy save the destiny of france for the first time by declare she neutrality on August 2 1914 and let the certainty of it be know from July 30 as the diplomatic document have show it be that sudden and unexpected declaration of neutrality which render it possible for france to concentrate all she force in the north and to win the battle of the marne italy for a second time save the destiny of the entente by enter into the war -lrb- too precipitately and unprepared -rrb- in may 1915 thus prevent the austrian army which be formidable for its technical organization and for its valor from obtain the advantage it expect why do italy go to war the diplomatic document which be not all document of political wisdom demonstrate the anxiety of the italian government to realize its adriatic program and to gain secure frontier against austria-hungary and its successor but this be not the _ cause _ of the war it be rather a means of explain to the people the necessity for the war italy have be for nearly thirty-four year ally of austria-hungary and the aspiration of italy 's adriatic policy have never disturb the relation between the two country the real cause of italy 's war be a sentimental movement a form of extraordinary agitation of the spirit bring about by the invasion of belgium and the danger of france the intellectual movement especially the world of culture partook largely in foment the state of exaltation which determine the war during the progress of the war which be long and bitter italy pass through some terrible hour she privation during the war and immediately after surpass all expectation italy find herself face to face with a enemy who enjoy a superior geographical situation a numerical superiority as well as a superiority in artillery after the downfall of russium she have to support a terrible campaign even in 1917 after the military disaster when ally troops come to italy she send abroad more man than there come ally troops to she aid accord to some statistics which i have compile and which i communicate to the ally italy be show in relation to she demographic structure to have more man in the front line than any other country the economic suffering be and be greater than those endure by other france be only in part a mediterranean country while italy be entirely so during the war the action of the submarine render the victualling of italy a very difficult matter many province for month on end have to content themselves with the most wretched kind of food take population and wealth into proportion if the united state have make the effort of italy they would have have to arm sixteen million of man to have lose a million and a half to two million soldier and to have spend at least four hundred milliard in order to work up popular enthusiasm -lrb- and it be perhaps necessary -rrb- the importance of the country 's adriatic claim be exaggerated thus many italian believe even to-day in good faith that the war may be consider as lose if some of these aspiration have not be realize or will not be realize but after the war italy 's situation suddenly change the war have arouse in the mind of all european a certain sentiment of violence a longing for expansion and conquest the proclamation of the entente the declaration of wilson 's principle or point become so contorted that no trace of they could be find in the treaty save for that ironic _ covenant _ of the league of nation which be always repeat on the front page as dante say of the rule of st benedict _ at the expense of the paper _ for italy a very curious situation come about france have but one enemy : germany she unite all she force against this enemy in a coherent and single action which culminate in the treaty of versaille france have but one idea : to make the entente abandon the principle it have proclaim and try to suffocate germany dismember she humiliate she by means of a military occupation by control she transport confiscate all she available wealth by raise to the dignity of elevated and highly civilized state inferior population without national dignity austria-hungary be compose of eleven people it be split up into a series of state austrium and hungary be reduce to small territory and shut up in narrow confines all the other country be give to rumania to serbium or more exactly to the shs state to poland or else be form into new state such as czeko-slovakium these country be consider by the entente as ally and to further good relation the most important of the entente nation protect they aspiration even against the wish of italy the italian have find themselves in they difficult theater of war against galatian bosnian croat transylvanian etc but by the simple fact of they have change name and have call themselves pole jugo-slavs rumanian they become friend in order to favor some of these new friend it have happen that not only have italy 's sentiment be offend but even justice itself montenegro be always mention in the declaration of the entente on January 10 1917 briand speaking in the name of all the ally unite at that time _ pour la défense et la liberté des peuples _ put forward as a fundamental program the restoration of belgium serbium and montenegro : montenegro be in this on a equality with belgium just a year afterwards January 8 1918 wilson when formulate he fourteen point have include in the eleventh proposition the duty of evacuate the territory of rumanium serbium and montenegro and restore they the exact reason for which it be establish that montenegro should be absorb -lrb- even without plebiscite -rrb- by the shs state thus offend also italy 's sentiment will remain one of the most melancholy page of the new holy alliance that the entente have become along with that poor prestigeless organism the league of nation but let we hope this latter will find a means of renovate itself while france be ruin the german people 's source of life the people who have fight most ferociously against italy become through the war friendly nation and every aspiration of italy appear direct to lessen the prestige of the new friend and ally the territory annex to italy have a small economic value for more than thirty year italy have sell a large part of she richest agricultural produce to germany and have import a considerable share of she raw material from russium since the war she have find herself in a state of regular isolation a large part of the italian press which repeat at haphazard the commonest theme of the french press instead of wish for a more intense revival of commercial relation with germany frighten the ignorant public with story of german penetration and the very plutocracy in france and italy -- though not to the same extent in italy -- abandon itself to the identical error so to-day we find spread throughout the peninsula a sense of lively discontent which be conducive to a wider acceptance of the exaggeration of the socialist and the fascist but the phenomenon be a transitory one italy have no feeling of rancor against the german people she enter the war against german imperialism and can not now follow any imperialistic policy indeed in the face of the imperialistic competition which have follow the war italy find herself in a state of profound psychological uneasiness france worry herself about one people only since as a matter of fact she have only one warlike race at she frontier : germany italy 's frontier touch france the german people the slav race it be therefore she interest to approve a democratic policy which allow no one of the group of combatant to take up a position of superiority the true italian nationalist policy consist in be against all excessive nationalism and nothing be more harmful to italy 's policy than the abandonment of those democratic principle in the name of which she arise and by which she live if the policy of justice be a moral duty for the other nation for italy it be a necessity of existence the italian people have a clear vision of these fact notwithstanding a certain section of she press and notwithstanding the exaggeration of certain excited party arise from the ash of the war and therefore she uneasiness be great while other country have a economic crisis italy experience in addition a mental crisis but one with which she will be able to cope france however be in a much more difficult situation and she policy be still a result of she anxiety all the violence against germany be until the day before yesterday a effect of hatred to-day they derive from dread moral idea have for nation a still greater value than wealth france have until the other day the prestige of she democratic institution all of we who detest the hohenzollern dynasty and the insolent fatuity of william ii love france heir of the bourgeois revolution and champion of democracy so when the war come all the democracy feel a lively pang : the crush of france mean the crush of democracy and liberty all the old bond be break all the organization which germany have abroad be smash up and france have be save not by arm alone but by the potent life of free people yet victory have take away from france she greatest prestige she fascination as a democratic country now all the democratic race of the world look at france with a eye of diffidence -- some indeed with rancor other with hate france have comport herself much more crudely toward germany than a victorious germany would have comport herself toward france in the case of russium she have follow purely plutocratic tendency she have on foot the largest army in the world in front of a helpless germany she send color troops to occupy the most culture and progressive city of germany abuse the fruit of victory she show no respect for the principle of nationality or for the right of self-determination germany be in a helpless and broken condition to-day she will not make war she can not but if to-morrow she should make war how many people would come to france 's aid the policy which have set the people of italy against one another the diffusion of nationalist violence the crude persecution of enemy exclude even from the league of nation have create a atmosphere of distrust of france admirable in she political perceptiveness france by reason of a error of exaltation have lose almost all the benefit of she victorious action a situation hedge with difficulty have be bring about the united state and great britain have no longer any treaty of alliance of guarantee with france the anglo-saxons conqueror of the war and the peace have draw themselves aside italy have no alliance and can not have any no italian politician could pledge he country and parliament only desire that italy follow a democratic peaceful policy maintain herself in europe as a force for equilibrium and life france apart from she military alliance with belgium have a whole system of alliance base largely on the newly form state : shift sand like poland russium 's and germany 's enemy whose fate no one can prophesy when germany be reconstruct and russium rise again unless she find a way of remedy she present mistake which be much more numerous than she past misfortune thus the more france increase she army the more she corner raw material and increase she measure against germany the more unquiet she become she have see that germany mistress on land and to a large extent on the sea after have carry everywhere she victorious flag after have organize she commerce and by means of she banker merchant and capitalist make vast expansion and place a regular network of relation and intrigue round the earth fall when she attempt she act of imperialistic violence france when in difficulty appeal to the sentiment of the nation and find arm everywhere to help she what then be able organization worth to-day the fluctuation of fortune in europe show for all she people a succession of victory and defeat there be no people always victorious after have under napoleon i humiliate germany france see the end of she imperialistic dream and later witness the ruin of napoleon iii she have suffer two great defeat and then when she stand diminish in stature before a germany at the top of she fortune she together with the ally have have a victory over a enemy who seem invincible but no one can foresee the future to have convey great nucleus of german population to the slav state and especially to poland to have divide the magyar without any consideration for they fine race among the rumanian czeko-slovak and the jugo-slav to have use every kind of violence with the bulgar to have offend turkey on any and every pretext to have do this be not to have guarantee the victory and the peace russium sooner or later will recover it be a illusion to suppose that great britain france and italy can form a agreement to regulate the new state or new state that will arise in russium there be too many tendency and diverse interest germany too will reconstruct herself after a series of sorrow and privation and no one can say how the german will behave unless a policy of peace and social renovation be shape and follow we son will witness scene much more terrible than those which have horrify we generation and upset we mind even more than we interest meanwhile in spite of the frightful increase of scrofula rickets and tuberculosis from which the conquer people be principally suffer the march of the nation will proceed accord to the law which have hitherto rule they and on which we limited action can only for brief period cause small modification or alteration demographic forecast like all forecast of social event have but a comparative value it be true that demographic movement be especially biological manifestation but it be also true that economic and social factor exercise a profound influence in limit they regularity and can disturb they very considerably it be better therefore not to make long prophecy what be certain be that the french population have increase almost imperceptibly while the population of germany augment very rapidly the annual average of birth in the five year before the war 1908-13 be 762000 in france and 176000 in belgium in germany it be 1916000 the average of death be 729000 in france 117000 in belgium and 1073000 in germany thus per thousand the excess of birth in france be 09 in belgium 77 in germany 13 the war have terribly aggravate the situation in france whose demographic structure be far from be a healthy one from statistics publish give the first result of the french census of 1921 -- without the new territory of alsace-lorraine -- france in the interval between the two census period have decrease by 2102864 from 39602258 to 37499394 -lrb- 1921 -rrb- the death in the war do not represent a half of this decrease when be deduct the loss among the color troops and those from french colony who fight for france the new territory annex to france do not compensate for the war-mortality and the decrease in birth we may presume that if normal condition of life return the population of germany and german-austrium will be more than one hundred million that the population of belgium altogether little less than fifty million that italy will have a population much greater than that of france of at least forty-five million inhabitant and that great britain will have about sixty million inhabitant in the case of the german we have mention one hundred million person take into consideration germany and german-austrium but the german of poland of czeko-slovakium and the baltic state will amount to at least twenty million of inhabitant no one can make forecast even of a approximate nature on russium whose fecundity be always the highest in europe and whose loss be rapidly replace by a high birth-rate even after the greatest catastrophe and then there be the german spread about the world great aggregation of population as in the united state of america and in a lesser degree in brazil up to now these people have be silent not only because they be surround by hostile population but because the accusation of be son of the hun weigh down upon they more than any danger of the war but the treaty of versaille and more still the manner in which it have be apply be to dissipate and soon will entirely dissipate the atmosphere of antipathy that exist against the german in great britain the situation have change profoundly in three year the united state have make they separate peace and want no responsibility in italy there scarcely exist any hatred for the german and apart from certain capitalist who paint in lurid color the danger of german penetration in they papers because they want higher tariff protection and to be able to speculate on government order there be no one who do not desire peace with all people the great majority of the italian people only desire to reconstruct the economic and social life of the nation certain tendency in france 's policy depend perhaps on she great anxiety for the future a anxiety in fact not unjustified by the lesson of the past germany notwithstanding she fallen state she anguish and the torment she have to go through be so strong and vital that everybody be certain of see she once again potent indeed more potent and formidable than ever everyone in france be convince that the treaty of versaille have lose all foundation since the united state of america abandon it and since great britain and italy persuade of the impossibility of put certain clause into effect have show by they attitude that they be not dispose to entertain coercive measure which be as useless as they be damage in france the very author of the treaty of versaille recognize that it be weaken by a series of successive attenuation tardieu have assert that the treaty of versaille tend to be abandon on all side : _ cette faillite a des cause allemande des cause alliés des cause françaises _ -lrb- p 489 -rrb- the united state have ask itself after the trouble that have follow the treaty if wisdom do not lie in the old time isolation in washington 's testament in the monroe doctrine : _ keep off _ but in america they have not understand say tardieu that to assist europe the same solidarity be necessary that exist during the war -lrb- p 493 -rrb- great britain accord to tardieu tend now also to stand aside the english be incline to say _ n'en parlon plus _ -lrb- p 493 -rrb- no frenchman will accept with calm the manner in which lloyd george have conceive the execution of the peace treaty the campaign for the revision of the treaty spring up in lower sphere and from popular association and workman 's group have surprise and sadden the french spirit -lrb- p 495 -rrb- in the new development _ était-ce une autre angleterre était-ce un autre lloyd george _ -lrb- p 496 -rrb- even in france herself tardieu recognize sadly the language have alter : _ les gouvernements français qui se sont succédé au pouvoir depuis le _ 10 _ janvier _ 1920 that be after the fall of clemenceau accuse in turn by poincaré of be weak and feeble in assert he demand _ ont compromi les droits que leur prédecesseur avait fait reconnaître à la france _ -lrb- p 503 -rrb- take into consideration germany 's financial downfall which threaten to upset not only all the indemnity scheme but the entire economy of continental europe the state of mind which be prevalent be not much different from that which tardieu indicate it be already more than a year ago since i leave the direction of the italian government and the french press no longer accuse I of be in perfect agreement with lloyd george yet poincaré write on August 1 1920 : _ l'autre jour m asquith déclarait au parlement britannique : quelque forme de langage qu'on emploie la conférence de spa a bien été en fait une conférence pour la révision des condition du traité chut a répondu m lloyd george : c'est là une déclaration très grave par l'effet qu'elle peut produire en france je ne puis la laisser passer sans la contredire contradiction de pure forme faite pour courtoisie vis-à-vis de nous mais qui malheureusement ne change rien au fond des choses chaque fois que le conseil suprême s ` est réuni il a laissé sur la table des delibérations quelques morceaux épars du traité _ no kind of high-handedness no combined effort will ever be able to keep afloat absurdity like the dream of the vast indemnity the polish program the hope of annex the saar etc as thing go there be almost more danger for the victor than for the vanquish he who have lose all have nothing to lose it be rather the victorious nation who risk all in this disorganized europe of ours the conqueror arm themselves in the ratio by which the vanquish disarm and the worse the situation of we old enemy become so much the worse become the exchange and the credit of the victorious continental country yet in some of the exaggerated idea of france and other country of the entente there be not only the rancor and anxiety for the future but a sentiment of well-founded diffidence after the war the european state belong to the entente have be embarrass not only on account of the enormous internal debt but also for the huge debt contract abroad if germany have not have to pay any indemnity and have not lose she colony and mercantile marine we should have be confront with the absurd paradox that the victorious nation would have issue from the war wear out with they territory destroy and with a huge foreign debt germany would have have she territory quite intact she industry ready to begin work again herself anxious to start again she productive force and in addition with no foreign debt consequently ample credit abroad in the mad struggle to break up germany there have have part not only hatred but also a quite reasonable anxiety which after all must be take into consideration even to-day three year after the war great britain have not pay she debt to america and france and italy have not pay they debt to america and great britain great britain could pay with a great effort france and italy can not pay anyhow accord to the account of the american treasury the ally ' war debt be 9587 million of dollar : 4277 million owe from great britain 2977 million from france 1648 million from italy 349 million from belgium 187 million from russium 61 million from czeko-slovakium 26 million from serbium 25 million from rumanium and 15 million from greece up to last July great britain have pay back 110 million of dollar since the spring of 1919 the payment of the interest on the amount due to the american treasury have be suspend by some european state between October and November 1919 the amount of the capitalize and unpaid interest of the european state come to 236 million dollar the figure have considerably increase since then accord to the _ statist _ -lrb- August 6 1921 -rrb- the ally ' debt to the united state on march 31 1921 amount to ten milliard and 959 million dollar include the interest in which sum great britain be interested to the sum of 4775 million dollar and france for 3351 million dollar but the _ statist 's _ figure in variance to the official figure include other debt than strictly war debt the debt of the various ally country ' to great britain on march 31 1921 accord to a schedule annex to the financial statement for 1921-22 publish by the british treasury come to # 1777900000 distribute as follow : france 557 million italy 476 million russium 561 million belgium 94 million serbia 22 million portugal rumanium greece and other ally 66 million this sum represent war debt but to it must be add the # 9900000 give by great britain for the reconstruction of belgium and the loan grant by she for relief to a amount of # 16000000 so altogether great britain 's credit to the ally on march 31 1921 be # 1803600000 and have since be increase by the interest great britain have also at the same date a credit of # 144000000 to she dominion france have credit of little less than nine milliard franc of which 875 million be from italy four milliard from russia 2250 million from belgium 500 million from the jugo-slav and 1250 million from other ally italy have only small credit of no account now this situation by reason of which the victorious country of europe be heavy debtor -lrb- france have a foreign debt of nearly 30 milliard and italy a debt of more than 20 milliard -rrb- in comparison with germany which come out of the war without any debt have create a certain amount of bad feeling germany would have get on she foot again quicker than the victor if she have no indemnity to pay and have no foreign debt to settle france 's anxiety in this matter be perfectly legitimate and must be most seriously consider without however produce the enormity of the treaty of versaille assume this the situation may be state in the follow term : 1 all the illusion as to the capacity of germany be able to pay have fall to piece and the indemnity after the absurd demand which tend to consider as inadequate the figure of 350 milliard and a annual payment of from ten to fifteen milliard have become a anxious unknown quantity as troublesome to the victor as to the vanquish the german circulation have lose all control under the force of internal need and germany be threaten with failure the other debtor -- austria-hungary turkey bulgarium -- have need of succor and can pay nothing austrium have need of the most indispensable object of existence and everything be lack 2 the indemnity which germany can pay annually in she present condition can not calculate goods and cash payment altogether represent more than two or three milliard at the most 3 the victorious country such as france have win immense territory and great benefit yet they have not be able to pay the war debt contract abroad and not even the interest france and italy be country of good faith have demonstrate that if they can not pay it be absurd to demand the payment of much higher sum from country like germany which have lose almost all she best resource : mercantile fleet colony and foreign organization etc 4 the danger exist that with the aggravation of the situation in the vanquished country and the weakening of the economic structure of europe the vanquished country will drag the victor down with they to ruin while the anglo-saxon people stand apart from continental europe will detach themselves more and more from its policy 5 the situation which have come about be a reason for everyone to be anxious and threaten both the downfall of the vanquish and the almost inevitable ruin of the victor unless a way be find of reconstruct the moral unity of europe and the solidarity of economic life vi europe 's post-war reconstruction and peace policy no right-thinking person have nowadays any doubt as to the profound injustice of the treaty of versaille and of all the treaty which derive from it but this fact be of small importance inasmuch as it be not justice or injustice which regulate the relation between nation but they interest and sentiment in the past we have see christian people transplant in america maintain the necessity of slavery and we have see and continue to see every day method of reasoning which when use by the defeat enemy be declare to be fallacious and wrong become in turn when vary only in form the idea and the customary life of the conqueror in the war -- idea which then assume the quality of liberal expression of democracy if appeal to the noblest human sentiment be not make in vain -lrb- and no effort of goodness or generosity be ever sterile -rrb- the conviction which be gradually form itself even in the least receptive mind that the treaty of peace be inapplicable as harmful to the conqueror as to the conquered gain in force for the treaty be at one and the same time a menace for the conqueror and a paralysis of all activity on the part of the conquer since once the economic unity of continental europe be break the resultant depression become inevitable if many error have be commit many error be inevitable what we must try to do now be to limit the consequence of these mistake in a change spirit to reconstruct where we see only ruin be the most evident necessity we must also try to diffuse among the nation which have win the war together and suffer together the least amount of diffidence possible as it be the united state great britain france italy japan all go they own way france have obtain she maximum of concession include those of least use to she but never before have the world see she so alone in she attitude as after the treaty of pari what be most urgently require at the moment be to change the prevalent war-mentality which still infect we and overcome all generous sentiment all hope of unity the statement that war make man better or worse be perhaps a exaggerated one war which create a state of exaltation hypertrophy all the quality all the tendency be they for good or for evil ascetic soul spirit naturally noble be dispose toward sacrifice develop a state of exaltation and true fervor how many example of nobility of abnegation of voluntary martyrdom have not the war give we but in person dispose to evil action in rude and violent spirit -lrb- and these be always in the majority -rrb- the spirit of violence increase this spirit which among the intellectual take the form of arrogance and concupiscence and in politics express itself in a policy of conquest assume in the crowd the most violent form of class war continuous assault upon the power of the state and a unbalanced desire to gain as much as possible with the least possible work before the war the number of man ready to take the law into they own hand be relatively small now there be many such individual the various nation even those most advanced can not boast a moral progress comparable with they intellectual development the explosion of sentiment of violence have create in the period after the war in most country a atmosphere which one may call unbreathable people accustom to be dominate and to serve have come to believe that have become dominator in they turn they have the right to use every kind of violence against they overlord of yesterday be not the injustice of the pole against the german and those of the rumanian against the magyar a proof of this state of mind even in the most civilized country many rule of order and discipline have go by the board after all the great war a condition of torpor of unwillingness to work together with a certain rudeness in social relation have always be notice the war of 1870 be a little war in comparison with the cataclysm let loose by the european war yet then the conquer country have its attempt at bolshevism which in those day be call the commune and the fall of its political regime in the conquer country we witness together with the rapid development of industrial group a quick growth in socialism and the constitution of great party like the catholic center _ mutati mutandi _ the same situation have show itself after the european war what be most urgently necessary therefore be to effect a return to peace sentiment and in the manifestation of government to abandon those attitude which in the peace of pari have they root in hate i have try as premier of italy as writer and as politician to regulate my action by this principle in the first month of 1920 i give instruction to italy 's ambassador in vienna the marquis della torretta to arrange a meeting between himself and chancellor renner head of the government of vienna so the chief of the conquer country come together with he minister to greet the head of the conquer country and there be no word that could record in any way the past hatred and the ancient rancor all the conversation be of the necessity for reconstruction and for the development of fresh current of life and commercial activity the government of italy help the government of austrium in so far as be possible and in so act i feel i be work better for the greatness of my country than i could possibly have do by any kind of stolid persecution i feel that over and beyond we competition there exist the human sorrow of nation for whom we must avoid fresh shed of blood and fresh war have i not leave the government it be my intention not only to continue in this path but also to intensify my effort in this direction the banal idea that there exist in europe two group of nation one of which stand for violence and barbarism -- the german the magyar and the bulgarian -- while the other group of anglo-saxon and latin represent civilization must not continue to be repeat because not only be it a outrage on truth but a outrage on honesty always to repeat that the german be not adapt for a democratic regime be neither just nor true nor be it true that germany be a essentially warlike country and therefore different from all other land in the last three century france and england have fight many more war than germany one must read the book of the napoleonic period to see with what disdain pacificist germany be refer to -- that country of peasant waiter and philosopher it be sufficient to read the work of german writer include treitschke himself to perceive for what a long period of time the german land anxious for peace have consider france as the country always eager for war and conquest not only be i of the opinion that germany be a land suit for democratic institution but i believe that after the fall of the empire democratic principle have a wider prevalence there than in any other country of europe the resistance offer to the peace of versaille -- that be to disorganization -- may be claim as a merit for the democratic party which if they be loyally assist by the state of the entente can not only develop themselves but establish a great and noble democracy germany have accustom we in history to the most remarkable surprise a century and a half ago she be consider as a pacificist nation without national spirit she have since then become a warlike country with the most pronounced national spirit early in the seventeenth century there be in germany more than one hundred territory and independent state there be no true national conscience and not even the violence of the napoleonic war a century after suffice to awaken it what be require be a regular effort of think a sustained program of action on the part of man like wolff fichte and hegel to mould a national conscience fifty year earlier no one would have believe in the possibility of a germany unite and compact in she national sentiment germany pass from the widest decentralization to the greatest concentration and the intensest national life germany will also be a democratic country if the violence of she ancient enemy do not drive she into a state of exaltation which will tend to render mind and spirit favourable to a return to the old regime to arrive at peace we must first of all desire peace we must no longer carry on conversation by means of military mission but by means of ambassador and diplomatic representative 1 -- the league of nation and the participation of the vanquish a great step towards peace may be make by admit at once all ex-enemy state into the league of nation among the state of european civilization million of person be unrepresented in the league of nation : the united state who have not wish to adhere to it after the treaty of versaille sanction violence russium who have not be able to join owe to she difficult position germany hungary austrium and bulgarium who have not be permit to join the turk etc the league of nation be a magnificent conception in which i have have faith and which i have regard with sympathy but a formidable mistake have deprive it of all prestige clause 5 and 10 of its originate constitution and the exclusion of the defeat have give it at once the character of a kind of holy alliance of the conqueror establish to regulate the incredible relation which the treaty have create between conqueror and conquer wilson have already commit the mistake of found the league of nation without first define the nation and leave to chance the resource of the beaten people and they population the day however on which all the people be represent in the league the united state without approve the treaty of versaille st germain or trianon etc will feel the need of abandon they isolation which be harmful for they and place they in a position of inferiority and the day when all the people of the world be represent and accept reciprocal pledge of international solidarity a great step will have be take as thing stand the organism of the reparation commission establish by schedule 2 of part viii of the treaty of versaille be a absurd union of the conqueror -lrb- no longer ally but reunite solely in a kind of bankruptcy procedure -rrb- who interpret the treaty in they own fashion and can even modify the law and regulation in the conquer country the existence of such a institution among civilized people ought to be a impossibility its power must be transfer to the league of nation in such a manner as to provide guarantee for the victor but guarantee also for the conquer the suppression of the reparation commission become therefore a fundamental necessity 2 -- the revision of the treaty when the public and especially in the united state and great britain become convinced that the spirit of peace can only prevail by means of a honest revision of the treaty the difficulty will be easily eliminate but one can not merely speak of a simple revision it would be a cure worse than the evil during the tempest one can not abandon the storm-beaten ship and cross over to a safer vessel it be necessary to return into harbor and make the transhipment where calm or relative calm at any rate reign inasmuch as europe be out of equilibrium a settlement even of a bad kind can not be arrive at off-hand to cast down the present political scaffolding without have build anything would be a error perhaps here the method that will prove most efficacious be to entrust the league of nation with the task of arrive at a revision when the league of nation be charge with this work the various government will send they best politician and the discussion will be able to assume a realizable character accord to its constitution the league of nation may in case of war or the menace of war -lrb- clause 11 -rrb- convoke its member and take all the measure require to safeguard the peace of the nation all the adhering state have recognize they obligation to submit all controversy to arbitration and that in any case they have no right to resort to war before the expiration of a term of three month after the verdict of the arbiter or the report of the council -lrb- clause 12 -rrb- any member of the league of nation resort to war contrary to the undertaking of the treaty which constitute the league be _ ipso facto _ consider as if he have commit a act of war against all the other member of the league -lrb- clause 19 -rrb- but more important still be the fact that the assembly of the league of nation may invite its member to proceed to a fresh examination of treaty that become inapplicable as well as of international situation whose prolongation might imperil the peace of the world -lrb- clause 19 -rrb- we may therefore revise the present treaty without violence and without destroy they what require to be modify there be no necessity to say inasmuch as all the matter of this book supply the evidence and the proof what be certain be that in europe and america except for a intransigent movement run strong in france everyone be convince of the necessity of revision it will be well that this revision should take place through the operation of the league of nation after the representative of all the state conqueror conquer and neutral have come to form part of it but in the constitution of the league of nation there be two clause which form its fundamental weakness section desire by france whose gravity escape wilson clause 5 declare that save and except contrary disposition the decision of the assembly or of the council be to be by the unanimous consent of the member represent at the meeting it be difficult to imagine anything more absurd if the modification of a territorial situation be be discuss all the nation must agree as to the solution include the interested nation the league of nation be convince that the danzig corridor be a absurdity but if france be not of the same opinion no modification can be make without a change of this clause every honest attempt at revision must necessarily break down clause 10 by which the member of the league of nation pledge themselves to respect and preserve from external attack the territorial integrity and the exist political independence of all the member of the league must also be alter this clause which be profoundly immoral consecrate and perpetuate the mistake and fault of the treaty no honest country can guarantee the territorial integrity of the state now exist after the monstrous parcelling out of entire group of german and magyar to other nation arrange without scruple and without intelligence no one can honestly guarantee the territorial integrity of poland as it stand at present if a new-risen russium a renew germany and a unextinguished austrium desire in the future a revision of the treaty they will be make a most reasonable demand to which no civilized country may make objection it be indeed clause 5 and 10 which have deprive the constitution of the league of nation of all moral credit which have transform it into a instrument of oppression for the victor which have cause the just and profound disapproval of the most enlighten man of the american senate a league of nation with clause 5 and 10 and the prolonged exclusion of the vanquish can not but accentuate the diffidence of all the democracy and the aversion of the mass but the league of nation can be alter and can become indeed a great force for renovation if the problem of its function be clearly confront and promptly resolve the league of nation can become a great guarantee for peace on three condition : -lrb- a -rrb- that it include really and in the shortest space of time possible all the people conqueror conquer and neutral -lrb- b -rrb- that clause 5 and 10 be modify and that after they modification a revision of the treaty be undertake -lrb- c -rrb- that the reparation commission be abolish and its power be confer upon the league of nation itself as it exist at present the league of nation have neither prestige nor dignity it be a expression of the violence of the conquer group of nation but reconstitute and renovate it may become the greatest of peace factor in the relation between the people 3 -- the safety of france and the military guarantee in the state of mind in which france exist at present there be a reasonable cause of worry for the future since the conclusion of the war the united state of america have withdraw they concern themselves with europe no more or only in a very limited form and with diffidence the monroe doctrine have come into its own again great britain watch the decadence of the european continent but girt by the sea have nothing to fear she be a country of europe but she do not live the life of europe she stand apart from it italy when she have overcome the difficulty of she economic situation can be certain of she future the very fact that she stand in direct opposition to no state that she may have competition with various people but not long-nurtured hatred give italy a relative security but france who have be in less than forty-four year twice at war with germany have little security for she future germany and the germanic race increase rapidly in number france do not increase france notwithstanding the new territory after she war loss have probably no more inhabitant than in 1914 in she almost tormented anxiety to destroy germany we see she dread for the future -- more indeed than mere hatred to occupy with numerous troops the left bank of the rhine and the bridgehead be a act of vengeance but in the vengeance there be also anxiety there be many in france who think that neither now nor after fifteen year must the territory of the vanquish be abandon and so france maintain in effective force too large a army and nourish too great a rancor and for this reason she help the pole in they unjustifiable attempt in upper silesium will not allow the german of austrium to live and seek to provoke and facilitate all movement and political action which can tend towards the dismemberment of germany the british and the italian viewpoint be essentially different france which know it can no longer count on the co-operation of great britain of the united state or of italy keep on foot she numerous army have ally herself with belgium and poland and try to suffocate germany in a ring of iron the attempt be a vain one and destine to fail within a few year inasmuch as france 's ally have no capacity for resistance yet all the same she attempt derive from a feeling that be not only justifiable but just france have obtain at pari apart from the occupation of the left bank of the rhine and all the military control two guarantee treaty from the united state and from great britain : in case of unprovoked aggression on the part of germany great britain and the united state pledge themselves to defend france the british parliament as we have see approve the treaty provisionally on the similar approbation of the united state but as the latter have not approve the treaty of versaille and have not even discuss the guarantee treaty france have now no guarantee treaty if we be anxious to realize a peace politic two thing be necessary : 1 that france have security and that for twenty year at least great britain and italy pledge themselves to defend she in case of aggression 2 that the measure for the disarmament of the conquered state be maintain maybe with some tempering of they condition and that they execution and control be entrust with the amplest power to the league of nation no one can think it unjust that the party who provoke the war or those who have if not the entire at least the greatest share of responsibility should be render for a certain time incapable the fall of the military caste in germany and the formation of a democratic society will derive much help from the abolition for a not too brief period of time of the permanent army and this will render possible at no distant date a effective reduction of the armament in the victorious country great britain have the moral duty to proffer a guarantee already spontaneously give italy also must give such a guarantee if she wish truly to contribute towards the peace of europe as long as germany have no fleet and can not put together a artillery and a aviation corps she can not present a menace great britain and italy can however only give they guarantee on the condition that they guarantee a proper state of thing and not a continued condition of violence the withdrawal of all the troops from the rhine ought to coincide with a clear definition concern the fate of the german of austrium and the german detach from germany without motive such a retirement must coincide with the definition of the territory of the saar and the assign pure and simple of upper silesium to germany and the end of all the insupportable control and the indemnity regulation be myself contrary to any pledge binding italy for too long a period i be of opinion that it be perfectly right that great britain and italy should make this sacrifice for the peace of europe but no guarantee be possible either for great britain or italy until the most essential problem be resolve in the justest manner by means of straightforward and explicit understanding italy 's tendency towards british policy on the continent of europe depend on the fact that great britain have never wish or tolerate that any continental state should have a hegemony over other and therefore she have find herself at different epoch range against france germany and russium england be in the mediterranean solely to secure she passage through it not to dominate it she continue to follow the grand policy by which she have transform she colony into dominion and in spite of error she have always show the greatest respect for the liberty of other people but europe will not have peace until the three progressive country of the continent germany france and italy find a way of agreement which can reunite all they energy in one common force russium have conceive the idea of have the hegemony of europe germany have indeed have the illusion of such a hegemony now this illusion penetrate certain french element can a people of forty million inhabitant who be not increase who already find difficulty in dominate and control they immense colony aspire to hegemonic action even take count of they great political prestige can france lastingly dominate and menace a country like germany which at no distant date will have a population double that of france the future of european civilization require that germany france and italy after so much disaster find a common road to travel the first step to be take be to give security of existence and of reconstruction to germany the second be to guarantee france from the peril of a not distant future the third be to find at all cost a means of accord between germany france and italy but only vast popular movement and great current of thought and of life can work effectively in those case where the labor of politician have reveal themselves as characterize by uncertainty and as be too traditional europe be still under the dominion of old soul which often enough dwell in young body and therefore unite old error with violence a great movement can only come from the intellectual of the country most menaced and from fresh popular energy 4 -- regulate inter-allied debt germany 's indemnity and that of the defeat country these two problem be closely connect the victorious country demand a indemnity from the conquer country which except germany who have a great productive force even in she hour of difficulty be in extreme depression and misery great britain be in debt to the united state and france italy and minor nation be in they turn heavy debtor to the american and to great britain the experience of the last three year have show that even with the best will none of the country owe money to the entente have be able to pay its debt or even the interest with a effort great britain could pay france and italy will never be able to and have moreover exchange which constitute a real menace for the future of each the fact that france and italy although they come out of the war victoriously have not be able to pay they debt or even the interest on they be the proof that germany whose best resource have be take away from she can only pay a indemnity very different from the fantastic figure put forward at the time of the conference of pari when even important political man speak of monstrous and ridiculous indemnity the problem of the inter-allied debt as well as that of the indemnity will be solve by a certain sacrifice on the part of all who participate in the war the credit of the united state amount to almost 48 milliard of lira or franc at par and the credit of great britain to 44 milliard great britain owe about 21 milliard to the united state and be in turn creditor for some 44 milliard she have a bad debt owe from russium for more than 14 milliard but 13 milliard be owe from france about 12 milliard from italy and almost 2-1\/2 milliard from belgium that be to say that great britain could well pay she debt to the united state cede the greater part of she credit towards france and italy but the truth be that while on the subject of the german indemnity stolid illusion continue to be propagate -lrb- perhaps now with greater discretion -rrb- neither france nor italy be in a position to pay its debt the most honest solution which intelligently enough jm keyne have see from the first be that each of the inter-allied country should renounce its state credit towards country that be ally or associate during the war the united state of america be creditor only great britain have lend the double of what she have borrow france have receive on loan the triple of what she have lend to other the credit of france be for almost two-third undemandable credit of great britain more than 14 milliard be with russium they be for considerably more than one-third bad debt france and italy would be benefit chiefly by this provision great britain would scarcely either benefit or lose or rather the benefit accrue to she would be less in so much as she chief credit be to russia the united state would doubtless have to bear the largest burden but when one think of the small sacrifice which the united state have make in comparison with the effort of france and italy -lrb- and italy be not oblige to enter the war -rrb- the new sacrifice demand do not seem excessive during the war the united state of america who for three year furnished food provision and arm to the country of the entente have absorb the greater part of they available resource not only be the state of europe debtor but so be especially the private citizen who have contract debt during or after the war great britain during the war have to sell at least 25 milliard of she foreign value the united state of america on the contrary have immensely increase they reserve but this very increase be harmful to they inasmuch as the capacity for exchange of the state of europe have be much reduce the united state now risk see still further reduce if not destroy this purchasing capacity of they best client and this finally constitute for the usa infinitely greater damage than the renounce of all they credit to reconstruct germany to intensify exchange of goods with the old country of austria-hungary and russium to settle the situation of the exchange of goods with italy and the balkan country be much more important for the united state and the prosperity of its people than to demand payment or not demand payment of those debt make for the common cause i will speak of the absurd situation which have come about czeko-slovakium and poland unwillingly indeed fight against the entente which have raise they to free and autonomous state and not only have they no debt to pay be now in the position of conqueror or at least ally of the conqueror but they have in fact scarcely any foreign debt the existence of enormous war debt be then everywhere a menace to financial stability no one be anxious to repudiate he debt in order not to suffer in loss of dignity but almost all know that they can not pay the end of the war as keyne have justly write have bring about that all owe immense sum of money to one another the holder of loan stock in every country be creditor for vast sum towards the state and the state in its turn be creditor for enormous sum towards the taxpayer the whole situation be highly artificial and irritating we shall be unable to move unless we succeed in free ourselves from this chain of paper the work of reconstruction can begin by annul the inter-allied debt if it be not think desirable to proceed at once to annulment there remain only the solution of include they in the indemnity which germany must pay in the measure of 20 per cent allocate a certain proportion to each country which have make loan to ally and associate government on account of the war in round figure the inter-allied loan come to 100 milliard they can be reduce to 20 and then each creditor can renounce he respective credit towards ally or associate and participate proportionately in the new credit towards germany such a credit bearing no interest could only be demand after the payment of all the other indemnity and would be consider in the complete total of the indemnity all the illusion concern the indemnity be now fate to disappear they have already vanish for the other country they be about to vanish in the case of germany nevertheless it be right that germany should pay a indemnity yet if the conqueror can not meet they foreign debt how can the vanquish clear the vast indemnity ask each pass day demonstrate more clearly the misunderstanding of the indemnity the non-expert have not learn financial technic but common sense tell they that the golden nimbus which have be trail before they eye be only a thick cloud of smoke that be slowly dissipate i have already say that the real damages to repair do not exceed 40 milliard of gold mark and that all the other figure be pure exaggeration if it be agree that germany accept 20 per cent of the inter-allied debt the indemnity may be raise to 60 milliard of franc at par to be pay in gold mark but we must calculate for germany 's benefit all that she have already give in immediate marketable wealth apart from she colony germany have give up all she mercantile marine fleet she submarine cable much railway material and war material government property in cede territory without any diminution of the amount of public debt etc without take account then of the colony and she magnificent commercial organization abroad germany have part with at least 20 milliard if we be to calculate what germany have cede with the same criterion with which the conquer country have calculate they loss we should arrive at figure much surpass these we may agree in tax germany with a indemnity equivalent in gold mark to 60 milliard of franc at par -- a indemnity to be pay in the follow manner : -lrb- a -rrb- twenty milliard of franc to be consider as already pay in consideration of all that germany have cede in consequence of the treaty -lrb- b -rrb- twenty milliard from the indemnity which germany must pay to she conqueror especially in coal and other material accord to the proportion already establish -lrb- c -rrb- twenty milliard -- after the payment of the debt in the second category to be take over by germany -- as part of the reimbursement for country which have make credit to the belligerent of the entente : that be the united state great britain and france in proportion to the sum lend in what material can germany pay 20 milliard in a few year especially in coal and in material for repair the devastate territory of france germany must pledge herself for ten year to consign to france a quantity of coal at least equal in bulk to the difference between the annual production before the war in the mine of the north and in the pas de calais and the production of the mine in the same area during the next ten year she must also furnish italy -- who after the heavy loss sustain have not the possibility of effect exchange -- a quantity of coal that will represent three-quarter of the figure settle upon in the treaty of versaille we can compel germany to give to the ally for ten year in extinction of they credit at least 500 million a year in gold with privilege on the custom receipt this systematization which can only be impose by the free agreement of the united state and great britain would have the effect of create excellent relation the united state cancel they in great part impossible debt would derive the advantage of develop they trade and industry and thus be able to guarantee credit for private individual in europe it would also be of advantage to great britain who would lose nothing great britain have about a equal number of debit and credit with this difference that the debit be secure while the credit be in part unsecured france 's credit be proportionately the worst and she debit largest almost 27 milliard france liberate from she debt and in a position to calculate on a coal situation comparable with that of before the war and with she new territory would be in a position to re-establish herself the cancellation of 27 milliard of debt a proportionate share in 20 milliard together with all that she have have represent on the whole a sum that perhaps exceed 50 milliard italy would have the advantage of possess for ten year the minimum of coal necessary to she existence and would be liberate from she foreign debt which amount to much more than she can possibly hope for from the indemnity such a arrangement or one like it be the only way calculate to allow europe to set out again on the path of civilization and to re-establish slowly that economic equilibrium which the war have destroy with enormous damage for the conqueror and the certain ruin of the vanquish but before speaking of any indemnity the reparation commission must be abolish and its function hand over to the league of nation while all the useless control and other hateful vexation must be put a end to while the ally troops ' occupation of the rhine cost germany 25 milliard of paper mark a year it be foolish to speak of reconstruction or indemnity either all occupation must cease or the expense ought not to exceed accord to the foregoing agreement a maximum of 80 million at par or even less we shall however never arrive at such a arrangement until the continental country become convinced of two thing : first that the united state will grant no credit under any formulum secondly that germany under the present system will be unable to pay anything and will collapse drag down to ruin she conqueror among many uncertainty these two conviction become ever clearer if in all country the spirit of insubordination among the work class be increase the state of mind of the german operative be quite remarkable the workman almost everywhere in face of the enormous fortune which the war have create and by reason of the spirit of violence work in they have work with bad spirit after the war because they have think that a portion of they labor have go to form the profit of the industrial it be useless to say that we be deal here with a absurd and dangerous conception because the profit of the capitalist be a necessary element of production and because production along communist line wherever it have be attempt have bring ruin and misery but it be useless to deny that such a situation exist together with the state of mind which it imply we can well imagine then the condition in which germany and the vanquished country find themselves the workman who in france england and italy exhibit in various degree and measure a state of intractability in germany have to face a situation still graver when they work they know that a portion of they labor be destine to go to the victor another part to the capitalist and finally there will remain something for they add to this that in all the beaten country hunger be widespread with a consequent diminution of energy and work no reasonable person can explain how humanity can continue to believe in the perpetuation of a similar state of thing for another forty year in speaking of the indemnity which germany can pay it be necessary to consider this special state of mind of the operative and other category of producer but the mere announcement of the settling of the indemnity of the immediate admission of the vanquished nation into the league of nation of the settle the question of the occupation of the rhine and of the firm intention to modify the constitution of the league of nation accord it the power now hold by the reparation commission will improve at once the market and signalize a definite and assure revival the united state make a great financial effort to assist they associate and in they own interest as well as for those of europe they would have do badly to have continue with such assistance when the mean provide by america come to be employ to keep go the anarchy of central europe rumanium 's disorder greece 's adventure and poland 's violence together with denikin 's and wrangel 's restoration attempt it be better that all help should cease in fact europe have begin to reason a little better than she government since the financial difficulty have increase the fall of the mark and germany 's profound economic depression have already destroy a great part of the illusion on the subject of the indemnity and the figure with which for three year the public have be humbug no longer convince anyone 5 -- form new connexion with russium among the state of the entente there be always a fundamental discord on the subject of russium great britain recognize at once that if it be impossible to acknowledge the soviet government it be a mistake to encourage attempt at restoration after the first moment of uncertainty great britain have insist on temperate measure and notwithstanding that during the war she make the largest loan to the russian government -lrb- more than 14 milliard of franc at par while france only lend about 4 milliard -rrb- she have never put forward the idea that as a condition precedent to the recognition of the soviet government a guarantee of the repayment of the debt be necessary only france have have this mistaken idea which she have force to the point of ask for the sequestration of all gold send abroad by the soviet government for the purchase of goods wilson have already state in he fourteen point what the attitude of the entente towards russium ought to be but the attitude actually assume have be of quite a different order the barrier which poland want to construct between germany and russium be a absurdity which must be sweep away at once have take away germany 's colony and she capacity for expansion abroad we must now direct she towards russium where alone she can find the outlet necessary for she enormous population and the debt she have to carry the blockade of russium the barb wire place round russium have damage europe severely this blockade have resolve itself into a blockade against the ally before the present state of economic ruin russium be the great reservoir of raw material she be the unexplored treasure towards which one go with the confidence of find everything now owe to she effort she have fall but how large a part of she fall be as much due to the entente as to she action during the war and since for some time now even the most hidebound intelligence have recognize the fact that it be useless to talk of enter into trade relation with russium without the co-operation of germany the obvious ally in the vast task of renovation similarly it be useless to talk of reattempt military maneuver while germany remain disassociate from the work of reconstruction and feel herself menace by a poland that be anarchical and disorderly and act as a agent of the entente while germany have no security for she future and must work with doubt and with rancor all attempt to reconstruct russium will be vain the simple and fundamental truth be just this : one can only get to moscow by pass through berlin if we do not wish conqueror and conquer to fall one after the other and a common fate to reunite those who for too long have hate each other and continue to hate each other a solemn word of peace must be pronounced austrium germany italy france be not diverse phenomenon they be different phase of the same phenomenon all europe will go to piece if new condition of life be not find and the economic equilibrium profoundly shake by the war re-establish i have seek in this book to point out in all sincerity the thing that be in store for europe what peril menace she and in what way she regeneration lie in my political career i have find many bitterness but the campaign wage against I have not disturbed I at all i know that wisdom and life be indivisible and i have no need to modify anything of what i have do neither in my propaganda nor in my attempt at human regeneration convince as i be that i be serve both the cause of my country and the cause of civilization blame and praise do not disturb I and the agitation promote in the heart of my country will not modify in any way my conviction on the contrary they will only reinforce my will to follow in my own way truth be it only slowly make its way though now the cloud be blackest they will shortly disappear the crisis which menace and disturb europe so profoundly have inoculate with alarm the most excited spirit europe be still in
