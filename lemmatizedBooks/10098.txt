only to that era which see the birth of christianity all that occur in the fighting on the gaza-beersheba line be part and parcel of the taking of jerusalem the free of which from four century of turkish domination be the object of the first part of the campaign the holy city be the goal seek by every officer and man in the army and though from the moment that goal have be attain all energy be concentrate upon drive the turk out of the war there be not a member of the force from the highest on the staff to the humblest private in the rank who do not feel that jerusalem be the greatest prize of the campaign in a second volume i shall tell of that tremendous feat of arm which overwhelm the turkish army drive they through 400 mile of country in six week and give cavalry a opportunity of prove that despite all the art and device of modern warfare with fighter and observer in the air and a entirely new mechanism of war they continue as indispensable a part of a army as when the legion of old take the field this be too long a story to be tell in this volume though the detail of that magnificent triumph be so firmly impressed on the mind that one be loth to leave the narration of

at bethlehem a hairpin bend on the jerusalem road chapter i palestine 's influence on the war in a war which involve the people of the four quarter of the globe it be to be expect that on the world 's oldest battleground would be renew the scene of conflict of bygone age there be perhaps a desire of some element of both side certainly it be the unanimous wish of the ally to avoid the clash of arm in palestine and to leave untouched by army a land hold in reverence by three of the great religion of the world but this ancient cockpit of war race could not escape the will of those who break the peace prevail germany 's dream of eastern empire and world domination the lust of conquest of the kaiser party require that the tide of war should once more surge across the land and if the conquer host leave fewer trace of war wreckage than be to be expect in they victorious march it be due not to any anxiety of we foe to avoid conflict about and damage to place with hallowed association but to the masterly strategy of the british commander-in-chief who manoeuvre the turkish army out of position defend the sacred site the people of to-day who have live through the war who have have they view bewilder by ever-recurring anxiety by hope shatter and fear realize by a succession of victory and defeat on a colossal scale and by a sudden collapse of the enemy may fail to see the palestine campaign in true perspective but in a future generation the calm judgment of the historian in review the greatest of all war will if i mistake not pay a great tribute to general allenby 's strategy not only as mark the commencement of the enemy 's downfall but as preserve from the scourge of war those holy place which symbolise the example by which most people rule they life briton who value the good name of they country will appreciate what this mean to those who shall come after we -- that the record of a great campaign carry out exclusively by british imperial troops be unsullied by a single act to disturb the sacred monument and leave the land in the full possession of those rich treasure which stand for the principle that guide we action and which if posterity observe they will make a better and happier world a few month after the turk enter the war it be obvious that unaided they could never realize the kaiser 's hope of cut the suez canal communication of the british empire the german commitment in europe be too overwhelming to permit of they render the turk adequate support for a renew effort against egypt after the failure of the attack on the canal in February 1915 there be a attempt by the turk in August 1916 but it be crush by anzac horse and british infantry at romanus -lrb- 1 -rrb- a score of mile from port say and thereafter the turk in this theater be on the defensive some declare the dardanelle enterprise to have be a mistake other believe that have we not threaten the turk there egypt would have have to share with we the anxiety that war bring alike upon attacker and defender gallipolus and mesopotamium however we regard those expedition in the first year of the struggle undoubtedly prevent the turk employ a large army against egypt and the possibility result from a defeat there be so full of danger to we not merely in that half-way house of the empire but in indium and the east generally that if gallipolus serve to avert the disaster that ill-starred expedition be worth undertaking we have to drive the turk out of the sinaus peninsula -- egyptian territory -- and that accomplish a attack on the turk through palestine be imperative since the russian collapse release a large body of turkish troops from the caucasus who would otherwise be employ in mesopotamium -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the desert campaign _ : london constable and co ltd -rrb- when general allenby take over the command of the egyptian expeditionary force the british public as a whole do not fully realize the importance of the palestine campaign most of they regard it as a ` side show ' and look upon it as one of those minor field of operation which dissipate we strength at a time when it be imperative we should concentrate to resist the german effort on the western front they do not know the fact in we far-flung empire it be essential that we should maintain we prestige among the race we govern some of they martial people who might remain faithful to the british flag only so long as we could impress they with we power to win the war they be more influence by a triumph in mesopotamium which be nearer they door than by a victory in france and the occupation of bagdad be a victory of greater import to the king 's indian subject than the german retirement from the hindenburg line if there ever be a fear of serious trouble in indium the advance of general maude in mesopotamium dispel it and make it easier not only to release a portion of we white garrison in indium for active service elsewhere but to recruit a large force of indian for the empire 's work in other clime bagdad be a tremendous blow to german ambition the loss of it spell ruin to those hope of eastern conquest which have prompt the german intrigue in turkey and it be certain that the kaiser so long as he believe in ultimate victory would refuse to accept the loss of bagdad as final russium 's withdrawal as a belligerent release a large body of turkish troops in the caucasus and set free many german particularly ` technical troops ' of which the turk stand in need for other front it be then that the german high command conceive a scheme for retake bagdad and the redoubtable von falkenhayn be send to constantinople charge with the preparation for the undertake certain it be that it would have be put into execution but for the situation create by the presence of a large british army in the sinaus peninsula a large force be collect about aleppo for a march down the euphrate valley and the winter of 1917-18 would have witness a stern struggle for supremacy in mesopotamium if the war cabinet have not decide to force the turk to accept battle where they least want it the view of the british war cabinet on the war in the east at any rate be sound and solid they concentrate on one big campaign and profit from past mistake which lead to a wastage of strength allow all the weight they could spare to be throw into the egyptian expeditionary force under a general who have prove he high military capacity in france and in whom all rank have complete confidence and they permit the mesopotamian and salonika army to contain the enemy on they front while the army in palestine set out to crush the turk at what prove to be they most vital point as to whether the force available on we mesopotamium front be capable of defeat the german scheme i can not offer a opinion but it be beyond all question that the conduct of operation in palestine on a plan at once bold resolute and worthy of a high place in military history save the empire much anxiety over we position in the tigri and euphrate valley and probably prevent unrest on the frontier of indium and in indium itself where mischief maker be actively work in the german cause nor can there be any doubt that the brilliant campaign in palestine prevent british and french influence decline among the mahomedan population of those country ' respective sphere of control in africa indeed i regard it as incontrovertible that the palestine strategy of general allenby even apart from he stupendous rush through syrium in the autumn of the last year of war do as much to end the war in 1918 as the great battle on the western front for if there have be failure or check in palestine some british and french troops in france might have have to be detach to other front and the german ' effort in the spring might have push they line farther towards the channel and pari if bagdad be not actually save in palestine a expedition against it be certainly stop by we army operate on the old battleground in palestine we lose many life and it cost we a vast amount of money but the sacrifice of brave man contribute to the saving of the world from german domination and high as the british name stand in the east as the upholder of the freedom of people the fame of britain for justice fair dealing and honesty be wider and more firmly establish to-day because the people have see it emerge triumphantly from a supreme test in the strategy of the world war we make no doubt many mistake but in palestine the strategy be of the best and in the work out of a far-seeing scheme victory so influence event that on this front begin the final phase of the war -- once turkey be beat bulgarium and austria-hungary submit and germany acknowledge the inevitable falkenhayn see that the bagdad undertaking be impossible so long as we be dangerous on the palestine front and general allenby 's attack on the gaza line wipe the bagdad enterprise out of the list of german ambition the plan of battle on the gaza-beersheba line resemble in miniature the ending of the war if we take beersheba for turkey sherium and hareira for bulgarium and austrium and gaza for germany we get the exact progress of event in the final stage except that bulgarium 's submission be a intelligent anticipation of the lay down of they arm by the turk gaza-beersheba be a roll up from we right to leave so be the ending of the hun alliance chapter ii old battleground it be in accordance with the fitness of thing that the british army should fight and conquer on the very spot consecrate by the memory of the most famous battle of old from gaza onward we make we progress by the most ancient road on earth for this way move commerce between the euphrate and the nile many century before the east know west we fight on field which have be the battleground of egyptian and assyrian army where hittite ethiopian persian parthian and mongol pour out they blood in time when kingdom be strong by the sword alone the ptolemy invade syrium by this way and here the greek put they colonise hand on the country alexander the great make this he route to egypt pompey march over the maritime plain and inaugurate that roman rule which last for century till islam make its wide irresistible sweep in the seventh century then the crusader fight and win and lose and napoleon 's ambition in the east be wreck just beyond the plain up the maritime plain we battle at gaza every yard of which have be contest by the army of mighty king in the past thirty-five century at akir gezer lydda and around joppa all down the age army have move in victory or flight over this plain and general allenby in he advance be but repeat history and when the turk have be drive beyond the plain of philistium and the commander-in-chief have to decide how to take jerusalem we see the british force move along precisely the same route that have be take by army since the time when joshua overcome the amorite and the day be lengthen by the sun and moon standing still till the battle be win geography have its influence on the strategy of to-day as completely as it do when army be not cumber with gun and mechanical transport of the few pass from the maritime plain over the shephelah into the judean range only that emerge from the green vale of ajalon be possible if we be to take jerusalem as the great captain of old take it from the north the syrian sometimes choose this road in preference to advance through samarium the roman suffer retreat on it richard coeur de lion make it the path for he approach towards the holy city and precisely as in joshua 's day and as when in the first century the roman fall victim to a tremendous jewish onslaught the fighting be hardest about the beth-horon but with a different result -- the invader be victorious the corps which actually take jerusalem advance up the new road from latron through kuryet el enab identify by some as kirjath-jearim where the philistine return the ark but that road would have be deny to we if we have not make good the ancient path from the vale of ajalon to gibeon jerusalem be win by the fighting at the beth-horon as surely as it be on the line of hill above the wadi surar which the londoner carry there be fight at gibeon at michma at beeroth at be and numerous other place make familiar to we by the old testament and assuredly no army go forth to battle on more hallowed soil of all the army which earn a place in history in palestine general allenby 's be the greatest -- the greatest in size in equipment in quality in fight power and not even the invade army in the romantic day of the crusade could equal it in chivalry it fight the strong fight with clean hand throughout and finish without a blemish on its conduct it be the best of all the conquer army see in the holy land as well as the greatest will not the influence of this army endure i think so there be a awakening in palestine not merely of christian and jew but of moslem too in a less degree during the last thirty year there have grow more sign of the deep faith of people and of they veneration of this land of sacred history if they institution and mission could develop and shed light over palestine even while the slothful and corrupt turk rule the land how much faster and more in keep with the sanctity of the country will the improvement be under british protection the grave of we soldier dot over desert waste and cornfield on barren hill and in fertile valley ay and on the mount of olive where the savior trod will mark a era more truly grand and inspiring and offer a far greater lesson to future generation than the crusade or any other invasion down the track of time the army of general allenby respond to the happy thought of the commander-in-chief and contribute one day 's pay for the erection of a memorial near jerusalem in honor of its heroic dead apart from the holy site no other memorial will be revere so much and future pilgrim to whatever faith they belong will look upon it as a monument to man who go to battle to bring lasting peace to a land from which the word of peace and goodwill go forth to mankind in select general sir edmund allenby as the palestine army 's chief the war cabinet make a happy choice general sir archibald murray be recall to take up a important command at home after the two unsuccessful attempt to drive the turk from the gaza defence the troops at general murray 's disposal be not strong enough to take the offensive again and it be clear there must be a long period of preparation for a attack on a large scale general allenby bring to the east a lengthy experience of fight on the western front where he deliberate method of attack notably at arras have give the ally victory over the cleverest and bravest of we enemy palestine be likely to be a cavalry as well as a infantry campaign or at any rate the theater of war in which the mount arm could be employ with the most fruitful of result general allenby 's achievement as a cavalry leader in the early day of the war mark he as the one officer of high rank suit for the palestine command and he proved capacity as a general both in open and in trench warfare give the army that high degree of confidence in its commander-in-chief which it be so necessary that a big fight force should possess a tremendously hard worker himself general allenby expect all under he to concentrate the whole of they energy on they work he have the faculty for get the best out of he officer and on he staff be some of the most enthusiastic soldier in the service there be no room for a inefficient leader in any branch of the force and the knowledge that the commander-in-chief value the life and the health of he man so highly that he would not risk a failure keep all the staff tune up to concert pitch we see many change and the best man come to the top he own vigor infect the whole command and within a short while of arrive at the front the efficiency of the army be considerably increase the palestine ghq be probably nearer the battle front than any ghq in other theater of operation and when the army have break through and chase the enemy beyond the jaffa-jerusalem line ghq be open at bir salem near ramleh and for several month be actually within reach of the long-range gun which the turk possess the rank and file be not slow to appreciate this they know they commander-in-chief be on the spot keep he eye and hand on everything organise with he organiser plan with he operation staff familiar with every detail of the complicated transport system watch he supply service with the keenness of a quartermaster-general and take that lively interest in the medical branch which betray a anxious desire for the welfare and health of the man the rank and file know something more than this they see the commander-in-chief at the front every day general allenby do not rely solely on report from he corps he go to each section of the line himself and before practically every major operation he see the ground and examine the scheme for attack there be not a part of the line he do not know and no one will contradict I when i say that the military road in palestine be know by no one better than the driver of the commander-in-chief 's car a man of few word general allenby always say what he mean with soldierly directness which make the thanks he give a rich reward a good piece of work bring a write or oral message of thanks and the man be satisfy they have do well to deserve congratulation they be proud to have the confidence of such a chief and to deserve it and they in they turn have such unbounded faith in the military judgment of the general and in the care he take to prevent unnecessary risk of life that there be nothing which he sanction that they would not attempt such mutual confidence breed strength and it be the commander-in-chief 's example he tact energy and military genius which make he army a potent power for britain and a strong pillar of the ally ' cause let it not be imagine that general allenby in he victorious campaign shone only as a great soldier he be also a great administrator in england little be know about this part of the general 's work and owe to the difficulty of the task and to the consideration which have and still have to be show to the susceptibility of a number of friendly nation and people it may be long before the full story of the administration of the occupied territory in palestine be unfold for general appreciation it be a good story worthy of britain 's record as a protector of people and though from the nature of he conquest over the turk in the bible country the name of general allenby will adorn the page of history principally as a victor it will also stand before the government of state as set a model for a wise prudent considerate even benevolent administration of occupied enemy territory in day when power drive mad by military ambition tear up treaty as scrap of paper general allenby observe the spirit as well as the letter of the hague convention and find it possible to apply to occupied territory the principle of administration as lay down in the manual of military law the native marvel at the change in place of insecurity extortion bribery and corruption levy on labor and property and all the evil of turkish government general allenby give the country behind the front line peace justice fair treatment of every race and creed and a firm and equitable administration of the law every man 's house become he castle tax be readily pay the tax gatherer be honest servant and none of the revenue go to keep fat pasha in luxury in constantinople there come a prospect of expenditure and revenue balancing after much money have be usefully spend on local government until the signing of peace international law provide that turkish law should apply these properly administer as they never be by the turk give a basis of good government and with the old abuse connect with the collection of revenue remove and certain increase taxation and custom due impose by the turk during the war discontinue the people resume the art of peace and enjoy a degree of prosperity none of they have ever anticipate what the future government of palestine may be be uncertain at the time of write there be talk of international control -- we seem ever ready to lose at the conference table what a valiant sword have gain for we -- but the careful and perfectly correct administration of general allenby will save we from the criticism of many jealous foreigner certainly it will bear examination by any impartial investigator but the best of all tribute that could be pay to it be that it satisfied religious community which do not live in perfect harmony with one another and the inhabitant of a country which shelter the people of many different race the yilderim undertaking as the bagdad scheme be describe do not meet with the full acceptance of the turk the ` mighty jemal ' as the german sneeringly call the commander of the syrian army oppose it as weaken he prospects and even enver the ambitious creature and tool of germany postpone he approval it would seem the take over of the command of the egyptian expeditionary force by general allenby set the turk think and make the german military mission in constantinople reconsider they plan not with a view to a complete abandonment of the proposal to advance on bagdad as would have be wise but in order to see how few of the yilderim troops they could allot to jemal 's army to make safe the sinaus front there be a all-important meeting of turkish general in the latter half of August and jemal stand to he gun von falkenhayn could not get he to abate one item of he demand and there can be no doubt that falkenhayn obsess though he be with the importance of get bagdad could see that jemal be right he admit that the yilderim operation be only practicable if it have freedom for retirement through the removal of the danger on the palestine front with that end in view he advocate that the british should be attack and suggest that two division and the ` asia corps ' should be send from aleppo to move round we right jemal be in favor of defensive action enver procrastinate and propose send one division to strengthen the ivth army on the gaza front and to proceed with the bagdad preparation the wait-and-see policy prevail but long before we exert we full strength bagdad be out of the danger zone general allenby 's force be so disposed that any suggestion of the yilderim operation be put into execution be rule out of consideration several document capture at yilderim headquarters at nazareth in September 1918 when general allenby make he big drive through syrium show very clearly how we palestine operation change the whole of the german plan and reading between the line one can realize how the impatience of the german be increase turkish stubbornness and create friction and ill-feel the german military character brook no opposition the turk like to postpone till to-morrow what should be do to-day the latter be cocksure after they two success at gaza they could hold we up the german believe that with a offensive against we they would hold we in check till the wet season arrive -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see appendix i ii and iii -rrb- down to the south the turk have to bring they division they line of communication be very bad there be a railway from aleppo through rayak to damascus and onward through deraa -lrb- on the hedjaz line -rrb- to afule messudieh tul keram ramleh junction station to beit hanun on the gaza sector and through et tineh to beersheba rolling stock be short and fuel be scarce and the enemy have short ration when we advance through syrium in the autumn of 1918 we transport be nobly serve by motor-lorry column which perform marvel in get up supplies over the worst of road but as we go ahead we have command of the sea land store all the way up the coast and unless the navy have lend its help hand we should never have get to aleppo before the turk cry ` enough ' every ounce of the turk ' supplies have to be haul over land they manage to put ten infantry division and one cavalry division against we in the first three week but they be not comparable in strength to we seven infantry division and three cavalry division in rifle strength we outnumber they by two to one but if the enemy have be well lead and properly ration he be on the defensive and have strong prepared position should have have the power to resist we more strongly the turkish division we attack be : 3rd 7th 16th 19th 20th 24th 26th 27th 53rd and 54th and the 3rd cavalry division the latter avoid battle but all the infantry division have heavy casualty that the moral of the turkish army be not high may be gather from a very illuminating letter write by general kress von kressenstein the goc of the sinaus front to yilderim headquarters on September 29 1917 -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see appendix iv -rrb- the troops who win palestine and make it happier than it have be for four century be exclusively soldier of the british empire there be a french detachment and a italian detachment with general allenby 's army the italian for a short period hold a small portion of the line in the gaza sector but do not advance with we force the french detachment be solely employ as garrison troops the french battleship _ requin _ and two french destroyer cooperate with the ship of the royal navy in the bombardment of the coast we army be truly representative of the empire and the unit compose it give a abide example that in unity rest we strength from over the seven sea the empire 's son come to illustrate the unanimity of all the king 's subject in the prosecution of the war english scottish irish and welsh division of good man and true fight side by side with soldier of vary indian race and caste australium 's valiant son constitute many brigade of horse and with new zealand mount regiment become the most hardened campaigner in the egyptian and palestine theater of operation they powerful support in the day of anxiety and trial as well as in the time of triumph will be remember with gratitude south africa contribute good gunner we dark-skinned brethren in the west indy furnished infantry who when the fierce summer heat make the air in the jordan valley like a draught from a furnace have a bayonet charge which arouse a anzac brigade to enthusiasm -lrb- and colonial free man can estimate bravery at its true value -rrb- from far-away hong kong and singapore come mountain gunner equal to any in the world krooman send from they home in west africa surf boatman to

communion of the representative of the mother and daughter nation on the stern field of war bring together people with the same ideal and if there be any minor jealousy between they the brotherhood of arm will make the soldier return to they home in all quarter of the globe the best of missionary to spread the imperial idea instead of wreck the british empire the german-made war should rebuild it on the soundest of foundation affection mutual trust and common interest chapter iii difficulty of the attack general allenby 's first problem be of vital consequence he have to pierce the gaza line before he arrival there have be as already state two attempt which fail a third failure or even a check might have spell disaster for we in the east the turk hold commanding position which they strengthen and fortify under the direction of german engineer until they country between the sea and beersheba become a chain of land work of high military value well adapt for defense and cover almost every line of approach the turk at the dardanelle have show no loss of that quality of doggedness in defense which characterise he in plevna and though we know he commander still cherish the hope of successfully attack we before we could attempt to crush he line it be on he system of defense that the enemy mainly rely to break the power of the british force on arrive in egypt general allenby be give a appreciation of the situation write by lieut-general sir philip chetwode who have command the desert column in various stage across the sand of sinaus be responsible for force the turk to evacuate el arish arrange the dash on magdaba by general sir harry chauvel 's mount troops and fight the brilliant little battle of rafa this appreciation of the position be the work of a master military mind take a broad comprehensive view of the whole military situation in the east palestine 's position in the world war the strategical and tactical problem to be face and without make any exorbitant demand for troops which would lessen the ally ' power in other theater set out the minimum necessity for the palestine force general allenby give the fullest consideration to this document and after he have make as complete a examination of the front as any commander-in-chief ever undertake -- the general be in one or other sector with he troops almost every day for four month -- general chetwode 's plan be adopt and full credit be give to he prescience in general allenby 's despatch cover the operation up to the fall of jerusalem it be general chetwode 's view at the time of write he appreciation that both the british and turkish army be strategically on the defensive the force be nearly equal in number though we be slightly superior in artillery but we have no advantage sufficient to enable we to attack a well-entrenched enemy who only offer we a flank on which we could not operate owe to lack of water and the extreme difficulty of supply general chetwode think it be possible the enemy might make a offensive against we -- we have since learn he have such design -- but he give weighty reason against the turk embarking upon a campaign conduct with a view to throw we beyond the egyptian frontier into the desert again if the enemy contemplate even minor operation in the sinaus desert he have not the means of undertake they we should be retire on position we have prepare for during he advance across the desert general chetwode have always take the precaution of have he force dig in against the unlikely event of a turkish attack every step we go back would make we supply easier and there be no water difficulty the pipe line then 130 mile long which carry the purify water of the nile to the amount of hundred of thousand of gallon daily be always available for we troops it would be necessary for the turk to repair the beersheba-auja railway they have lift some of the rail for use north of gaza and a raid we have carry out show that we could stop this railway be put into a state of preparedness for military traffic a attack which aim at again threaten the suez canal be therefore rule as outside the range of possibility on the other hand now that the russian collapse have relieve the turk of he anxiety in the caucasus and permit he to concentrate he attention on the mesopotamian and palestine front what hope have he of resist we attack when we should be in a position to launch it the enemy have a single narrow-gauge railway line connect with the jaffa-jerusalem railway at junction station about six mile south-east of ramleh this line run to beersheba and there be a spur line run past deir sineid to beit hanun from which the gaza position be supply there be a shortage of roll stock and there be no coal for the engine whole olive orchard have be hack down to provide fuel the hebron road which could keep beersheba supply if the railway be cut be in good order but in other part there be no road at all except several mile of badly metalled track from junction station to juli we could not keep many troops with such ill-conditioned communication but turkish soldier require far less supplies than european troops and the enemy have do such remarkable thing in surmount supply difficulty that he be give credit for be able to support between sixty and seventy battalion in the line and reserve with a artillery somewhat weaker than we own if we make another frontal attack at gaza we should find ourselves up against a desperately strong defensive system but even suppose we get through it we should come to another halt in a few mile as the enemy have select and in most case have prepare a number of position right up to the jaffa-jerusalem road where he would be in a land of comparative plenty with he supply and transport trouble very considerably reduce no one could doubt that the turk intend to defend jerusalem to the last not only because of the moral effect its capture would have on the people of the world but because its possession by we would threaten they enterprise in the hedjaz and the enormous amount of work we afterwards find they have do on the judean hill prove that they be determine to do all in they power to prevent we drive they from the holy city the enemy too imagine that we progress could not exceed the rate at which we standard gauge railway could be build water-borne supplies be limit as to quantity and during the winter the landing of supplies on a open beach be hazardous in the coastal belt there be no road and the wide fringe of sand which have accumulate for century and still encroach on the maritime plain can only be cross by camel well be few and yield but small volume of water with the transport allot to the force in the middle of 1917 it be not possible to maintain more than one infantry division at a distance of twenty to twenty-five mile beyond railhead and this could only be do by allot to they all the camel and wheel of other division and render these immobile this be insufficient to keep the enemy on the move after a tactical success and he would have ample time to reorganise general chetwode hold that careful preliminary arrangement suitable and elastic organization of transport the collection of material at railhead the training of platelay gang provide by the troops the utilisation of the earthwork of the enemy 's line for we own railway luck as regard the weather and the fullest use of sea transport should enable we to give the enemy less breathing time than appear possible on paper it be beyond hope however whatever preparation be make that we should be able to pursue at a speed approach that which the river make possible in mesopotamium general chetwode consider it would be fatal to attempt a offensive with force which might permit we to attack and occupy the enemy 's gaza line but which would be insufficient to inflict upon he a really severe blow and to follow up that blow with sufficient troops no less than seven infantry division at full strength and three cavalry division would be adequate for the purpose and they would be none too many further if the turk begin to press severely in mesopotamium or even to revive they campaign in the hedjaz a premature offensive might be necessitate on we part in palestine the suggestion make by general chetwode for general allenby 's consideration be that the enemy should be lead to believe we intend to attack he in front of gaza and that we should pin he down to he defence in the center while the real attack should begin on beersheba and continue at hareira and sherium and so force the enemy by maneuver to abandon gaza that plan general allenby adopt after see all the ground and the event of the last day of October and the first week of November support general chetwode 's prediction to the letter indeed it would be hard to find a parallel in history for such another complete and absolute justification of a plan draw up several month previously and it be doubtful if suppose the turk have succeed in do what they german adviser advocate namely forestall we blow by a vigorous attack on we position there would have be any material alteration in the work out of the scheme the staff work of general headquarters and of the staff of the three corps prove wholly sound each department give of its best and from the moment when beersheba be take in a day and we secure its water supply there be never a doubt that the enemy could be keep on the move until we get into the rough rocky hill about jerusalem and by that time as event prove he moral have have such a tremendous shake that he never again make the most of he many opportunity the soundness of the plan can quite easily be make apparent to the unmilitary eye yet the turk be absolutely deceive as to general allenby 's intention if it be concede that to deceive the enemy be one of the greatest accomplishment in the soldier 's art it must be admit that the battle of gaza show general allenby 's consummate generalship just as it be prove again and perhaps to a even greater extent in the wonderful day of September 1918 in northern palestine and syrium a glance at the map of the gaza-beersheba line and the country immediately behind it will show that if a successful attack be deliver against gaza the enemy could withdraw he whole line to a second and supporting position where we should have to begin afresh upon a almost similar operation the turk would still have he water and would be slightly nearer he supplies since the two unsuccessful attack in march and April gaza have be put into a powerful state of defense the house of the town be mostly on a ridge and enclose the place be a mass of garden fully a mile deep each surround by high cactus hedge afford complete cover and quite impossible for infantry to penetrate to reduce gaza would require a prolonged artillery bombardment with far more battery than general allenby could ever expect to have at he command and it be certain that not only would the line in front of the town have have to be take but also the whole of the western end of the turk ' trench system for a length of at least 12000 yard and as have be say with gaza secure we should still have have to face the enemy in a new line of position about the wadi hesus gaza be the turk ' strongest point to attack here would have mean a long-drawn-out artillery duel infantry would have have to advance over open ground under complete observation and while make a frontal attack would have be expose to enfilade fire from the ` tank ' system of work to the south-east it would have prove a costly operation its success could only have be partial in that it do not follow that we should break the enemy 's line and it would not have enable we to contain the remainder of the turkish force nor would a attack on the center have promise more favourably here the enemy have all the best of the ground at atawineh sausage ridge hareira and teiaha there be defence support each other on high ground overlook a almost flat plain through which the wadi ghuzze run all the observation be in enemy possession and to attack over this ground would have be invite disaster there be little fear that the turk would attack we across this wide range of no man 's land for we hold secure control of the curiously shaped heap of broken earth about shellal and the conical hill at fara give a uninterrupted view for several mile northward and eastward the position be very different about beersheba if we secure that place with its water supply and in this dry country the battle really amount to a fight for water we should be attack from high ground and against position which have not be prepare on so formidable a scale as elsewhere with the prospect of compelling the enemy to abandon the remainder of the line for fear of be envelop by mount troops move behind he weakened leave that in brief outline be the gist of general chetwode 's report and with its full acceptance begin the preparation for the advance these preparation take several month to complete and they be as thorough as the energy of a capable staff could make they chapter iv training the army those of we who be fortunate enough to witness the nature of the preparation for the first of general allenby 's great and triumphant move in palestine can speak of the debt britain and she ally owe not merely to the commander-in-chief and he headquarters staff but to the three corps commander the divisional commander the brigadier and the officer responsible for transport artillery engineer and the other service the army have to be put on a altogether different footing from that which have twice fail to drive the turk from gaza it serve nothing to ignore the fact that the moral of the troops be not high in the week follow the second failure they have to be tune up and train for a big task they know the turk be turn he natural advantage of ground about gaza into a veritable fortress and that if they next effort be to meet with more success than they last they have to learn all that experience on the western front have teach as to system of trench warfare and more than that they have to prepare to apply the art of open warfare to the full extent of they power a couple of month before general allenby take over command general chetwode have take in hand the question of training and in employ the knowledge gain during the strenuous day he have spend in france and flander he not only win the confidence of the troops but improve they tone and by degree bring they up to something approach the level of the best fighting division of we army in france this be hard work during hot weather when we trench system on a wide front have to be prepare against a active enemy and man could ill be spare for the all-important task of training behind the front line it be not long however before troops who have get into that state of lassitude which be engender by a belief that they be settle down to trench warfare for the duration of the war -- that in fact there be a stalemate on this front -- become inspire by the energy of general chetwode they see he in the front line almost every day face the risk they run themselves compliment they on any good piece of work suggest improvement in they defence always anxious to provide anything possible for they comfort and generally look after the rank and file with a detailed attention which no good battalion commander could exceed the man know that the long visit general chetwode pay they form but a small part of he daily task it have be say that a goc of a force have to think one hour a day about operation and five hour about beef in east force as this part of the egyptian expeditionary force be then call general chetwode have to look month ahead have also six worry hour a day to think about water for any one who do not love he profession or who have not a ardent soldierly spirit within he such a daily task would have be impossible i have the privilege of living in general chetwode 's camp for some time and i have see he work at four o'clock in the morning and at nine o'clock at night and the note on a write tablet by the side of he rough camp-bed show that in the hour when sleep forsake he he be plan the next day 's work he staff be entirely compose of hard worker and perhaps no command in this war ever have so small a staff but there be no officer in east force who labor so long or with such concentration and energy and determination as its chief this enthusiasm be infectious and spread through all rank the sick rate decline septic sore from which many man suffer through rough life in the desert on army ration get better and the man show more interest in they work and be keener on they sport the full effect have not be wholly realize when the war cabinet select general allenby for the control of the big operation but the improvement in the condition of the troops be already most marked and when general allenby arrive and at once direct that general headquarters should be move from cairo which be pleasant but very far away from the front to kelab near khan yunus there be not a man who do not see in the new order of thing a sign that he be to be give a chance of test the briton 's supremacy over the turk the improvement in the moral of the troops the foundation of which be thus begin and cement by general chetwode be rapidly carry on under the new chief division like the 52nd 53rd and 54th which have work right across the desert from the suez canal toiling in a torrid temperature when parch throat sun-blistered limb and septic sore be a heavy trial weaken by casualty in action and sickness be bring up to something like strength reinforce draft join a lot of cheery veteran they be teach in the stern field of experience what be expect of they and they work themselves up to the degree of efficiency of the older man the 74th division make up of yeomanry regiment which have be do excellent service in the libyan desert watch for and harass the element of the senussus army have to be train as infantry these yeoman do not take long to make themselves first-rate infantry and when after the german attack on the somme in march 1918 they go away from we to strengthen the western front a distinguished general tell I he believe that man for man the 74th would prove the finest division in france they certainly prove themselves in palestine and many a old yeomanry regiment win for itself the right to bear ` jerusalem 1917 ' on its standard the 75th division have bring some of the wessex territorial from indium with two battalion of gurkha and two of rifle the 1\/4th duke of cornwall 's light infantry join it from aden but for some month the battalion be not itself it have spend a long time at that dreary sunburnt outpost of the empire and the man do not regain they physical fitness till close upon the time it be require for the gaza operation the 60th division come over from salonika and we be delighted to have they for they not only give we general bulfin as the xxist corps commander but set a example of efficiency and a combination of dash and doggedness which earn for they a record worthy of the best in the history of the great war these london territorial be second-line man man recruit from volunteer in the early day of the war when the county of london territorial battalion go across to france to take a part on a front hard press by german legion the 60th division man have rush forward to do they duty before the derby scheme or conscription seek out the cream of britain 's manhood and no one have any misgiving about that fine cheery crowd the 10th division likewise come from salonika unfortunately it have be do duty in a fever-stricken area and malaria have weaken its rank a little while before the autumn operation begin as many as 3000 of its man be down at one time with malaria but care and tonic of the battle pull the rank together and the irish division a purely irish division campaign up to the glorious tradition of they race they work like glutton with rifle and spade and they pioneer work on road in the judean hill will always be remember with gratitude the cavalry of the desert mount corps be old campaigner in the east the anzac mount division compose of six regiment of australian light horse and three regiment of new zealand mount rifle have be operate in the sinaus desert when they be not win fame on gallipolus since the early day of the war they have prove sterling soldier in the desert war hard full of courage capable of make light of the longest trek in waterless stretch of country and mobile to a degree the turk never dream of there be six other regiment of australian light horse and three first-line regiment of yeomanry in the australian mount division and nine yeomanry regiment in the yeomanry mount division the 7th mount brigade be attach to desert corps as be also the imperial camel corps brigade form of yeoman and australian who have volunteer from they regiment for work as camelry they too be veteran all these division have to be train hard not only have the four infantry division of xxth corps to be bring to a pitch of physical fitness to enable they to endure a considerable period of open fighting but they have to be train in water abstinence as in the event of success they would unquestionably have long march in a country yield a quite inadequate supply of drinking water and this problem in itself be such that fully 6000 camel be require to carry drinking water to infantry alone water-abstinence training last three week and the maximum of half a gallon a man for all purpose be not exceed simply because the man have be make accustomed to deny themselves drink except when absolutely necessary but for a systematic training they would have suffer a great deal the disposition of the force be give in the appendix -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see appendix v -rrb- chapter v railway road and the base to ease the supply problem a spur line be lay from rafa to shellal on the wadi ghuzze in that way supply store and ammunition be take up to we right flank shellal be a position of great strategic importance at one time it appear as if we should have to fight hard to gain it the turk have cut a elaborate series of trench on walus sheikh nuran a hill cover shellal but they evacuate this position before we make the first attack on gaza and leave a invaluable water supply in we hand at shellal the stony bed of the wadi ghuzze rest between high mud bank which have be cut into fantastic shape by the rush water descend from the southern extremity of the judean range of hill during the winter rain in the summer month when the remainder of the wadi bed be dry there be bubble spring of good water at shellal and these have probably be continuously flow for many century for close above the spot where the water issue anzac cavalry discover a beautiful remnant of the mosaic flooring of a ancient christian church which raise on a hundred-feet mound be doubtless the center of a colony of christian hundred of year before crusader be attract to the holy land we engineer harness that precious flow a dam be put across the wadi bed and at least a million gallon of crystal water be hold up by it whilst the overflow go into shallow pool fringe with grass -lrb- a delightfully refreshing sight in that arid country -rrb- from which horse be water pump set be install at the reservoir and pipe be lay towards karm and from these the camel transport corps be to fill fanati -- eight to twelve gallon tank -- for carriage of water to troops on the move the railway staff the department which arrange the make up and run of train as well as the construction staff have heavy responsibility it be recognize early in 1917 that if we be to crush the turk out of the war provision would have to be make for a larger army than a single line from the suez canal could feed it be decide to double the track the difficulty of the director of railway transport be enormous there be great shortage of railway material all over the world some very valuable cargo be lose through enemy action at sea and we have to call for more from different centre and england deprive herself of roll stock she badly need to enable she flag of freedom to be carry -lrb- though it be not to be hoist -rrb- through the holy land and incidentally i may remark that with the solitary exception of a dirty little piece of red ensign i see fly in the native quarter in jerusalem the only british flag the people see in palestine and syrium be a miniature union jack carry on the commander-in-chief 's motor car and by he standard-bearer when ride thus do the british army play the game for some of the ally susceptibility might have be wound if the people have be tell -lrb- though indeed they know it -rrb- that they be under the protection of the british flag they have the most convincing evidence however that they be under the staunch protection of the british army the doubling of the railway track go on apace to save pressure at the alexandrium dock and on the egyptian state railway which give some of its rolling stock and i think the whole of its reserve of material for the use of the military line east of the canal be work to its utmost capacity and also to economise money by save railway freight wharf be build on the canal at kantara and as many as six ocean-going steamer could be unloaded there at one time by and by a railway bridge be throw over the canal and when the war be over through train could be run from cairo to jerusalem and haifa kantara grow into a wonderful town with several mile of canal frontage huge railway siding and workshop enormous store of ration for man and horse medical supplies ordnance and ammunition dump etc probably the enemy know all about this vast base any one on any ship pass through the canal could see the place and it be surprising and it certainly point to a lack of enterprise on the part of the german that no attempt be make to bomb kantara by the super-zeppelin which in November 1917 leave its balkan base and get as far south as the region of khartoum on its way to east africa before be recall by wireless this same zeppelin be see about forty mile from port say and a visit by it be anticipate aeroplane with experienced pilot and arm with the latest anti-zeppelin device be station at port say and aboukir ready to ascend on any moonlight night when the hum of aerial motor machinery could be hear the super-zeppelin never come and kantara 's progress be unchecked the double railway track be lay as far as el arish by the time operation commence and this be a great aid to the railway staff every engine and truck be use to its fullest capacity and a enormous amount of time be save by the abolition of pass station for some ninety mile of the line 's length railhead be at deir el belah about eight mile short of gaza and here troops and a army of egyptian labourer be work night and day week in week out off-loading truck with a speed that enable the maximum amount of service to be get out of roll stock there be large depts down the line too at rafa there be a big store of ammunition and at shellal large quantity not only of supplies but of railway material be pile up in readiness for push out railhead immediately the advance begin a decauville or light line run out towards gamlus from shellal to make the supply system easier and i remember see some indian pioneer lay about three mile of light railway with astonishing rapidity the day after we take beersheba every mile the line advance mean time save in get up supplies and the radius of action of lorry horse and camel transport be considerably increase to supply the gaza front we call in aid a small system of light railway from the railhead at deir el belah to the mouth of the wadi ghuzze and from that point along the line of the wadi to various place behind the line hold by we we have a total length of 21 kilometre of light railway before this railway get into full operation horse have begin to lose condition and during the summer ammunition-column officer become very anxious about they horse the light railway be almost everywhere within range of the enemy 's gun and in some place it be unavoidably expose particularly where it run on the bank of the wadi due south of gaza i recollect while the track be be lay speak to a australian in charge of a gang of native prepare a earthwork and ask why it be that a trench be dig before earth be pile up he point to the hill of alus muntar the most prominent feature in the enemy 's system and say that from the turk ' observation post on that eminence every movement of the labourer could be see and the man be often force by gunfire to the refuge of the trench when the railway be in run order train have to run the gauntlet of shell-fire on this section on bright moonlight night and no camouflage could hide they but they work through in a marvellously orderly and efficient fashion and on one day when we gun be hungry this little line carry 850 ton of ammunition to the battery the horse become fit and strong and be ready for the war to be carry into open country in christen they tiny puffing locomotive the tommy driver show they strong appreciation of they comrade on the sea and the ` iron duke ' and ` lion ' be always tune up to haul a maximum load but the pride of the engine yard be the ` jerusalem cuckoo ' -- some prophetic eye must have see its future employment on the light line between jerusalem and ramallah -- though in popularity it be run close by the ` bulfin-ch ' a play upon the name of the commander of the xxist corps for which it do sterling service the navy form part of the picture as well some small steamer of 1000 to 1500 ton burden come up from port say to a little cove north of belah to lighten the railway 's task they anchor about 150 yard off shore and a crowd of boat pass backwards and forwards with store these be carry up the beach to truck on a line connect with the supply depts and if you wish to see a busy scene where slacker have no place the belah beach give it you the army try all sort of boatman and labourer there be kroo boy who find the mediterranean water a comparative calm after the turbulent surf on they own west african shore the maltese be not a success the egyptian be both here and almost everywhere else where they service be call for the best of all the fellow on this beach however be the raratonga from the cook island the island from which the maori originally come they be first employ at el arish where they make it a point of honor to get a job do well and quickly and on a give day it be find that thirty of they have do as much labourer ' work as 170 british soldier they be man of fine physical strength and endurance and some one who know they have the instinct of sportsman devise a simple plan to get the best out of they he present a small flag to be win each day by the crew accomplish the best work with the boat the result be amazing every minute the boat be afloat the raratonga strain they muscle to win the day 's competition and when the day 's task be end the victorious crew march with they flag to they camp singing a weird song and as proud as champion some raratonga work at ammunition dump and it be the boast of most of they that they could carry four 60-pounder shell at a time a few of these stalwart man from southern sea receive a promotion which make they the most envied man of they race -- they become load number in heavy howitzer battery fight side by side with the motherland gunner however well the navy and all associate with it work only a very small proportion of the army 's supplies be water bear the great bulk have to be carry by rail enormously long train most of they haul by london and south-western locomotive bear munitions food for man and animal water equipment medical comfort gun wagon caterpillar tractor motor car and other paraphernalia require for the largest army which have ever operate about the town of gaza in the thousand of year of its history the main line have throw out from it great tentacle embrace in they iron clasp vital centre for the supply of we front and over these spur line the train run with the regularity of british main-line express besides 96000 actual fight man there be a vast army of man behind the line and there be over 100000 animal to be feed there be 46000 horse 40000 camel 15000 mule and 3500 donkey on army work east of the canal and not a man or beast go short of ration we use to think kitchener 's advance on khartoum the perfection of military organization beside the palestine expedition that soudan campaign fade into insignificance in fight man and labor corps in animal and the machinery of war this army be vastly larger and more important and the method by which it be bring to palestine and be supply and the low sick rate constitute a tribute to the master mind of the organiser the army have fresh meat bread and vegetable in a country which under the lash of war yield nothing but which under we rule in peace will furnish three time the produce of the best of past year of plenty a not inconsiderable portion of the front line be supply with nile water take from a canal nearly two hundred mile away but the army once at the front depend less upon the water of that father of river than it have to do in the long trek across the desert then all drinking water come from the nile it flow down the sweet-water canal -lrb- if one may be pardon for call ` sweet ' a volume of water so charge with vegetable matter and bacterium that it be harmful for white man even to wash in it -rrb- be filter and siphon under the suez canal at kantara where it be chlorinate and pass through a big pipe line and pump through in stage into palestine the engineer set about improve all local resource over a wide stretch of country which use to be regard as waterless in summer many water level be tap and there be a fair yield the engineer ' greatest task in move with the army during the advance be always the provision of a water supply and in develop it they confer on the native a boon which should make they be remember with gratitude for many generation in the month precede we attack royal engineer be also concern in improve the means of communication between railway depts and the front line before we arrival in this part of southern palestine wheel traffic be almost unknown among the native there be not one metalled roadway and only comparatively light load could be transport in wheel vehicle the soil between khan yunus and deir el belah especially on the west of we railway line be very sandy and after the winter rain have knit it together it begin to crumble under the sun 's heat and it soon cut up badly when two or three limber have pass over it the sandy earth be also a great nuisance in the region between khan yunus and shellal but between deir el belah and we gaza front except on the belt near the sea which be compose of hillock of sand precisely similar to the sinaus desert the earth be firmer and yield less to the grind action of wheel for ordinary heavy military traffic the engineer make good go by take off about one foot of the top soil and banking it on either side of the road these track last very well but they require constant attention ambulance and light motor car have special arrangement make for they hundred of mile of wire net be lay on sand in all direction and these wire road which stretch across bright golden sand appear like black band to observer in aircraft at first arouse much curiosity among enemy airman and it be not until they have make out a ambulance convoy on the move that they realize the purpose of the track the rabbit wire road be a remarkable success motor wheel hold firmly to the surface and when the road be in good condition car could travel at high speed three or four width of wire net be lace together lay on the sand and peg down after a time loose pocket of sand could not resist the weight of wheel and there become many hole beneath the wire and the jolting be a sore trial alike to spring and to a passenger 's temper but here again constant attention keep the road in order and if one could not describe travel over they as easy and comfortable they be at least sure and one could be certain of get to a destination at a average speed of twelve mile a hour in sand the ford car have perform wonderful feat but remarkable as be the record of that cheap american car with we -- it help we very considerably to win the war -- you could never tell within hour how long a journey would take off the wire road once leave the net and you might with good luck and a skilful driver get across the sand without much trouble but it often mean much bottom-gear work and a hot engine and not infrequently the digging out of wheel the driver use to try to keep to the track make by other car these be never straight and the swing from side to side remind you of you first ride on a camel 's back the wire road be a great help to we and the officer who first think out the idea receive we daily blessing i do not know who he be but i be tell the wire road scheme be the outcome of a device suggest by a medical officer at romanus in 1916 when infantry could not march much more than six mile a day through the sand this officer make a sort of wire moccasin which he attach to the boot and double the march power of the soldier a sample of those moccasin should find a place in we war museum chapter vi prepare for ` zero day ' about the middle of August it be the intention that the attack on the turk ' front line in southern palestine should be launch some time in September general allenby know he force would not be then at full strength but what be happen at other point in the turkish theater of operation might make it necessary to strike a early blow at gaza to spoil enemy plan elsewhere however it be soon see that a September advance be not absolutely necessary general allenby decide that instead of make a early attack it would be far more profitable to wait until he army have be improve by a longer period of training and until he have get he artillery particularly some of he heavy battery into a high state of efficiency he would risk have to take jerusalem after bad weather have set in rather than be unable owe to the condition of he troops to exploit a initial success to the fullest extent how wholly justified be this decision the subsequent fighting prove and it be doubtful if there be ever a more complete illustration of the wisdom of those direct war policy at home submit to the cool balanced calculation of the man on the spot the extra six week spend in training and preparation be of incalculable service to the ally i have hear it say that a September victory in palestine would have have its reflex on the italian front and that the caporetto disaster would not have assume the gigantic proportion which necessitate the withdrawal to italy of british and french division from the western front and prevent cambraus be a big victory that be very doubtful on the contrary a September battle in palestine before we be fully ready to follow the turk after break and roll up they line even if we have succeed in do this completely might have deprive we of the moral effect of the capture of jerusalem and of the wonderful influence which that victory have on the whole civilised world by reason of the sacrifice the commander-in-chief make to prevent any fight at all in the precinct of the holy city of this i shall speak later give the fullest detail at my command for there be no page in the story of british arm which better uphold the honor and chivalry of the soldier than the preservation of the holy place from the clash of battle that last six week of preparation be unforgettable the london newspaper i have the honor to represent as war correspondent know operation be about to begin but i do not cable or mail they one word which would give a indication that big thing be afoot they never ask for news but be content to wait till they could tell the public that victory be ours in accordance with they practice throughout the war the london press set a example to the world by refrain from publish anything which would give information of the slightest value to the enemy it be a privilege to see that victory in the make some division which have allot to they the hardest part of the attack on beersheba be draw out of the line and form up in big camp between belah and shellal set about a course of training such as athlete undergo they have long march in the sand carry pack and equipment they be put on a short allowance of water except for wash purpose they dig they have bombing practice and with all this extra exercise while the day be still very hot they need no encouragement to continue they game football be they favorite sport and the british tommy be such a remarkable fellow that it be usual to see he trudge home to camp look ` feed up ' with exercise and then after throw off he pack and tunic run out to kick a ball the italian and french detachment use to look at he in astonishment and doubtless they think he enthusiasm for sport be a sore trial he get thoroughly fit for march over sand over stony ground over shift shingle during the period of concentration he have to cross a district desperately bad for march and it be more than probable the enemy never believe he capable of such endurance he be often tired no doubt but he always get to he destination be rarely footsore and laugh at the worst part of he journey the sand be choke the fly be a irritating pest equipment become painfully heavy but a big brave heart carry tommy through he training to a state of perfect condition for the heavy test to enable about two-third of the force to carry on a move battle while the remainder keep half the enemy pin down to he trench system on he right-centre and right it be necessary to reinforce strongly the transport service for we mobile column the xxist corps give up most of its lorry tractor and camel to xxth corps these have to be move across from the gaza sector to we right as secretly as possible and they be not bring up to load at the supply depts at shellal and about karm until the moment they be require to carry supplies for the corps move to attack it be not easy to convey to any one who have not see a army on the move what a vast amount of transport be require to provision two corps in france where road be numerous and in comparatively good condition the supply problem could be work out to a nicety but in a roadless country where there be not a sound half-mile of track and where water have to be develop and every gallon be precious the question of supply need most anxious consideration and a big margin have to be allow for contingency it will give some idea of the requirement when i state that for the supply of water alone the xxth corps have allot to it 6000 camel and 73 lorry to feed these water camel alone need a big convoy we get a impression of the might and majesty of a army in the field as we see it prepare to take the offensive the camp of general headquarters where i be located be situate north of rafa the railway run on two side of the camping ground one line go to belah and the other stretch out to shellal where everything be in readiness to extend the iron road to the north-east of karm on the plain which because the turk enjoy complete observation over it have hitherto be no man 's land we see and hear the traffic on this section of the line it be enormous heavily laden train run night and day with a mass of store and supplies with motor lorry car and tractor and the ever-increasing volume of traffic tell those of we who know nothing of the date of ` zero day ' that it be not far off the heaviest train seem to run at night and the return empty train be hurry forward at a speed suggest the urgency of clear the line for a fully load train await at rafa the signal to proceed with its valuable load to railhead perfect control not only on the railway system but in the forward supply yard prevent congestion and when a train arrive at its destination and be split up into several part well-drilled gang of troops and egyptian labourer be allot to each truck and whether a lorry or a tractor have to be unshipped and move down a ramp or a truck have to be relieve of its ten ton of tibbin box of biscuit and bully or of engineer ' store the goods be clear away from the vicinity of the line with a celerity which a goods-yard foreman at home would have applaud as the smartest work he have ever see there be no room for slacker in the army and the value of each truck be so high that it could not be leave stand idle for a hour the organization be equally good at kantara where the loading and make up of train have to be arrange precisely as the need at the front demand those remarkable hauler the caterpillar tractor cut many a passage through the sand tug heavy gun and ammunition store for the air and signal service machinery for engineer and mobile workshop and sometimes tow a weighty load of petrol to satisfy they voracious appetite for that fuel the tractor do well sand be no trouble to they and when mud maroon lorry during the advance in November the rattle rumble old tractor make fair weather of it the mechanical transport train will not forget the service of the tractor on the morning after beersheba be take from railhead to the spot where father abraham and he people feed they flock the country be bare and the earth 's crust have yield all its strength under the influence of the summer sun load lorry under they own power could not move more than a few yard before they be several inch deep in the sandy soil but a motor transport officer devise a plan for beat down a track which all lorry could use he get a tractor to haul six unladen lorry and with all the vehicle use they own power the tractor manage to pull they through to beersheba leave behind some wheel track with a hard foundation a hundred lorry follow the driver steer they in the rut and they make such good progress that by the afternoon they have deposit between 200 and 300 ton of supplies in beersheba the path the tractor cut do not last very long but it be sound enough for the immediate and pressing requirement of the army within a month of he arrival in egypt general allenby have visit the whole of he front line and have decide the form he offensive should take as soon as he force have be make up to seven infantry division and the desert mount corps and they have be bring up to strength and train he would attack make he main offensive against the enemy 's left flank while conduct operation vigorously and on a extensive scale against the turkish right-centre and right the principal operation against the left be to be conduct by general chetwode 's xxth corps consist of four infantry division and the imperial camel brigade and by general chauvel 's desert mount corps general bulfin 's xxist corps be to operate against gaza and the turkish right-centre south-east of that ancient town if the situation become such as to make it necessary to take the offensive before the force have be bring up to strength the xxist corps would have have to undertake its task with only two division but in those circumstance its operation be to be limit to demonstration and raid by throw forward he right the xxist corps commander be to pin the enemy down in the atawineh district and on the leave he would move against the south-western defence of gaza so as to lead the turk to suppose a attack be to come in this sector that movement be make the xxth corps and desert mount corps be to advance against beersheba and have take it to secure the valuable water supply which be know to have exist there since abraham dig the well of the oath which give its name to the town because of water difficulty it be consider vital that beersheba should be capture in one day a formidable undertaking owe to the situation of the town the high entrenched hill around it and the long march for cavalry and infantry before the attack and in draw up the scheme base on the commander-in-chief 's plan the commander of xxth corps and desert mount corps have always to work on the assumption that beersheba would be in they hand by nightfall of the first day of the attack general barrow 's yeomanry mount division be to remain at shellal in the gap between xxth corps and xxist corps in case the enemy should attempt to attack the xxth corps ' leave flank have deal with the enemy in beersheba general chetwode with mount troops protect he right be to move north and north-west against the enemy 's left flank to drive he from he strong position at sherium and hareira envelop he left flank and striking it obliquely while the xxth corps be move against this section of the enemy line desert mount corps be to bring up the mount division leave at shellal and pass behind the xxth corps to march on nejile where there be a excellent water supply and the wadi hesus so as to threaten the left rear and the line of retreat of the turkish army it be always doubtful whether xxth corps would be able to close up the gap between it and the xxist corps owe to the length of its march and the distance it be from railhead and the scheme therefore provide that the xxist corps should confirm success gain on we right by force its way through the tremendously strong gaza position to the line of the wadi hesus and join up with desert mount corps a considerable number of xxth corps troops would then return to the neighborhood of railhead and release the greater part of its transport for the infantry of xxist corps move up the maritime plain this in summary form be the scheme general allenby plan before the middle of August and though the detail be not and could not be work out until a couple of month have pass it be noteworthy as show that notwithstanding the move a enterprising enemy have at he command in a country where position be entirely favourable to he where he have water near at hand where the transport of supplies be never so serious a problem for he as for we when we get on the move and where he could make we fight almost every step of the way the commander-in-chief foresaw and provide for every eventuality and he scheme work out absolutely and entirely ` accord to plan ' to use the favorite phrase of the german high command when the corps commander begin work out the detail two of the greatest problem be transport and water only patience and skilful development of known source of supply would surmount the water difficulty and we have to wait till the period of concentration before commence its solution but to lighten the transport load which must have weigh heavily on corps staff the commander-in-chief agree to allow the extension of the railway east of shellal to be begin sooner than he have provide for it be imperative that railway construction should not give the enemy a indication of we intention if he have realize the nature and scope of we preparation he would have do something to counteract they and to deny we that element of surprise which exert so great a influence on the course of the battle general allenby however be willing to take some risk to simplify supply difficulty and he order that the extension to a railway station north-east of karm should be complete by the evening of the third day before the attack that a decauville line from gamlus not to be begin before the sixth day prior to the attack be to be complete to karm by the day precede the opening of the fighting at beersheba and that a new decauville line should be start at karm when fight have begin and should be carry nearly three mile in the beersheba direction early on the follow morning these new line though of short length be a inestimable boon to the conductor of supply train the new railhead both of the standard gauge and light line be well place and they not only save time and shorten the journey of camel convoy and lorry transport column but prevent congestion at depts in one central spot a big effort be make to escape detection by enemy aircraft for the first time since the egyptian expeditionary force take the field we have obtain mastery in the air on the 8th and 15th October two enemy plane be shoot down behind we line and the keenness of we airman for combat make the german aviator extremely careful they have be bold and resolute take they observation several thousand foot higher than we pilot it be true but neither anti-aircraft fire nor the presence of we machine in the air have up to this time deter they however just at the moment when airwork be of extreme importance to the turk the german fly man recognize that we pilot have new battle plane and be full of resource and daring show a unusual lack of enterprise and we profit from they inactivity the concentration of the force in the position from which it be to attack beersheba be to have take seven day but owe to the difficulty attend the development of water at asluj and khalasa the time be extend to ten day during this period the uppermost thought of commander be to conceal they movement all march be do at night and no move of any kind be permit till nearly six o'clock in the evening when enemy aircraft be usually at rest and the light be sufficiently dull to prevent the fritz see much if they have make a exceptionally late excursion all the tent and temporary shelter which have be occupy for week be leave stand cookhouse horse line canteen and so on be untouched and one have a eerie feeling in pass at night through these untenanted camping grounds desert and lifeless and a prey to the jackal and pariah dog a vast area of many square mile which have hold ten of thousand of troops and animal almost become a wilderness again and the few native hereabouts who have make large profit from the sale of egg fruit and vegetable look disconsolate and bewildered at the change hope and believe that the empty tent merely denote a temporary absence but the great majority of the army never come that way again when the infantry start on the march division and brigade have allot to they particular area for they march route and all over that country where scarcely a tree or native hut exist to make a landmark there be dot small arrow-pointed board with the direction ' a road ' ' b road ' ' z road ' as the case might be march in the dark hour when a refreshing air succeed the heat of the day the troops halt as soon as a purple flush throw into high relief the southern end of the judean hill and they hide themselves in the wadi and broken ground and on one unit vacate a bivouac area it be occupy by another thus make the area in which the troops rest as few as possible the concentration be work to a time-table not only be brigade allot certain march each night but they be give specify time to cover certain distance and these be arrange accord to the condition of the ground in part it be very broken and cover with loose stone and the pace of infantry by night be very slightly more than one mile per hour the route for gun be not choose until the whole country have be reconnoitr and it be a highly creditable performance for artillery to get they field gun and heavy howitzer battery through to the time-table but the clockwork precision of the movement reflect even more highly on the staff work out the detail than on the infantry and artillery and it may be say with perfect truth that the staff make no miscalculation or mistake the xxth corps staff map and plan and the detail accompany they be masterpiece of clearness and completeness the man who fight out the plan to a triumphant finish be glad to recognize this perfection of staff work -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see appendix vi -rrb- chapter vii the beersheba victory the xxth corps begin its movement on the night of 20-21st October the whole corps be not on the march but a sufficient force be send forward to form supply dump and to store water at esanus for troops cover desert mount corps engineer engage on the development of water at khalasa and asluj some of the australian and new zealand troops engage on this work have previously be at these place in the early summer it be think desirable to destroy the turkish railway which run from beersheba to asluj and on to kossaima in order to prevent a enemy raid on we communication between el arish and rafa and the mount troops with the imperial camel corps have have a most successful day in destroy many mile of line and several bridge the turk be badly in need of rail for the line they be then construct down to deir sineid and they have lift some of the rail between asluj and kossaima but during we raid we break every rail over some fifteen mile of track khalasa and asluj be water centre become the point of concentration for two mount division and the splendid colonial in the engineer section work at the well as if the success of the whole enterprise depend upon they effort as indeed to a very large extent it do theirs be not a eight hour day they work under many difficulty often thigh deep in water and mud cleaning out and deepen well and install power pump put up large canvas tank for storage and make water trough the result exceed anticipation and the commander-in-chief on a day when the call on he time be many and urgent make a long journey to thank the officer and man for the work they have do and to express he high appreciation of they skill and energy the principal work carry out by the xxth corps during the period of concentration consist in lay the standard gauge line to imara and open the station at that place on October 28 prolong the railway line to a point three-quarter of a mile north-north-east of karm where the station be open on November 3 complete by October 30 the light railway from the east bank of the wadi ghuzze at gamlus _ via _ karm to khasif and develop water at esani malaga and abu ghalyun for the use first by cavalry detachment and then by the 60th division cistern in the khasif and imsirus area be stock with 60000 gallon of water to be use by the 53rd and 74th division and this supply be to be supplement by camel convoy apparently the enemy know very little about the concentration until about October 26 and even then he could have have only slight knowledge of the extent of we movement and probably know nothing at all of where the first blow be to fall in the early hour of October 27 he do make a attempt to interfere with we concentration and there be a spirited little action on we outpost line which have be push out beyond the plain to a line of low hill near the wadi hanafish the turk in overwhelming force meet a most stubborn defense by the middlesex yeomanry and if the enemy take these london yeoman as a average sample of general allenby 's troops this engagement must have give they a foretaste of what be in store for they the middlesex yeomanry -lrb- the 1st county of london yeomanry to give the regiment the name by which it be officially know though the man almost invariably use the much older territorial title -rrb- and the 21st machine gun squadron hold the long ridge from el buggar to hill 630 there be a squadron dismount on hill 630 three troops on hill 720 the next and highest point on the ridge and a post at el buggar at four o'clock in the morning the latter post be fire on by a turkish cavalry patrol and a hour later it be evident that the enemy intend to try to drive we off the ridge he occupation of which would have give he the power to harass railway construction party by shell-fire even if it do not entirely stop the work some 3000 turkish infantry 1200 cavalry and twelve gun have advance from the kauwukah system of defence to attack we outpost line on the ridge they heavily engage hill 630 work round both flank and bring heavy machine-gun and artillery fire to bear on the squadron hold it the royal fly corps estimate that a force of 2000 man attack the garrison which be completely cut off a squadron of the city of london yeomanry send to reinforce be hold up by a machine-gun barrage and have to withdraw the garrison hold out magnificently all day in a support trench close behind the crest against odds of twenty to one and repeatedly beat off rush although the body of dead turk show that they get as close as forty yard from the defender two officer be wound and four other rank kill and twelve wound the attack on hill 720 be make by 1200 cavalry support by a heavy volume of shell and machine-gun fire during the early morning two desperate charge be beat off but in a third charge the enemy gain possession of the hill after the detachment have hold out for six hour all we officer be kill or wound and all the man be casualty except three at six o'clock in the evening the turk be hold this position in strength against the 3rd australian light horse but two infantry brigade of the 53rd division be move towards the ridge and during the evening the enemy retire and we hold the ridge from this time on quite securely the strong defense of the middlesex yeomanry undoubtedly prevent the turk establish themselves on the ridge and save the infantry from have to make a night attack which might have be costly thereafter the enemy make no attempt to interfere with the concentration the yeomanry loss in this encounter be 1 officer and 23 other rank kill 5 officer and 48 other rank wound 2 officer and 8 other rank miss on the night of October 30-31 a brilliant moon light up the whole country the day have be very hot and at sunset a entire absence of wind promise that the night march of nearly 40000 troops of all arm would be attend by all the discomfort of dust and heat the thermometer fall but there be not a breath of wind to shift the pall of dust which hang above the long column of horse foot and gun where the track be sandy some brigade often appear to be advance through one of london 's own particular fog man 's face become cake with yellow dust they nostril be hot and burning and parched throat could not be relieve because of the necessity of conserve the water allowance a hot day be in prospect on the morrow and the fear of have to fight on a empty water-bottle prevent many a gallant fellow broach he supply before daybreak most of the man have have a long acquaintance with heat in the middle east and the high temperature would have cause they scarcely any trouble if there have be wind to carry away the dust cloud the cavalry march over harder and more stony ground than the infantry they advance from khalasa and asluj a long way south of beersheba to the east of the town it be a big night march of some thirty mile but it be well within the power of the veteran of the anzac mount division and australian mount division whose man and horse be in admirable condition the infantry be order to be on they line of deployment by four o'clock on the morning of October 31 and in every case they be before time there have be many reconnaissance by officer who be to act as guide to column and they be quite familiar with the ground and the gun and ammunition column be take by route which have be carefully select and mark in place the bank of wadi have be cut into and ramp make to enable the rough stony watercourse to be practicable for wheel and break as the country be and though all previous preparation have to be make without arouse the suspicion of turk and wander bedouin there be no incident to check the progress of infantry or gun occasional rifle fire and some shell occur during the early hour but at a little after three be the xxth corps advance headquarters have the news that all column have reach they allotted position the xxth corps plan be to attack the enemy 's work between the khalasa road and the wadi saba with the 60th and 74th division while the defence north of the wadi saba be to be mask by the imperial camel corps brigade and two battalion of the 53rd division the remainder of the latter division protect the left flank of the corps from any attack by enemy troops who might move south from the sherium area the first objective be a hill mark on the map as ' 1070 ' about 6000 yard south-west of beersheba it be a prominent feature 500 yard or perhaps a little more from a portion of the enemy 's main line and the turk hold it strongly and be support by a section of german machine-gunner we have to win this height in order to get good observation of the enemy 's main line of work and to allow of the advance of field artillery within wire-cutting range of a elaborate system of work protect beersheba from a advance from the west at six the gun begin to bombard 1070 and the volume of fire concentrate on that spot must have give the turk a big surprise on a front of 4500 yard we have in action seventy-six 18-pounder twenty 45-inch howitzer and four 37-inch howitzer while eight 60-pounder eight 6-inch howitzer and four 45-inch howitzer be employ in counter battery work the absence of wind place we at a heavy disadvantage the high explosive shell burst about the crest of 1070 raise enormous cloud of dust which obscure everything and after a short while even the flame of explode shell be entirely hide from view the gunner have to stop firing for three-quarter of a hour to allow the dust to settle they then reopen and by half-past eight the wire-cutting be report complete a intense bombardment be order under cover of which and with the assistance of machine-gun fire from aeroplane the 181st infantry brigade of the 60th division go forward to the assault they capture the hill in ten minute only sustain about one hundred casualty and take nearly as many prisoner a german machine-gunner who fall into we hand bemoan the fact that he have not a weapon leave -- every one of the machine gun have be knock out by the artillery and a number be bury by we fire the first phase of the operation have thus end successfully quite early in the day the second stage be enter upon field gun be rush forward at the gallop over ground break by shallow wadi and up and down a very uneven stony surface the gun team be generally expose during the advance and be treat to heavy shrapnel fire but they swing into action at prearranged point and set about wire-cutting with excellent effect the first part of the second phase consist in reduce the enemy 's main line from the khalasa road to the wadi saba though the artillery bombard the whole line the 60th division on the right have two brigade attack and one in divisional reserve and the 74th division attack on the left of the 60th likewise have a brigade in reserve the 74th while wait to advance come under considerable shell-fire from battery on the north of the wadi and it be some time before they fire could be silence as a rule the enemy work be cut into rocky rise ground and the trench be well enclose in wire fix to iron stanchion they be strongly make and there be possibility of prolonged opposition but by the time the big assault be launch the turk know they be be attack on both side of beersheba and they must have become anxious about a line of retreat general shea report that the wire in front of he be cut before noon but general girdwood be not certain that the wire be sufficiently break on the 74th division 's front though he intimate to the corps commander that he be ready to attack at the same time as the 60th it still continue a windless day and the dust cloud prevent any observation of the wire entanglement general girdwood turn this disadvantage to account and order he artillery to raise they fire slightly so that it should fall just in front of and about the trench put up what be in effect a dust barrage and under cover of it select detachment of he infantry advance almost into the burst shell to cut passage through the wire with wire-cutter the dismounted yeomanry of the 231st and 230th infantry brigade rush through and by half-past one the 74th division have secure they objective the 179th and 181st brigade of the 60th division have win they trench almost a hour earlier and about 5000 yard of work be in we hand south of the wadi saba the enemy have 3000 yard of trench north of the wadi and though these be threaten from the south and west it be not until five o'clock that the 230th brigade occupy they the turk clear out during the bombardment during the day on the left of the 74th division the imperial camel corps brigade and two battalion of the 53rd division hold the ground to the north of the wadi saba to a point where the remainder of the 53rd division watch for the approach of any enemy force from the north while the 10th division about shellal protect the line of communication east of the wadi ghuzze and the yeomanry mount division be on the west side of the wadi ghuzze in ghq reserve the xxth corps ' loss be 7 officer kill and 42 wound 129 other rank kill 988 wound and 5 miss a light total consider the nature of the work carry during the day it be obvious that the enemy be take completely by surprise by the direction of the attack and the rapidity with which we carry he strongest point be overwhelming the turk do not attempt anything in the nature of a counter-attack by the beersheba garrison nor do he make any move from hareira against the 53rd division have he do so the 10th division and the yeomanry mount division would have seize the opportunity of fall on he from shellal and the turk choose the safer course of allow the beersheba garrison to stand unaided in its own defence the xxth corps ' capture include 25 officer 394 other rank 6 gun and numerous machine gun the desert mount corps meet with stubborn opposition in they operation south-east and east of beersheba but they be carry through no less successfully than those of the xxth corps the mount man have have a busy time general ryrie 's 2nd australian light horse brigade and the imperial camel corps brigade have move southwards on October 2 and on they and on the 1st and 2nd field squadron australian engineer the bulk of the work fall of develop water and make and mark track which in the sandy soil become badly cut up on the evening of October 30 the anzac mount division be at asluj the australian mount division at khalasa the 7th mount brigade at esanus imperial camel brigade at hiseium and the yeomanry mount division in reserve at shellal the anzac division command by general chaytor leave asluj during the night and in a march of twenty-four mile round the south of beersheba meet with only slight opposition on the way to bir el hamam and bir salim abu irgeig between five and seven mile east of the town the 2nd australian light horse brigade during the morning advance north to take the high hill tel el sakaty a little east of the beersheba-hebron road which be capture at one o'clock and the brigade then sweep across the metalled road which be in quite fair condition and which subsequently be of great service to we during the advance of one infantry division on bethlehem and jerusalem the 1st australian light horse brigade command by general cox and the new zealand mount rifle brigade under general meldrum move against tel el saba a 1000-feet hill which rise very precipitously on the northern bank of the wadi saba 4000 yard due east of beersheba tel el saba be believe to be the original site of beersheba it have be make into a strong redoubt and be well hold by a substantial garrison adequately dig in and support by nest of machine-gunner the right bank of the wadi khalil be also strongly hold and between the hebron road and tel el saba some german machine-gunner in three house offer determine opposition the new zealander and a number of general cox 's man creep up the wadi saba take full advantage of the cover offer by the high bank and form up under the hill of saba they then dash up the steep side while the horse artillery lash the crest with they fire and drive the turk from they trench have capture the hill by three o'clock at about the same time the 1st light horse brigade suitably deal with the machine-gunner in the house much grind east of beersheba have thus be make good and the hebron road be deny to the garrison of the town as a line of retreat the anzac mount division be then reinforce by general wilson 's 3rd australian light horse brigade and by six pm the division hold a long crescent of hill from point 970 a mile north of beersheba through tel el sakaty round south-eastward to bir el hamam general hodgson 's australian mount division have a night march of thirty-four mile from khalasa to iswawin south-east of beersheba and after the 3rd light horse brigade have be detach to assist the anzac division order be give to general grant 's 4th australian light horse brigade to attack and take the town of beersheba from the east the order be receive at four o'clock and until we have get a absolute hold on tel el saba a attack on the town from this direction would have be suicidal as a attack force would have be between two fire the shell of the cavalry during the day have be rather hot and enemy airman have occasionally bomb they it be get late and as it be of the greatest importance that the town 's available water should be secure that night general grant be direct to attack with the utmost vigor he brigade worthily carry out its order the ground be very uneven and be cover with a mass of large stone and shingle the trench be well manned and strongly hold but general grant order they to be take at the gallop the australian carry they with a irresistible charge dismount clear the first line of all the enemy in it run on and capture the second and third system of trench and then they horse have be bring up gallop into the town to prevent any destruction of the well the first-line eastern trench of beersheba be eight foot deep and four foot wide and as there be many of the enemy in they they be a serious obstacle to be take in one rush this charge be a sterling feat and unless the town have be occupy that night most if not all of the cavalry would have have to withdraw many mile to water and subsequent operation might have be imperil until we have get beersheba there appear small prospect of water more than two brigade in this area luckily there have be two thunderstorm a few day before the attack and we find a few pool of sweet water which enable the whole of the corps ' horse to be water during the night these pool soon dry up and the water problem again become serious the commander-in-chief reward general grant with the dso as a appreciation of he work and the brigade be gratify at a well-earned honor the 7th mount brigade be hold up for some time in the afternoon by a flanking fire from ra ghannam south of beersheba but this be silence in time to enable the brigade to assist in the occupation of beersheba at nightfall the 4th light horse brigade 's capture in the charge be 58 officer 1090 other rank and 10 field gun and the total ` bag ' of the desert mount corps be 70 officer and 1458 other rank the loss of beersheba be a heavy blow to the turk yet he do not even then realize to the full the significance of we capture of the town he certainly fail to appreciate that we be to use it as a jumping-off place to attack he main line from gaza to sherium by roll it up from leave to right in this plan there be no doubt that general allenby entirely deceive he enemy for in the next few day there be the best of evidence to show that general kress von kressenstein believe we be go to advance from beersheba to jerusalem up the hebron road and he make he disposition to oppose we here it be not merely the moral effect of the loss of beersheba that disturb the turk they have be drive out of a not unimportant stronghold all through the many century since abraham and he people lead a pastoral life near the well beersheba have be a meanly appoint place there be no sign as far as i could see of any elaborate ruin to indicate anything larger than a native settlement elsewhere we see crumble wall of ancient castle and fortress to tell of conqueror and glory long since fade away of relic of a age when great captain lead martial man into new world to conquer of the time when the crusading spirit be abroad and the flower of western chivalry come east to hold the land for christian here the native quarter suggest that trade in beersheba be purely local and not ambitious that it provide nothing for the world 's commerce save a few skin and hide and that the inhabitant be content to live the rude simple life of they forefather but the enterprising german arrive and you could tell by he work how he intend to compel a change in the unchanging character of the people he build a handsome mosque -- but before he be drive out he wire and mine it for destruction he build a seat of government a hospital and a barracks all of they pretentious building for such a town well design construct of stone with red-tiled roof and the garden be nicely lay out there be a railway station and storehouse on a scale which would not yield a return on capital expenditure for many year and the water tower and engine shed be build to last longer than merely military necessity demand they be fashion by european craftsman and the solidity of the structure offer strange contrast to the rough-and-ready native house the primary object of the hun scheme be doubtless to make beersheba a suitable base for a attack on the suez canal and the manner of improve the hebron road of set road engineer to construct zigzag up hill so that lorry could move over the road be part of the plan of man whose vision be centre on cut the suez canal artery of the british empire 's body the best lay scheme when i enter beersheba we troops hold a line of outpost sufficiently far north of the town to prevent the turk shell it and the place be secure except from aircraft bomb of which a number fall into the town without damaging anything of much consequence some of the troops fall victim to booby trap apparently harmless whisky bottle explode when attempt be make to draw the cork and several small mine go up besides the mine in the mosque there be a good deal of wiring about the railway station and some rolling stock be make ready for destruction the instant a door be open the ruse be expect some australian engineer draw the charge and the coach be afterwards of considerable service to the supply branch chapter viii gaza defence meanwhile there be important happening at the other end of the line gaza be about to submit to the biggest of all she ordeal she have be a bone of contention for thousand of year the pharaoh covet she and more than 3500 year ago make bloody strife within the environs of the town alexander the great besiege she and persian and arabian oppose that mighty general the ptolemy and the antiochus for century fight for gaza whose inhabitant have a greater taste for the mart than for the sword and when the maccabee be carry a victorious war through philistium the people of gaza buy off jonathan but the jew occupy the city itself about a century before the christian era later on the place be capture after a year 's siege and destroy and for long it remain a mass of moulder ruin pompey revive it make it a free city and gabinius extend it close to the harbor whilst under caesar and herod its prosperity and fame increase in succeed century gaza 's commerce flourish under the greek who found school famous for rhetoric and philosophy till the mahomedan wave sweep over the land in the first half of the seventh century when the town become a shadow of its former self though it continue to exist as a center for trade the crusader make they influence feel and many be the trace of they period in this ancient city but askalon always have more crusader support napoleon 's attack on gaza find abdallah 's army in a very different state of preparedness from von kress 's turkish army nearly all abdallah 's artillery be leave behind in a gun park at jaffa owe to lack of transport and though he have a numerically superior force he do not like napoleon 's disposition and retreat when kleber move up the plain to pass between gaza and the sea and the cavalry advance east of the mound of hebron or alus muntar as we know the hill up which samson be repute to have carry the gate and bar of gaza for nearly a century and a quarter since napoleon pass forwards and backwards through the town gaza pursue the art of peace in the lethargic spirit which suit the native temperament but in eight month of 1917 it be the cockpit of strife in the middle east and there be often cram into one day as much fight energy as be show in all the battle of the past thirty-five century napoleon 's campaign include fortunately after the battle of march and April nearly all the civilian population leave the town for quieter quarter some of they on return must have have difficulty in identify they home in the center of the town where bazaar radiate from the quarter of which the great mosque be the hub the house be a mass of stone and rubble and the narrow street and tortuous byway be fill with fall wall and roof the great mosque have entirely lose its beauty we have shell it because its minaret one of those delicately fashion spire which see from a distance lead a traveller to imagine a native town in the east to be arrange on a artistic and orderly plan be use as a turkish observation post and the mosque itself as a ammunition store i be tell we gun be never lay on to this objective until there be a accident within it which explode the ammunition be that as it may there be ample justification for shell the mosque i go in to examine the structure a few hour after the turk have be compel to evacuate the town and whilst they be then shell it with unpleasant severity amid the wreck marble column the broken pulpit the tear and twist lamp and crumble wall be hundred of thousand of round of small-arms ammunition most of it destroy by explosion a great shell have cut the minaret in half and have leave expose telephone wire lead direct to army headquarters and to the turkish gunner ' fire control station most of the mosque furniture and all the carpet have be remove but a few torn copy of the koran some of they in manuscript with marginal note lay mix up with german newspaper and some typical turkish war propaganda literature that mosque which saladin seize from the crusader and turn from a christian into a mahomedan place of worship be unquestionably use for military purpose and the turk care as little for its religious character or its venerable age as they do for the mosque on nebus samwil where the remains of the prophet samuel be suppose to rest they story of the trouble take to avoid military contact with holy place and site be all bunkum and eyewash they would have fight from the wall of the holy city and place machine-gun nest in the church of the holy sepulchre and the mosque of omar if they have think it would spare they the loss of jerusalem gaza have as i have say be turn into a fortress with a mass of field work in place of considerable natural strength if we force have be on the defensive at gaza the german would not have attack without a army of at least three time we strength it be doubtful if the turk put as much material in use on gallipolus as they do here they trench be deeply cut and be protect by a immense amount of wire in the sand-dune area they use a vast quantity of sandbag and they meet the shortage of jute stuff by make small sack of bedstead hanging and curtain which in the dry heat of the summer wear very well look across no man 's land one could easily pick out a line of trench by a red a vivid blue or a saffron sandbag the turkish dug-out be most elaborate place of security the excavator have go down into the hard earth well beneath the deep stratum of sand and they roof these hole with six eight and sometimes ten layer of palm log we have see these beautiful tree disappear and have guess the reason but a even greater protection than the device of military engineer have be provide for the turk by dame nature along the southern outskirts of the town all the field be enclose by giant cactus hedge sometimes with stem as thick as a man 's body and not infrequently rear they strong limb and prickly leaf twenty foot above the ground the hedge be deep as well as high they be at once a screen for defend troops and a barrier as impenetrable as the wall of a fortress if one line of cactus hedge have be cut through infantry would have find another and yet another to a depth of nearly two mile and as the whole of these thorny enclosure be command by a few machine gun the possibility of get through be almost hopeless there be similar hedge on the eastern and western side of gaza but they be not quite so deep as on the south on the western side and extend south as far as the desert which the army have cross with such steady methodical and one may also say painful progression be a wide belt of yellow sand sometimes settle down hard under the weight of heavy wind and in other place yield to the pressure of foot the turk have labor hard in this mile and a half width of sand right down to the sea to protect they right flank there be a point about 4000 yard due west from the edge of the west town of gaza which we call sea post it be the western extremity of the enemy 's exceedingly intricate system of defence the beach be below the level of the post from sea post for about 1500 yard the turkish front line run to rafa redoubt there be wired-in entrenchment with strong point here and there and a series of communication trench and redoubt behind they for 3000 yard to sheikh hasan which be the port of gaza if you can so describe a open roadstead with no landing facility from rafa redoubt the contour of the sand dune permit the enemy to construct a exceedingly strong line run due south for 2000 yard the strongest point be name by we zowaid trench el burj trench triangle trench peach orchard and el arish redoubt the nomenclature be reminiscent of the trial of the troops in the desert march behind this line there be many a sunken passageway and shelter from gunfire while back the whole system and for reason i have give a element of defense as strong as the prepared position be cactus hedge enclose the west town 's garden from el arish redoubt the line run east again to mazar trench with a prodigal expenditure of wire in front of it and then south for several hundred yard when it be throw out to the south-west to embrace a position of high importance know as umbrella hill a dune of blaze yellow sand face about 500 yard away samson 's ridge which we hold strongly and on which the enemy often concentrate he fire this end the turk ' right-half section of the gaza defence close by pass what from time immemorial have be call the cairo road a track wear down by caravan of camel move towards kantara on they way with goods for egyptian bazaar but there be no break in the trench system which run across the plain a beautiful green tint with the bloom of myriad of wild flower when we first advance over it in march now browned and dry up by absolutely cloudless summer day in the garden on the western slope of the hill run south from ali muntar the turk have achieve much spadework but he have do far more work on the hill themselves and these be a frame of fortification for alus muntar on which we once sit for a few hour and the possession of which mean the reduction of gaza by the end of summer the hill of muntar have lose its shape when we see it during the first battle of gaza it be a bold feature surmount by a few tree and the whitened wall and gray dome of a sheikh 's tomb in the earlier battle of 1917 much be do to ruffle muntar 's crest we see tree uproot other lose they limb and naval gunfire threaten the foundation of the old chief 's bury place but alus muntar stoutly resist the heavy shell ' attack as if samson 's feat have endow it with some of the strong man 's power muntar for a long time receive its daily thump stoically but by degree the resistance of the old hill decline and when agent report that the sheikh 's tomb be use as a observation post 8-inch howitzer get on to it and make it untenable there be a bit of it leave at the end but not more than would offer protection from a rifle bullet and the one tree leave standing be a limbless trunk the crest of the hill lose its roundness and the soil which have work out through the shell crater have change the color of the summit old alus muntar have have the worst of the bombardment and if some future sheikh should choose the site for a summer residence he will come across a wealth of metal in digging he foundation to capture gaza the formidable it be propose first to take the western defence from umbrella hill to sea post to press on to sheikh hasan and thus turn the right flank of the whole position that would compel the enemy to reinforce he right flank when he be be heavily attack elsewhere and if he have be transfer he reserve to meet the threat against the left of he main line after beersheba have be win for the empire he would be in sore trouble gaza have already taste a full sample of the war food we intend it should consume before the attack on beersheba have develop ship of war and the heavy gun of xxist corps have rattle its defence the warship ' fire be chiefly direct on target we land gun could not reach observer in aircraft control the fire and notify the destruction of ammunition dump at deir sineid and other place the work of the heavy battery be watch with much interest some be entirely new battery which have never be in action against any enemy and they only arrive on the gaza front five week before the battle these be not allow to register until shortly before the battle begin and they borrow gun from other battery in order to train the gun crew so desirous be general bulfin to conceal the concentration of heavy that the wireless code call be only those use by battery which be in position before he corps be form and the volume of fire come as a absolute surprise to the enemy it come as a surprise also to some of we in camp at ghq one night at the end of October suddenly there be a terrific burst of fire on about four mile of front vivid fan-shaped flash stab the sky the bright moonlight of the east do not dim the gun ' lightning and they thunderous voice be a challenge the enemy be powerless to refuse he take it up slowly as if half ashamed of he weakness then he fire increase in volume and in strength but it ebb again and we know the reason we hold some big ` stuff ' for counter battery work and we fire be effective the preliminary bombardment begin on October 27 and it grow in intensity day by day the navy co-operate on October 29 and subsequent day the whole line from middlesex hill -lrb- close to outpost hill -rrb- to the sea be subject to heavy fire all the route to the front line be shell during the night by 60-pounder and field-gun battery gas shell dose the centre of communication and bivouac area and every quarter of the defence be make uncomfortable the sound-ranging section tell we the enemy have between sixteen and twenty-four gun south of gaza and from forty to forty-eight north of the town and over 100 gun be disclose include more than thirty firing from the tank redoubt well away to the eastward on October 29 some of the gun south of gaza have be force back by the severity of we counter battery work and of the ten gun remain between we and the town on that date all except four have be remove by November 2 for several night the bombardment continue without a move by infantry then just at the moment von kress be discuss the loss of beersheba and he plan to meet we further advance in that direction some infantry of the 75th division raid outpost hill the southern extremity of the entrenched hill system south of alus muntar and kill far more turk than they take prisoner there be a intense bombardment of the enemy 's work at the same time the next night -- November 1-2 -- be the opening of xxist corps ' great attack on gaza and though the enemy do not leave the town or the remainder of the trench we have not assault till nearly a week afterwards the vigor of the attack and the bravery with which it be thrust home and the subsequent total failure of counter-attack must have make the enemy commander realize on the afternoon of November 2 that gaza be doom and that they boast that gaza be impregnable be thin air they reserve be on the way to they leave where they be urgently want there be nothing strong enough to replace such heavy wastage cause to they by the attack of the night of November 1 and the morning of the 2nd and we big gain of ground be a enormous advantage to we for the second phase in the gaza sector for we have bite deeply into the turk ' right flank like the concentration of the xxth corps and the desert mount corps for the jump off on to beersheba the preparation against the turk ' extreme right have to be very secretly make the xxist corps commander have to look a long way ahead he have to consider the possibility of the enemy abandon gaza when beersheba be capture and fall back to the line of the wadi hesus he troops have be confine to trench warfare for month digging and sit in trench put out wire go out on listen patrol snipe and do all the drudgery in the line of earthwork they be hard and strong they health have considerably improve since the early summer but at the end of September the infantry be by no means march fit realize that if general allenby 's operation be successful and no one doubt that we should have a period of open warfare when troops would be call upon to make long march and undergo the privation entail by transport difficulty general bulfin bring as many man as he could spare from the trench back to deir el belah and the coast where they have route march over the sand for the restoration of they march power gradually he accumulate supplies in sheltered position just behind the front in three dump be collect seven day ' mobile ration ammunition water and engineer ' material track be construct cable bury conceal gun position and brigade and battalion headquarters make and from the 25th October troops be ready to move off with two day ' ration on the man should the enemy retire general hill 's 52nd -lrb- lowland -rrb- division be to march up the shore beneath the sand cliff get across the wadi hesus at the mouth detach a force to proceed towards askalon and then move eastward down to the ridge opposite deir sineid and by secure the bridge and crossing of the wadi hesus prevent the enemy establish himself on the north bank of the wadi the operation on the night of November 1-2 be conduct by major-general hare command the 54th division to which general leggatt 's 156th infantry brigade be temporarily attach the latter brigade be give the important task of capture umbrella hill and el arish redoubt umbrella hill be to be take first and as it be anticipate the enemy would keep up a strong artillery fire for a considerable time after the position have be take and that he fire would interfere with the assembly and advance of troops detail for the second phase the first phase be time to start four hour earlier than the second for several day the gun have open intense fire at midnight and again at 3 be so that the enemy should not attach particular importance to we artillery activity on the night of action and a creep barrage nightly sweep across no man 's land to clear off the chain of listen post establish 300 yard in front of the enemy 's trench some heavy bank of cloud move across the sky when the scottish rifle brigade assemble for the assault but the moon shed sufficient light at interval to enable the scot to file through the gap make in we wire and to form up on the tape lay outside at 11 pm the 7th scottish rifle storm umbrella hill with the greatest gallantry the first wave of some sixty-five officer and man be blow up by four large contact mine and entirely destroy the second wave pass over the body of they comrade without a moment 's check and move through the wire smash by we artillery enter umbrella hill trench and set about the turk with they bayonet they have to clear a maze of trench and dug-out but they bomb out of existence the machine-gunner oppose they and have settle the possession of umbrella hill in half a hour the 4th royal scot lead the attack on el arish redoubt it be a bigger and noisier ` show ' than the royal scot have have some month before when in a ` silent ' raid they kill with hatchet only for the scot have see the condition of some of they dead left in turkish hand and be take retribution not many turk in el arish redoubt live to relate that night 's story the scot be rapidly in the redoubt and be rapidly through it clear up a nasty corner know as the ` little devil ' and be just about to shelter from the shell which be to answer they attack when they catch a brisk fire from a bedouin hut a platoon leader dispose he man cleverly and rush the hut killing everybody in it and capture two machine gun the vigorous resistance of the turk on umbrella hill and el arish redoubt result in we have to bury over 350 enemy dead in these position the second phase be to attack the enemy 's front-line system from el arish redoubt to the sea at sea post at 3 be after the enemy gun have plentifully sprinkle umbrella hill and have give it up as irretrievably lose we open a ten-minute ' intense bombardment of the front line exactly as have be do on precede morning but this time the 161st and 162nd infantry brigade follow up we shell and carry 3000 yard of trench at once three-quarter of a hour afterwards the 163rd infantry brigade try to get the support trench several hundred yard in rear but the difficulty be too many and the effort fail have secure sea post and beach post the 162nd brigade complete the program by advance up the coast and capture the ` port ' of gaza sheikh hasan with a considerable body of prisoner the enemy 's gun remain active until seven o'clock when they reserve they fire till the afternoon then a heavy counter-attack be see to be develop by a aerial observer whose timely warning enable the big gun and warship to smash it up another counter-attack against sheikh hasan be repulse later in the day and a third start from crest rock which aim at get back el burj trench be a complete failure after the second phase we troops bury 739 enemy dead without doubt there be many other kill and wound in the unsuccessful counter-attack particularly the first against sheikh hasan when many heavy shell be see to fall in the enemy 's rank we take prisoner 26 officer include two battalion commander and 418 other rank we casualty be 30 officer and 331 other rank kill 94 officer and 1869 other rank wound and 10 officer and 362 other rank miss consider the enormous strength of the position attack the number engage and the fact that we secure enemy front 5000 yard long and 3000 yard deep the loss be not more severe than might have be expect the turk cling to they trench with a tenacity equal to that which characterise they defence on gallipolus and officer prisoner tell we they have be order to hold gaza at all cost that be good news though even if they have get back to the wadi hesus line it be doubtful if when sherium be take they could have do more than temporarily hold we up there during the next few day the work against the enemy 's right consist of heavy bombardment on the line of hill run from the north-east to the south of gaza and on the prominent position of sheikh redwan east of the port the enemy make some spirited reply notably on the 4th but he force in gaza be get shake and prisoner reluctantly admit that the heavy naval shell take they in flank and rear be affect the moral of the troops the gunfire of rear-admiral jackson 's fleet of hm _ grafton _ _ raglan _ monitor 15 29 31 and 32 river-gunboat _ ladybird _ and _ amphi _ and the destroyer _ staunch _ and _ comet _ be worthy of the king 's navy they be assist by the french battleship _ requin _ we lose a monitor and destroyer torpedo by a submarine but the mark of the navy 's hard hit be on and about gaza and we hear if we could not see the best the ship be do on one day there be a number of explosion about deir sineid indicate the destruction of some of the enemy 's reserve of ammunition and while the turk be still in gaza they receive a shock resemble nothing more than a earthquake one of the ship -- the _ raglan _ i believe -- take a signal from a seaplane get a direct hit on a ammunition train at beit hanun the railway terminus north of gaza the whole train go up and its load be scatter in fragment over a area of several hundred square yard a extraordinary scene of wreckage of tear and twist railway material and destroy ammunition present itself to we when we get on the spot on November 7 there be another very fine example of the navy 's indirect fire a short distance northward of this railway station a stone road bridge have be build over the wadi hesus and it have to carry all heavy traffic the bank of the wadi be too steep and broken to permit wheel pass down they as they stand during we advance the engineer have to build ramp here a warship take its line from a aeroplane fire at the bridge from a range of 14000 yard get two direct hit on it and hole it in the center and there must have be thirty or forty shell crater within a radius of fifty yard the confounding of the turk be ably assist by the navy chapter ix crush the turkish left now we return to the operation of xxth corps and desert mount corps on we right after the capture of beersheba this force be prepare to attack the left of the turkish main line about hareira and sherium the capture of which would enable the fine force of cavalry to get to nejile and gain a excellent water supply to advance to the neighborhood of huj and so reach the plain and threaten the enemy 's line in rear and to fall on he line of retreat it be propose to make the attack on the kauwukah and rushdus system at hareira on November 4 but the water available at beersheba have not be equal to the demand make upon it and be peter out and mount troops protect the right flank of xxth corps have to be relieved every twenty-four hour the man also suffer a good deal from thirst the weather be unusually hot for this period of the year and the dust churn up by traffic be as irritating as when the khamseen wind blow the two day ' delay mean much in favor of the enemy who be enable to move he troops as he desire but it also permit we infantry to get some rest after they long march and supplies be bring nearer the front ` rest ' be only a comparative term brigade be on the move each day in country which be one continual rise and fall with stony bed of wadi to check progress without a tree to lend a few moment ' grateful relief from a burning sun and nothing but the rare sight of a squalid native hut to relieve the monotony of a sun-dried desolate land the troops be remarkably cheerful they be on they toe as the cavalry tell they they have draw first blood profusely from the turk after many weary month of wait and get fit and they know that those gaunt mountain ridge away on they right front hold behind they bethlehem and jerusalem goal they desire to reach more than any other prize of war they have see the turk and have soundly thrash he out of trench which the british could have hold against a much stronger force they confidence be base on the proof that they be better man and they be convince that once they get the enemy into the open they superiority would be still more marked the event of the next six week show they estimate of the turkish soldier be justified the 53rd division with the imperial camel corps on its right move to towal abu jerwal on November 1 to protect the flank guard of the xxth corps during the pend attack on the kauwukah system the infantry have some fighting on that day but it be mild compare with the strenuous day before they the 10th division attack irgeig railway station north-west of beersheba and secure it and wait there with the 74th division on its right while the welsh division go forward to fight for khuweilfeh on November 3 the welshman could not obtain the whole of the position on that day and it be not until the 6th that it become theirs khuweilfeh be about ten mile due east of sherium the same distance north of beersheba and some five mile west of the hebron road it be in the hill country difficult to approach with nothing in the nature of a road or track lead to it and there be no element in the position to suggest the prospect of a easy capture when general mott advance to these forbid height the strength of the enemy in these part be not realize prisoner take during the day prove that there be portion of three or four turkish division in the neighborhood and the strong effort make to prevent the welsh troops gain the position and the furious attempt to drive they out of it suggest that most of the turkish reserve have be bring over to they left flank to guard against a wide movement intend to envelop it it afterwards turn out that von kressenstein believe general allenby intend to march on jerusalem up the hebron road and he throw over to he left all he reserve to stop we that be a supreme mistake for when we have break through at hareira and sherium the two wing of he army be never in contact and they only means of communication be by aeroplane the magnificent fight the 53rd division put up at khuweilfeh against vastly superior force and in the face of heavy casualty play a very important part in the overwhelming defeat of the turk for four day and night the welsh division fight without respite and with the knowledge that they could not be substantially reinforce since the plan for the attack on hareira and sherium entail the employment of all the available infantry of xxth corps attack after attack be launch against they with extreme violence and great gallantry they position be rake by gunfire whilst water and supplies be not over plentiful but the staunch division hold on grimly to what it have gain and its tenacity be well reward by what be win on other portion of the field during the night of November 5-6 and the day of the 6th the 74th 60th and 10th division concentrate for the attack on the kauwukah system the enemy 's position run from he jerusalem-beersheba railway about five mile south-east of hareira across the gaza-beersheba road to the wadi sherium on the northern bank of which be a exceedingly strong redoubt cover hareira the eastern portion of this line be know as the kauwukah system and between it and hareira be the rushdus system all be connect up by long communication and support trench while a light railway run from the rushdus line to dump south of sherium at the moment of assembly for attack we line from right to left be make up as follow : the 158th infantry brigade be on the right south of tel khuweilfeh then come the 160th brigade and 159th brigade the yeomanry mount division hold a long line of country and be the connect link between the 53rd and 74th division the latter division dispose from right to leave the 231st brigade the 229th brigade and 230th brigade who be to march from the south-east to the north-west to attack the right of the kauwukah system of entrenchment on the railway the 181st brigade 180th brigade and 179th brigade of the 60th division be to march in the same direction to attack the next portion of the system on the left of the 74th division 's objective then swing to the north to march on sherium the 31st brigade 30th brigade and 29th brigade be to operate on the 60th division 's leave with the australian mount division watch the left flank of xxth corps the turkish viith army and 3rd cavalry division be oppose the xxth corps another division be opposite the 53rd division and the imperial camel corps with the 12th dept regiment at dharahiyeh on the hebron road the 16th division opposite we 74th the 24th and 26th division opposite we 69th and the 54th against the 10th division the 3rd 53rd and 7th turkish division be in the gaza area at daybreak the troops advance to the attack the first part of the line in front of the 231st brigade be a serious obstacle two or three small outlying rifle pit have to be take before the division could proceed with its effort to drive the enemy out of sherium and protect the flank of the 60th division which have to cross the railway where a double line of trench be to be tackle the rear line above the other with the flank well throw back and protect by small advanced pit to hold a few man and machine gun the turk hold on very obstinately to they ground east of the railway and keep the 74th division at bay till one o'clock in the afternoon but the artillery of that division have for some time be assist in the wire-cutting in front of the trench to be assault by the 60th division and the latter go ahead soon after noon and with the assistance of one brigade of the 10th division have win about 4000 yard of the complicated trench system and most of the rushdus system by half-past two the londoner then swing to the north and occupy the station at sherium while the dismount yeomanry work round farther east take a series of isolate trench on the way the irish troops relieve the 60th in the capture trench at kauwukah the 60th division have possession of the larger part of sherium intend to attack the hill there at nightfall and the attack be in preparation when a enemy dump explode and a huge fire light up the whole district so that all troops would have be expose to the fire of the garrison on the hill general shea therefore stop the attack but the hill be storm at 430 next morning and carry at the point of the bayonet a bridgehead be then form at sherium and the londoner fight all day and stop one counter-attack when it be within 200 yard of we line on that same morning the irish troops have extend they gain westwards from the rushdus system till they get to hareira tepe redoubt a high mound 500 yard across the top which have be criss-cross with trench with wire hang about some broken ground at the bottom here there be a hot tussle but the irishman valiantly push through and not only give xxth corps the whole of its objective and complete the turn of the enemy 's left flank but join up with the xxist corps the working of xxth corps ' scheme have again be admirable and once more the staff work have enable the movement to be time perfectly the desert mount corps be thus able to draw up to sheria in readiness to take up the pursuit and to get the water supply at nejile this end the xxth corps ' task for a few day though the 60th division become temporarily attach to desert mount corps xxth corps have nobly do its part the consummate ability energy and foresight of the corps commander have be support throughout by the skill of divisional and brigade commander for the man no praise could be too high the attention give to they training be well repay they bear the strain of long march on hard food and a small allowance of water in a way that prove they physique to be only match by they courage and that be of a high order they discipline be admirable they determination alike in attack and defense strong and well sustained to say they be equal to the finest troops in the world might lay one open to a charge of exaggeration when it be impossible to get a fair ground of comparison see the condition of fight on different front be so varied but the trial through which the troops of xxth corps pass up to the end of the first week of November and they magnificent accomplishment by the end of the year make I doubt whether any other corps possess finer soldierly quality the man be indeed splendid the casualty sustain by the xxth corps from October 31 to November 16 be : kill officer 63 other rank 869 wounded officer 198 other rank 4246 miss no officer 108 other rank -- a total of 261 officer and 5223 other rank during the period after beersheba when the xxth corps troops be concentrate to break up the turk ' defensive position on the leave the desert mount corps be busily engage hold a line eight or ten mile north and north-east of beersheba and watch for any movement of troops down the hebron road the 2nd australian light horse brigade and 7th mount brigade try to occupy a line from khuweilfeh to dharahiyeh but it be not possible to reach it -- a fact by no means surprising as in the light of subsequent knowledge it be clear that the turk have put much of they strength there a patrol of light horseman manage to work round to the north of dharahiyeh a curious group of mud house on a hill-top inhabit by native who have yet to appreciate the evil of grossly overcrowded quarter as well as some of the elementary principle of sanitation and they see a number of motor lorry come up the admirably construct hill road design by german engineer the lorry be hurry from the jerusalem area with reinforcement prisoner -- several hundred of they in all -- be bring in daily but no attempt be make to force the enemy back until November 6 when the 53rd division which for the time be be attach to the desert mount corps drive the turk off the whole of khuweilfeh behave as i have already say with fine gallantry and inflict severe loss there be also counter-attack launch against the 5th mount brigade the new zealand mount rifle brigade and the imperial camel corps brigade but these be likewise beat off with considerable casualty to the enemy when the xxth corps have capture the khauwukah system a detachment for the defense of the right flank of the army be form under the command of major-general g de s barrow the goc yeomanry mount division consist of the imperial camel corps brigade 53rd division yeomanry mount division new zealand mount rifle brigade and two squadron and eight machine gun of the 2nd australian light horse brigade the australian mount division march from karm whither it have be send on account of water difficulty to rejoin desert mount corps to whom the 60th division be temporarily attach the desert corps have order on November 7 to push through as rapidly as possible to the line wadi jemmameh-huj and from that day the corps commence its long march to jaffa a march which though strongly oppose by considerable body of troops be more often interfere with by lack of water than by difficulty in defeat the enemy the scarcity of water be a sore trouble there be a occasional pool here and there but generally the only water procurable be in deep well give a poor yield the cavalry will not forget that long trek no brigade could march straight ahead those operate in the foothill on we right have to fight all the way and they be often call upon to resist counter-attack by strong rearguard issue from the hill to threaten the flank and so delay the advance in order to permit the turk to carry off some of they material it be necessary almost every day to withdraw certain formation from the front and send they back a considerable distance to water replace they by other troops come from a well center in this way brigade be not infrequently attach to division other than they own and the administrative service be heavily handicapped several time whole brigade be without water for forty-eight hour and though supplies reach they on all but one or two occasion they be often late and a exceedingly severe strain be put on the transport during that diagonal march across the maritime plain i hear infantry officer remark that the australian always seem to have they supplies up with they i do not think the supplies be always there but they generally be not far behind and if resource and energy could work miracle the australian supply officer deserve the credit for they the divisional train work hard in those strenuous day and the ` q ' staff of the desert mount corps have many a sleepless night devise plan to get that last ounce out of they transport man and to get that little extra amount of supplies to the front which mean the difference between want and a sufficiency for man and horse on the 7th November the 60th division after its spirited attack on tel el sherium cross the wadi and advance north about two mile fight obstinate rearguard all the way the 1st australian light horse take 300 prisoner and a considerable quantity of ammunition and store at ameidat and with the remainder of the anzac division reach tel abu dilakh by the evening and the australian mount division fill the gap between the anzac and the londoner but have be unable to water could not advance further the 8th November be a busy and brilliantly successful day the corps ' effort be to make a wide sweeping movement in order first to obtain the valuable and urgently require water at nejile and then to push across the hill and roll downs to the country behind gaza to harass the enemy retreat from that town the turk have a big rearguard south-west of nejile and make a strong effort to delay the capture of that place the importance of which to we they realize to the full and they be prepare to sacrifice the whole of the rearguard if they could hold we off the water for another twenty-four hour the pressure of the anzac division and the 7th mount brigade assist it be too much for the enemy who though hold on to the hill very stoutly till the last moment have to give way and leave the water in we undisputed possession the sherwood ranger and south nott hussar be vigorously counter-attack at mudweiweh but they severely handle the enemy who retire a much weakened body by the evening the anzac hold the country from nejile to the north bank of the wadi jemmameh have capture 300 prisoner and two gun the australian mount division make a excellent advance round the north side of huj which have be the turkish viiith army headquarters and the 4th australian light horse brigade be in touch with the corps cavalry of xxist corps at beit hanun while the 3rd australian light horse brigade have take prisoner and two of the troublesome austrian 59 howitzer it be the work of the 60th division in the center however which be the outstanding feature of the day though the londoner readily admit that without the glorious charge of the worcester and warwickshire yeomanry in the afternoon they would not have be in the neighborhood of huj when darkness fall the 60th be in the center sandwich between the anzac and australian mount division and they allotted task be to clear the country between sherium and huj a distance of ten mile the country be a series of billowy downs with valley seldom more than 1000 yard wide and every yard of the way be oppose by infantry and artillery consider the opposition the progress be good the londoner drive in the turk ' strong flank three time first from the hill of zuheilika then from the cultivate area behind it and thirdly from the wadi-torn district of muntaret el baghl from which the infantry proceed to the high ground to the north it be then between two and three o'clock in the afternoon and map show that between the division and huj there be nearly four mile of most difficult country a mass of wadi bed and hill give a enterprising enemy the best possible means for hold up a advance general shea go ahead in a light armored car to reconnoitre and see a strong body of turk with gun march across he front it be impossible for he infantry to catch they and see ten troops of warwick and worcester yeomanry on he right about a mile away he go over to they and order lieut-colonel h cheape to charge the enemy it be a case for instant action the enemy be a mile and a half from we cavalry the gunner have come into action and be shell the london territorial but they soon have to switch off and fire at a more terrifying target lead by they gallant colonel a master of foxhound who be afterwards drown in the mediterranean the yeoman sweep over a ridge in successive line and race down the northern slope on to the flat at first make direct for the gun then swerve to the leave under the direction of colonel cheape whose eye for country lead he to take advantage of a mound on the opposite side of the valley over this rise the midland yeoman spur they charger and give full-throated cheer dash through the turk ' left flank guard and go straight for the gun they rank be somewhat thin for they have be expose to a heavy machine-gun fire as well as to the fire of eight field gun and three 59 howitzer work at the highest pressure the gunner be nearly all german and austrian and they fight well they splash the valley with shrapnel and during the few moment ' lull when the yeomanry be lose to view behind the mound they set they shell fuse at zero to make they burst at the mouth of the gun and act as case shot they tear some gap in the yeoman 's rank but nothing could stop that charge the midlander ride straight at the gun and sabred every artilleryman at he piece the londoner say they hear all the gun stop dead at the same moment and they know they have be silence in true balaclava style have wipe out the battery the yeoman again answer the call of they leader and sweep up a ridge to deal effectively with three machine gun and have use the white arm against they crew the gun be turn on to the retreat turk and decimate they rank this charge be witness by general shea and i know it be he opinion that it be execute with the greatest gallantry and lan and be worthy of the best tradition of british cavalry the yeomanry lose about twenty-five per cent of they number in casualty but they action be worth the price for they completely break up the enemy resistance and enable the london division to push straight through to huj the warwick and worcester yeomanry receive the personal congratulation of the commander-in-chief and general shea be also thank by general allenby during this day general shea accomplish what probably no other divisional commander do in this war when out scout in a light armored car he be within 500 yard of a big ammunition dump which be blow up he see the three man who have destroy it run away and he chase they into a wadi and machine-gun they they hold up they hand and be astonish to find they have surrender to a general these man be capture in the nick of time but for the appearance of general shea they would have destroy another dump which we capture intact i be with the division the night after they have take huj it be they first day of rest for some time but the man show few sign of fatigue no one could move among they without be proud of the londoner they be strong self-reliant well-disciplined brave fellow i well remember what colonel temperley the gso of the division tell I when sit out on a hill in the twilight that night colonel temperley have be brigade major of the first new zealand infantry brigade which come to egypt and take a full share in the work on gallipolus on its way to france he have over two year of active service on the western front before come out to palestine for duty with the 60th division and he view on man in action be base on the sound experience of the professional soldier of the london county territorial he say : ' i can not speak of these warrior without a lump rise in my throat these cockney be the best man in the world they spirit be simply wonderful and i do not think any division ever go into a big show with higher moral after three year of war it be refresh to hear the man 's earnestly express desire to go into action again these grand fellow go forward with the full bloom on they there never be any hesitation they discipline be absolutely perfect they physique and courage be alike magnificent and they valor beyond word the cockney make the perfect soldier ' i write at the time that ` whether the man come from bermondsey camberwell or kennington or belong to what be know as class corps such as the civil service or kensington before the war all battalion be equally good they be train for month for the big battle till they body be bring to such a state of fitness that spartan fare during the ten day of ceaseless action cause neither grumble nor fatigue the man may well be reward with the title london 's pride and london be honor by have such stalwart to represent the heart of the british empire in eight day the londoner march sixty-six mile and fight a number of hot action the march may not seem long but palestine be not salisbury plain a leg-weary man be ask by a officer if he foot be blister and reply : they be rotten sore but my heart 's gay that be typical of the spirit of these unconquerable cockney i have just leave they they still have the bloom of freshness and i do not think it will ever fade scorching wind which parch the throat and make everything one wear hot to the touch be enough to oppress the staunchest soldier but these sterling territorial coster and labourer artisan and tradesman professional man and man of independent means true brother in arm and good briton leave they bivouac and trudge across heavy country fearless strong proud and with the cheerfulness of good man who fight for right ' what i say in those early day of the great advance be more than bear out later and in the capture of jerusalem in take jericho and in force the passage of the jordan this glorious division of londoner be always the same a pride to its commander a bulwark of the xxth corps and a great asset of the empire chapter x through gaza into the open on the gaza section of the front the xxist corps have be busily occupy with preparation for a powerful thrust through the remainder of the defence on the enemy 's right when the xxth corps should have succeed in turn the main position on the leave the 52nd division on the coast be ready to go ahead immediately there be any sign that the enemy see that the worst be about to happen intend to order a general retirement and then it would be a race and a fight to prevent he establish himself on the high ground north of the wadi hesus should he fail to do that there be scarcely a possibility of the turk hold we up till we get to the jaffa-jerusalem road though between gaza and that metalled highway there be many point of strength from which they could fight delay action it be very doubtful whether the turkish general staff give the cavalry credit for be able to move across the plain in the middle of November when the wadi be absolutely dry and the water-level in the well be lower than at any other period of the year nor do they imagine that the transport difficulty for infantry division feed as ours be could be surmount they may have think that if they could secure the wadi hesus line before we get into position to threaten it in flank they would immobilise we army till the rain begin and there be a possibility of sit face each other in wet uncomfortable trench quarter till the flower show themselves in the spring by which time the bagdad venture of the german higher command prove hopeless before it be start a great volume of reinforcement might be divert to southern palestine with turkish division from the salonika front and a stiffening of german battalion spare from europe in consequence of the russian collapse whatever they may have be the turkish calculation be completely upset the cavalry 's water trouble remain and no human foresight could have smooth they over but the transport problem be solve in this way during the attack on beersheba xxist corps come to the aid of xxth corps by hand over to it the greater part of its camel convoy and lorry so much transport indeed that a vast amount of work in the gaza sector fall to be do by a greatly deplete supply staff when beersheba have be win and the enemy 's left flank have be smash and throw back the xxth corps repay the xxist corps not only by return what it have borrow but by march back into the region of railhead at karm where it could live with a minimum of transport and send all its surplus to work in the coastal sector the switching over of this transport be a fine piece of organization on the allotted day many thousand of camel be see draw out in huge line all over the country intersect by the wadi ghuzze slowly converge on the spot at which they could be barrack and rest before load for the advance the lorry take other path there be no repose for they driver they work till the last moment on the east and then cake with the accumulate dust of a week 's weary labor in sand and powdered earth turn westward to arrive just in time to load up and be off again in pursuit of infantry some make the mistake of travel between the west and east town of gaza while other take the longer and sounder but still treacherous route east of alus muntar and through the old position of the turk these lorry driver be wonderful fellow who laugh at they trial but in the day and night when they bump over the uneven track and negotiate earth rent that threaten to swallow they vehicle they put they faith in the promise of the railway constructor to open the station at gaza at a early date even gaza though it save they so many toilsome mile do not help they greatly because of a terrible piece of road north-east of the station but beit hanun be comfortable and for the relief bring by the railway 's arrival at deir sineid they be profoundly grateful but this be anticipate the story of gaza 's capture the xxist corps have not receive its additional transport when it gain the ancient city of the philistine though it know some of it be on the way and most of it about to start on its westward trek on the day of November 4 and during the succeed night the navy co-operate with the corps ' artillery in destroy enemy trench and gun position and the alus muntar ridge be a glad sight for tired gunner ' eye the enemy show a disposition to retaliate and on the afternoon of the 4th he put up a fierce bombardment of we front-line position from outpost hill to the sea include in he fire area the whole of the trench we have take from he from umbrella hill to sheikh hasan many observer of this bombardment by all the turk ' gun of heavy medium and small calibre declare it be the prelude not of a attack but of a retirement and that the turk be loose off a lot of the ammunition they know they could not carry away they be probably right though the enemy make no sign of go away for a couple of day but if he think he demonstration by artillery be go to hasten back to gaza some of the troops assemble against the left of he main line he be grievously in error the xxist corps be strong enough to deal with any attack the turk could launch and they would have be please if a attempt to reach we line have be make next day the turk be much quieter they have to sit under a terrific fire both on the 5th and 6th November when in order to assist xxth corps ' operation the corps ' heavy artillery the divisional artillery and the warship ' gun carry out a intense bombardment the land gun search the turk ' front line and reserve system while the navy fire on fryer 's hill to the north of alus muntar sheikh redwan a sandhill with a native chief 's tomb on the crest north of gaza and on trench not easily reach by the corps ' gun during the night of November 6-7 general palin 's 75th division as a preliminary to a major operation time for the follow morning attack and gain the enemy 's trench on outpost hill and the whole of middlesex hill to the north of it the opposition be less serious than be anticipate at daylight the 75th division push on over the other hill towards alus muntar and gain that dominate position before eight o'clock the fighting have not be severe and it be soon realize that the enemy have leave gaza abandon a stronghold which have be prepare for defense with all the ingenuity german master of war could suggest and into which have be work a enormous amount of material it be obvious from the complete success of xxth corps ' operation against the turkish left which have be work out absolutely ` accord to plan ' that general allenby have so thoroughly mystified von kressenstein that the latter have put all he reserve into the wrong spot and that the 53rd division 's stout resistance against superior number have pin they down to the wrong end of the line there be nothing therefore for the turk to do but to try to hold another position and he be strain every nerve to reach it the east anglian division go up west of gaza and hold from sheikh redwan to the sea by seven o'clock two squadron of the corps ' cavalry ride along the seashore and have patrol on the wadi hesus a little earlier than that and the imperial service cavalry brigade compose of troops raise and maintain by patriotic indian prince pass through gaza at nine o'clock and go out towards beit hanun to the lowland division be give the important task of get to the right or northern bank of the wadi hesus these imperturbable scot leave they trench in the morning delighted at the prospect of once more engaging in open warfare they march along the beach under cover of the low sand cliff and by dusk have cross the mouth of the wadi and hold some of the high ground to the north in face of determine opposition the 157th brigade after a march through very heavy go get to the wadi at five in the afternoon and see the enemy post on the opposite bank the place be reconnoitr and the brigade make a fine bayonet charge in the dark secure the position between ten and eleven o'clock on this and succeed day the division have to fight very hard indeed and they often meet the enemy with the bayonet one of they officer tell I the scot be twice as good as the turk in ordinary fighting but with the bayonet he advantage be as five to one the record of the division throughout the campaign show this be no too generous a estimate of they power after secure alus muntar the 75th division advance over fryer 's hill to australia hill so that they hold the whole ridge run north and south to the eastward of gaza the enemy still hold to he position to the right of he center and from the atawineh redoubt tank redoubt and beer trench there be considerable shell of gaza and the alus muntar ridge throughout the day a large number of shell fall in the plantation on the western side of the ridge we mastery of the air prevent enemy aviator observe for they artillery or they would have see no traffic be pass along that way we be use the old cairo ` road ' and as far as i could see not a enemy shell reach it though when we troops be in the town of gaza there be many crump and woolly bear to disturb the new occupation but all go swimmingly it be true we have only capture the well-cracked shell of a town but the taking of it be full of promise of greater thing and those of we who look on the mutilate remnant of one of the world 's oldest city feel we be indeed witness of the beginning of the downfall of the turkish empire next morning the 75th division capture beer trench and tank and atawineh redoubt and link up with the irish division of xxth corps on its right they be shell heavily but it be the shell of rearguard and not attacker and soon after twelve o'clock we have the best of evidence that the turk be say good-bye to a neighborhood they have long inhabit i be stand on raspberry hill the battle headquarters of xxist corps when i hear a terrific report staff officer who be use to the visitation of aerial marauder come out of they shelter and search the pearly vault of the heaven for fritz no machine could be find some one look across the country towards atawineh see a huge mushroom-shaped cloud and then we know that one enormous dump at least contain no more projectile to hold up a advance this ammunition store must have be eight mile away as the crow fly but the noise of the explosion be so violent that it be a considerable time before some officer could be bring to believe a enemy plane have not lay a egg near we the blow up of that dump be a signal that the turk be off the lowlander have another very strenuous day in the sand-dune belt first of all they repulse a strong counter-attack from the direction of askalon then the 155th infantry brigade go forward and swing to the right drive the turk off the rise ground north-west of deir sineid the possession of which would determine the question whether the turk could hold on in this quarter sufficiently long to enable he to get any of he material away by he railway and road the enemy put in a counter-attack of great violence and force the scot back the 157th brigade in the early evening attack the ridge and gain the whole of they objective by eight o'clock there ensue some sanguinary struggle on this sandy ground during the night the turk be determine to have possession of it and the scot be willing to fight it out to a finish the first counter-attack in the dark hour drive the lowlander off but they be shortly afterwards back on the hill again the turk return and push the highland light infantry and argyll and sutherland highlander off a second time a third attack be deliver with splendid vigor and the enemy leave many dead but they renew they effort to get the commanding ground and succeed once more the dogged scot however be not to be deny they re-formed and sweep up the heavy shift sand meet the turk on the top with a clash and knock he down the reverse slope soon afterwards there be another ding-dong struggle the turk put in all they available strength for a fourth time get the upper hand and the lowlander have to yield the ground do it slowly and reluctantly and with the determination to try again they be robert bruce all of they it be the best that stay the longest after a brief rest these heroic scot once more swarm up the ridge they cheer have the note of victory in they they drive they bayonet home with the haymaker ' lift and what be leave of the turk flee helter-skelter down the hill towards deir sineid broken dismayed beaten and totally unable to make another effort the hlus brigade 's victory be buy at a price the cost of that hill be heavy but the turk ' tale of dead be far heavier than ours and we have win and hold the hill and consolidated they the turk then turn they face to the north and the scot hurry they on the imperial service cavalry brigade have also meet with considerable resistance but they work up to and on the ridge overlook beit hanun from the east and capture a 59 by evening these indian horseman be link up with the 4th australian light horse brigade on they right and the 52nd division on they left and pursue the enemy as far as tumrah and deir sineid general headquarters direct that two infantry division should advance to the line julis-hamameh in support of mount troops and the 75th division be accordingly order from its position east of gaza up to beit hanun on the 9th November the 52nd division be again advance the 156th brigade have move forward from the gaza trench one officer five groom and two signaller mount on second horse form a little party to reconnoitre askalon and ride boldly into the ancient landing place of the crusader army capture the ruin town unaided there be visible remains of its old strength but the power of askalon have depart it still stand look over the blue mediterranean as a sort of watch tower a silent desert outpost of the land the crusader set they heart on gain and preserve for christianity but behind it be many century ' accumulation of sand encroach upon the fertile plain and no effort have be make to stop the inroad the gallant half-dozen have report to the 156th brigade that askalon be open to they -- the brigade occupy the place at noon -- ride across the sand-dune to the important native town of mejdel where there be a substantial bazaar do a good trade in the essential for native existence bean and cereal in plenty fruit and tobacco of execrable quality at mejdel the six accept the surrender of a body of turk guard a substantial ammunition dump and rejoin they unit satisfy with the day 's adventure the turk have retire a considerable distance during the day the principal body be move up what be call the main road from deir sineid through beit jerjal to juli to get to suafir esh sherkiyeh kustineh and junction station from which they could reach latron by a metalled road or ramleh by a hard mud track by the side of they railway they be clearly go to oppose we all the way or they would lose the whole of they material and they force east and west of the road be well handle in previously select and partially prepared position they leave behind they the unpleasant trail of a defeat army turk have fall by the way and the native would not bury they we aircraft have bomb the road and the dead man cattle and horse and smash transport be ghastly sight and make the air offensive there they lay one long line of dead man and animal and if a london fog have descend to blind the eye of we army the sense of smell would still have carry a scout on the direct line of the turkish retreat i will break off the narrative of fight at this point to describe a scene which express more eloquently than anything else i witness in palestine how deeply engrave in the native mind be the conviction that britain stand for fair dealing and freedom the inhabitant like the arab of the desert do not allow they face to betray they feeling they preserve a stolid exterior and it be difficult to tell from they demeanor whether they be friendly or indifferent to you but they action speak aloud early on the morning after the lowlander have enter mejdel i be in the neighborhood we gun bang away to the north be a reminder that there be to be no promenade over the plain and that we have yet to make good the formidable obstacle of the wadi sukereir when i pass a curious procession people whom the turk have turn out of gaza and the surrounding country be trek back to the spot where they and they forefather have live for countless generation all they worldly goods and chattel be pack on overloaded camel and donkey the woman bear astonishingly heavy load on they head the man ride or walk carry nothing while patriarch of family be either hold in donkey saddle or be bear on the shoulder of younger man agriculturist begin to turn out to plough and till the field which have lie fallow while the turkish scourge of war be on the land and the people show that now they have the security of british protection they intend at once to resume they industry the troops have the liveliest welcome in pass through village though the people be not as a rule demonstrative and one could point to no better evidence of the exemplary behavior of we soldier than the group of woman sit and gossip round the well during the process of draw water just as they do in biblical day heedless of the pass troops whom they regard as they protector the man behind a rude plough may have stop he ill-matched team of pony and donkey to look at a column of troops move as he have never see troops march before a head of a family might collect the animal carry he household goods and hurry they off the line of route take by military transport but neither one nor the other have any fear of interference with he work and the life of the whole country one of the most unchanging region of the world have suddenly again become normal although only yesterday two army have dispute possession of the very soil on which they stand the moment we be victorious old occupation be resume by the people in the way that be a tradition from they forefather we victory mean peace and safety accord to the native idea and a end to extortion oppression and pillage under the name of requisition it also mean prosperity the native likes to drive a bargain he will not sell under a fair price and he ask much more in the hope of show a buyer who have beat he down how cheaply he be get goods the army chiefly seek egg which be light to carry and easy to cook and give variety to the daily round of bully biscuit and jam the soldier be a generous fellow and if a child ask a piastre -lrb- 2-1\/2 d -rrb- for a egg he get it the price soon become four to five for a shilling in cash though the turk want five time that number for a equivalent sum in depreciate paper currency the law of supply and demand obtain in this old world just as at home and it become sufficient for a soldier to ask for a article to show he want it and would pay almost anything that be demand it be curious to see how the news spread not merely among trader but also among villager the man who first occupy a place find orange vegetable fresh bread and egg cheap in ramleh for example a market be open for we troops immediately they get to the town and the goods be sound and sell at fair rate the next day price be up and the standard fix behind the front soon rule at the line itself there be no real control attempt and while the extortionate price charge by jew in they excellent agricultural colony and by the native make a poor people prosperous it give they a exaggerated idea of the size of the british purse and they may be disappoint at the limitation of we spending power in the future also it be hard on the bravest and most chivalrous of fight man but it open the eye of the native whose happiness and contentment be obvious directly we reach he door we movement on November 9 be limit by the extent to which general chauvel be able to use he cavalry of the desert mount corps water be the sole but absolute handicap the yeomanry mount division rejoin the corps on that day and get south of huj but could not proceed further through lack of water and supply difficulty the australian mount division also have to halt for water and it be leave to anzac mount division plus the 7th mount brigade to march eighteen mile north-westwards to occupy the line et tineh-beit duras-jemameh-esdud -lrb- the ashdod of the bible -rrb- the 52nd division occupy the area esdud-mejdel-herbieh by the evening of the 10th and on the way australian cavalry be hold up on a ridge north of beit dura the 157th brigade make another of its fine bayonet charge at night and capture the ground enable the cavalry to get at some precious water the brigade make the attack just after complete a fourteen mile ' march in heavy go achieve the remarkable record of have have three bayonet battle on three night out of four on this occasion the turk again suffer heavy casualty in man and lose many machine gun the 75th division prolong the infantry line through gharbiyeh to berberah the 54th division be in the gaza defence with all its transport allot to the division take part in the forward move but as the 54th have five day ' ration in dump close at hand it be able to maintain itself and the railway be be push on from the wadi ghuzze with the utmost speed the iron road in war be a army 's jugular vein and each mile add to its length be of enormous value during the advance general allenby look well ahead and realize the possibility open out by he complete success in every phase of the operation on the turk ' main defensive line on the 10th November order the 52nd and 75th division to concentrate on they advanced guard so as to support the cavalry on they front and to prevent the turk consolidate on the line of the wadi sukereir the enemy be develop a more organised resistance on a crescent-shaped line from et tineh through yasur to beshshit and it be necessary to adopt deliberate method of attack to move he the advance on the 11th be the preliminary to three day of stir fight the turk put up a very strong defense by they rearguard and when one say that at this time they be fight with courage and magnificent determination one be not only pay a just tribute to the enemy but do justice to the gallantry and skill of the troops who defeat he the scot can claim a large share of the success of the next two day but british yeomanry take a great part in it and they charge at mughar and perhaps they charge at abu shushe as well will find a place in military text-book for it have confound those critic who declare that the development of the machine gun in modern warfare have bring the use of cavalry down to very narrow limit the 156th brigade be direct to take burkah on the 12th so as to give the infantry liberty of maneuver on the follow day burkah be a nasty place to tackle the enemy have two line of beautifully site trench prepare before he fall back from gaza the scot have to attack up a slope to the first line and have take this to pass down another slope for 1000 yard before reach the glaci in front of the second line the scottish rifle assault this position by day without much artillery support but they take it in magnificent style it look as if the turk have accept the verdict but at night they return to a brown hill on the right and drive the 4th royal scot from it this battalion come back soon afterwards and retake the hill with the assistance of some gurkha of general colston 's 233rd infantry brigade and the turk retire to another spot hope that he luck would change while this fighting be go on about burkah the 155th brigade go ahead up a road which the cavalry say be strongly hold they get eight mile north of esdud and be in advance of the cavalry intend to try to secure the two height and village of katrah and mughar on the follow day katrah be a village on a long mound south of mughar native mud hut constitute its southern part whilst separate from it on the northern side by some garden be a pretty little jewish settlement whose red-tiled house and orderly well-cared-for orchard speak of the industry of these settler in zion all over the hill right up to the house the cactus flourish and the hedge be a replica of the terrible obstacle at gaza from katrah the ground slope down to the flat on all four side so that the village seem to stand on a island in the plain a mile due west of it be beshshit while one mile to the north across more than one wadi stand el mughar at the southern end of a irregular line of hill which separate yebnah and akir which will be more readily recognize the former as the jamnium of the jew and the latter as ekron one of the famous philistine city while the 75th division be force back the line turmus-kustineh-yasur and mesmiyeh athwart the road to junction station the 155th brigade attack katrah the whole of the artillery of two division open a bombardment of the line at eight o'clock but the turk show more willingness to concede ground on the east than at katrah where the machine-gun fire be exceptionally heavy general pollak m ` call decide to assault the village with the bulk of he brigade and seize a rifle and bayonet from a wounded man lead the charge himself take the village and gradually clear the enemy out of the cactus-enclosed garden the enemy loss at katrah be very heavy in cross a rectangular field many turk be catch in a cross fire from we machine gun and over 400 dead be count in this one field chapter xi two yeomanry charge in front of the mud hut of mughar so closely pack together on the southern slope of the hill that the dwelling at the bottom seem to keep the upper house from fall into the plain there be a long oval garden with a clump of cypress in the center the whole surround by cactus hedge of great age and strength in the cypress be a nest of machine gun whose crew have a perfect view of a advance from katrah the infantry have to advance over flat open ground to the edge of the garden the turkish machine-gunner and rifleman in the garden and village be support by artillery firing from behind the ridge at the back of the village and although the brigade make repeat effort to get on its advance be hold up in the early afternoon and it seem impossible to take the place by infantry from the south in the clear light of a November afternoon the 6th mount brigade command by brigadier-general cac godwin dso compose of the 1\/1st buck hussar 1\/1st berkshire yeomanry and 1\/1st dorset yeomanry the berkshire battery royal horse artillery and the 17th machine gun squadron -- old campaigner with the egyptian expeditionary force -- have work round to the left of the lowlander and have reach a point about two mile south-west of yebnah that place have be occupy by the 8th mount brigade compose of the 1\/1st city of london yeomanry 1\/1st county of london yeomanry and the 1\/3rd county of london yeomanry at half-past twelve

of yebnah and join the wadi rubin one squadron of the buck hussar have enter yebnah from the east co-operating with the 8th brigade general godwin be tell over the telephone that the infantry attack be hold up and that he brigade would advance to take mughar this order be confirm by telegram a quarter of a hour later as the brigadier be about to reconnoitre a line of approach the berk battery begin shell mughar and the ridge behind the village from a position half a mile north of beshshit screen by some tree brigade headquarters join the buck hussar headquarters in the wadi janus half a mile south-east of yebnah where lieut-colonel the hon f cripps command the buck hussar have with splendid judgment already commence a valuable reconnaissance the dorset and berk yeomanry be halt in a depression out of sight a few hundred yard behind the turk have the best possible observation and know they be hold up the infantry concentrate they attention upon the cavalry therein they show good judgment for it be from the mount troops the heavy blow be to fall lieut perkin buck hussar be send forward to reconnoitre the wadi shellal el ghor which run parallel to and east of the wadi janus he become the target of every kind of fire gun machine gun and rifle open on he from the ridge whenever he expose himself captain patron of the 17th machine gun squadron be similarly treat while examine a position from which to cover the advance of the brigade with concentrated machine-gun fire it be not a easy thing to get cavalry into position for a mount attack except in the wadi the plain between yebnah and mughar offer no cover and be within easy range of the enemy 's gun the wadi janus be a deep slit in the ground with side of clay fall almost sheer to the stony bottom it be hard to get horse into the wadi and equally troublesome to get they to bank again and the wadi in most place be so narrow that horse could only move in single file the dorset be bring up in small party to join the buck in the wadi and they have to run the gauntlet of shell and rifle fire the berk be to enter the wadi immediately the buck have leave it behind mughar village and its garden the ground fall sharply then rise again and form a rocky hill some 300 yard long there be another decline and north of it a conical shaped hill also stony and barren though before the crest be reach there be some undulating ground which would have afford a little cover if the cunning turk have not post machine gun on it the dorset yeomanry be order to attack this latter hill and the buck hussar the ridge between it and mughar village the berk yeomanry to be keep in support there seem to be no reason for doubt that mughar would not have be capture that day but for the extremely brilliant charge of these home county yeomen the 155th brigade be still hold fast in that part of the wadi janus which give cover south-west and south of mughar and after the charge have be completely successful and the yeomanry be work forward to clear up the village a message be receive -- time 245 pm but receive at 4 pm -- which show the difficulty face that very gallant infantry brigade : ' 52nd division unable to make progress co-operate and turn mughar from the north ' it be a hot bright afternoon the disposition have be make the buck hussar and dorset yeomanry get out of the wadi and commence they mount attack the berk battery in the meantime have register on certain point the buck hussar in column of squadron extend to four yard interval advance at a trot from the wadi which be 3000 yard distant from the ridge which be they objective two machine gun be attach to the buck and two to the dorset and the other gun under captain patron be mount in a position which that officer have choose in the wadi el ghor from which they could bring to bear a heavy fire almost up to the moment the buck should be on the ridge this machine-gun fire be of the highest value and it unquestionably keep many turkish rifleman inactive ` b ' squadron under captain bulteel mc be lead and when 1000 yard from the objective the order be give to gallop and horse sweep over the last portion of the plain and up the hill at a terrific pace the thunder hoof raise cloud of dust the tap-tap of machine gun firing at the highest pressure intense rifle fire from all part of the enemy position the fierce storm of shell rain on the hill by the berk battery which during the charge fire with splendid accuracy no fewer than 200 round of shrapnel at a range of 3200 to 3500 yard and the rapid fire of turkish field gun completely drown the cheer of the charge yeoman ` c ' squadron command by lord bosebery 's son captain the hon neil primrose mc who be kill on the follow day make a equally dashing charge and come up on the right of ` b ' squadron once the cavalry have reach the crest of the hill many of the turk surrender and throw down they arm but some retire and then have discover the weakness of the cavalry return to some rock on the flank and continue the fight at close range captain primrose 's squadron be vigorously attack on he left flank but captain bulteel be able to get over the ridge and across the rough steep eastern side of it and from this point he utilise capture turkish machine gun to put down a heavy barrage on to the northern end of the village ` a ' squadron under captain lawson then come up from yebnah at the gallop and with he support the whole of the buck ' objective be secure and consolidate the dorset yeomanry on the left of the buck have 1000 yard farther to go and the country they traverse be just as crack and break they horse at the finish be quite exhaust at the base of the hill captain dammer dismount ` a ' squadron which charge on the left and the squadron fight they way to the top of the ridge on foot the hold horse be catch in a cone of machine-gun fire and in a space of about fifty square yard many gallant charger perish ` b ' squadron -lrb- major wingfield-digby -rrb- in the center and ` c ' squadron -lrb- major gordon mc -rrb- on the right lead by colonel sir randolf baker mp form line and gallop the hill and they horse loss be considerably less than those of the dismount squadron the berk yeomanry move to the wadi el ghor under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from the village and garden on the west side and two squadron be dismount and send into the village to clear it the remain squadron ride into the plain on the eastern side of the ridge where they collect a number of straggler dot over this plain be many dead turk who fall under the fire of the machine-gun squadron while attempt to get to ramleh the turkish dead be numerous and they condition show how thoroughly the sword have do its work i see many head cleft in twain and mughar be not a sweet place to look upon and want a good deal of clear up the yeomanry take 18 officer and 1078 other rank prisoner whilst fourteen machine gun and two field gun be capture but for the tired state of the horse many more prisoner would have be take large number be see make they way along the red sand track to ramleh and a inspection of the route on the morrow tell of the pace of the retirement bring about by the shock of contact with cavalry machine gun belt and box of ammunition equipment of all kind be strew about the path and not a few wounded turk have give up the effort to escape and have lie down to die the casualty in the 6th mount brigade be 1 officer kill and 6 wound 15 other rank kill and 107 wound and 1 miss a remarkably small total among the mortally wound be major de rothschild who fall within sight of some of the jewish colony which he family have found two hundred and sixty-five horse and two mule be kill and wound in the action mughar be a great cavalry triumph and the regiment which take part in it confirm the good opinion form of they in this theater of war the dorset have already make a spirited charge against the senussus in the western desert in 1916 -lrb- 1 -rrb- and have suffer from the white arm once those misguided arab never give the cavalry another chance of get near they the buck and berk too have take part in that swift and satisfactory campaign all three regiment on the follow day be to make another charge this time on one of the most famous site in the battle history of palestine the 6th mount brigade move no farther on the day of mughar because the 22nd mount brigade when commence a attack on akir the old philistine city of ekron be counter-attack on they leave during the night however the turk in akir probably hear the full story of mughar and do not wait long for a similar action against they the 22nd mount brigade drive they out early next morning and they go rapidly away across the railway at naaneh leave in we hand the railway guard of seventy man and seek the bold crest of abu shushe they move as i shall presently tell out of the frying-pan into the fire -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the desert campaign _ : constable -rrb- the 155th infantry which help to finish up the mughar business take a gun and fourteen machine gun then with the remainder of the 52nd division it have a few hour of hard-earned rest the division have have a severe time but the man bear they trial with the fortitude of they race and with a spirit which could not be beat for several day when water be hold up the cavalry the lowlander keep ahead of the mount troops and one battalion fight and march sixty-nine mile in seven day they training be as complete as any infantry even the regimental stretcher-bearer be teach the use of lewi gun and on more than one occasion the bearer go for the enemy with mill bomb till a position be capture and they be require to tend the wound a stokes-gun crew find they weapon very useful in open warfare and at one place where machine gun have get on to a large party of turk and enclose they in a box barrage the stoke gun search every corner of the area and finish the whole party the loss inflict by the scot be exceptionally severe farther eastward on the 13th the 75th division have also be give of its best the objective of this division be the important junction station on the turk ' jaffa-jerusalem railway and a big step forward be make in the early afternoon by the overcome of a stubborn resistance at mesmiyeh troops rush the village from the south and capture 292 prisoner and 7 machine gun the 234th brigade begin a advance on junction station during the night but be strongly counter-attacked and have to halt till the morning when at dawn they secure the best position on the rolling downs west of the station and by 730 the station itself be occupy two engine and 45 vehicle be find intact two large gun on truck and over 100 prisoner be also take the enemy shell the station during the morning try in vain to damage he lose roll stock this booty be of immense value to we and to a large extent it solve the transport problem which at this moment be a very anxious one indeed the line be metre gauge and we have no stock to fit it though later the egyptian state railway bring down some engine and truck from the luxor-assouan section but this welcome aid be not available till after the rain have begin and have make lorry traffic temporarily impossible between we standard gauge railhead and we fight front junction station be no sooner occupied than a light-railway staff under colonel o'brien be bring up from beit hanun the whole of the line to deir sineid be not in run order but broken culvert be give minor repair attention be bestow on truck and the engine be closely examine while the turk be shell the station the water tank have be destroy as a result of which two man spend hour in fill up the engine by means of a water jug and basin find in the station building and the turk have the mortification of see these engine steam out of the station during the morning to a cutting which be effective cover from they field-gun fire the light-railway staff be highly delighted at they success and the train which they soon have run over they little system be indeed a boon and a blessing to the fight man and horse on this morning of November 14 the infantry be operate with desert mount corps ' troops on both they wing the australian mount division be on the right fighting vigorous action with the enemy rearguard secrete in the irregular rocky foothill of the shephelah which stand as rampart to the judean mountain it be a difficult task to drive the turk out of these fastness and while they hold on to they it be almost impossible to outflank some of the place like et tineh a railway station and camp of some importance on the line to beersheba they have already have some stiff fighting at tel el safi the limestone hill which be the white guard of the crusader the division suffer severely from want of water particularly the 5th mount brigade and it be necessary to transfer to it the 7th mount brigade and the 2nd australian light horse brigade on the left of the infantry the yeomanry mount division be move forward from akir and mansura and after the 22nd mount brigade have take naaneh they detail a demolition party to blow up one mile of railway so that even if the 75th division have not take junction station jerusalem would have be entirely cut off from railway communication with the turkish base at tul keram and haifa and damascus between naaneh and mansura the 6th mount brigade be prepare for another dash charge the enemy who have be oppose we for two day consist of remnant of two division of both the turkish viith and viiith army bring together and hurriedly reorganise the victory at mughar have almost if not quite split the force in two that be to say that portion of the line which have be give the duty of hold mughar have be so weaken by heavy casualty and the loss of moral consequent upon the shock of the cavalry charge that it have fall back to ramleh and ludd and be incapable of further serious resistance there be still a strong and virile force on the seaside though that be adequately deal with but the center be very weak and the enemy 's only chance of prevent the mount troops from work through and round he right center be to fall back on abu shushe and tel jezar to cover latron with its good water supply and the main metalled road where it enter the hill on the way to jerusalem the loss of tel jezar mean that we could get to latron and the vale of ajalon and the action of the 6th mount brigade on the morning of the 14th give it to we the berk yeomanry have have outpost on the railway south-east of naaneh since before dawn they have see the position the previous day and at dawn send forward a squadron dismount to engage the machine gun post in the walled-in house at the north of the village from the railway to the abu shushe ridge be about three mile of up and down country with two or three rise of sufficient height to afford some cover to advance cavalry general godwin arrange that six machine gun should go forward to give cover fire and support by the berk battery rha from a good position half a mile west of the railway the buck hussar be to deliver a mount attack against the hill with the assistance on they left of two squadron of berk yeomanry the dorset yeomanry be move up to the red hill of melat into support at seven o'clock the attack start the 22nd mount brigade operating on foot on the leave the buck hussar take advantage of all the dead ground gallop about a mile and a half until they come to a dip behind a gently rise mound when it be clear that the enemy hold the whole ridge in strength colonel cripp signal to brigade headquarters at melat for support the dorset yeomanry move out to the right of the buck and the latter then charge the hill a little south of the village and capture it it be a fine effort the side of the hill be steep with shelf of rock and the crest be a mass of stone and boulder while from some cave one or two of they quite big place the turk have machine gun in action when the buck be charge there be a good deal of machine-gun fire from the right but the dorset deal with this very speedily assist by the berk battery which have also move forward to a near position from which they could command the ridge in flank a hostile counter-attack develop against the dorset but this be crush by the berk battery and some of the 52nd division 's gun two squadron of the berk yeomanry in the meantime have charge on the left of the buck and secure the hill immediately to the south-east of abu shushe village and at nine o'clock the whole of this strong position be in we hand the brigade have sustain the extremely slight casualty of three officer and thirty-four other rank kill and wound so small a cost of life be a wonderful tribute to good and dashing leading and furnished another example of cavalry 's power when move rapidly in extended formation to the infinite regret of the brigade indeed of the whole of general allenby 's army one of the officer kill that day be the hon neil primrose a intrepid leader who leave the comfort and safety of a ministerial appointment answer the call of duty to be with he squadron of the buck hussar he be a fine soldier and a favorite among he man and he die as a good cavalryman would wish shoot through the head when lead he squadron in a glorious charge he body rest in the garden of the french convent at ramleh not far from the spot where humbler soldier take they long repose and these grave within visual range of the tomb of st george we patron saint will stand as memorial of those briton who forsake ease to obey the stern call of duty to they race and country the overwhelming nature of this victory be illustrate by a comparison of the loss on the two side whereas ours be 37 all tell we count between 400 and 500 dead turk on the field and the enemy leave with we 360 prisoner and some material the extraordinary disparity between the loss can only be account for first by the care take to lead the cavalry along every depression in the ground and secondly by rapidity of movement the cavalry be confront by considerable shell fire and the volume of machine-gun fire be heavy though it be keep down a good deal by the cover fire of the 17th machine gun squadron i have refer to the importance of jezar as dominate the approach to latron on the north-east and ramleh on the north-west jezar as we call it on we map have be a stronghold since man of all race and creed color and white pagan mahomedan jew and christian fight in palestine it be a spot which many a great leader of legion have covet and to its military history we home county yeoman have add another brilliant page let I quote the description of jezar from george adam smith 's _ historical geography of the holy land _ a book of fascinating interest to all student of the sacred history which many of the soldier in general allenby 's army read with great profit to themselves : ` one point in the northern shephelah round which these tide of war have sweep deserve special notice -- gezer or gazar it be one of the few remarkable bastion which the shephelah fling out to the west -- on a ridge run towards ramleh the most prominent object in view of the traveller from jaffa towards jerusalem it be high and isolate but fertile and well water -- a very strong post and striking landmark its name occur in the egyptian correspondence of the fourteenth century where it be describe as be take from the egyptian vassal by the tribe whose invasion so agitate that correspondence a city of the canaanite under a king of its own -- horam -- gezer be not give as one of joshua 's conquest though the king be but the israelite drave not out the canaanite who dwell at gezer and in the hand of these it remain till its conquest by egypt when pharaoh give it with he daughter to solomon and solomon rebuilt it juda maccabeus be strategist enough to gird himself early to the capture of gezer and simon fortify it to cover the way to the harbor of joppa and cause john he son the captain of the host to dwell there it be virtually therefore the key of judea at a time when judea 's foe come down the coast from the north and with joppa it form part of the syrian demand upon the jew but this be by no mean the last of it m clermont ganneau who a number of year ago discover the site have lately identify gezer with the mont gisart of the crusade mont gisart be a castle and feif in the county of joppa with a abbey of st katharine of mont gisart whose prior be one of the five suffragan of the bishop of lydda it be the scene on the 24th November 1174 seventeen year before the third crusade of a victory win by a small army from jerusalem under the boy-king the leper baldwin iv against a very much larger army under saladin himself and in 1192 saladin encamp upon it during he negotiation for a truce with richard ` shade of king horam what host of man have fall round that citadel of yours on what camp and column have it look down through the century since first you see the strange hebrew burst with the sunrise across the hill and chase you countryman down ajalon -- that day when the victor feel the very sun conspire with they to achieve the unexampled length of battle within sight of every egyptian and every assyrian invasion of the land gezer have also see alexander pass by and the legion of rome in unusual flight and the army of the cross struggle waver and give way and napoleon come and go if all could rise who have fall around its base -- ethiopian hebrew assyrian arab turcoman greek roman celt saxon mongol -- what a rehearsal of the judgment day it would be few of the traveller who now rush across the plain realize that the first conspicuous hill they pass in palestine be also one of the most thickly haunt -- even in that narrow land into which history have so crowded itself but upon the ridge of gezer no sign of all this now remain except in the tel jezer and in a sweet hollow to the north beside a fountain where lie the scatter christian stone of deir warda the convent of the rose ` up none of the other valley of the shephelah have history surge as up and down ajalon and past gezer for none be so open to the north nor present so easy a passage to jerusalem ' chapter xii look towards jerusalem the anzac mount division have only the 1st australian light horse and the new zealand mount rifle brigade operate with it on the 14th the australian by the evening be in the thick olive grove on the south of ramleh and on the ridge about surafend on they leave the turk be violently oppose the new zealander who be work along the sand-dune with the port and town of jaffa as they ultimate objective there be one very fierce struggle in the course of the day a force attack a new zealand regiment in great strength and for the moment secure the advantage but the regiment get to grip with the enemy with hand-grenade and bayonet and so completely repulse they that they flee in hopeless disorder leave many dead and wound behind they it be unfortunate that there be no mobile reserve available for pursuit as the turk be in such a plight that a large number would have be round up general cox 's brigade seize ramleh on the morning of the 15th take ninety prisoner and then advance and capture ludd be careful that no harm should come to the building which hold the grave of st george in ludd 360 prisoner be take and the brigade carry out a good deal of demolition work on the railway run north the new zealander make jaffa by noon on the 16th the turk evacuate the town during the morning without make any attempt to destroy it though there be one gross piece of vandalism in a christian cemetery where monument and tombstone have be throw down and break in the meantime in order to protect the rear of the infantry five battalion of the 52nd division with three battery be station at yebnah mughar and akir until they could be relieve by unit of the 54th division advance from gaza to enable the 54th to move the transport lend to the 52nd and 75th division have to be return which do not make the supply of those division any easier the main line of railway be still a long way in the rear and the landing of store by the navy at the mouth of the wadi sukereir have not yet begin a little later and before jaffa have be make secure enough for the use of ship many thousand of ton of supplies and ammunition be put ashore at the wadi 's mouth and at a time when heavy rain damage the newly construct railway track the sukereir base of supply be a inestimable boon yet there be time when the infantry have a bare day 's supply with they though they have they iron ration to fall back upon it speak well for the supply branch that in the long forward move of xxist corps the infantry be never once put on short ration while the 54th be come up to take over from the 52nd plan be prepare for the further advance on jerusalem the commander-in-chief be deeply anxious that there should be no fighting of any description near the holy place and he give the turk a chance of be chivalrous and of accept the inevitable we have get so far that the ancient route take by army which have capture jerusalem be just before we the turkish force be disorganise by heavy and repeated defeat the man demoralise and not in good condition and there be no hope for they that they could receive sufficient reinforcement to enable they to stave off the ultimate capture of bethlehem and jerusalem though as event prove they could still put up a stout defense we know from papers take from the enemy that the turk believe general allenby intend to go right up the plain to get to the defile lead to messudieh and nablus and thus threaten the hedjaz railway in which case the position of the enemy in the holy city would be hopeless and the turk form a assault group of three infantry division in the neighborhood of tul keram to prevent this and continue to hold on to jerusalem general allenby propose to strike through the hill to the north-east to try to get across the jerusalem-nablus road about bireh -lrb- the ancient beeroth -rrb- and in this operation success would have enable he to cut off the enemy force in and about the holy city when they only line of retreat would have be through jericho and the east of the jordan the turk decide to oppose this plan and to make we fight for jerusalem that be disappointing but in the end it could not have suit we better for it show to we own people and to the world how after the turk have decline a opportunity of show a desire to preserve the holy place from attack -- a opportunity prompt by we strength not by any fear that victory could not be win -- general allenby be still able to achieve he great objective without a drop of blood be spill near any of the holy site and without so much as a stray rifle bullet sear any of they wall that indeed be the triumph of military practice and when jerusalem fall for the twenty-third time and thus for the first time pass into the hand of british soldier the whole force feel that the sacrifice which have be make on the gaunt forbid hill to the north-west be worth the price and that the grave of englishman scot and colonial of gurkha punjabus and sikh be monument to the honor of british arm the scheme be that the 75th division would advance along the main jerusalem road which cut into the hill about three mile east of latron and occupy kuryet el enab and that the lowland division should go through ludd strike eastward and advance to beit likium to turn from the north the hill through which the road pass the yeomanry mount division on the left flank of the 52nd division to press on to bireh on the nablus road about a dozen mile north of jerusalem a brief survey of the country to be attack would convince even a civilian of the extreme difficulty of the undertaking north and east of latron -lrb- which be not yet ours -rrb- frown the hill which constitute this important section of the judean range the backbone of palestine the hill be steep and high separated one from another by narrow valley clothe here and there with fir and olive tree but elsewhere a mass of rock and boulder bare and inhospitable practically every hill command another there be only one road -- the main one -- and this about three mile east of latron pass up a narrow defile with rugged mountain on either side there be a old roman road to the north but unused for century it be now a road only in name the very trace of it be lose in many place in this strong country man fight of old and the defender not infrequently hold they own against odds it be pre-eminently suitable for defense and if the warrior of the past find that flint-tipped shaft of wood would keep the invader at bay how much more easily could a modern army equip with rifle of precision and machine gun adapt nature to its advantage it will always be a marvel to I how in a country where one machine gun in defense could hold up a battalion we make such rapid progress and how have get so deep into the range it be possible for we to feed we front we have no luck with the weather in advance over the plain the troops have suffer from the abnormal heat and many of the well have be destroy or damage by the retreat enemy in the hill the troops have to endure heavy rain and piercingly cold wind with mud a foot deep on the road and the earth so slippery on the hill that only donkey transport be serviceable yet despite all adverse circumstance the infantry and yeomanry press on and if they do not secure all objective they dash resource and magnificent determination at least pave the way for ultimate triumph to the trial of hard fighting and march on field ration the wet add a severe test of physical endurance the troops be in enemy country where they scrupulously avoid every native village and no wall or roof stand to shelter they from wind or water the heat of the first two week of November change with a most undesirable suddenness and though the day continue agreeably warm on the plain into December the night become chilly and then desperately cold the single blanket carry in the pack -- most of the infantry on the march have no blanket at all -- do not give sufficient warmth to man whose blood have be thin by long month of work under a pitiless eastern sun and lucky be the soldier who secure even break sleep in the early morning hour of that fight march across the northern part of the maritime plain the general with one eye on the enemy and the other on the weather must have be dismay in the third week of November at the gathering storm cloud which in burst flood the plain with rain unusually heavy for this period of the year the surface be a very light cotton soil several foot deep when baked by summer sun it have a crack hard crust give a firm foothold for man and horse and yield only slightly to the wheel of light car even laden lorry make easy track over the country the lorry generally keep off the ill-made unrolled turkish road which have be construct for winter use and except for slight deviation to avoid wadi and gully cut by nature to carry off surplus water the supply column could move in almost as direct a course as the fly man when the heaven open all this be alter the first storm turn the top into a slippery greasy mass in a hour or two the rain soak down into the light earth and any lorry driver pull out of the line to avoid a skid vehicle ahead have the almost certainty of find he car and load come to a full stop with the wheel hold fast axle deep in the soft soil a hour 's hard digging the fix of plank beneath the wheel and a tow cable from another lorry sometimes get the machine on to the pressed-down track again and enable it to move ahead for a few mile but many be the supply vehicle that have to wait for a couple of sunny day to dry a path for they my own experience of the first of the winter rain be so like that of other in the force who move on wheel that i may give some idea of the condition by recount it we have take ludd and ramleh and guide by the ruin tower of the church of the forty martyr i have follow in the cavalry 's wake i dally on the way back to see if akir present to the latter-day crusader any sign of its former strength when it stand as the philistine stronghold of ekron near where the old city have be the ghastly sight of turk cut down by yeomanry during a hot pursuit offend the sens of sight and smell and when you see native move towards they village at a rate somewhat in excess of they customary shuffling gait you be almost lead to think that they superstitious fear be drive they home before sundown lest darkness should raise the ghost of the turkish dead a few of the jewish settler whose industry have improve the landscape be leave the field and orchard they tend so well though there be still more than a hour of daylight and they task be not yet do they be weatherwise they could have be deaf to the rumbling in the south and still have notice the come of the storm i be some forty mile from the spot at which my despatch could be censor and pass over land wire and cable to london when a vivid lightning flash warn I that the element be in forbid mood and that i have misread the obvious signal of the native ' homeward movement the map show a path from akir through mansura towards junction station from which the so-called turkish road run south in the gathering gloom my driver pick up wheel track through a olive orchard and cross a nullah find the mark of a ford car 's wheel on the other side the rain fall heavily and soon obliterate all sign of a car 's progress and with darkness come on there be a prospect of a shiver night with a wet skin in the open a australian doctor go up to he regiment at grip with the turk tell I that he have no doubt we be on the right road for he have be give a line through mansura which must be the farmhouse ahead of we these australian have a keen nose for country and you have a sense of security in follow they the doctor 's horse be slip in the mud but my car make even worse go it skid to right and left and only by the skill and coolness of my driver be i save a duck in a narrow wadi now full of storm water after much low-gear work we pull up a slight rise and see ahead of we one or two little fire under the lee of a dilapidated wall some scottish infantry be brew tea and make the most of a slight shelter it be mansura and if we bear to the right and keep the track beat down by lorry across a field we might by the favor of fortune reach junction station during the night the scot have arrange a bivouac in that field before it become sodden they know how bad it have get and a native instinct to be hospitable prompt a invitation to share the fire for the night however london be wait for news and i decide to press on the road could not be worse than the sea of mud in which i be flounder and it might be better we turn right-handed and after a struggle come up against three lorry driver hopelessly maroon they have turn in up a greasy bank we come to a stop and slide back we try again and fail i relieve the car of my weight and make a effort to push it from behind but my foot hold fast in the mud and the car cannon into I when it skid downhill ` better give it up till the morning ' say a mt driver whose sleep be disturb by the running of we engine ` can not who have you get there eh oh very well here jim give they a hand or we 'll have no sleep to-night ' -- or word to that effect three of the lorry man and the engine get we on the move and before they take mud back with they to the dry interior of the lorry they hope they say that we would reach ghq but declare that it be hopeless to try before get much farther a light wave ahead of we tell of some one hold up i walk on and find general butler the chief of the army veterinary service with the force unable to move a inch the effort of two driver fail to locate the trouble and everything removable be take off the general 's car and put into ours and with the heavier load we start off again for junction station this be not difficult to pick up for there be many flare burn to enable work party to repair engine roll stock and permanent way we get on to the road ultimately carry more mud on we foot than i imagine human leg could lift leave a driver and all spare gear at the station we thrash we way along a road metal with a soft friable limestone which have be cut into by the iron-shod wheel of german lorry until the rut be fully a foot deep and the soft earth foundation be ooze through to the surface it be desperately hard to steer a course on this treacherous highway and a number of lorry we pass have go temporarily out of action in ditch the german with the turk have blow up most of the culvert and the road bridge which have be destroy have only be lightly repair with plank and trestle no safety rail be in position to negotiate these dangerous path in the dark the driver have to put on all possible speed and make a dash for it and he usually get to the other side before a skid become serious most of the lorry driver put out no light because they think no car would be able to move on such a night and we have several narrow escape of finish we career on a half-sunken supply motor vehicle reinforcement for infantry battalion move up the road as we come down it they be go to the front to take the place of casualty for weather and mud be not consider when bayonet be want in the line so the stolid british infantryman splash and slip he way towards the enemy and he would probably have be sleep that night if there have not be a risk of he drown in the mud the camel transport corps fight the element with a courage which deserve better luck the camel dislike many thing and be afraid of some but if he be capable of think at all he regard mud as he greatest enemy he can not stand up in it and if he slip he have not a understanding capable of realize that if all he foot do not go the same way he must spread-eagle and split up this be what often happen but if by good luck a camel should go down sideways he seem quite content to stay there and he be so refractory that he prefer to die rather than help himself to he foot again on this wild night i have a good opportunity of see white officer encourage the egyptian boy in the camel transport corps at juli the roadway pass through the village there be a ambulance column in difficulty in the village and while some car be be extricate a camel supply column come up in the opposite direction the camel like neither the headlight nor the run engine and these have to be make dark and silent before they would pass the water be run over the roadway several inch deep carry with it a mass of garbage and filth which only arab villager would tolerate officer and gyppy coax and wheedle the stubborn beast through juli but outside the place the animal raise a chorus of protest and go down they hold I up for a hour or more and though officer and boy do they utmost to get they go again it be a fruitless effort and the poor beast be off-load where they lay that night of rain and thunder wind and cold be bad alike for man and beast but beyond a flippant remark of some soldier do he best and the curious chant of the gyppy ' chorus you hear nothing tommy could not trust himself to talk about the weather it be too bad for word for even the strongest it take we car ten hour to run forty mile and as the last ten mile be over wet sand and on rabbit wire stretch across the sand where the car could do fifteen mile a hour we have average something under three mile a hour through the mud wet through cold with a face render painful to the touch by driven rain i reach my tent with a feeling of thankfulness for myself and deep sympathy for the ten of thousand of brave boy endure intense discomfort and fatigue couple with the fear of short ration for the next day or two the man in the hill which they be just enter have a worse time than those in the waterlogged plain but no storm could damp they enthusiasm they be beat you enemy and mine and they be face a goal which britain have never yet win jerusalem the golden be before they and the honor and glory of win it from the turk be a prize to attain which no sacrifice be too great those who do not say so behave in a way to show that they feel it they be very gallant perfect knight these soldier of the king chapter xiii into the judean hill when the 52nd division be move out of ludd on the 19th November the 75th division be fight hard about latron where the turk hold the monastery and its beautiful garden and the hill about amwa until late in the morning have drive they out the 75th push on to gain the pass into the hill and to begin two day of fight which earn the unstinted praise of general bulfin who witness it for nearly three mile from latron the road pass through a flat valley flank by hill till it reach a guardhouse and khan at the foot of the pass which then rise rapidly to sari the difference in elevation in less than four mile be 1400 foot close to the guardhouse begin the hill which tower above the road the turk have construct defence on these hill and hold they with rifleman and machine gun so that these position dominate all approach we gun have few position from which to assist the infantry but they do sterling service wherever possible in general palin the division have a commander with wide experience of hill fighting on the indian frontier and he bring that experience to bear in a way which must have dumb-found the enemy frontal attack be impossible and suicidal and each position have to be turn by a wide movement start a long way in rear all unit in the division do well the gurkha particularly well and by a continual encircle of they flank the turk be compel to leave they fastness and fall back to new hill crest thus outwit and outmatch the enemy retreat to sari a high hill with a commanding view of the pass for half a mile the hill be cover with olive tree and have a village on its eastern slope and as the road wind at its foot and then take a left-handed turn to kuryet el enab its value for defense be considerable the turk have take advantage of the cover to place a large body of defender with machine gun on the hill but with every condition unfavourable to we the 75th division have route out the enemy before three o'clock and be ready to move forward as soon as the gun could get up the pass rain be fall heavily the road surface be clinging and treacherous and worse still the road have be blow up in several place the gun could not advance to be of service that day and the infantry have therefore to remain where they be for the night there be a good deal of snipe but nature be more unkind than the enemy who receive more than he give the troops be wear light summer clothing drill shorts and tunic and the sudden change from the heat and dryness of the plain to bitter cold and wet be a desperate trial especially to the indian unit who have little sleep that night they need rest to prepare they for the rigor of the succeed day a drenching rain turn the whole face of the mountain where earth cover rock into a sea of mud on the position about sari be search a number of prisoner be take among they a battalion commander man capture in the morning tell we there be six turkish battalion hold enab which be something under two mile from saris the road proceed up a rise from saris then fall slightly it pass below the crest of a ridge and again climb to the foot of a hill on which a red-roofed convent church and building stand as a landmark that can be see from jaffa on the opposite side of the road be a substantial house the summer retreat of the german consul in jerusalem whose staff trade in jordan holy water and this house now empty sheltered a divisional general from the bad weather while the operation for the capture of the holy city be in preparation i have a grateful recollection of this building for in it the military attachs and i stay before the official entry into jerusalem and its roof save we from one inclement night on the bleak hill on the 20th November the turk do they best to keep the place under german ownership the hill on which it stand be well occupy by man under cover of thick stone wall the convent garden on the opposite side of the highway be pack with turkish infantry and across the deep valley to the west be gun and rifleman on another hill all of they hold the road under the best possible observation the enemy 's howitzer put down a heavy barrage on all approach and on the reverse of the hill cover the village lie in the hollow there be machine gun and many man reconnaissance show the difficulty attend a attack and it be not until the afternoon that a plan be ready to be put into execution no weak point in the defence could be discover and just as it seem possible that a daylight attack would be hold up a thick mist roll up the valley and settle down over enab the 2\/3rd gurkha seize a welcome opportunity and as the light be fail the shrill sharp note of these gallant hillman and the deep-throated roar of the 1\/5th somerset tell that a weighty bayonet charge have get home and that the key of the enemy position have be win the man of the bold 75th go beyond enab in the dark and also out along the old roman road towards biddu to deny the turk a point from which they could see the road as it fall away from the enab ridge towards the wadi ikbalum that night many man seek the doubtful shelter of olive grove and build stone sangar to break the force of a bite wind a few as many as could be accommodate be welcome by the monk in a monastery in a fold in the hill whilst some rest and be thankful in a crypt beneath the monk ' church the oldest part of the building believe to be the work of sixth-century mason the monk have a tale of woe to tell they have be proud to have as they guest the latin patriarch in jerusalem who be a french protg and this high ecclesiastic remain at the monastery till November 17 when turkish gendarmerie carry he away the spanish consul in jerusalem lodge a vigorous protest and so the monk be tell he be support by the german commandant but to no purpose for when general allenby enter jerusalem he learn that the latin patriarch have be remove to damascus for quite a long time the monk do many kindly thing for we troops they give up the greater part of the monastery and church for use as a hospital and many a sick man be bring back to health by rest within those ancient wall some alas there be whose wound be mortal and a number lie in the monk ' secluded garden they have set up wooden cross over they and we may be certain that in that quiet sequestered spot they remains will rest in peace and will have the protection of the monk as surely as it have be give to the grave of the roman centurion which face those of we brave boy who fall on the same soil fight the same good fight while the 75th division be make they magnificent effort at enab the lowlander have breast other and equally difficult hill to the north general hill have post a strong force at beit likium and then move south-east along the route prepare by cestius gallus nearly 1900 year ago to the height of beit anan and thence east again to beit dukku on the 21st the road and ground near it be in exceedingly bad condition and the difficulty of move anything on wheel along it could hardly have be greater already the 52nd division have realize it be hopeless to get all they divisional artillery into action and only three section of artillery be bring up the horse of the gun send back to ramleh be use to double the team in the three advanced section it be heavy work too for infantry who not only have to carry the weight of mud-caked boot but be handicap by continual slip upon the rocky ground the 75th advance along the road from enab to kustul get a idea of the turkish lack of attention to the highway the main road be deep in mud and full of dangerous rut they win kustul about midday and officer who climb to the top get they first glimpse of the outskirts of jerusalem from the ruin wall of a roman castle that give its name to the little village perch on the height they do not however see much beyond the syrian colony behind the main turkish defence and the first view of jerusalem by the troops of the british army be obtain by general maclean 's brigade when they advance from biddu to nebus samwil that crowning height on which many century before richard the lion heart bury he face in he casque and exclaim : ` lord god i pray that i may never see thy holy city if so be that i may not rescue it from the hand of thine enemy ' what a fight it be for nebus samwil the turk have make it he advanced work for he main line run from el jib through bir nabalum beit iksa to lifta as strong a chain of entrenched mountain as any commander could desire general maclean 's brigade advance from biddu along the side of a ridge and up the expose steep slope of nebus samwil not all of which in the only direction he could select for a advance be terraced as it be on the turk ' side he be all the time confront by heavy artillery and rifle fire and though support by gun firing at long range from the neighborhood of enab he could not make nebus samwil in daylight round the top of the hill the turk have dig deeply into the stony earth he know the value of that hill from its crest good observation be obtain in all direction and if when we have to attack the main jerusalem defence on December 8 the summit of nebus samwil have still be in turkish hand not a movement of troops as they issue from the bed of the wadi surar and climb the rough face of the western buttress of jerusalem would have escape notice the brigade win the hill and hold it just before midnight but the battle for the crest ebb and flow for day with terrific violence we never give up possession of it though it be storm again and again by a enemy who it be fair to admit display fine courage and not a little skill that hill-top at this period have to submit to a thunderous bombardment and the mosque of nebus samwil become a battered shell here be suppose to lie the remains of the prophet samuel the tradition may or may not be well found but at any rate mahomedan and christian alike have hold the place in veneration for century the turk pay no regard to the sanctity of the mosque and as it be of military importance to he that we should not hold it he shell it daily with all he available gun utterly destroy it there may be case where the turk will deny that they damage a holy place they could not hide they guilt on nebus samwil i be at pain to examine the mosque and the immediate surroundings and the photograph i take be proof that the wreckage of this church come from artillery fire from the east and north the direction of the turkish gun-pit it be possible we be apt to be a little too sentimental about the destruction in war of a place of worship if a general have reason to think that a tower or minaret be be use as a observation post or that a church or mosque be shelter a body of troops there be those who hold that he be justified in deliberately plan its destruction but here be a sacred building with association hold in reverence by all class and creed in a land where these thing be count high and to have set about wreck it be a crime the german influence over the turk assert itself as it do in the heavy fighting after we have take jerusalem we have battery on the mount of olive and the turk search for they but they never fire one round at the kaiserin augusta victorium hospice near by that have be use as falkenhayn 's headquarters general chetwode occupy it as he corps headquarters soon after he enter jerusalem there be a wireless installation and the turk could see the come and go of the corps ' motor car i have watch operation from a summer-house in the garden and no enemy plane could pass over the building without discover the purpose to which it be put and there be spy but not one shell fall within the precinct of the hospice because it be a german building contain the statue of the kaiser and kaiserin and -lrb- oh the taste of the hun -rrb- with effigy of the kaiser and he consort paint in the roof of the chapel not far from a picture of the savior britain be rebuild what the turk destroy and there will soon arise on nebus samwil a new mosque to show mahomedan that tolerance and freedom abide under we flag when the 75th division be make the attack on nebus samwil the 52nd division put all the man they could spare on to the task of make road to be out of the firing line do not mean rest in fact as far as physical exertion go it be easier to be fight than in reserve from sunrise till dark and often later the roadmaker be at work with pick shovel and crowbar and the tool be not too many for the job the gunner join in the work and manage to take they battery over the road long before they be consider suitable for other wheel the battery commander sometimes select firing position which appear quite inaccessible to any one save a mountain climber but the gun get there and earn much credit for they team on the 22nd nebus samwil be thrice attack british and indian troops be hold the hill but the turk be on the northern slope they be in fact on strong position on three side and from el burj a prominent hill 1200 yard to the south-east and from the wooded valley of the wadi hannina they could advance with plenty of cover there be much dead ground stone wall enclose small patch of cultivation and when troops halt under the terrace on the slope no gun or rifle fire could reach they the enemy could thus get quite close to we position before we could deal with they and they attack be also favor by a intense volume of artillery fire from 59 's place about the jerusalem-nablus road and as some people in jerusalem afterwards tell I from the mount of olive the attacker possess the advantage that we gun could not concentrate on they while the attack be prepare and could only put in a torrent of fire when the enemy infantry be get near they goal these three attack be deliver with the utmost ferocity and be press home each time with determination but the 75th division hold on with a stubbornness which be beyond praise and the harder the turk try to reach the summit the tighter become the defense each attack be repulse with very heavy loss and after he third failure the enemy do not put in he infantry again that day the 75th division endeavor to reach el jib a village on the hill a mile and a half to the north of nebus samwil the possession of el jib by we would have attract some of the enemy oppose the advance of the yeomanry mount division on the left but not only be the position strongly defend in the village and on the high ground on the north and north-west but we infantry could not break down the opposition behind the sangar and boulder on the northern side of nebus samwil the attack have to be give up but we make some progress in this mountainous sector as the 52nd division have push out from dukku to beit izza between 3000 and 4000 yard from el jib and by drive the enemy from this strong village they make it more comfortable for the troops in biddu and protect the nebus samwil flank the secure of which in those day of bitter fighting be a important factor it be evident from what be happen on this front not only where two division of infantry have to strain every nerve to hold on to what they have get but where the yeomanry mount division be battle against enormous odds in the worse country to the north-west that the turk be not go to allow we to get to the nablus road without make a direct attack on the jerusalem defence they outnumber we have a large preponderance in gun be near they base and enjoy the advantage of prepared position and a comparatively easy access to supplies and ammunition everything be in they favor down to the very state of the weather but we army struggle on against all the big obstacle on the 23rd the 75th division renew they attack on el jib but although the man show the dash which throughout characterise the division it have to be stop the garrison of el jib have be reinforce and the enemy hold the wood wadi bank and sangar in greater strength than before while the artillery fire be extremely heavy not only be the 75th division tire with ceaseless fighting but the loss they have sustain since they leave the plain of ajalon have be substantial and the 52nd division take over from they that night to prepare for another effort on the follow day the scot be no more successful they make simultaneous attack on the northern and southern end of nebus samwil and a brigade work up from beit izza to a ridge north-west of el jib two magnificent attempt be make to get into the enemy 's position but they fail the officer casualty be heavy some company have no officer and the troops be wear out by great exertion and privation in the bleak hill the two division have be fight hard for over three week they have march long distance on hard food which at the finish be not too plentiful and the sudden violent change in the weather condition make it desirable that the man should get to a issue of warmer clothing general bulfin realize it would be risk heavy loss to ask he troops to make another immediate effort against a numerically stronger enemy in position of he own choice and he therefore apply to general allenby that the xxth corps -- the 60th division be already at latron attach to the xxist corps -- might take over the line the commander-in-chief that evening order the attack on the enemy 's position to be discontinue until the arrival of fresh troops during the next day or two the enemy 's artillery be as active as hitherto but the punishment he have receive in he attack make he pause and there be only small half-hearted attempt to reach we line they be all beat off by infantry fire and the relief of the various brigade of the xxist corps be complete by November 28 it have not be give to the xxist corps to obtain the distinction of drive the turk for ever from jerusalem but the work of the corps in the third and fourth week of November have lay the foundation on which victory finally rest the grand effort of the 52nd and 75th division in rush over the foothill of the shephelah on to the judean height in get a footing on some of the most prominent hill within three day of leave the plain and in hold on with grim tenacity to what they have gain enable the commander-in-chief to start on a new plan by which to take the holy city in one stride so to speak the 52nd and 75th division and as will be see the yeomanry mount division as well share the glory of the capture of jerusalem with the 53rd 60th and 74th division who be in at the finish the fighting of the yeomanry mount division on the left of the 52nd be part and parcel of the xxist corps ' effort to get to the nablus road it be epic fighting and i have not describe it when narrate the infantry 's daily work because it be best tell in a connected story if the foot slogger have a bad time the condition be infinitely worse for mount troops the ground be as steep but the hillside be rougher the wadi narrower the patch of open flat fewer than in the district where infantry operate so bad indeed be the country that horse be a encumbrance and most of they be return to the plain after a time horse artillery could proceed no farther and the only gun the yeomanry have with they be those of a section of the hong kong and singapore mountain battery man by sikh superb fellow whose service in the egyptian desert and in palestine be worthy of a martial race but they little gun be outrange by the turkish artillery and though they be often right up with the mount man they could not get near the enemy battery the supply of the division in the nook and cranny where there be not so much as a goat-path be a desperate problem and could not have be solve without the aid of many hundred of pack-donkey which dump they load of supplies and ammunition on the hillside leave it to be carry forward by hand the division be fight almost continually for a fortnight they get farther forward than the infantry and meet the full force of a opposition which if not stronger than that about nebus samwil be extremely violent and they come back to a line which could be supply with less difficulty when it be apparent that the turk be not go to accept the opportunity general allenby give they to withdraw they army from jerusalem the division 's most bitter struggle be about the beth-horon on the very scene where joshua on a lengthen day throw the canaanite off the shephelah the yeomanry mount division receive order on the afternoon of November 17 to move across ajalon into the foothill and to press forward straight on bireh as rapidly as possible they trial they begin immediately one regiment of the 8th brigade occupy annabeh and a regiment of the 22nd brigade get within a couple of mile of nalin where a well-concealed body of the enemy hold it up soon the report come in that the country be impassable for wheel by the afternoon of the next day the 8th brigade be at beit ur el foka -- beth-horon the upper -- a height where fig tree and pomegranate flourish eastward the country fall away and there be several ragged narrow valley between some tree-topped ridge till the eye meet a sheikh 's tomb on the zeitun ridge standing midway between foka and beitunium which rear a proud and picturesque head to bar the way to bireh the wadi cross the valley wherever torrent water can tear up rock but the yeomanry find they bed smoother go fill though they be with boulder than the hill slope which generally rise in steep gradient from the side of watercourse during every step of the way across this saw-toothed country one appreciate to the full the defender ' advantage if dead ground hide you from one hill-top enemy marks-man could get you from another and it be impossible for the division to proceed unless it get the enemy out of all the hill on its line of advance the infantry on the right be very helpful but the brigade on the left flank have many difficulty which be not lessen when on the second day of the movement all royal horse artillery gun and all wheel have to be send back owe to the bad country up to this point the fight against nature be more arduous than against the enemy thenceforward the enemy become more vigilant and active and the hill and stony hollow more try all available man be set to work to make a road for the hong kong and singapore gunner a battery which would always get as far into the mountain as any in the king 's army the road party labor night and day but it be only by the greatest exertion that the battery could be get through the heavy rain of the 19th add to the trouble the 8th brigade have occupy beit ur et tahta -lrb- beth-horon the lower -rrb- early on the morning of the 19th proceed along the wadi sunt until a force on the height hold they up and they have to remain in the wadi while the 6th mount brigade turn the enemy 's flank at foka the 22nd mount brigade on the north meet with the same trouble -- every hill have to be win and picquete -- and they could not make ain arik that day as soon as it be light on the follow morning the 6th mount brigade brush away opposition in foka and enter the village push on thence towards beitunium the advance be slow and hazardous every hill have to be search a task difficult of accomplishment by reason of the innumerable cave and boulder capable of shelter sniper the turk have become a adept at snipe and leave party in the hill to carry on by themselves when the 6th brigade get within two mile of the south-west of beitunium they be oppose by 5000 turk well screen by wood on the slope and the wadi both side strive all day without gain ground divisional headquarters be only a short distance behind the 6th and the 8th brigade be move up into the same area to be ready to assist by two o'clock in the afternoon the 22nd brigade get into ain arik and find a strong force of the enemy hold beitunium and the hill of muntar a few hundred yard to the north of it thus bar the way to ramallah and bireh rain fall copiously and the wind be chilly after a miserable night in bivouac the 6th brigade be astir before daylight on the 21st they be fight at dawn and in the half light compel the enemy to retire to within half a mile of beitunium a few prisoner be round up and these tell the brigadier that 3000 turk be hold beitunium with four battery of field gun and four heavy camel gun that estimate be find to be approximately accurate a regiment of the 8th brigade send to reinforce the 6th brigade on they left get within 800 yard of the hill when the gun about bireh and ramallah open on they and they be compel to withdraw and a turkish counter-attack force we forward line back slightly in the afternoon the enemy have a plentiful supply of ammunition and make a prodigal use of it while continue to shell fiercely he put more infantry into he fight line and as we have only 1200 rifle and four mountain gun which the enemy 's artillery outrange it be clear we could not dislodge he from the beitunium crest the 22nd mount brigade have make a attempt to get to ramallah from ain arik but the opposition from muntar and the high ground to the east be much too severe we casualty have not be inconsiderable and in face of the enemy 's superiority in number and gun and the strength of he position it would have be dangerous and useless to make a further attack general barrow therefore decide to withdraw to foka during the night all horse have be send back in the course of the afternoon and when the light fail the retirement begin the wound be first evacuate and they poor fellow have a bad time of it get back to foka in the dark over four mile of rock-strewn country it be not till two o'clock on the follow morning that all the convoy of wound pass through foka but by that time the track to tahta have be make into passable order and some of these helpless man be out of the hill soon after daylight journey in comparative ease in light motor ambulance over the plain of ajalon the arrangement for the withdrawal work admirably the 8th mount brigade cover the retirement so successfully that the enemy know nothing about it hold on in front of beitunium till three o'clock reach foka before dawn while the 22nd brigade remain cover the northern flank till almost midnight when it fall back to tahta the division 's casualty during the day be 300 kill and wound we still hold the zeitun ridge observation be keep on ain arik from el hafy by one regiment and troops be out on many part north and east of tahta and foka on the next two day there be nothing beyond enemy shell and patrol encounter on the 24th demonstration be make against beitunium to support the left of the 52nd division 's attack on el jib but the enemy be too strong to permit of the yeomanry proceed more than two mile east of foka the roadmaker have do a enormous amount of navvy work on the track between foka and tahta they have labor without cessation break up rock lever out boulder with crowbar and do a sort of rough-and-ready levelling and by the night of the 24th the track be report passable for gun the leicester battery rha come along it next morning without difficulty i do not see the road till some time later and its surface have then be considerably improve but even then one feel the driver of those gun team have achieve the almost impossible the leicester battery arrive at foka just in time to unlimber and get into action behind a fig orchard in order to disperse a couple of company of enemy infantry which be work round the left flank of the staffordshire yeomanry at khurbet meita below the zeitun height the enemy bring up reinforcement and make a attack in the late afternoon but this be also break up the berkshire battery reach tahta the follow day and with the leicester gunner answer the turk ' long-range shell throughout the day and night on the 27th the enemy make a determine attempt to compel we to withdraw from the zeitun ridge which be a isolate hill command the valley on both side the 6th mount brigade furnish the garrison of 3 officer and 60 man who occupy a stone building on the summit against they the enemy put 600 infantry with machine gun and they also bring a heavy artillery fire to bear on the building from beitunia 4000 yard away the garrison put up a most gallant defense they be compel to leave the building because the enemy practically destroy it by gunfire and the infantry almost surround the hill but they obtain cover on the boulder-strewn side of the hill and hold they assailant at bay at dusk although the garrison be reduce to 2 officer and 26 man they refuse to give ground they be instruct to hold on as long as possible and a reinforcement of 50 man be send up after dark -- all that could be spare as the division be hold a series of hill ten mile long and every rifle be in the line this front be be threaten at several point and the activity of patrol at deir ibzium and north of it suggest that the enemy be try to get into the gap of five mile between the yeomanry and the right of the 54th division which be now at shilta it be a anxious night and no 2 light armored car battery be keep west of tahta to enfilade the enemy with machine gun should he appear in the neighborhood of suffa the 7th mount brigade be order up to reinforce the fresh troops arrive at dawn on the 28th and have no sooner get into position at hellabus half a mile north-west of tahta than they left flank be attack by 1000 turk with machine gun the 155th brigade of the 52nd division be on its way through beit likium to rest after its hard work in the neighborhood of nebus samwil and el jib and it be order up to assist at midday the brigade attack suffa but could not take it the scot however prevent the turk break round the left flank of the yeomanry the post which have hold zeitun so bravely be bring into foka under cover of the leicester and berkshire battery ' fire and very heavy fighting continue all day long on the foka-tahta-suffa line but though the enemy employ 3000 infantry in he attack and have four battery of 77 's and four heavy camel gun he be unsuccessful at dusk the attack on tahta which have be under shell-fire all day be beat off and the enemy be compel to withdraw one mile suffa be still he but he advanced troops on the cairn south of that place have suffer heavily during the day at the hand of the 7th mount brigade who several time drive they off some howitzer of the 52nd division be haul over the hill in the afternoon and shell the cairn so heavily that the post seek shelter in suffa to the south-east of the line of attack the turk be do they utmost to secure foka they come again and again and they attack be always meet and break with the bayonet by yeoman who be become fatigue by continuous fighting and advance and retire in this terrible country they could have hold the place that night but there be no possibility of send they reinforcement and as the enemy have be see work round to the south of the village with machine gun it might have be impossible to get they out in the morning general barrow accordingly withdraw the foka garrison to a new position on a wooded ridge half-way between that place and tahta and the enemy make no attempt to get beyond foka late at night he get so close to tahta from the north that he throw bomb at we sangar but he be drive off during the evening the yeomanry mount division receive welcome reinforcement the 4th australian light horse brigade be place in support of the 6th mount brigade and a battalion of the 156th infantry brigade assist the 7th mount brigade on the 29th the turk make they biggest effort to break through the important line we hold and all day they persist with the greatest determination in a attack on we leave at midnight they have again occupy the cairn south of suffa and remain there till 8 be when the 268th brigade royal field artillery crown the hill with a tremendous burst of fire and drive they off the machine-gunner of the 7th mount brigade catch the force as it be retire and inflict many casualty the turk come back again and again and the cairn repeatedly change hand until at last it be unoccupied by either side towards dusk the turk ' attack peter out though the gun and sniper continue busy and the yeomanry mount division be relieve by the 231st infantry brigade of the 74th division and the 157th infantry brigade of the 52nd division the australian mount division ultimately take over the left of the line which xxth corps troops occupy the yeomanry mount division have make a grand fight against a vastly superior force of the enemy in a country absolutely unfavourable to the movement of mount troops they never have more than 1200 rifle hold a far-flung barren and bleak line and the fine quality of vigorous and swift attack unfaltering discipline and heroic stubbornness in defense under all condition get they proof in the 499 casualty incur by the division in the hill fight exclusive of those sustain by the 7th mount brigade which reinforce they the division be make up entirely of first-line yeomanry regiment whose member have become efficient soldier in they spare time when politician be prattle about peace and delude party into the belief that there be little necessity to prepare for war they patriotism and example give a tone to the draft send out to replace casualty and the wastage of war and be a credit to the stock from which they spring while the yeomanry mount division have be fight a great battle alongside the infantry of the xxist corps in the hill the remainder of the troops of the desert mount corps be employ on the plain and in the coastal sector hammer the enemy hard and establish a line from the mouth of the river auja through some rise ground across the plain they be busily engage clear the enemy out of some of the well-ordered village east of the sandy belt several of they german colony show sign of prosperity and more regard for cleanliness and sanitation than other of the small centre of population hereabouts the village of sarona north of jaffa a almost exclusively german settlement be better arrange than any other but wilhelma be a good second the most important move be on November 24 when with a view to make the enemy believe a attack be intend against he right flank the new zealand mount rifle brigade be send across the river auja to seize the village of sheikh muanni near the sea and hadrah farther inland two company of infantry hold each of the two crossing the enemy become alarmed and attack the cavalry in force early next morning 1000 infantry march on muanni the hadrah force be drive back across the auja and the two company of infantry cover the cross suffer heavily have no support from artillery which have be send into bivouac some of the man have to swim the river a bridge of boat have be build at jerisheh mill during the night and by this mean man cross until muanni be occupy by the enemy later in the morning the cavalry cross the ford at the mouth of the auja at the gallop the 1\/4th essex hold on to hadrah until five out of six officer and about fifty per cent of the man become casualty there be a good deal of minor fighting on this section of the front and in a number of patrol encounter the resource of the australian light horse add to they bag of prisoner and to the army 's store of information nothing further of importance occur in this neighborhood until we seize the crossing of the auja and the high ground north of the river a week before the end of the year chapter xiv the deliverance of the holy city the impossibility of get across the road north of jerusalem by make a wide sweep over the judean hill cause a new plan to be put into execution this necessitate a direct attack on the well-prepared system of defence on the hill protect jerusalem from the west but it do not entail any weakening of general allenby 's determination that there should be no fighting by british troops in and about the precinct of the holy city that resolve be unshaken and unshakable when a new scheme be prepare by the xxth corps the question be put whether the turk could be attack at lifta which be part of they system now lifta be a native village on one of the hill-face to the west of jerusalem about a mile from the holy city 's wall and as it be not even connect by a road with any of the various colony form the suburb of jerusalem could not by any stretch of imagination be describe by a hun propaganda merchant as part of jerusalem i happen to know that on the 26th November the commander-in-chief send this communication to general chetwode : ' i place no restriction upon you in respect of any operation which you may consider necessary against lifta or the enemy 's line to the south of it except that on no account be any risk to be run of bring the city of jerusalem or its immediate environs within the area of operation ' the spirit as well as the letter of that order be carry out and in the very full order and note on the operation issue before the victorious attack be make there be the most elaborate detail regard the different objective of division and brigade and scrupulous care be take that no advance should be make against any resist enemy within the boundary not only of the holy city but of the suburb we shall see how thoroughly these instruction be follow when it become obvious that jerusalem could not be secure without the adoption of a deliberate method of attack there be many matter require the anxious consideration of the xxth corps staff they take over from xxist corps at a time when the enemy be still very active against the line which they have gain under very hard condition the xxth corps begin with the advantage of position which the xxist corps have win have to prepare to meet the enemy with equal gun power and more than equality in rifle strength we have the man and the gun in the country but to get they into the line and to keep they supply be a problem of considerable magnitude time be a important factor the rain have begin the spell of fine weather be get shorter and after each period of rain the sodden state of the country affect all movement to bring up supplies we could only rely on road traffic from gaza and deir sineid and the light soil have become hopelessly cut up during the rain the main line of railway be not to be open to mejdel till December 8 and the capture turkish line between deir sineid and junction station have a maximum capacity of one hundred ton of ordnance store a day and these have to be move forward again by road a advance must slow down while communication be improve the xxth corps inherit from the xxist corps the track between beit likium and biddu which have be prepare with a infinity of trouble and exertion but this and the main latron-jerusalem road be the only highway available general chetwode 's corps relieved general bulfin 's corps during the day of November 28 and view in the most favourable light it appear that there must be at least one week 's work on the road before it would be possible for heavy and field battery in sufficient strength to support a attack to be get into the mountain a new road be begin between latron and beit likium and another from enab to kubeibeh and these even in a rough state of completion ease the situation very considerably a enormous amount of labor be devote to the main road the surface be in bad order and be get worse every hour with the passage of lorry traffic it become full of hole and the available metal in the neighborhood be a friable limestone which under heavy pressure during rain be ground into the consistency of a thick cream pioneer battalion be reinforce by large party of egyptian labor corps and these work ceaselessly clear off top layer of mud carry stone down from the hill and break they put on a new surface and repair the decayed wall which hold up the road in many place the roadmaker prove splendid fellow they put a vast amount of energy into they work but when the road be improved rain gravely interfere with traffic and camel be find to be most unsatisfactory they slip and fall and no reliance could be place on a camel convoy get to its destination in the hill two thousand donkey be press into service and with they the troops in the distant position be keep supply it would not be possible to exaggerate the value of this donkey transport in anticipation of the advance the quartermaster-general 's department with the foresight which characterise that department and all its branch throughout the campaign search egypt for the proper stamp of ass for pack transport in the hill the egyptian donkey be a big fellow with a light-grey coat capable of carry a substantial load hardy generally docile and less stubborn than most of the species he be much taller and heavier than the palestine donkey and we army never submit he to the atrociously heavy load which crush and break the spirit of the local arab ' animal it be perhaps too much to hope that the native will learn something from the british soldier 's treatment of animal it be one of the sight of the campaign to see the donkey train at work they carry supplies which have be bring by the military railway from the suez canal to railhead be convey by motor lorry as far as the state of the road permit self-propelled vehicle to run be next tranship into limber and when horse transport could proceed no farther be stow on to the back of camel the condition of the road presently hold up the camel and then donkey train take over the load under a white officer you would see a chain of some two hundred donkey each rope in file of four lead by a egyptian who know all that be worth know about the way of the ass wind they way up and down hill get a foothold on rock where no other animal but a goat could stand and surmount all obstacle with a patient endurance which every soldier admire they do not like the cold and the rain make they look deplorably wretched but they get ration and drinking-water right up to the crag where we infantry be practise mountaineer shell-fire do not disturb they much and they would nibble at any rank stuff grow on the hillside to supplement the ration which do not always reach they line at regular interval the gyppy boy be excellent leader and to they and the donkey the front-line fight man in the hill country owe much they be save a good deal of exhausting labor in manhandle store from the point where camel have to stop and they could therefore concentrate they attention on the turk by December 2 the fine exertion of the troops on the line of communication have enable the xxth corps commander to make he plan for the capture of jerusalem and at a conference at enab on the follow day general chetwode outline he scheme which put in a nutshell be to attack with the 60th and 74th division in a easterly direction on the front ain karim-beit surik and skirt the western suburb of jerusalem to place these two division astride the jerusalem-nablus road while the 53rd division advance from hebron to threaten the enemy from the south and protect the right of the 60th division i will not apologise for deal as fully as possible with the fight about jerusalem because jerusalem be one of the great victory of the war and the care take to observe the sanctity of the place will for all time stand out as one of the brightest example of the honor of british arm but before enter upon those detail i will put in chronological sequence the course of the fighting on this front from the moment when the xxth corps take over the command and show how despite enemy vigilance and many attack the preparation for the outstanding event of the campaign be carry through it be remarkable that in the short period of ten day the plan could be work out in detail and carry through to a triumphant issue notwithstanding the bad weather and the almost overwhelming difficulty of supply only the whole-hearted co-operation of all rank make it possible on the day after the xxth corps become responsible for this front general chetwode have a conference with general barrow hill and girdwood and after a full discussion of the situation in the hill decide to abandon the plan of get on to the jerusalem-nablus road from the north in favor of attempt to take jerusalem from the west and south-west the commander of the yeomanry mount division and the 52nd division be ask to suggest from they experience of the fighting of the past ten day what improvement in the line be necessary to make it certain that the new plan would not be interfere with by a enemy counter-attack they be in favor of take the western portion of the beitunia-zeitun ridge preparation be make immediately to relieve the yeomanry mount division by the australian mount division and when the 10th division arrive -- it be march up from gaza -- the 52nd division be to be return to the xxist corps the hard fighting and the determine attack of the turk have make it unavoidable that some portion of the division should be mixed and the relief be not complete till the 2nd of December the yeomanry mount division troops give over the tahta defence to the 157th infantry brigade on the night of November 29-30 and the enemy make a attack on the new defender at dawn but be swiftly beat off a local effort against nebus samwil be easily repulse but the 60th division report that the enemy have in the past few day continue he shell of the mosque and have add to he destruction of that sacred place by demolish the minaret by gunfire the 231st infantry brigade with one battalion in the front line take over from the 8th mount brigade from beit dukku to jufna and while the relief be in progress there be continual fighting in the et tireh-foka area the former place be win and lose several time and finally the infantry consolidate on the high ground west of those village early on the 30th a detachment of the 231st brigade take foka capture eight officer and 298 man but as it be not possible to hold the village the infantry retire to we original line on December 1 the 10th division relieve the 52nd in the sector wadi zait-tahta-kh faaush but on that day the 155th brigade have have another hard brush with the turk a regiment of the 3rd australian light horse on a hill north of el burj in front of they be heavily attack at half-past one in the morning by a specially prepared sturmtruppen battalion of the turkish 19th division and a footing be gain in we position but with the aid of a detachment of the gloucester yeomanry and the 1\/4th royal scot fusilier the enemy be drive out at daybreak and six officer and 106 unwounded and 60 wound turk wear steel hat and equip like german storm troops be take prisoner the attack be press with the greatest determination and the enemy use hand grenade get within thirty yard of we line during the latter part of they advance the turk be expose to a heavy cross fire from machine gun and rifle of the 9th light horse regiment and this fire and the gun of the 268th brigade royal field artillery and the hong kong and singapore battery prevent the retirement of the enemy the capture of the prisoner be effect by a encircle movement round both flank we casualty be 9 kill and 47 wound that storm battalion leave over 100 dead about we trench at the same time a violent attack be make on the tahta defence hold by the 157th brigade the enemy rush forward in considerable strength and with great impetus capture a ridge overlook tahta -- a success which if they have succeed in hold the position till daylight would have render that village untenable and would have force we line back some distance at a important point it prove to be a last desperate effort of the enemy at this vital center no sooner be the scot drive off the ridge than they re-form and prepare to retake it reinforce they attack with magnificent courage in face of heavy machine-gun fire but it be not until after a rather prolonged period of bayonet work that the lowland troops get the upper hand the turk try again and again to force they out at half-past four they give up the attempt and from that hour tahta and the rock about it be object of terror to they nor do the turk permit nebus samwil to remain in we possession undispute the londoner hold it be thrice attack with extreme violence but the defender never flinch and the heavy loss of the enemy may be measure by the fact that when we take jerusalem and a unwonted silence hang over nebus samwil we bury party inter more than 500 turkish dead about the summit of that lofty hill they grave be mostly on the eastern northern and southern slope ours lie on the west where scot londoner west countryman and indian all equally heroic son of the empire sleep as they fight side by side the last heavy piece of fight on the xxth corps ' front before the attack on jerusalem be on December 3 when a regiment of yeomanry which like a number of other yeomanry regiment have be dismount to form the 74th division cover itself with glory the 16th -lrb- royal devon yeomanry -rrb- battalion of the devon regiment belong to the 229th brigade be order to make a attack on beit ur el foka in the dark hour of the morning all the officer have make reconnaissance and have learn the extreme difficulty of the ground at 1 be these yeoman work they way up the wadi zeit to the head of that narrow watercourse at the base of the south-western edge of the hill on which the village stand the attack be launch from this position the company on the right have the steepest face to climb here the villager to get the most out of the soil and to prevent the winter rain wash it off the rock into the wadi have build a series of terrace and the retain wall often crumble to the touch offer some cover from the turkish defender ' fire with the advantage of this shelter the troops on the right reach the southern end of the village soon after 2 o'clock but the company on the left meet with much opposition on the easier slope and have to call in aid the support of a machine-gun section post in the wood on a ridge north-west of the village by 3 o'clock the whole battalion be in the village use rifle and bayonet in the road scarcely more than a couple of yard wide and bombing the enemy out of native mud and stone house and cave two officer and fifteen unwounded man be take prisoner with three machine gun but before any consolidation could be do the turk begin a series of counter-attack which last all day as we have previously find foka be very hard to defend it be overlook on the north north-east and east by ridge a few hundred yard away and by a high hill north of ain jeruit 1200 yard to the north by another hill 1000 yard to the east and by the famous zeitun ridge about 1500 yard beyond it and attack from these direction could be cover very effectively by overhead machine-gun fire to enlarge the perimeter of defense would be to increase the difficulty and require a much larger force than be available and there be no intention of go beyond foka before the main operation against jerusalem be start to hold foka securely a force must be in possession of the height on the north and east and to keep these beitunium itself must be gain before daylight arrive some work on defence be begin but it be interfere with by sniper and not much could be do immediately the sun rise from behind the judean hill there be a violent outburst of fire from machine gun and rifle on three side increase in volume as the light improve the enemy counter-attack with a determination fully equal to that which he have display during the past fortnight 's battle in the hill he have the advantage of cover and be support by artillery and a hurricane of machine-gun fire but although he climb the hill and get into the small garden outside the very house he be repulse with bomb and bayonet at one moment there be little rifle fire and the two side fight it out with bomb the turk retire with heavy loss but they soon come back again and fight with the same determination though equally unsuccessfully the devon call for artillery and three battery support they splendidly though the gunner be under a great disadvantage in that the ground do not permit the effect of gunfire to be observe and it be difficult to follow the attacker the supplies of bomb and small-arm ammunition be get low and to replenish they man have to expose themselves to a torrent of fire so fierce indeed that in bring up two box of rifle ammunition which four man could carry twelve casualty be incur a head show in the village instantly draw a hail of bullet from three side reinforcement be on the way up and the fife and forfar yeomanry battalion of the royal highlander be prepare to make a flank attack from they outpost line three-quarter of a mile south-east of foka to relieve the devon but this would have endanger the safety of the outpost line without reduce the fire from the height and as the fife and forfar man would have have to cross two deep wadi under enfilade fire on they way to foka they adventure would have be a perilous one by this time three out of four of the devon ' company commander be wound and the casualty be increase the officer command the battalion therefore decide after seven hour of terrific fighting that the village of foka be no longer tenable and authority be give he to withdraw in they last attack the enemy put 1000 man against the village and it be not until the oc devon have see this strength that he propose the place should be evacuate he man have put up a great fight the battalion go into action 762 strong it come out 488 three officer be kill and nine wound and 49 other rank kill and 132 wound thirteen be wound and miss and 78 miss in foka to-day you will see most of the battered house repair but progress through the street be partially bar by the grave of devon yeoman who be bury where they fall it be not possible to hew a grave in rock therefore earth and stone be pile up round the body so that in at least two spot you find several grave serve as buttress to rude dwelling on one of these grave beside the identification tablet of two strong son of devon you will find on a piece of paper insert in a slit cut into wood tear from a ammunition box the word ` grave of unknown turk ' friend and foe share a common resting-place the native of this village be more than usually friendly and those grave seem safe in they keep between the 4th and 7th December there be a reshuffling of the troops hold the line to enable a concentration of the division entrust with the attack on the defence cover jerusalem the 10th division relieve the 229th and 230th brigade of the 74th division and extend its line to cover beit dukku a point near and west of et tireh to tahta and when the enemy retire from the immediate front of the 10th division 's left hellabus and suffa be occupy the australian mount division also slightly advance its line on the night of December 5 the 231st brigade relieve the 60th division in the beit izza and nebus samwil position and on December 6 the line hold by the 74th be extend to a point about a mile and a half north of kulonieh the 53rd division have pass through hebron and its advance be time to reach the bethlehem-beit jalum district on December 7 the information gain by the xxth corps lead the staff to estimate the strength of the enemy opposite they to be 13300 rifle and 2700 sabre dispose as follow : east of jerusalem the 7th cavalry regiment 500 sabre the 27th division cover jerusalem and extend to the junction station-jerusalem railway at bitter station 1200 rifle thence to the latron-jerusalem road with strong point at ain karim and deir yesin the 53rd turkish division 2000 rifle from the road to nebus samwil -lrb- beit iksa be very strongly hold -rrb- the 26th turkish division 1800 rifle nebi samwil to beit ur el foka 19th turkish division with the 2\/61st regiment and the 158th regiment attach 4000 rifle beit ur el foka to about suffa the 24th division 1600 rifle thence to the extreme left of the xxth corps the 3rd cavalry division 1500 sabre the 54th turkish division be in reserve at bireh with 2700 rifle the enemy hold a line cover bethlehem across the hebron road to balua then to the hill kibryan south-west of beit jalum whence the line proceed due north to ain karim and deir yesin both of which be strongly entrench on to the hill overlook the jerusalem road above lifta from this point the line cross the road to the high ground west of beit iksa -- entrenchment be cut deep into the face of this hill to cover the road from kulonieh -- thence northward again to the east of nebus samwil west of el jib dreihemeh -lrb- one mile north-east of beit dukku -rrb- to foka kh aberjan and beyond suffa during the attack the australian mount division be to protect the left flank of the 10th division which with one brigade of the 74th division be to hold the whole of the line in the hill from tahta through foka dukku beit izza to nebus samwil leave the attack to be conduct by two brigade group of the 74th division the whole of the 60th division and two brigade group of the 53rd division with the 10th regiment of australian light horse watch the right flank of the 60th division until the left of the 53rd could join up with it one brigade of the 53rd division be to advance from the bethlehem-beit jalum area with its leave on the line draw from sherafat through malhah to protect the 60th division 's flank the other brigade march direct on jerusalem and to move by road south of the town to a position cover jerusalem from the east and north-east but -- and these be instruction specially impress on this brigade -- ` the city of jerusalem will not be enter and all movement by troops and vehicle will be restricted to road pass outside the city ' the objective of the 60th and 74th division be a general line from ra et tawil a hill east of the nablus road about four mile north of jerusalem to nebus samwil one brigade of the 74th division hold nebus samwil and beit izza defence and to form the pivot of the attack the divide line between the 60th and 74th division be the enab-jerusalem road as far as lifta and from that place to the wadi beit hannina the form of the attack be uncertain until it be know how the enemy would meet the advance of the 53rd division which on the 3rd December be in a position north of hebron within two ten-mile march of the point at which it would co-operate on the right of the 60th if the enemy increase he strength south of jerusalem to oppose the advance of the 53rd division general chetwode propose that the 60th and 74th division should force straight through to the jerusalem-nablus road the 60th throw out a flank to the south-east so as to cut off the turk oppose the 53rd from either the nablus or the jericho road it be not consider probable that the enemy would risk the capture of a large body of troops south of jerusalem on the other hand should the turk withdraw from in front of the welsh division the alternative plan provide that the latter attack should take the form of make a direct advance on jerusalem and a wheel by the 60th and 74th division pivot on the beit izza and nebus sainwil defence so as to drive the enemy northwards the operation be to be divide into four phase the first phase fall to the 60th and 74th division and consist in the capture of the whole of the south-western and western defence of jerusalem these run from a point near the railway south-west of malhah round to the west of ain karim then on to the hill of khurbet subr down a cleft in the hill and up on to the high deir yesin ridge thence round the top of two other hill dominate the old and new road to jerusalem from jaffa as they pass by the village of kulonieh north of the new road the enemy 's line run round the southern face of a bold hill overlook the village of beit iksa and along the tortuous course of the wadi el abbeideh in the second phase the 60th division be to move over the jaffa-jerusalem road with its right almost up to the scattered house on the north-western fringe of jerusalem 's suburb and its left be to pass the village of lifta on the slope of the hill rise from the wadi beit hannina the objective of the 60th division in the third phase be the capture of a line of a track leave the jerusalem-nablus road well forward of the northern suburb and run down to the wadi hannina the 74th division advance down the spur run south-east from nebus samwil to a point about 1000 yard south-west of beit hannina the latter a prominent height with a slope amply clothe with olive tree the fourth phase be a advance astride the road to ra et tawil as will be see hereafter all these objective be not obtain but the first and chief of they be and the inevitable follow -- jerusalem become ours let we now picture some of the country the troops have to cross and the defence they have to capture before the turk could be force out of jerusalem we will first look at it from enab the ancient kir-jath-jearim which the somerset wilt and gurkha have take at the point of the bayonet from the top of enab the jaffa-jerusalem road wind down a deep valley plentifully plant with olive and fig tree and water by the wadi ikbalum a splendid supply of water have be develop by royal engineer near the ruin of a crusader fortress which if native tradition may be rely on house richard of the lion heart from the wadi rise a hill on which be kustul a village cover the site of a old roman castle from which doubtless its name be derive kustul stand out the next boldest feature to nebus samwil and from it when the atmosphere be clear the red-tiled roof of house in the suburb of jerusalem be plainly visible a dozen village cling like limpet to steep hillside be before you and away on you right front the tall spire of christian church at ain karim tell you you be approach the holy site look east the road fall with many short zigzag in its length to kulonieh cross the wadi surar by a substantial bridge -lrb- which the turk blow up -rrb- and then creep up the hill in heavy gradient till it be lose to view about lifta the wadi surar wind round the foot of the hill which kustul crown and on the other side of the watercourse there rise the series of hill on which the turk intend to hold we hand off jerusalem the descent from kustul be very rapid and the rise on the other side be almost as precipitous on both side of the wadi olive tree be thickly plant and on the terraced slope vine yield a plentiful harvest big spur run down to the wadi the side be rough even in dry weather but when the winter rain be fall it be difficult to keep a foothold south-west of kustul be soba a village on another high hill and below it and west of ain karim on lower ground be setaf both have orchard and vineyard in which the inhabitant practice the art of husbandry by the same method as they remote forefather a aerial reconnaissance nearly a year before we take jerusalem show the turk busily make trench on the hill east of the wadi surar a inspection of the defence prove the work to have be long and arduous though like many thing the turk begin he do not finish they what he do do be do elaborately he employ mason to chisel the stone use for revet and in place the stone fit well and truly one upon the other while a enormous amount of rock must have be blast to excavate the trench the system adopt be to have three fire trench near the top of the hill one above the other so that be the first two line take the third would still offer a difficult obstacle and if the defender be arm with bomb it would be hard for attacker to retain the trench in front of they there be much dead ground below the entrenchment but the defence be so arrange that cross fire from one system sweep the dead ground on the next spur and if the hill be properly hold a advance up they would have be a stupendous task the turk have put all he egg into one basket perhaps he consider he position impregnable -- they would have be practically impregnable in british hand -- and he make no attempt to cut support trench behind the crest there be one system only and he failure to provide defence in depth cost he dear look eastward from kustul the turkish position south of the jaffa-jerusalem road each of they on a hill be call by we the ` liver redoubt ' -lrb- near lifta -rrb- the ` heart redoubt ' ` deir yesin ' and ` khurbet subr ' with the village of ain karim in a fold of the hill and a line of trench south-west of it run down to the railway against the 74th division 's front the nature of the country be equally difficult from beit surik down to the kulonieh road the hill fall sharply with the ground strew with boulder we man have to advance across ravine and bed of watercourse cover with large stone and up the wooded slope of hill where stone wall constitute ready-made sangar easily capable of defense the hardest position they have to tackle be the hill cover beit iksa due north of the road as it issue from kulonieh where long semicircular trench have be cut to command at least half a mile of the main road in front of the 53rd division be a ideal rearguard country where enterprising cavalry could have delay a advance by infantry for a lengthen period to the south of bethlehem around beit jalum and near urta cover the pool of solomon a invaluable water supply there be prepare defence but though the division be much delay by heavy rain and dense mist the fog be use to they advantage for the whole of the division 's horse be water at solomon 's pool one afternoon without opposition from the urta garrison December 8 be the date fix for the attack on December 7 rain fall unceasingly the road which have be dry become a mass of slippery mud to the west of jerusalem and on the hebron side the welsh troops have to trudge ankle deep through a soft limy surface it be soon a most difficult task to move transport on the road lorry skid and double team of horse could only make slow progress with limber off the road it become almost impossible to move the ground be a quagmire on the sodden hill the troops bivouac without a stick to shelter they the wind be strong and drive wall of water before it and there be not a man in the attack force with a dry skin sleep on those perish height be quite out of the question and on the day when it be hope the man would get rest to prepare they for the morrow 's fatigue the whole army be shiver and awake so bad be the condition that the question be consider as to whether it would not be advisable to postpone the attack but general chetwode than whom no general have a greater sympathy for he man decide that as the 53rd division be within striking distance by the enemy the attack must go forward on the date fix that night be calculate to make the stoutest heart faint man whose blood have be thin by summer heat in the desert be now call upon to endure long hour of pierce cold with they clothes wet through and water ooze out of they boot as they stand with equipment make doubly heavy by rain cake with mud from steel helmet to heel and the toughen skin of old campaigner render sore by rain drive against it with the force of a gale group of man huddle together in the effort to keep warm : a vain hope and all welcome the order to fall in preparatory to move off in the darkness and mist to a battle which perhaps more than any other in this war stir the emotion of countless million in the old and new world yet they spirit remain the same nearly frozen very tired ` feed up ' with the weather as all of they be they be always cheerful and the man who miss he footing and flounder in the mud regard the incident as light-heartedly as he fellow a army which could face the trial of such a night with cheerfulness be unbeatable one section of the force do regard the prospects with rueful countenance this be the divisional artillery tractor those wonderfully ugly but efficient engine which triumph over most obstacle have get the heavy into position the 96th heavy group consist of three 6-inch howitzer battery one complete 60-pounder battery and a section of another 60-pounder battery and the hong kong and singapore mountain battery be attach to and up with the 74th division the 10 and b 9 mountain battery be with the 60th division wait to try they luck down the hill and the 91st heavy battery -lrb- 60-pounder -rrb- be be haul forward with the 53rd the heavy could get in long-range fire from kustul but what think the 18-pounder battery with the country in such a deplorable state it look hopeless for they to expect to be in the show and the prospect of remain out of the big thing have more effect upon the gunner than the weather as a matter of fact but few field battery manage to get into action those which succeed in open fire during the afternoon of December 8 do most gallant work for hour with enemy rifleman shoot at they from close range and they work form a worthy part in the victory the other field gunner could console themselves with the fact that the difficulty which be too great for they -- and really field-gun fire on the steep slope could not be very effective -- prevent even the mountain battery which can go almost anywhere from fully co-operate with the infantry the preliminary move for the attack be make during the night the 179th infantry brigade group consist of 2\/13th london 2\/14th london 2\/15th london and 2\/16th london with the 2\/23rd london attach the 10th mountain battery and b 9 mountain battery a section of the 521st field coy re c company of loyal north lancashire pioneer and the 2\/4th field ambulance specially equip on a all-mule scale move to the wadi surar in two column the right column be precede by a advance guard of the kensington battalion the loyal north lancashire pioneer and the section of re which leave the brigade bivouac behind soba at five o'clock on the afternoon of the 7th to enable the pioneer and engineer to improve a track mark on the map for the greater part of the way the track have evidently be unused for many year and all trace of it have disappear but in three hour ' time a way have be make down the hill to the wadi and the brigade get over the watercourse just north of setaf a little after midnight as a preliminary to the attack on the first objective it be necessary to secure the high ground south of ain karim and the trench cover that bright and picturesque little town at two o'clock when rain and mist make it so dark it be not possible to see a wall a couple of yard ahead the kensington advance to gain the height south of ain karim in order to enable the 179th brigade to be deploy a scramble climb bring the kensington to the top of the hill and after a weird fight of a hour and a half in such blackness of night that it be hard to distinguish between friend and foe they capture it and beat off several persistent counter-attack the 179th brigade thus have the ground secure for prepare to attack they section of the main defence the 180th infantry brigade whose brigadier brig-general watson have the honor of be the first general in jerusalem the first across the jordan and the first to get through the turkish line in September 1918 when general allenby spring forward through the turk and make the mighty march to aleppo be compose of the 2\/17th london 2\/18th london 2\/19th london and 2\/20th london 519th coy re two platoon of pioneer and the 2\/5th field ambulance it reach its position of assembly without serious opposition though a detachment which go through the village of kulonieh meet some enemy post these to use the brigadier 's phrase be ` silently deal with ' it be a fine feat to get the two brigade of londoner into they position of deployment well up to time the infantry have to get from kustul down a precipitous slope of nearly a thousand foot into a wadi now a rush torrent and up a rocky and almost as steep hill on the other side nobody could see where he be go but direction be keep perfectly and silence be well maintain the loosen stone fall into mud the assault be launch at a quarter-past five and in ten minute under two hour the two brigade -lrb- the 181st brigade be in reserve just south of kustul -rrb- have penetrate the whole of the front line of the defence the queen 's westminster on the left of the kensington have clear the turk out of ain karim and then climb up a steep spur to attack the formidable khurbet subr defence they take the garrison completely by surprise and those who do not flee be either kill or take prisoner the queen 's westminster be expose to a heavy flanking fire at a range of about a thousand yard from a tumulus south-east of ain karim above the road from the village to the western suburb of jerusalem turkish rifleman be firmly dig in on this spot and they two machine gun pour in a annoying fire on the 179th brigade troops which threaten to hold up the attack indeed preparation be be make to send a company to take the tumulus hill in flank but two gallant london scot settle the activity of the enemy and capture the position by themselves corporal cw train and corporal f thornhill stalk the garrison corporal train fire a rifle grenade at one machine gun which he hit and put out of action and then shoot the whole of the gun team thornhill be attack the other gun and he with the assistance of train account for that crew as well the two gun be capture and tumulus hill give no more trouble both these scot be reward and train have the unique honor of wear the only vc award during the capture of jerusalem at about the same time there be another very gallant piece of work be do by two man of the queen 's westminster above the khurbet subr ridge when the battalion get to the first objective a enemy battery of 77 's be find in action on the reverse slope of the hill the gun be firing from a hollow near the ain karim-jerusalem track some 600 yard behind the forward trench on subr and be show a uncomfortable activity a company be push forward to engage the battery the movement be expose to a good deal of snipe fire and it be not a simple matter for rifleman to work ahead on to a knoll on the east of the subr position to deal with the gun to two man may be give the credit for capture the battery lance-corporal wh whine of the westminster get along quickly and bring he lewi gun to bear on the battery and with a admirably direct fire cause many casualty two gun team be wipe out either kill or wound by the corporal at the same time rifleman cd smith who have follow he comrade rush in on another team and bomb it smith 's rifle have be smash and be useless but with he bomb he lay low all except one man he supply be then exhaust but before the turk could use he weapon smith get to grip and a rare wrestling bout follow the turk would not surrender and smith give he a stranglehold and break he neck the enemy manage to get one of the four gun away the battery horse be near at hand but while this one gun be escape at the gallop the westminster ' fire bring down one horse and two driver and i see they body on the road as evidence of how the westminster have develop the art of shooting at a rapidly move target the two incident i have describe in detail merely as example of the fight prowess not only of one but of all three division alike in the capture of jerusalem perhaps it would be fairer to say that they be example of the spirit of general allenby 's whole force for english scottish irish welsh australian new zealander indian cavalry infantry and artillery have all during the six week of the campaign show the same high quality in irresistible attack and stubborn defense the position of the 179th brigade at this time be about one mile east of ain karim where it be expose to heavy enfilade fire from its right and as it be obvious that the advance of the 53rd division have be delay owe to the fog and rain the brigadier decide not to go further during the early part of the day but to wait till he could be support by the mountain battery which the appalling state of the ground have prevent from keep up with he now as to the advance of the 180th infantry brigade they principal objective be the deir yesin position the hill next on the northern side of subr from which it be separate by a deep though narrow valley the trench cut on both side of this gorge support subr as well as deir yesin and the subr defence be also arrange to be helpful to the deir yesin garrison by take attacker in flank the 180th brigade 's advance be a direct frontal attack on the hill the jumping-off place be a narrow width of flat ground thickly plant with olive tree on the bank of the wadi surar the 2\/19th london the right battalion of the 180th brigade have not get far when it become the target of concentrated machine-gun fire and be unable to move with the result that a considerable gap exist between it and the 179th brigade the stoppage be only temporary for with the advance of the center and right the 19th battalion push forward in series of rush and with the other battalion carry the crest of deir yesin at the point of the bayonet so that the whole system of entrenchment be in they hand by seven o'clock the brigade at once set about reorganise for the attack on the second objective which as will be remember be a wheel to the left and pass well on the outside of the western suburb of jerusalem a advance to the rocky ground to the north-west of the city down to the wadi beit hannina the commander of the 2\/18th london in he preparation have push out a platoon in advance of he left and these man at half-past nine see 200 of the enemy with pack mule retire down a wadi north-east of kulonieh the platoon hold its fire until the turk be within close range and then engage they with rifle and machine gun completely surprising they and take prisoner the whole of the survivor 5 officer and 50 man the turk now begin to develop a serious opposition to the 180th brigade from a quarry behind deir yesin and from a group of house form part of what be know as the syrian colony nearly a mile from the deir yesin system there be some german and a number of machine gun in these house and by noon they hold up the advance the brigade be seriously handicap by the difficulty in move gun the road during the morning have get into a desperate state it be next to impossible to haul field gun anywhere off the road and as the turk have pay no attention to the highway for some time -- or where they have do something it be merely to dump down large stone to fill a particularly bad hole -- it have become deeply rutted and cover with a mass of adhesive mud the gun have to pass down from kustul by a series of zigzag with hairpin bend in full view of enemy observer and it be only by the greatest exertion and devotion to duty that the gunner get they team into the neighborhood of the wadi the bridge over the surar at kulonieh have be wholly destroy they have to negotiate the wadi which be now in torrent and carry away the water which have wash the face of the hill over a wide area the artillery make a track through a garden on the right of the village just before the road reach the broken bridge and two battery the 301st and 302nd get they gun and limber across they go up the old track lead from kulonieh to jerusalem when first one section and then another come into action at a spot between deir yesin and heart redoubt where both battery be subject to a close-range rifle fire for several hour the artillery fight they gun with superb courage and remain in action until the fire from the house be silence by a brilliant infantry attack at half-past one general watson decide he would attack the enemy on a ridge in front of the house of the syrian colony with the 18th and 19th battalion with they be unit of other battalion of the brigade soon after three o'clock they advance under heavy fire from gun machine gun and rifle and at a quarter to four a glorious bayonet charge during which the london boy go through german and turk in one overwhelming stride seal the fate of the turk in jerusalem that bayonet charge be within sight of the corps commander who be with general shea at he look-out on kustul and when he see the flash of steel drive home with unerring certainty by he magnificent man general chetwode may well have feel thankful that he have be give such troops with which to deliver jerusalem from the turk the 74th division have take the whole of its first objective early in the morning and have throughout the day support the left of the london division be ready to commence operation against the second objective the dismount yeomanry whose condition through the wet and mud be precisely similar to that of the 60th division troops for they too have find the hill barren of shelter and equally cold do extremely well in force the enemy from he stronghold on the hill cover beit iksa and the kulonieh-jerusalem road from which have he not be eject he could have harass the londoner ' leave the beit iksa defence be carry by a most determine rush a gallant attempt be also make to get the el burj ridge which run south-east from nebus samwil but owe to strong enfilade fire from the right they could not get on there be no doubt in any mind that jerusalem would be ours but the difficulty the 53rd division be contend with have slow down they advance thus the right flank of the 60th division be expose and a considerable body of turk be know to be south of jerusalem late in the afternoon the advance be order to be stop and the position gain to be hold with a view to continue the advance next day the 181st brigade -lrb- 2\/21st london 2\/22nd london 2\/23rd london and 2\/24th london -rrb- be order to get into a position of readiness to pass through the 179th brigade and resume the attack on the right of the 180th brigade on the evening of December 8 the position of the attack force be this the 53rd division -lrb- i will deal presently with the advance of this division -rrb- be across the bethlehem-hebron road from el keiseraniyeh two mile south of bethlehem to ra el balua in a east and west direction then north-west to the hill of haud kibriyan with its flank throw south to cover kh el kuseir the 10th australian light horse be at malhah the 179th and 180th brigade of the 60th division occupy position extend from malhah through a line more than a mile east of the capture defence west of jerusalem to lifta with the 181st brigade in divisional reserve near kustul the 229th and 230th brigade of the 74th division hold a due north and south line from the jaffa-jerusalem road about midway between kulonieh and lifta through beit iksa to nebus samwil the 53rd division have not reach they line without enormous trouble but for the two day ' rain and fog it be quite possible that the whole of the four objective plan by the xxth corps would have be gain and whether any substantial body of turk could have leave the vicinity of jerusalem by either the nablus or jericho road be doubtful the weather prove to be the turk ' ally the 53rd division battle against it until fog come down to prevent reconnaissance in a extremely bad bit of country they be well up to they march table and in the few clear moment of the afternoon of the 7th general mott from the top of ra esh sherifeh a hill 3237 foot high the most prominent feature south of jerusalem catch a glimpse of bethlehem and the holy city it be only a temporary break in the weather and the fog come down again so thick that neither the position of the bethlehem defence nor those of beit jalum could be reconnoitr the division after withstand the repeat shock of enemy attack at khuweilfeh immediately follow the taking of beersheba have have a comparatively light time watch the hebron road they construct a track over the mountain to get the division to dharahiyeh when it should be order to take part in the attack on the jerusalem defence and while they be wait at dilbeih they do much to improve the main road the famous zigzag on the steep ridge between dharahiyeh and dilbeih be in good condition and you see german thoroughness in the gradient in the well-banked bend and in the masonry wall which hold up the road where it have be cut in the side of a hill it be the most difficult part of the road and the german have take as much care of it as they would of a road in the fatherland -- because it be the way by which they hope to get to the suez canal other portion of the road require renew and the labor which the welshman devote to the work help the feeding of the division not only during the march to jerusalem but for several week after it have pass through it to the hill on the east and north-east the ration and store for this division be carry by the main railway through shellal to karm be thence transport by limber to a point on the turk ' line to beersheba which have be repair but be without engine be next haul in truck by mule on the railway track and finally place in lorry at beersheba for carriage up the hebron road at this time the capacity of the latron-jerusalem road be tax to the utmost and every bit of the welshman 's spadework be repay a hundredfold the 159th brigade get into hebron on the night of the 5th of December but instead of go north of it -- if they have do so a enemy cavalry patrol would have see they -- they set to work to repair the road through the old biblical town for the enemy have blow hole in the highway next day the infantry have a ten-mile ' march and make the wadi arab a brigade be leave in hebron to watch that area the native of which be report as not be wholly favourable to we there be many rifle in the place and a number of unarmed turk be believe to be in the rough country between the town and the dead sea ready to return to take up arm armored car also remain in hebron the infantry and field artillery occupy the road during the day and the heavy gun come along at night and join the infantry as the latter be about to set off again on the night of the 6th the division get to a strong line unopposed and see enemy cavalry on the southern end of sherifeh on which the turk have construct a powerful system of defence the traverse and breastwork of which be excellently make in front of the hill the road take a bend to the west and the whole of the highway from this point be expose to the ground in enemy hand south of bethlehem and it be necessary to make good the hill to the east before we could control this road next morning the 7th cheshire support by the 4th welsh deploy and advance direct on sherifeh and gain the summit soon after dawn in time to see small party of enemy cavalry move off then the fog and rain envelop everything the 4th welsh hold the hill during the night in pour rain with no ration -- pack mule could not get up the height -- and the man have no greatcoat be perish with the cold colonel pemberton they co come down to report the man all right and ask for no relief till the morning when they could be bring back to they transport the general go beyond solomon 's pool and be within rifle fire from the turkish trench in he effort to reconnoitre but it be impossible to see ahead and instead of be able to begin he attack in the beit jala-bethlehem area on the morning of the 8th that morning arrive before any reconnaissance could be make he decide to attack on the high ground of beit jalum -lrb- two mile north-west of bethlehem -rrb- from the south to send he divisional cavalry the westminster dragoon on the infantry 's leave to threaten beit jalum from the west and to refuse bethlehem before develop this attack it be essential to drive the enemy off the observation post look down upon the main road along which the gun and troops have to pass the fog enable the gun to pass up the road although the turk have seven mountain gun in the garden of a big house south of bethlehem and have register the road to a yard they also have a heavy gun outside the town the weather clear at interval about noon but about two o'clock a dense fog come down again and once more the advance be hold up late in the afternoon the welsh division troops reach the high ground west and south-west of beit jalum but the defence of bethlehem on the south have still to be take advance guard be send into bethlehem and beit jalum during the night and by early morning of the 9th it be find that the enemy have leave and the lead brigade press on reach mar elias midway between bethlehem and jerusalem by eleven o'clock and the southern outskirts of jerusalem a hour later meanwhile the 60th and 74th division have actively patrol they front during the night and the turk have taste the quality of british bayonet make no attempt to recover any of the lose position we have outpost well up the road above lifta and at half-past eight they see a white flag approach the nearest officer be a commander of the 302nd brigade royal field artillery to whom the mayor the head of the husseiny family descendant of the prophet and hereditary mayor of jerusalem signify he desire to surrender the city the mayor be accompany by the chief of police and two of the gendarmerie and while communication be pass between general shea general chetwode and general headquarters general watson ride as far as the jaffa gate of the holy city to learn what be happen in the town i believe major montagu cooke one of the officer of the 302nd artillery brigade be the first officer actually in the town and i understand that whilst he and he orderly be in the post office a substantial body of turk turn the corner outside the building and pass down the jericho road quite unconscious of the near presence of a british officer general shea be depute by the commander-in-chief to enter jerusalem in order to accept the surrender of the city it be a simple little ceremony last but a minute or two free from any display of strength and a fitting prelude to general allenby 's official entry at half-past twelve general shea with he aide-de-camp and a guard of honor furnish by the 2\/17th london meet the mayor who formally surrender the city to the chief of police general shea give instruction for the maintenance of order and guard be place over the public building then the commander of the 60th division leave to continue the direction of he troops who be make the holy city secure from turkish attack i believe the official report run : ` thus at 1230 the holy city be surrender for the twenty-third time and for the first time to british arm and on this occasion without bloodshed among the inhabitant or damage to the building in the city itself ' simple as be the surrender of jerusalem there be scene in the street during the short half-hour of general shea 's visit which reflect the feeling of half the civilised world on receive the news it be a world event this deliverance of jerusalem from turkish misgovernment be bind to stir the emotion of christian jewish and moslem community in the two hemisphere in a war in which the moral effect of victory be only slightly less important than a big strategical triumph jerusalem be one of the strongest possible position for the ally to win and it be not make too great a claim to say that the capture of the holy city by british arm give more satisfaction to countless million of people than do the win back for france of any big town on the western front the latter might be more important from a military standpoint but among the people especially neutral it would be regard merely as a pass incident in the ebb and flow of the tide of war bagdad have a important influence on the eastern mind jerusalem affect christian jew and moslem alike the world over the war cabinet regard the taking of jerusalem by british imperial troops in so important a light that order be give to hold up correspondent ' message and any telegram the military attachs might write until the announcement of the victory have be make to the world by a minister in the house of common this instruction be officially communicate to I before we take jerusalem and i believe it be the case that the world receive the first news when the mouthpiece of the government give it to the choose representative of the british people in the mother of parliament the end of ottoman dominion over the cradle of christianity a place hold in reverence by the vast majority of the people of the old and new world make a deep and abide impression and as long as people hold dearly to they faith sentiment will make general allenby 's victory one of the greatest triumph of the war the relief of the people of jerusalem as well as they confidence that we be there to stay manifest itself when general shea drive into the city the news have go abroad that the general be to arrive about noon and all jerusalem come into the street to welcome he they clap they hand and raise shrill cry of delight in a babel of tongue woman throw flower into the car and spread palm leave on the road scarcely have the turk leave probably before they have all go and while the gun be still bang outside the entrance to jerusalem stray piece of bunting which have do duty on many another day be hang out to signify the popular pleasure at the end of a old hard extortionate regime and the beginning of a era of happiness and freedom after leave jerusalem the enemy take up a strong position on the hill north and north-east of the city from which he have to be drive before jerusalem be secure from counter-attack during the morning general chetwode give order for a general advance to the line lay down in he original plan of attack which may be describe as the preliminary line for the defense of jerusalem the 180th and 181st brigade be already on the move and some of the 53rd division have march by the main road outside the holy city 's wall to position from which they be to attempt to drive the enemy off the mount of olive the 180th brigade fresh and strong but still wet and muddy go forward rapidly over the boulder on the hill east of the wadi beit hannina and occupy the rugged height of shafat at half-past one shafat be about two mile north of jerusalem in another half-hour they have drive the turk from the conical top of tel el ful that sugar-loaf hill which dominate the nablus road and which before the end of the year be to be the scene of a epic struggle between londoner and turk the 181st brigade on debouch from the suburb of jerusalem north-east of lifta be face with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire on the ridge run from the western edge of the mount of olive across the nablus road through kh e salah on the leave the 180th brigade lend support and at four o'clock the 2\/21st and 2\/24th london rush the ridge with the bayonet and drive off the turk who leave seventy dead behind they the london division that night establish itself on the line from a point a thousand yard north of jerusalem and east of the nablus road through ra mesharus to tel el ful thence westwards to the wadi behind the olive orchard south of beit hannina the 74th division reach its objective without violent opposition and its line run from north of nebus samwil to the height of beit hannina and out towards tel el ful the 53rd division be strongly oppose when it get round the south-east of jerusalem on to the jericho road in the direction of aziriyeh -lrb- bethany -rrb- and it be necessary to clear the turk from the mount of olive troops of the welsh division move round the holy city and drive the enemy off the mount follow they down the eastern spur and thus deny they any direct observation over jerusalem the next day they push the enemy still farther eastward and by the night of the 10th hold the line from the well at azad 4000 yard south-east of jerusalem the hill 1500 yard south of aziriyeh aziriyeh itself to the mount of olive whence we position continue to ra et tawil north of tel el ful across the nablus road to nebus samwil this be we first line of position for the defense of jerusalem and we continue to hold these strong point for some time they be gradually extend on the east and north-east by the welsh division in order to prevent a attack from the direction of jericho where we know the turk have receive reinforcement indeed during we attack on the jerusalem position the turk have withdraw a portion of they force on the hedjaz railway a regiment have pass through jericho from the hedjaz line at amman and be march up the road to assist in jerusalem 's defense but be ` too late ' the regiment be turn back when we have capture jerusalem we casualty from November 28 to December 10 -- these figure include the heavy fighting about tahta foka and nebus samwil prior to the xxth corps ' attack on the jerusalem defence -- be : officer 21 kill 64 wound 3 miss other rank 247 kill 1163 wound 169 miss a total of 1667 the casualty of the 60th division during the attack on and advance north of jerusalem on December 8-9 be interesting because they be so extremely light consider the strength of the defence capture and the difficulty of the ground namely : 8 officer kill and 24 wound 98 other

include two 4-2 krupp howitzer three 77-mm field gun and carriage nine heavy and three light machine gun 137 box of small-arms ammunition and 103000 loose round chapter xv general allenby 's official entry jerusalem become supremely happy it have pass through the trial if not the peril of war it have be the headquarters and base of a turkish army great body of troops be never quarter there but staff and depts be establish in the city and be in complete control the military pay little regard to the need of the population unfortunately a not inconsiderable section of jerusalem 's inhabitant be content to live not by its own handiwork but on the gift of charitable religious people of all creed when war virtually shut off jerusalem from the outer world the lot of the poor become precarious the food of the country just about sufficient for self-support be to a large extent commandeer for the troops and while price rise the poor could not buy and either they appeal do not reach the benevolent or fund be intercept death from starvation be number by the thousand jew christian and moslem alike suffer and there be few civilian in the holy city who be not hungry for month at a time when i reach jerusalem the people be at the height of they excitement over the come of the british and they put the best face on they condition but the freely express feeling of relief that the day of hunger torture be nearly past do not remove the sign of want and misery of infinite suffering by father mother and child bring about by a long period of starvation that a people pale thin bent whose movement have become listless under the lash of hunger could have be stir into enthusiasm by the appearance of a khaki coat that they could throw off the lethargy which come of acute want be only to be account for by the existence of a profound belief that we have be send to deliver they some hour before the official entry i be walk in david street when a jewish woman see that i be english stop I and say : ` we have pray for this day to-day i shall sing god save we gracious king long live we noble king we have be starve but what do that matter now we be liberate and free ' she clasp she hand across she breast and exclaim several time ` oh how thankful we be ' a elderly man in a black robe whose pinch pale face tell of a long period of want catch I by the hand and say : ` god have deliver we oh how happy we be ' a american worker in a red crescent hospital who have live in jerusalem for upward of ten year and know the people well assure I there be not one person in the holy city who in he heart be not devoutly thankful for we victory he tell I that on the day we capture nebus samwil three wound arab officer be bring to the hospital one of they speak english -- it be astonishing how many people could speak we mother tongue -- and while he be have he wound dress he exclaim : ' i can shout hip-hip-hurrah for england now ' the officer be advise to be careful as there be many turkish wound in the hospital but he reply he do not care and in unrestrained joy cry out ` hurrah for england ' the deplorable lot of the people have be make harder by profiteer officer those who have money have to part with it for turkish paper the turkish note be depreciate to about one-fifth of its face value german officer trade in the note for gold send the note to germany where by a financial arrangement conclude between constantinople and berlin they be accept at face value the german officer and soldier get richer the more they force turkish paper down turkish officer buy considerable supplies of wheat and flour from military depts the cost be debit against they pay which be pay in paper they then sell the goods for gold that account for the high price of foodstuff the price in gold be take for the market valuation in the middle of November when there be a prospect of the turk evacuate jerusalem the officer sell out they stock of provision and price become less prohibitive but they rise again quickly when it be decide to defend the city and the cost of food mount to almost famine price the turk by sell for gold that which be buy for paper rechanging gold for paper at they own price make huge profit and cause a heavy depreciation of the note at the expense of the population grain be bring from the district east of the dead sea but none of it find its way to civilian mouth except through the extortionate channel provide by officer yet when we get into jerusalem there be people with small stock of flour who be willing to make flat loaf of unleavened bread for sale to we troops the soldier have be live for week on hard biscuit and bully beef and many be willing to pay a shilling for a small cake of bread they do not know that the stock of flour in the town be desperately low and that by buy this bread they be almost take it out of the mouth of the poor some trader be so keen on get good money not paper that they try to do business on this footing look to the british army to come to the aid of the people the army soon put a stop to this trade and the troops be prohibit from buy bread in jerusalem and bethlehem as it be the quarter-master-general 's branch have to send a large quantity of foodstuff into the town and this be do at a time when it be a most anxious task to provision the troops those be very try day for the supply and transport department and one wonder whether the civilian population ever realize the extent of the humanitarian effort of we army staff during the period when no attempt be make to alleviate the lot of the people the turk give they a number of lesson in frightfulness there be public execution to show the severity of military law gallows be erect outside the jaffa gate and the victim be leave hang for hour as a warn to the population i have see a photograph of six native who suffer the penalty with they executioner stand at the swinging foot of they victim before the first battle of gaza the turk bring the rich mufti of gaza and he son to jerusalem and the mufti be hang in the presence of a throng compulsorily assemble to witness the execution the son be shoot they only crime be that they be believe to have express approval of britain 's policy in deal with moslem race thus be the people terrorise they know the turkish idea of justice and dare not talk of event happen in the town even in the seclusion of they home the evil of war as war be practice by the turk leave a mark on jerusalem 's population which will be indelible for this generation despite the wondrous change we army have work in the people when general allenby have break through the gaza line the turk in jerusalem despaired of save the city that all the army papers be bring from hebron on November 10 show that even at that date von kress still imagine we would come up the hebron road though he have learn to he cost that a mighty column be move through the coastal sector and that we cavalry be cut across the country to join it the notorious enver reach jerusalem from the north on November 12 and go down to hebron on he return it be report that the turk would leave jerusalem the immediate sale of officer ' stock of foodstuff give color to the rumor undoubtedly some preparation be make to evacuate the place but the temptation to hold on be too great one can see the influence of the german mind in the turkish council of war at a moment when they be flash the wireless news throughout the world that they caporetto victory mean the driving of italy out of the war they do not want the icy blast of jerusalem 's fall to tell of disaster to they hope in the east accordingly on the 16th November a new decision be take and jerusalem be to be defend to the last german officer come hurry south lorry be rush down with store until there be six hundred german lorry driver and mechanic in jerusalem reinforcement arrive and the house of the german colony be turn into nest of machine gun the pain the german be at to see they plan carry out be reflect in the fighting when we try to get across the jerusalem-nablus road and to avoid fight in the neighborhood of the holy city but all this effort avail they nought we disposition compel the enemy to distribute he force and when the attack be launch the turk lack sufficient man to man he defence adequately and german pretension in the holy land found upon year of scheming and the formation of settlement for german colonist approve and support by the kaiser himself be shatter beyond hope of recovery as similar pretension have be shatter at bagdad by general maude the turk have make they headquarters at the hospice of notre dame in jerusalem and take they cue from the hun carry away all the furniture belong to that french religious institution they have also deport some of the head of religious body falkenhayn wish that all american should be remove from jerusalem issue a order to that effect a fortnight before we enter some member of the american colony have be run the red crescent hospital and turkish doctor who appreciate they good work insist that the american should remain they protest prevail in most case but just as we arrive several american be carry off i have ask many man who be engage in the fight for jerusalem what they feeling be on get they first glimpse of the central spot of christendom some people imagine that the hard brutality of war erase the softer element of man 's nature that killing and the rough life of campaigning where one be familiarise with the tragedy of life every hour of every day where ease and comfort be forget thing remove from the mind those earlier lesson of peace on earth and goodwill toward man that be a fallacy every man or officer i speak to declare that he be seize with emotion when look from the shell-torn summit of nebus samwil he see the spire on the mount of olive or when reconnoitr from kustul he get a peep of the red roof of the newer house which surround the old city possibly only a small percentage of the army believe they be take part in a great mission not a great proportion would claim to be really devout man but they all behave like christian gentleman one londoner tell I he have think the scene of war have make he callous and that the ruthless destruction of those thing fashion by man 's hand in prosecute the art of peace have prompt the feeling that there be little in civilisation after all if civilisation could result in so bitter a thing as this awful fighting man seem as barbaric as in the day before the savior come to redeem the world and whether we win or lose the war all hope of a happier state of thing be futile so this cockney imagine that he condition show no improvement on that of the savage warrior of two thousand year ago except in that civilisation have develop finer weapon to kill with and be kill by the finer instinct have be blunt by the naked and unashamed horror of war but the lesson teach he before war scourge the world come back to he on get he first view of the holy city he feel that sense of emotion which make one wish to be alone and think alone he be on the ground where sacred history be make perhaps stand on the rock the savior 's foot have tread in the deep stir of he emotion the rougher edge of he nature become round by feeling of sympathy and a belief that good would come out of the evil of this strife that view of jerusalem and the knowledge of what the holy site stand for make he a better man and a better fighting man and he have no doubt the first distant glimpse of the holy city have similarly affect the bulk of the army that bad language be use by almost all troops in the field be notorious but in jerusalem one seldom hear a oath or a indecent word when jerusalem be win and small party of we soldier be allow to see the holy city they politeness to the inhabitant patriarch or priest trader or beggar man or woman rebuke the thought that the age of chivalry be past while the reverent attitude involuntarily adopt by every man when see the sacred place suggest that no crusader army or band of pilgrim ever come to the holy land under a more pious influence many time have i watch the troops of general allenby in the street of jerusalem they bear themselves as soldier and gentleman and if they have be select to go there simply to impress the people they could not have more worthily uphold the good fame of they nation these soldier missionary of the empire leave behind they a record which will be remember for generation if it have be possible to consult the british people as to the detail to be observe at the ceremony of the official entry into jerusalem the vast majority would surely have approve general allenby 's program american tell we the british as a nation do not know how to advertise we part in the war generally prove the accuracy of that statement but the official entry into jerusalem will stand out as one great exception by omit to make a great parade of he victory -- one may count elaborate ceremonial as advertisement -- general allenby give britain she best advertisement the simple dignified and one may also justly say humble order of ceremony be the creation of a truly british mind to impress the inhabitant of the east thing must be do on a lavish ostentatious scale for gold and glitter and tinsel go a long way to form a native 's estimate of power but there be time when the native be shrewd enough to realize that pomp and circumstance do not always indicate strength and that dignity be more powerful than display contrast the german emperor 's visit to jerusalem with general allenby 's official entry the kaiser bring a retinue clothe in white and red and blue and gold with richly caparisoned horse and like a true showman he himself affect some article of arab dress he ride into the holy city -- where one before have walk -- and a wide breach be even make in those ancient wall for a german progress all this to advertise the might and power of germany in parenthesis i may state we be go to restore those wall to the condition they be in before german hand defile they the general who by capture jerusalem help we so powerfully to bring germany to she knee and humble she before the world enter on foot by a ancient way the jaffa gate call by the native ` bab-el-khalil ' or the friend in this hallowed spot there be no great pageantry of arm no pomp and panoply no display of the mighty strength of a victorious army no thunderous salute to acclaim a world-resounding victory destine to take its place in the chronicle of all time there be no enemy flag to haul down and no flag be hoist there be no soldier shout of triumph over a defeat foe no bell in ancient belfry ring no te deum be sing and no preacher mount the rostrum to eulogise the victor or to point the moral to the multitude a small almost meager procession consist of the commander-in-chief and he staff with a guard of honor less than 150 all tell pass through the gate unherald by a single trumpet note a purely military act with a minimum of military display tell the people that the old order have change yield place to new the native mind keen discerning receptive understand the meaning and depth of this simplicity and from the moment of high noon on December 11 1917 when general allenby go into the mount zion quarter of the holy city the british name rest on a foundation as certain and sure as the rock on which the holy city stand right down in the heart of a people who cling to jerusalem with the deepest reverence and piety there be unfeigned delight they realize that four century of ottoman dominion over the holy city of christian and jew and ` the sanctuary ' of mahomedan have end and that jerusalem the golden the central site of sacred history be liberate for all creed from the blighting influence of the turk and while war have work this beneficent change the population see in this epoch-marking victory a merciful guide hand for it have be achieve without so much as a stone of the city be scratch or a particle of its ancient dust disturb the sacred monument and everything connect with the great life and its teaching be pass on untouched by we army rightly do the people rejoice when general allenby go into jerusalem all fear have pass away the official entry be make while there be considerable fighting on the north and east of the city where we line be nowhere more than 7000 yard off the gun be firing the sound of burst of musketry be carry down on the wind whilst droning aeroplane engine in the deep-blue vault overhead tell of we fly man deny a passage to enemy machine the stern voice of war be there in all they harsh discordancy but the people know they be safe in the keep of british soldier and come out to make holiday general allenby motor into the suburb of jerusalem by the road from latron which the pioneer have get into some sort of order the business of war be go on and the general 's car take its place on the highway on even term with the lorry which at that time when supply the front be the most urgent task and have priority on the road the people have put on gala raiment from the outer fringe of jerusalem the jaffa road be block not merely with the inhabitant of the city but with people who have follow in the army 's wake from bethlehem it be a picturesque throng there be sombre-clad jew of all nationality armenian greek russian and all the people who make jerusalem the most cosmopolitan of city to the many style of european dress the brighter robe of the east give vivid color and it be obvious from the remarkably free and spontaneous expression of joy of these people who at the end of three year of war have such strong faith in we fight for freedom that they recognize freedom be permanently win to all race and creed by the victory at jerusalem the most significant of all the sign be the attitude of moslem the turk have preach the holy war but they know the hollowness of the cry and the native abandon they natural reserve join in loud expression of welcome from flat-topped roof balcony and street there be cry of ` bravo ' and ` hurrah ' utter by man and woman who probably never speak the word before and quite close to the jaffa gate i see three old mahomedan clap they hand while tear of joy course down they cheek they heart be too full to utter a word there could be no doubt of the sincerity of this enthusiasm the crowd be more demonstrative than be usual with popular assembly in the east but the note strike be not one of jubilation so much as of thankfulness at the relief from a insufferable bondage of bad government outside the jaffa gate be a imperial guard of honor draw from man who have fight stoutly for the victory in the british guard of fifty of all rank be english scottish irish and welsh troops steel-helmeted and carry the kit they have a hour or two earlier bring with they from the front line opposite they be fifty dismount man of the australian light horse and new zealand mount rifle the australian under the command of captain throssel vc be draw from the 10th light horse regiment which have be employ in the capture of jerusalem on the right of the london division these colonial troops have earn they place for they have do the work of the vanguard in the sinaus desert and they victory over the turk on many a hard-won field in the torrid heat of summer have pave the way for this greater triumph a french and a italian guard of honor be post inside the jaffa gate as i have previously say the italian have hold a portion of the line in front of gaza with a composite brigade but the french troops have not yet be in action in palestine though they navy have assist with a battleship in the gaza bombardment we welcome the participation of the representative of we ally in the official entry as it show to those of they nationality in jerusalem that we be fight the battle of freedom for they all outside the jaffa gate the commander-in-chief be receive by major-general borton who have be appoint military governor of the city and a procession be form general allenby pass between the iron gate to within the city wall precede by two aide-de-camp the commander-in-chief advance with the commander of the french palestine detachment on he right and

a halt at the step of el kala the citadel which visitor to jerusalem will better remember as the entrance to david 's tower here the commander-in-chief and he staff form up on the step with the notable of the city behind they to listen to the reading of the proclamation in several language that proclamation tell the people they could pursue they lawful business without interruption and promise that every sacred building monument holy spot shrine traditional site endowment pious bequest or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of three of the great religion of mankind would be maintain and protect accord to exist custom and belief to those to whose faith they be sacred make a deep impression on the populace so you could judge from the expression on face and the frequent murmur of approval and it be interesting to note how when the procession be be re-formed many christian jew and moslem break away from the crowd to run and spread the good news in they respective quarter how faithfully and with what scrupulous care we promise have be keep the religious community of jerusalem can tell the procession next move into the old turkish barrack square less than a hundred yard away where general allenby receive the notable of the city and the head of religious community the mayor of jerusalem who unfortunately die of pneumonia a fortnight later and the mufti

presentation over the commander-in-chief return to the jaffa gate and leave for advanced general headquarters have be in the holy city not more than a quarter of a hour for succinctness it would be difficult to improve upon the commander-in-chief 's own description of he official entry into jerusalem cabling to london within two hour of that event general allenby thus narrate the event of the day : -lrb- 1 -rrb- at noon to-day i officially enter this city with a few of my staff the commander of the french and italian detachment the head of the picot mission and the military attachs of

chapter xvi make jerusalem secure general allenby within two day of capture jerusalem have secure a line of high ground which form a excellent defensive system but he xxth corps staff be busy with plan to extend the defence to give the holy city safety from attack nothing could have have so damage a influence on we prestige in the east which be grow stronger every day as the direct result of the immense success of the operation in palestine as the recapture of jerusalem by the turk we think the wire-pulling of the german high command would have its effect in the war council of turkey and see that the regain of the prize would have such far-reaching effect on public opinion no one be surprise that the german prevail upon they ally to make the attempt it be a hopeless failure the attack come at a moment when we be ready to launch a scheme to secure a second and a third line of defence for jerusalem and gallantly as the turk fight -- they deliver thirteen powerful attack against we line on the morning of December 27 -- the venture have a disastrous ending and instead of reach jerusalem the enemy have to yield to british arm seven mile of most valuable country and give we in place of one line four strong line for the defense of the holy city by supreme judgment when the turk have commit themselves to the attack on tel el ful without which they could not move a yard on the nablus road general chetwode start he operation on the left of he line with the 10th and 74th division use he plan as it have be prepare for some day to seize successive line of hill and compel the enemy in order to meet this attack to divert the fresh division hold in wait at bireh to throw forward into jerusalem the moment the storm troops should pierce we line with the precision of clockwork the irish and dismounted yeomanry division secure they objective and on the second day of the fighting we regain the initiative and compel the turk to conform to we disposition on the fourth day we be on the ramallah-bireh line and secure for jerusalem a impregnable defense prisoner tell we that they have be promise as a reward for they hoped-for success a day in jerusalem to do as they like we can imagine what the situation in the holy city would have be have we line be less true the londoner who have win the city save it probably only a few of the inhabitant have any knowledge of the danger the city be in on December 27 they confidence in the british troops have grow and could scarcely be stronger but some of they be alarm and throughout the early morning and day they kneel on housetops earnestly pray that we soldier would have strength to withstand the turkish onslaught from that day onward the sound of the gun be less violent and as we artillery advance northwards the people 's misgiving vanish and they reproach themselves for they fear it will be remember how the troops of the xxth corps be dispose the 53rd division hold the line south-east and east of jerusalem from bir asad through abu di bethany to north of the mount of olive whence the 60th division take it up from mesharus east of shafat to tel el ful and to beit hannina across the jerusalem-nablus road the 74th division carry on to nebi samwil beit izza to beit dukku with the 10th division on they leave through foka tahta to suffa the gap between the xxth corps to the right of the xxist corps be hold by the 3rd australian light horse brigade of the australian mount division against we be the 27th turkish division and the 7th and 27th cavalry regiment south of the jericho road with the 26th 53rd 19th and 24th division on the north of that road and to the west of the jerusalem-nablus road one division be in reserve at bireh the latter a new division fresh from the caucasus the 6th and 8th turkish cavalry regiment be face we extreme leave the estimated strength of the enemy in the line be 14700 rifle and 2300 sabre just as it be get dark on December 11 a party of the enemy attack the 179th brigade at tel el ful but be repulse there be not much activity the follow day but the 53rd division begin a series of minor operation by which they secure some feature of tactical importance on the 13th the 181st brigade make a dash attack on ra el kharrabeh and secure it take 43 prisoner and two machine gun with 31 casualty to themselves it be about this time the corps commander frame plan for the advance of we front north of jerusalem there have be a few day of fine weather and a great deal have be do to improve the condition of the road and communication a army of egyptian labourer have set to work on the enab-jerusalem road and from the village have come strong reinforcement of native woman as well as man -lrb- and the woman do quite as much work as the man -rrb- attract by the unusual wage payable in cash in jerusalem too the native be send to labor on the road and to clean up some of the filth that the turk have allow to accumulate for year if not for generation inside the holy city the army not merely provide work for idle hand but enable starve body to be vitalise food be bring into jerusalem and with the cash wages old and young labourer could get more than a sufficiency the native in the hill prove to be a good road repairer and the boy and woman show a eagerness to earn they daily rate of pay the man generally look on and give direction it be some time before steam roller crush in the surface but even rammed-in stone be better than mud and the lorry driver ' task become lighter general chetwode 's plan be to secure a line from obeid 9000 yard east of bethlehem the hill of zamby cover the jericho road three mile from jerusalem ana hismeh jeba burkah beitun el balua kh el burj deir ibzium to shilta the scheme be to strike with the 53rd and 60th division astride the jerusalem-nablus road and at the same time to push the 10th division and a part of the 74th division eastward from the neighborhood of tahta and foka the weather again become bad on December 14 and the troops suffer great discomfort from heavy rain and violent cold wind so that only light operation be undertake on the 17th the west kent and sussex battalion of the 160th brigade stalk the high ground east of abu di at dawn and at the cost of only 26 casualty take the ridge with 5 officer and 121 other rank prisoner and bury 46 enemy dead one battalion go up the hill on one side while the sussex creep up the opposite side the turk be catch between two fire the 53rd division also improve they position on the 21st December as one leave bethany and proceed down the jericho road one pass along a steep zigzag with several hairpin bend until one reach a guardhouse near a well about a mile east of bethany the road still fall smartly follow a straighter line close to a wadi bed but hill rise very steeply from the highway and for its whole length until it reach the jordan valley the road be always cover by high bare mountain soon after leave the zigzag there be a series of three hill to the north of the road it be important to obtain possession of two of these hill the first call zamby and the second name by the welsh troops ` whitehill ' from the bright limestone outcrop at the crest the 159th brigade attack and gain zamby and then turn nearer the jericho road to capture whitehill the turk resist very stoutly and there be heavy fight about the trench just below the top of the hill by noon the brigade have drive the enemy off but three determine counter-attack be deliver that day and the next and the brigade lose 180 kill and wound the turk suffer heavily in the counter-attack and leave over 50 dead behind they also a few prisoner at a later date there be further strong fight around this hill and at one period it become impossible for either side to hold it by the 21st there be a readjustment of the line on the assumption that the xxth corps would attack the turk on christmas day the 53rd division take over the line as far north as the wadi anata the 60th division extend its leave to include nebus samwil and the 74th go as far west as tahta as a preliminary to the big movement the 180th brigade be direct to move on kh adaseh a hill between tel el ful and tawil in the early hour of December 23 and the 181st brigade be to seize a height about half a mile north of beit hannina the latter attack succeed but despite the most gallant and repeated effort the 180th brigade be unable to gain the summit of adaseh though they get well up the hill the weather become bad once more and meteorological report indicate no improvement in the condition for at least twenty-four hour and as the move forward of artillery and supplies be impossible in the rain general chetwode with the concurrence of ghq decide that the attack should not be make on christmas day the 60th division thereupon do not further prosecute they attack on adaseh on the 24th December while general chetwode be confer with he divisional commander information be bring in that the turk be make preparation to recapture jerusalem by a attack on the 60th division and the corps commander decide that the moment the enemy be find to be fully commit to this attack the 10th division and one brigade of the 74th division would fall on the enemy 's right and advance over the zeitun kereina and ibzium ridge how well this plan work out be show before the beginning of the new year by which time we have secure a great depth of ground at a cost infinitely smaller than could have be expect if the turk have remain on the defensive while the turkish loss at a moment when they require to preserve every fighting man be much greater than we could have hope to inflict if they have not come into the open there be never a fear that the enemy would break through we have commanding position everywhere and the more one study we line on the chain of far-flung hill the more clearly one realize the prevision and military skill of general chetwode and the staff of the xxth corps in prepare the plan for its capture before the advance on jerusalem be start the ` fourth objective ' of December 8-9 well and truly lay the foundation for jerusalem 's security and relieve the inhabitant from the accumulate burden of more than three year of war we have nibble at piece of ground to flatten out the line here and there but in the main the line the turk assault be that fourth objective the turk put all they hope on they last card it be trump and when we have win the trick there be not a soldier in general allenby 's army nor a civilian in the holy city who have not a profound belief in the come downfall of the turkish empire troops in the line and in bivouac spend the most cheerless christmas day within they memory not only in the storm-swept hill but on the plain the day be bitterly cold and the gale carry with it heavy rain cloud which pass over the top of mountain and roll up the valley in ceaseless succession discharging hail and rain in copious quantity the wadi become roar tear torrent feed by hundred of tributary and man who have seek shelter on the lee side of rock often find water pour over they in cascade the whole country become a sea of mud and the trial of many month of desert sand be grateful and comforting memory transport column have a unhappy time : the hebron road be show many sign of wear and it be a long journey for lorry from beersheba when the retain wall be give way and a foot-deep layer of mud invite a skid every yard the latron-jerusalem road be better go but the soft metal lay down seem to melt under the unceasing traffic in the wet and in peace time this highway would have be vote unfit for traffic the worst piece of road however be also the most important the nablus road where it leave jerusalem be want to supply a vital point on we front it could not be use during the day because it be under observation and anything move along it be liberally dose with shell nor could its deplorable condition be improve by work party the ground be so soft on either side of it that no gun ammunition or supply limber could leave the track and whatever be require for man or beast or artillery have to be carry across the road in the pitch-black hour of night supplies be only get up to the troops after infinite labor yet no one go hungry boxing day be brighter and there be hope of a period of better weather during the morning there be indication that a enemy offensive be not far off and these be confirm about noon by information that the front north of jerusalem would be attack in the night general chetwode thereupon order general longley to start he offensive on the left of the xxth corps line at dawn next morning shortly before midnight the turk begin they operation against the line hold by the 60th division across the nablus road precisely where it have be expect they attack in considerable strength at ra et tawil and about the quarry hold by we outpost north of that hill and the outpost be drive in about the same time the 24th welsh regiment -- dismount yeomanry -- make the enemy realize that we be on the alert for they assault and capture a hill quite close to et tireh just forestall a attack by a turkish storm battalion and beat off several determine counter-attack as a result of which the enemy leave seventy kill with the bayonet and also some machine gun on the hill slope the night be dark and misty and by half-past one the turk have develop a big attack against the whole of the 60th division 's front the strongest effort be deliver on the line in front of tel el ful though there be also very violent fighting on the west of the wadi ed dunn north of beit hannina the turk fight with desperate bravery they have have no food for two day and the commander of one regiment tell he man : ` there be no english in front of you i have be watch the enemy line for a long time they be hold by egyptian and i tell you there be no english there you have only to capture two hill and you can go straight into jerusalem and get food it be we last chance of get jerusalem and if we fail we shall have to go back ' this officer give emphatic order that british wound be not to be mutilate between half-past one and eight be the turk attack in front of tel el ful eight time each attack be stronger than the last tel el ful be a conical hill cover with huge boulder and on the top be a mass of rough stone and ruin masonry the turk have register well and severely shell we position before make a assault and they cover the advance with machine gun in one attack make just after daybreak the enemy succeed in get into a short length of line but man of the 2\/15th london promptly organise a counter-attack and advance with fine gallantry though they rank be thin by a tremendous enfilade fire from artillery and machine gun they regain the sangar for several hour after eight o'clock this portion of the line be quieter but the turk be reorganise for a last effort a very brilliant defense have be make during the night of beit hannina by the 2\/24th london which battalion be command by a captain the colonel and the major be on the sick list the two company in the line be attack four time by superior number the last assault be deliver by more than five hundred man but the defender stand like rock and though they have fifty per cent of they number kill or wound and the turk get close to the trench the enemy be crushingly defeat the morning lull be welcome we troops get some rest though they vigilance be unrelaxed and few imagine that the turk have yet give up the attempt to reach jerusalem we be ready to meet a fresh effort but the strength with which it be deliver surprised everybody the turk it seem be prepare to stake everything on he last throw he know quite early on that morning that he caucasus division could not carry out the role assign to it general chetwode have counter he by smash in with he leave with a beautiful weighty stroke precisely at the moment when the turk have compromise himself elsewhere and instead of be able to put in he reserve to support he main attack the enemy have to divert they to stave off a advance which if unhindered would threaten the vital communication of the attacker north of jerusalem it be a remarkable situation but all the finesse in the art of war be on one side every message the turkish commander receive from he right must have report progress against he each signal from the jerusalem front must have be equally bitter sum up want of progress and heavy loss with we time be a secondary factor with the turk time be the whole essence of the business so he pledge he all on one tremendous final effort it be almost one o'clock when it start and it be make against the whole front of we xxth corps it be certainly make in unexpected strength and with a courage beyond praise the turk throw himself forward to the assault with the violence of despair and he impetuous onrush enable he to get into some small element of we front line but counter-attack immediately organise drive he out over the greater portion of the front the advance be stop dead but in some place the enemy try a whirlwind rush and use bomb against bomb he have meet he match the 60th division which bear the brunt of the onslaught as it be bind to do from its position astride the main road be absolutely unbreakable and at tel el ful there lay a dead turk for every yard of its front the enemy draw off but to save the remnant of he storm troops keep we position from near ra et tawil tel el ful to the wadi beit hannina under heavy gunfire for the rest of the day the turk be hopelessly beat he defeat irretrievable he have deliver thirteen costly attack and he sole gain be the expose outpost position at the tawil and the quarry all he reserve have be vigorously engage while at two o'clock in the afternoon general chetwode have in reserve nineteen battalion less one company still unused and the care exercise in keep this large body of troops fresh for follow up the turkish defeat undoubtedly contribute to the great success of the advance on the next three day simultaneously with they attack on the 60th division position the turk put in a weighty effort to oust the 53rd division from the position they hold north and south of the jericho road whether in they wildest dream they imagine they could enter jerusalem by this route be doubtful but if they have succeed in drive in we line on the north they would have put the 53rd division in a perilous position on the east with only one avenue of escape the turk concentrate they effort on whitehill and zamby a great fight rage round the former height and we be drive off it but the divisional artillery so sprinkle the crest with shell that the turk could not occupy it and it become no man 's land until the early evening when the 7th royal welsh fusilier recapture and hold it the contest for zamby last all day and for a long time it be a battle of bomb and machine gun so closely together be the fight man but the turk never get up to we sangar and be finally drive off with heavy loss over 100 dead be leave on the hill the turkish ambulance be see hard at work on the jericho road throughout the day there be a stout defense of a detach post at ibn obeid a company of the 2\/10th middlesex regiment have be send on to obeid about five mile east of bethlehem to watch for the enemy move about the rough track in that bare and broken country which fall away in jagged hill and sinuous valley to the dead sea the little garrison whose sole shelter be a ruin monastic building on the hill be attack at dawn by 700 turkish cavalry support by mountain gun the garrison stand fast all day though practically surround and every attack be beat off the turk try again and again to secure the hill which command a track to bethlehem but although they fire 400 shell at the position they could not enter it and a battalion send up to relieve the middlesex man next morning find that the company have drive the enemy off its casualty have amount to only 2 kill and 17 wound thus do the ` die hard ' live up to the tradition of the regiment have deal with the failure of the turkish attack against the 60th and 53rd division in front of jerusalem let we change we view point and focus attention on the left sector of xxth corps where the enemy be feel the full power of the corps at a time when he most wish to avoid it general longley have organise he attack column in three group on the right the 229th brigade of the 74th division be set the task of move from the wadi imeish to secure the high ground of bir esh shafa overlook beitunium the 31st brigade start from near tahta attack north of the wadi sunt to drive the enemy from a line from jeriut through hafy to the west of the olive orchard near ain arik while the left group compose of the 29th and 30th brigade aim at get shabuny across the wadi sad and sheikh abdallah where they would have the australian mount division on they leave the advance start from the left of the line the 29th brigade lead with the 30th brigade in support leave they position of deployment at six o'clock by which time the turk have have more than he have bargain for north and east of jerusalem the 1st leinster and 5th connaught ranger find the enemy in a stubborn mood west of deir ibzium but they break down the opposition in the proper irish style and rapidly reach they objective the center group start one hour after the left and get they line without much difficulty the right group be hotly oppose begin they advance at eight o'clock the 229th brigade have reach the western edge of the famous zeitun ridge in a hour but from this time onwards they be expose to incessant artillery and machine-gun fire and the forward movement become very slow in five hour small party have work along the ridge for about half its length fight every yard and it be not until the approach of dusk that we once more get control of the whole ridge it be appropriate that dismounted yeoman should gain this important tactical point which several week previously have be win and lose by they comrade of the yeomanry mount division descend from the ridge the brigade give the turk little chance to stand and with a bayonet charge they reach the day 's objective in the dark at two o'clock when the turk ' final effort against jerusalem have just fail the 60th and 74th division both send in the good news that the turkish commander be move he reserve division from bireh westwards to meet the attack from we left airman confirm this immediately and it be now obvious that general chetwode 's tactic have compel the enemy to conform to he movement and that we have regain the initiative at about ten o'clock the 24th royal welsh fusilier of the 231st brigade capture kh ed dreihemeh on the old roman road a mile east of tireh and at eleven o'clock advance to the assault of hill 2450 a little farther eastward they gain the crest but the enemy have a big force in the neighborhood and counter-attack force the welshman to withdraw some distance down the western slope they hold this ground till 430 when we gun heavily bombard the summit under cover of which fire the infantry make another attack this be also unsuccessful owe to the intense volume of fire from machine gun the hill be win however next morning the night of December 27-28 be without incident the turk have stake and lose and he spend the night in make new disposition to meet what he must have realize be be prepare for he on the follow day it be doubtful whether there be a more successful day for we army in the palestine campaign than December 27 the portion of we line which be on the defensive have stand a absolutely unmovable wall against which the enemy have batter himself to piece we left or attack sector have gain all they objective against strong opposition in a most difficult country and have draw against they the very troops hold in reserve for the main attack on jerusalem the physical power of some of we attack troops be try highly one position capture by the 229th brigade be a particularly bad hill the slope up which the infantry have to advance be a series of almost perpendicular terrace and the rifleman could only make the ascent by climb up each other ' back when dismount yeoman secure another hill some man carry up supplies take two hour to walk from the base of the hill to the summit the trial of the infantry be share by the artillery what surprise every one who have be over the route take by the 10th and 74th division be that any gun except those with the mountain battery be able to get into action the road work of engineer and the 5th royal irish regiment -lrb- pioneer -rrb- be magnificent and they make a way where none seem possible but though these roadmaker put they back into they task it be only by the untiring energy of the gunner and driver that artillery be get up to support the infantry the gun be bring into action well ahead of the road and be man-hauled for considerable distance two howitzer and one field gun be keep up with the infantry on the first day of the advance where no horse could get a foothold and the manner in which the gunner haul the gun through deep ravine and up seemingly unclimbable hill constitute a wonderful physical achievement the artillery be call upon to continue they arduous work on the 28th and 29th under condition of ground which be even more appalling than those meet with on the 27th the whole country be devoid of any road better than a goat track and the ravine become deeper and the hill more precipitous in some place particularly on the 10th division front the infantry go forward at a remarkable pace but gun move up with they and by keep down the fire of machine gun dot about on every hill perform service which earn the rifleman 's warm praise the 9th and 10th mountain battery be attach to the 10th division but field and howitzer battery be also well up on the 28th the 53rd division bit farther into the enemy 's line in order to cover the right of the 60th division which be to continue its advance up the nablus road towards bireh the 158th brigade capture ana and after fight all day the 1\/7th royal welsh fusilier secure ra urkub e suffa a forbidding-looking height towering above the storm-rent side of the wadi ruabeh the 1\/1st hereford after dark take kh almit in front of the 60th division the turk be still hold some strong position from which they should have be able seriously to delay the londoner ' advance have it not be for the threat to they communication by the pressure by the 10th and 74th division the londoner have previously test the strength of adaseh and have find it a extremely troublesome hill they go for it again -- the 179th brigade this time -- and after a several hour ' struggle take it at dusk meanwhile the 181st brigade have take the lofty village of bir nebalum and el jib and after adaseh become ours the division go ahead in the dark and get to the line across the nablus road from er ram to rafat capture some prisoner the 74th division also make splendid progress in the early hour the division with the 24th royal welsh fusilier and the 24th welsh regiment attach secured jufeir and resume they main advance in the afternoon the 230th and 231st brigade cooperate with the 229th brigade which be under the order of the 10th division before dark they have advance they line from the left of the 60th division in rafat past the east of beitunium to the hill east of abu el ainein and this strong line of hill once secure everybody be satisfy that the turk ' possession of ramallah and bireh be only a question of hour part of this line have be win by the 10th division which begin its advance before noon in the same battle formation as on the 27th soon after the three group start the heavy artillery put down a fierce fire on the final objective and before three o'clock the turk be see to be evacuate kefr skyan ainein and rubin the enemy put up a stout fight at beitunium and on a hill several hundred yard north-west of the village but the 229th brigade have good artillery and machine-gun assistance and get both place before four o'clock capture seventy prisoner include the commander of the garrison and a number of machine gun the left group be hotly oppose from a hill a mile west of rubin and from a high position south-west of ainein the nature of the ground be entirely favourable to defense and for a time the turk take full advantage of it but we artillery soon make he lose he stomach for fight and doubtless the sound of many shell-burst beyond ramallah make he think that he rock sangar and the deep ravine in front of he be not protection against a foe who fight nature with as much determination as he fight the turkish soldier six-inch howitzer of the 378th siege battery have be bring up to foka in the early hour and all the afternoon and evening they be plaster the road from ramallah along which the enemy be retreat the left group defy the nest of machine gun hide among the rock and break down the defense the center group have be delay by the opposition encounter by the left but they take skyan at six o'clock and all of the objective for one day be in we hand by the early evening a advance along the whole front be order to begin at six o'clock on December 29 on he right flank the enemy be willing to concede ground and the 159th brigade occupy hismeh jeba and the ridge to the north-west to protect the flank of the 60th division the 53rd division bury 271 enemy dead on they front as the result of three day ' fight the 181st brigade make a rapid advance up the nablus road until they be close to bireh and tahunah a high rocky hill just to the north-west of the village the turk have many machine gun and a strong force of rifleman in these place and it be impossible for infantry to advance against they over expose ground without artillery support the 303rd field artillery brigade be support the brigade and they be to move up a track from kullundium while the foot-slogger use the high road but the track be find impassable for wheel and the gun have to be bring to the road the attack be postpone till the gun be in position the gunner come into action at half-past two and infantry move to the leave to get on to the ramallah-bireh metalled road which run at right angle to the trunk road between nablus and jerusalem the 2\/22nd and the 2\/23rd london work across the road reach the tahunah ridge and after a heavy bombardment dash into the turkish position which be defend most stubbornly to the end and thus win the last remain hill which command we advance up the nablus road as far as bireh on the eastern side of the main highway the 180th brigade have once more do sterling service there be a bold eminence call shab saleh a mile due south of bireh it rise almost sheer from a piece of comparatively flat ground and the enemy hold it in strength the 2\/19th and the 2\/20th london attack this feature and display great gallantry in face of much machine-gun fire seize it at half-past three once again the gunner support the infantry admirably the 2\/17th and 2\/18th london push past saleh in a north-easterly direction and leave bireh on they left get into extremely bad country and take the turk by surprise on a wooded ridge at sheikh sheiban the two brigade rest and refresh for a couple of hour and then advance once more and by midnight they have route the turk out of another series of hill and be in firm possession of the line from beitin across the nablus road north of the balua lake to the ridge of el burj have carry through everything which have be plan for the division ramallah have be take at nine o'clock in the morning without opposition by the 230th and 229th brigade and at night the 74th division hold a strong line north of the picturesque village as far as et tireh the 10th division also occupy the tireh ridge quite early in the day and one of they field battery and both mountain battery get within long range of the nablus road and not only assist in shell the enemy in bireh but harass with a hot fire any body of man or transport see retreat northwards the fly corps too cause the turk many loss on the road the airman bomb the enemy from a low altitude and also machine-gun they and moreover by they timely information give great assistance during the operation by the 30th December all organised resistance to we advance have cease and the xxth corps consolidate its line the 60th division go forward slightly to improve its position and the other division rearrange they own the consolidation of the line be not a easy matter it have to be very thoroughly and rapidly do the supply difficulty compel the holding of the line with as few troops as possible and when it have be win it be necessary to put it in a proper order in a minimum of time and to bring back a considerable number of the troops who have be engage in the fight to hold the grand defensive chain which make jerusalem absolutely safe the standard gauge railway be still a long way from ramleh and the railway construction party have to fight against bad weather and washout the turkish line from ramleh to jerusalem be in bad order a number of bridge be down so that it be not likely the railway could be work for several week lorry could supply the troops in the neighborhood of the nablus road though the highway be get into bad condition but in the right center of the line the difficulty of terrain be appalling the enemy have have a painful experience of it and be not likely to wish to fight in that country again consequently it be decide to hold this part of the line with light force in this description of the operation i have make little mention of the work of the australian mount division which cover the gap between xxth and xxist corps these australian horseman and yeomanry guard a extended front in inaccessible country and every man in the division will long remember the trouble of supply in the hill they have some stiff fighting against a wily enemy and not for a minute could they relax they vigilance when with the turk ' fatal effort to retake jerusalem the 10th division change they front and attack in a north-easterly direction the australian mount division move with it and they find the country as they progress become more rugged and bleak and extremely difficult for mount troops the division be in the fight line for the whole month of December and when they hand over the new position they have reach to the infantry on the last day of the year they horse fully need the lengthen period of rest allot to they chapter xvii a great feat of war from the story of how jerusalem be make secure -lrb- for we may hope the clamor of war have echo for the last time about she holy shrine and venerable wall -rrb- we may turn back to the coastal sector and see how the xxist corps improve a rather dangerous situation and lay the foundation for the biggest break-through of the world struggle for it be the preparation in this area which make possible general allenby 's tremendous gallop through northern palestine and syrium and give the ally haifa beyrout and tripolus on the seaboard and nazareth damascus and aleppo in the interior the foundation be soundly lay when the xxist corps cross the auja before christmas 1917 and the superstructure of the victory which put turkey as well as bulgarium and austrium out of the war be build up with many difficulty from the sure base provide by the xxist corps line the cross of the auja be a great feat of war and this be the first time i be able to mention the name of those to whom the credit of the operation be due it be one of the strange regulation of the army council in connection with the censorship that no name of the commander of army corps division brigade or battalion should be mention by correspondent nor indeed be i permit to identify in my despatch any particular division yet the division concern -- the 52nd 53rd 54th 60th and so on -- have often be mention in official despatch the enemy not only know they be in palestine but be fully aware of they position in the line they commander and brigadier be know by name to the turk on the other hand in describe a certain battle i be allow to speak of division of lowland troops welshman and londoner allusion which would convey -lrb- if there be anything to give away -rrb- precisely as much information to the dull old turk and he sharper hun companion in arm as though the 52nd 53rd and 60th division have be explicitly designate this practice seem in effect to be design more with the object of keep we people at home in the dark of forbid they glory in the deed of they child and brother than of prevent information reach the enemy some gentleman enthrone in the authority of a official armchair say ` no ' and there be a end of it you could not get beyond he he decision be final complete -- and silly -- and the correspondent be bind hand and foot by it doubtless he would have like one to plead on the knee for some little relaxation of he decision then he would have answer ` no ' in a louder tone let I give one example from a number enter in my notebook of how officer at home exercise they authority in January 1917 the military railway from the suez canal have be construct across the sinaus desert and the first train be run into el arish about ninety mile from the canal i be ask by general headquarters to send a cablegram to london announce the fact that railhead be at el arish the town have be capture a fortnight previously after a fine night march that message be never publish and i know it be a waste of time to ask the reason i happen to be in london for a few day in the follow August and my duty take I to the war office a colonel in the intelligence branch hear i be there and send for I to tell I i have send home information of value to the enemy i remind he there be a ghq censorship in egypt which deal with my cablegram and ask the nature of the valuable information which should have be conceal ` you send a telegram that the railway have reach el arish when the turk do not know it be beyond bir el abd ' abd be fifty mile nearer the suez canal than el arish what do this officer care about a request make by ghq to transmit information to the british public he know better than ghq what the british public should know and he be certain the enemy think we be haul supplies through those fifty mile of sand to we troops at el arish a absolutely physical impossibility for there be not enough camel in the east to do it but he do not know and he should have know be a intelligence officer that the turk be so far aware of where we railhead be that they be frequently bombing it from the air i have be in these bombing raid and know how accurately the german airman drop they egg and have this intelligence officer take the trouble to inquire he would have find that between thirty and forty casualty be inflict by one bomb at el arish itself when railhead be be construct this critic imagine that the turk know only what the english papers tell he if the turk ' knowledge have be confine to what the war office intelligence branch give he credit for he would have be in a parlous state while this ruling of the authority at home prevail it be impossible for I to give the name of officer or to mention division or unit which be do exceptionally meritorious work unfortunately the bureaucratic interdict continue till within a few day of the end of the campaign when i be tell that ` have frequently refer to the work of the australian which be deserve ' the mention of british and indian unit would be welcome we have to wait until within a month of the end of the world war before the war office would unbend and realize the value of the best kind of propaganda no wonder we american friend consider we the worst national advertiser in the world the officer who be mainly responsible for the success of the auja cross be major-general j hill dso adc command the 52nd division he plan be agree to by general bulfin although the corps commander have doubt about the possibility of its success and have he own scheme ready to be put into instant operation if general hill 's fail in the state of the weather general hill 's own brigadier be not sanguine and they be the most loyal and devoted officer a divisional commander ever have but despite the most unfavourable condition call for heroic measure on the part of officer and man alike to gain they objective through mud and water and over ground that be as bad as it could be the movement of the troops work to the clock one brigade 's movement synchronise with those of another and the river be cross commanding position be seize and bridge be build with a astoundingly small loss to ourselves the lowland scot work as if at sport and they could not have work longer or stronger if the whole honor of scotland have depend upon they effort at a later date when digging at arsuf these scot come across some marble column which have grace a hall when apollonium be in its heyday the glory of apollonium have long vanish but if in that age of warrior there have be a belief that those marble column would some day be raise as monument to commemorate a great operation of war the ancient would have have a special veneration for they three of the column mark the spot where the scot span the river and it be a pity they can not tell the full story to succeed generation the river auja be a perennial stream empty itself into the blue mediterranean water four mile north of jaffa its average width be forty yard and its depth ten foot with a current run at about three mile a hour till we cross it the river be the boundary between the british and turkish army in this sector and all the advantage of observation be on the northern bank from it the town of jaffa and its port be in danger and the main road between jaffa and ramleh be observe and under fire the village of sheikh muanni about two mile inland stand on a high mound command the ground south of the river and from hadrah you could keep the river in sight in its whole wind course to the sea all this high ground conceal a entrenched enemy on the southern side of the river the turk be on bald hill and hold a line of trench cover the jewish colony of mulebbi and fejja a bridge and a mill dam have be destroy during winter the only means of cross be by a ford three foot deep at the mouth a uncertain passage because the sand bar over which one could walk shift after heavy rain when the stream be swollen with flood water reconnaissance at the river mouth be carry out with great daring as i say all the southern approach to the river be command by the turk on the northern bank who be always alert and the movement of one man in the auja valley be generally the signal for artillery activity so often do the turkish gunner salute the appearance of a single british soldier that the scot talk of the enemy ` snipe ' with gun to reconnoitre the enemy 's position by daylight be hazardous work and the scot have to obtain they first-hand knowledge of the river and the approach to it in the dark hour a officer ' patrol swim the river one night see what the enemy be do and return unobserved a few night afterwards two officer swim out to sea across the river mouth and creep up the right bank of the stream within the enemy 's line to ascertain the locality of the ford and its exact width and depth they also learn that there be no obstacle place across the ford which be three foot deep in normal time and five foot under water after rain it be obvious that bridge would be require and it be decide to force the passage of the river in the dark hour by put cover troops across to the northern bank and by capture the enemy 's position to form a bridgehead while pontoon bridge be be construct for the use of gun and the remainder of the division time be all-important December and January be the wettest month of the season at jaffa and after heavy rain the auja valley become little better than a marsh so that a small amount of traffic will cut up the boggy land into a almost impassable condition the xxist corps ' plan be as follow : at dawn on December 21 a heavy bombardment be to open on all the enemy 's trench cover the crossing the fire of heavy gun to be concentrate on enemy battery and strong position in the rear while ship of the royal navy bombard two strong artillery position at tel el rekket and el jelil near the coast when darkness fall cover troops be to be ferry across the river and then light bridge would be construct for the passage of larger unit charge with the task of get the turk out of they line from hadrah through el mukra to tel el rekket after these position have be gain the engineer be to build pontoon bridge to carry the remainder of the division and gun on the night of the 22nd-23rd December in time to advance at daylight on the 23rd to secure a defensive line from tel el mukhmar through sheikh el ballatar to jelil on the right of the 52nd division the 54th division be to attack bald hill on the night of 21st-22nd December and on the follow morning assault the trench system cover mulebbi and fejja then later in the day to advance to rantieh while the 75th division farther east be to attack bireh and beida this plan be give to divisional commander at a conference in jaffa on December 12 two day later general hill submit another scheme which provide for a surprise attack by night with no naval or land artillery bombardment such a demonstration be likely to attract attention general hill submit he proposal in detail general bulfin give the plan most careful consideration but decide that to base so important a operation on the success of a surprise attack be too hazardous and he adhere to he scheme of a deliberate operation to be carry through systematically he however give general hill permission to carry out he surprise attack on the night of December 20 but insist that the bombardment should begin accord to program at daylight on the 21st unless the surprise scheme be successful a brigade of the 54th division and the 1st australian light horse brigade relieve the scot in the trench for three night before the attempt every man in the lowland division enter upon the work of preparation with whole-hearted enthusiasm there be much to be do and material be none too plentiful pontoon be wire for and reach jaffa on the 16th there be little wood available and some old house in jaffa be pull down to supply the army 's need the material be collect in the orange grove around the german colony at sarona a northern suburb of jaffa and every man who could use a tool be set to work to build a framework of rectangular boat to a standard design and on this framework of wood tarpaulin and canvas be stretch these boat be light in structure and be so design that work party would be capable of transfer they from they place of manufacture to the river bank each boat be to carry twenty man fully arm and equip over the river they become so heavy with rain that they in fact only carry sixteen man the boat builder work where enemy airman could not see they and when the craft be complete the troops be practice at night in embarking and ferry across a waterway -- for this purpose the craft be put on a big pond -- and in cut a path through thick cactus hedge in the dark during these preparation the artillery be also active they take they gun up to forward position during the night and before the date of the attack there be a bombardment group of eight 6-inch howitzer and a counter battery group of ten 60-pounder and one 6-inch mark vii gun in conceal position and the artillery dump have be fill with 400 round for each heavy gun and 700 round for each field piece the weather on the 18th 19th and 20th December be most unfavourable rain be continuous and the valley of the auja become a morass the luck of the weather be almost always against general allenby 's army and the troops have become accustomed to fight the element as well as the turk but here be a situation where rain might have make all the difference between success and failure general bulfin see general hill and he brigadier on the afternoon of the 20th the brigadier be depress owe to the flood and the state of the ground because it be then clear that causeway would have to be make through the mud to the river bank general hill remain enthusiastic and hopeful and the corps commander support he it be decide to proceed with the operation for several night with the object of give the enemy the impression of a nightly strafe there have be artillery and machine-gun demonstration occur about the same time and last as long as those plan for the night of the cross after dusk on December 20 there be a big movement behind we line the ferry and bridge party get on the move each by they particular road and though the wind be searchingly cold and every officer and man become thoroughly drench there be not a sick heart in the force the 157th brigade proceed to the ford at the mouth of the auja the 156th brigade advance towards the river just below muanni and the 155th brigade move up to the mill and dam at jerisheh where it be to secure the cross and then swing to the right to capture hadrah the advance be slow but that the scot be able to move at all be the highest tribute to they determination the rain-soaked canvas of the boat have so greatly add to they weight that the party detail to carry they from the sarona orange orchard find the task almost beyond they power the bridge raft for one of the crossing could not be get up to the river bank because the man be continually slip in the mud under the heavy load and the attack battalion at this spot be ferry over in coracle on another route a section carry a raft lose one of its number who be afterwards find sink in mud up to he outstretched arm the track be almost impassable and a lancashire pioneer battalion be call up to assist in improve they the man become cake with mud from steel helmet to boot and the field gun which have to be haul by double team be so bespattered that there be no need for camouflage in those strenuous hour of darkness the weather continue vile and the storm wind fling the frequent heavy shower with cut force against the struggle man the cover party which be to cross at the ford find the bar have shift under the pressure of flood water and that the mark put down to direct the column have be wash away the command officer reconnoitr get up to he neck in water and find the ford considerably out of position and deeper than he have hope but he bring he man together in fours and order each section to link arm to prevent the swirl water carry they out to sea lead they across without a casualty in the other place the cover party of brigade begin to be ferry over at eight o'clock the first raft-load be paddle across with muffle oar a line be tow behind the boat and this be make fast on either side of the river the raft cross and recross by haulage on the rope in order that no disturbance on the surface by oar on even such a wild night should cause a alarm as soon as the cover party be over light bridge to carry infantry in file be construct by lash the raft together and place plank on they one of these bridge be burst by the strength of the current but the delay thus cause matter little as the surprise be complete when the bridge of raft have be swing and anchor blanket and carpet be lay upon they to deaden the fall of march foot and during that silent tramp across the rolling bridge many a keen-witted scot find it difficult to restrain a laugh as he tread on carpet richer by far than any that have lie in he best parlor at home he could not see the pattern but rightly guess that they be pick out in the bright color of the east and the muddy mark of war-travelled man be leave on they without regret for the carpet have come from german house in sarona how perfectly the operation be conduct -- noiselessly swiftly absolutely accord to time-table -- may be gather from the fact that two officer and sixteen turk be awaken in they trench dug-out at the ford by the river mouth two hour after we have take the trench the officer resist and have to be kill two mile behind the river the lowlander capture the whole garrison of a post near the sea none of whom have the slightest idea that the river have be cross a officer command a battalion at muanni be take in he bed whilst another command officer have the surprise of he life on be invite to put he hand up in he own house he look as if he have just awaken from a nightmare in one place some turk on be attack with the bayonet shout a alarm and one of the crossing be shell but its position be immediately change and the passage of the river continue without interruption the whole of the turkish system cover the river trench well conceal in the river bank and in patch of cultivate land be rush in silence and capture muanni be take at the point of the bayonet the strong position at hadrah be also carry in absolute silence and at daylight the whole line the scot have set out to gain be win and the assailant be digging themselves in and the price of they victory the scot have 8 officer and 93 other rank casualty they bury over 100 turkish dead and take 11 officer and 296 other rank prisoner besides capture ten machine gun the force of the passage of the auja be a magnificent achievement plan with great ability by general hill and carry out with that skill and energy which the brigadier staff and all rank of the division show throughout the campaign one significant fact serve to illustrate the scot ' discipline order be that not a shot be to be fire except by the gun and machine gun make they nightly strafe death be to be deal out with the bayonet and though the lowlander be engage in a life and death struggle with the turk not a single round of rifle ammunition be use by they till daylight come when as a keen marksman say they have some grand running-man practice during the day some battery get to the north bank by way of the ford and two heavy pontoon bridge be construct and a barrel bridge which have be put together in a wadi flow into the auja be float down and place in position there be a good deal of shell by the turk but they fire at we new position and interfere but little with the bridge construction on the night of the 21st-22nd December the 54th division assault bald hill a prominent mound south of the auja from which a magnificent view of the country be gain stiff fighting result but the enemy be drive off with a loss of 4 officer and 48 other rank kill and 3 officer and 41 man take prisoner at dawn the division report that the enemy be retire from mulebbi and fejja and those place be soon in we hand hm _ grafton _ with admiral t jackson the monitor m29 m31 and m32 and the destroyer _ lapw _ and _ lizard _ arrive off the coast and shell jelil and arsuf and the 52nd division advance on a broad front occupy the whole of they objective by five o'clock in the afternoon the 157th brigade get all the high ground about arsuf and thus prevent the enemy from obtain a long-range view of jaffa a few round of shell fire by a naval gun at a range of nearly twenty mile fall in jaffa some month afterwards but with this exception jaffa be quite free from the enemy 's attention the brilliant operation on the auja have save the town and its people many anxious day by the end of the year there be three strong bridge across the river and three other substantial enough to bear the weight of tractor and they load be under construction the troops receive they winter clothing bivouac shelter and tent be begin to arrive bath and laundry be in operation and the rigor of the campaign begin to be ease but the xxist corps could congratulate itself that notwithstanding two month of open warfare often fifty to sixty mile from railhead man 's ration have never be reduce horse and mule have have short allowance but they could pick up a little in the country the man be in good health despite the hardship in the hill and rapid change from summer to winter and they spirit could not be surpass chapter xviii by the bank of the jordan we have see how impregnable the defence of jerusalem have become as the result of the big advance northwards at the end of December as far as any military forecast could be make we be now in a impenetrable position whatever force the turk with he poor communication could employ against we either from the direction of nablus or from the east of the jordan there seem to be no risk whatever so long as we choose to hold the line xxth corps have win of the turk again approach jerusalem but the commander-in-chief determine to make the situation absolutely safe by advance eastward to capture jericho and the crossing of the jordan this be not solely a measure of precaution it certainly do provide a means for prevent the foe from operate in the stern forbid desolate and awe-inspiring region which have be know as the wilderness since biblical day and doubtless before in that rough country it would be extremely difficult to stop small band of enterprising troops get through a line and create diversion which while of small military consequence would have be troublesome and might have have the effect of unsettling the native a foothold in the jordan valley would have the great advantage of enable we to threaten the hedjaz railway the turk ' sole means of communication with medina where they garrison be hold out staunchly against the troops of the king of the hedjaz and any assistance we could give the king 's army would have a far-reaching effect on neutral arab it would also stop the grain trade on the dead sea on which the enemy set store and would divert traffic in foodstuff to native in lower palestine who at this time be to a considerable extent dependent on supplies furnish by we army the quartermaster-general carry many responsibility on he shoulder time be not the important factor and as general allenby be anxious to avoid a operation which might involve heavy loss it be at first propose that the enemy should be force to leave jericho by the gradually close in on the town from north and south the turk have get a immensely strong position about talat ed dumm the ` mound of blood ' where stand a ruin castle of the crusader the chastel rouge one can see it with the naked eye from the mount of olive and week before the operation start i stand in the garden of the kaiserin augusta victorium hospice and look over one of the most inhospitable region of the world could easily make out the turk walk on the road near the khan which have be call the good samaritan inn the country have indeed be rightly name gaunt bare mountain of limestone with scarcely a patch of green to relieve the nakedness of the land make a wilderness indeed and one see a drop of some four thousand foot in a distance of about fifteen mile the hill rise in continuous succession great rampart of the judean range and instead of valley between they there be huge cleft in the rock hundred of foot deep which carry away the winter torrent to the jordan and dead sea over beyond the edge of hill be the green wooded bank of the sacred river then a patch or two of stunt tree and finally the dark wall of the mountain of moab shut out the view of the land which still hold fascinating remains of greek civilisation but there be no promise of a early peep at such historic sight and the problem of get at the nearer land be hard enough for present deliberation it be at first propose that the whole of the xxth corps and a force of cavalry should carry out operation simultaneously on the north and east of the corps front which should give we possession of the road from mar saba and muntar and also from taiyibeh and the old roman road to jericho thus allow two cavalry force support by infantry column to converge on jericho from the north and south however by the second week of February there have be bad weather and the difficulty of supply a line forty mile from the railway on road which notwithstanding a vast amount of labor be still far from good be practically insuperable and it be apparent that a northerly and easterly advance at the same time would involve a delay of three week new circumstance come to light after the advance be first arrange and these demand that the enemy should be drive across the jordan as soon as possible general allenby decide that the operation should be carry out in two phase the first be a easterly advance to thrust the enemy from he position cover jericho to force he across the jordan and to obtain control of the country west of the river the northerly advance to secure the line of the wadi aujah be to follow this river aujah which flow into the jordan must not be confuse with the auja on the coast already describe the period of wet weather be prolonged and the accumulation of supplies of ration and ammunition do not permit of operation commence before February 19 that they start so early be a eloquent tribute to the hard work of the army for the weather by the date of the attack have improve but little and the task of get up store could only be complete by extraordinary exertion general chetwode order a brigade of the 60th division to capture mukhma as a preliminary to a concentration at that place on the 19th the division occupy a front of about fourteen mile from near muntar close to which the ancient road from bethlehem to jericho pass through ra umm deisis across the jerusalem-jericho road to arak ibrahim over the great chasm of the wadi farah which have cliff-like side hundred of foot deep to the brown knob of ra et tawil the line be not gain without fight the turk do not oppose we at muntar -- the spot where the jew release the scapegoat -- but there be a short contest for ibrahim and a longer fight lasting till the afternoon for a entrenched position a mile north of it ra et tawil be ours by nine in the morning tawil overlook a track which have be trodden from time immemorial it lead from the jordan valley north-west of jericho and pass beneath the frown height of jebel kuruntul with its bare face relieve by a monastery build into the rock about half-way up and a walled garden on top to mark the mount of temptation as the pious monk believe it to be the track then proceed westwards wind in and out of the tremendous slit in rock to mukhma and it be probably along this rough line that the israelite march from they camp at gilgal to overthrow the philistine on the right of the londoner be two brigade of the anzac mount division work through the most desolate hill and wadi down to the dead sea with a view to push up by nebus musa which tradition have ascribe as the burial place of mose and thence into the jordan valley northward of the 60th division the 53rd be extend its flank eastward to command the taiyibeh-jericho road and the welsh troops occupy rummon a huge mount of chalk give a good view of the wilderness this be the position on the night of 19th February at dawn on the 20th the londoner be to attack the turk in three column the right column be to march from el muntar to ekteif the center column to proceed along the jerusalem-jericho road between the highway and the wadi farah and the left column be to go forward by the tawil-jebel kuruntul track the 1st australian light horse brigade and the new zealand mount rifle brigade be if possible to make nebus musa the infantry attack be as fine as anything do in the campaign i have the advantage of witness the center column carry out the whole of its task and of see the right column complete as gallant a effort as any troops could make and as one see they scale frown height and clamber up and down the roughest of torrent bed one realize that more than three month ' fighting have not remove the ` bloom ' from these cockney warrior and that they physique and courage be proof against long and heavy trial of campaign the chief objective of the center column be talat ed dumm which lie on the jericho road just before the junction of the old and the new road to the jordan valley be the key to jericho it be hard to imagine a better defensive position to the north of the road be the wadi farah a great crack in the rock which can only be cross in a few place and which a few rifleman could cover likewise a platoon distribute behind rock on the many hill could command the approach from all direction while the hill of talat ed dumm by the good samaritan inn and the height whereon the crusader ruin stand dominate a broad flat across which we troops must move this position the 180th brigade attack at dawn the gun open before the sun appear above the black crest line of the mountain of moab and well before long shadow be cast across the jordan valley the battery be tear to piece the stone wall and rocky eyrie shelter machine-gunner and infantry this preliminary bombardment if short be wonderfully effective from where i stand i see the heavy pour a unerring fire on to the crusader castle huge spurt of black smoke and the dislocation of big stone which have withstand the disintegrate effect of many century of sun power tell the forward observe officer that he gunner be well on the target and that to live in that havoc the turk must seek the shelter of vault cut deep down in the rock by mason of old no enemy could delay we progress from that shell-torn spot lighter gun search other position and whiff of shrapnel keep turk from they business there be green patch on the western side of talat ed dumm in the early month of the year before the sun have burn up the country over these the infantry advance as lay down in the book the whir rap-rap of machine gun at present unlocated do not stop they and as we machine-gun section ever on the alert to keep down rival automatic gun find out and spray the nest the enemy be see to be anxious about he line of retreat one large party harry by shrapnel and machine-gun fire leave its position and rush towards a defile but rally and come back though when it reoccupy its former line the londoner have reach a point to enfilade it and it suffer heavily we soon get this position and then we troops ascend some spur pour a destructive fire into the defile and so harass the turk re-form for a counterattack as to render feeble they effort to regain what they have lose by eight o'clock we have take the whole of the talat ed dumm position and long-range sniping throughout the day do not disturb we secure possession of it immediately the height be occupy the gun go ahead to new point and armored car leave the road to try to find a way to the south-east to protect the flank of the right column they have a troublesome journey some of the crew walk well ahead of the car to reconnoitre the track and it speak well for the efficiency of the car as well as for the pluck and cleverness of the driver that in cross a mile or two of that terribly broken mountainous country no car be overturn and all get back to the road without mishap throughout the night and during the greater part of the day of February 20 the right column be fight under many difficulty in they march from the hill of muntar they have to travel over ground so crack and strew with boulder that in many part the brigade could only proceed in single file in some place the track choose have a huge cleft in the mountain on one side and a cliff face on the other it be a continual succession of watercourse and mountain of uphill and downhill travel over the most uneven surface in the blackness of night and it take nearly eight hour to march three mile the nature of the country be a very serious obstacle and the column be late in deploy for attack but bad as be the route the man have follow during the night it be easy as compare with the position they have set out to carry this be jebel ekteif the southern end of the range of hill of which talat ed dumm be the northern ekteif present to this column a face as precipitous as gibraltar and perhaps half as high there be a ledge run round it about three-quarter of the way from the top and for hour one could see the turk lie flat on this rude path try to pick off the intrepid climber attempt a precarious ascent some mountain gun suddenly range on the enemy on this ledge and pick up the range with remarkable rapidity force the turk into more comfortable position the enemy too have some well-served gun and they plaster the spur lead to the crest from the west but we infantry 's audacity never falter and after we have get into the first line on the hill we man proceed methodically to rout out the machine gun from they nook and cranny this be a somewhat lengthy process but small party work in support of each other gradually crushed opposition and the huge rocky rampart be ours by three o'clock in the afternoon meanwhile two brigade of the anzac mount division be move eastward from muntar over the hill and wadi down to the dead sea whence turn northwards they march towards nebus musa to try to get on to the jordan valley flat to threaten the turk in rear the terrain be appallingly bad and horse have to be lead the troops frequently proceed in indian file no gun could be get over the hill to support the anzac and when they try to pass through a narrow defile south of nebus musa it be find that the enemy cover the approach with machine gun and progress be stop dead until during the early hour of the follow morning some of the londoner ' artillery manage by a superhuman effort to get a few gun over the mountain to support the cavalry by this time the turk have have enough of it and while it be dark they be busy trek through jericho towards the ghoraniyeh bridge over the river cover by a force on the jebel kuruntul track which prevent the left column from reach the cliff overlook the jordan valley by dawn on the 21st nebus musa be make good the 1st australian light horse brigade and the new zealand brigade be in jericho by eight o'clock and have clear the jordan valley as far north as the river aujah the londoner hold the line of cliff which absolutely prevent any possibility of the enemy ever again threatening jerusalem or bethlehem from the east this successful operation also put a end to the turk ' dead sea grain traffic they have give up hope of keep they landing place on the northern shore of the dead sea when we take talat ed dumm and one hour after we infantry have plant themselves on the hill of blood we see the enemy burn he boat wharf and storehouse at rujm el bahr where he have expend a good deal of labor to put up building to store grain want for he army subsequently we have some naval man operate motor boat from this point and these sailor achieve a record on that melancholy waterway at a level far below that at which any submarine british or german ever rest chapter xix the touch of the civilising hand it be doubtful whether the population of any city within the zone of war profit so much at the hand of the conqueror as jerusalem in a little more than half a year a wondrous change be effect in the condition of the people and if it have be possible to search the oriental mind and to get a free and frank expression of opinion one would probably have find a universal thankfulness for general allenby 's deliverance of the holy city from the hand of the turk and with good reason the scourge of war so far as the british army be concerned leave jerusalem the golden untouched for the 50000 people in the city the skilfully apply military pressure which put a end to turkish misgovernment be the beginning of a era of happiness and contentment of which they have hitherto have no conception justice be administer in accordance with british ideal every man enjoy the profit of he industry trader no longer run the gauntlet of extortionate official the old time corruption be a thing of the past public health be organise as far as it could be on western line and though in matter of sanitation and personal cleanliness the inhabitant still have much to learn the appearance of the holy city and its population vastly improve under the touch of a civilising hand sight that offend more than one of the sens on the day when general allenby make he official entry have disappear and peace and order reign where previously have be but misery poverty disease and squalor one of the biggest blot upon the turkish government of the city be the total failure to provide a adequate water supply what they could not or would not do in they rule of four hundred year he majesty 's royal engineer accomplish in a little more than two month and now for the first time in history every civilian in jerusalem can obtain as much pure mountain spring water as he wish and for this water as fresh and bright as any bubble out of welsh hill not a penny be charge the picturesque though usually unclean water carrier be pass into the limbo of forget thing and he energy be be divert into other channel the germ that swarm in he leathern water bag will no longer endanger the life of the citizen and the deadly peril of stagnant cistern water have be to a large extent remove for its water jerusalem use to rely mainly upon the winter rainfall to fill its cistern practically every house have its underground reservoir and it be estimate that if all be full they would contain about 360000000 gallon but many have fall into disrepair and most if not the whole of they require thorough cleanse one which be inspect by we sanitary department have not be empty for nineteen year to supplement the cistern supply the mosque of omar reservoir halve with bethlehem the water which flow from near solomon 's pool down a aqueduct construct by roman engineer under herod before the savior be bear this be not nearly sufficient nor be it so constant a supply as that provide by we army engineer they go farther afield they find a group of spring-head in a absolutely clean gathering ground on the hill yield some 14000 gallon a hour and this water which be run to waste be lift to the top of a hill from which it flow by gravity through a long pipe-line to jerusalem where a reservoir have be build on a high point on the outskirts of the city supplies of this beautiful water run direct to the hospital and at standpipe all over the city the inhabitant take as much as they desire the water consumption of the people become ten time what it be in the previous year and this fact alone tell how the boon be appreciate the scheme do not stop at put up standpipe for those who fetch the water a portion of the contents of the cistern be take for water troop horse in the spring -- troops be not allow to drink it the water level of these cistern become very low and as they get empty the authority arrange for refill they on the one condition that they be first thoroughly cleanse and put in order the british administration would not be party to the perpetuation of a system which permit the fouling of good crystal water a householder have merely to apply to the military governor for water and a sanitary officer inspect the cistern order it to be cleansed and see that this be do then the department of public health give its certificate and the engineer run a pipe to the cistern and fill it no matter what its capacity two cistern be replenish with between 60000 and 70000 gallon of sparkling water from the hill in place of water heavily charge with the accumulation of summer dust on roof and the dust of jerusalem road as we have sample it be not as clean as desert sand the installation of the supply be a triumph for the royal engineer in peace time the work would have take from one to two year to complete a preliminary investigation and survey of the ground be make on February 14 and a scheme be submit four day later owe to the shortage of transport and abnormally bad weather work could not be commence till April 12 many mile of pipe line have to be lay and a powerful pump plant erect but water be be deliver to the people of jerusalem on the 18th of June other military work have do much for the common good in palestine but none of they be of greater utility than this mahomedan see bright water flow into jerusalem regard it as one of the wonder of all time it be interesting to note that the american red cross society which send a large and capable staff to the holy land after america come into the war know of the lack of a adequate water supply for jerusalem and with that foresight which american show forward to egypt for transportation to jerusalem some thousand ton of water main to provide a water service when the american red cross worker reach the holy city they find the army 's plan almost complete and they be the first to pay a tribute to what they describe as the ` civilising march of the british army ' those who watch the ceaseless activity of the public health administration be not surprise at the remarkable improvement in the sick and death rate not only of jerusalem but of all the town and district the new water supply will unquestionably help to lower the figure still further a medical authority recently tell I that the health of the community be wonderfully good and there be no suspicion of cholera outbreak of which be frequent under the turkish regime government hospital be establish in all large centre in this country where small-pox take a heavy toll the ` conscientious objector ' be unknown and many thousand of native in a few month come forward of they own free will to be vaccinate typhus and relapse fever both lice-borne disease use to claim many victim but the figure fall very rapidly due largely no doubt to the full use to which disinfect plant be put in all area of the occupied territory the virtue of bodily cleanliness be teach and the people be give that personal attention which be entirely lack under turkish rule it be not easy to overcome the prejudice and cure the habit of thousand of year but progress be be make surely if slowly and already there be a gratifying improvement in the condition of the people which be patent to any observer in jerusalem a infant ' welfare bureau be institute where mother be see before and after childbirth infant ' clinic be establish a body of health be form and a kitchen be open to provide food for baby and the poor the nurse be mainly local subject who have to undergo a adequate training and there be no one who do not confidently predict a rapid fall in the infant mortality rate which to the shame of the turkish administration be fully a dozen time that of the highest of english town the spadework be all do by the medical staff of the occupied enemy territory administration the call be urgent and though labor under war-time difficulty they get thing go quickly and smoothly some voluntary society be assist and the enthusiasm of the american red cross unit enable all to carry on a great and beneficent work chapter xx we conquering airman the airman who be the eye of the army in sinaus and palestine can look back on they record as a great achievement enormous difficulty be face with stout heart and the royal fly corps spirit surmount they it be one long test of courage endurance and efficiency and so triumphantly do the airman come through the ordeal that general allenby 's army may truthfully be say to have secure as complete a mastery of the air as it do of the plain and hill of southern palestine those of we who watch the airman ` carry on ' from the time when they aeroplane be inferior to those of the german in speed climb capacity and other quality which go to make up first-class fight machine till the position during the great advance when few enemy aviator dare cross we line can well testify to the wonderful work we airman perform with comparatively few opportunity for combat because the enemy know he inferiority and decline to fight unless force the pilot and observer from the moment we attack be about to start be always aggressive and though the number of they victim may seem small compare with aerial victory on the western front they be substantial and important in the month of January 1917 the fly man account for eleven aeroplane five of these fall victim to one pilot the last of these victory i myself witness in a single-seater the pilot engage two two-seater aeroplane of a late type drive down one machine within we line the pilot kill by eleven bullet and the observer wound he then chase the other plane whose pilot soon lose he taste for fight drop into a heavy cloud bank and get away no odds be too great for we airman i have see one aeroplane swoop down out of the blue to attack a formation of six enemy machine send one crash to earth and disperse the remainder in one brief fight another pilot drive down three german plane the airman do not talk of he work and we know that what we see and hear of be but fragment in the silent record of great thing do much that be accomplish be far behind we visual range high up over the bleak hill of judea above even the rain cloud drive across the height by the fury of a winter gale or skimming over the dull surface of the dead sea fly some hundred of foot below sea level to interrupt the passage of foodstuff of which the turk stand in need all through the army 's rapid march northwards from the crushed gaza-beersheba line the airman 's untiring work be of infinite value when the turkish retreat begin the enemy be bomb and machine-gun for a full week the railway aerodrome troops on the march artillery and transport be hit time and again and five smash aeroplane and a large quantity of aircraft store of every description be find at menshiye alone the raid on that aerodrome be so successful that at night the german burn the whole of the equipment not destroy by bomb three machine be also destroy by we at et tineh five at ramleh and one at ludd and the country be cover with the debris of a well-bombed and beaten army after jerusalem come under the safe protection of we arm airman harass the retire enemy with bomb and machine gun the wind be strong but defy treacherous eddy the pilot come through the valley between steep-sloped hill and catch the turk on the nablus road empty they bomb rack at a height of a few hundred foot and give the scatter troops machine-gun fire on the return journey a glance at the list of honor bestow on officer and other rank of the rfc serve with the egyptian expeditionary force in 1917 be sufficient to give a idea of the efficiency of the service of we airman it must be remember that the palestine wing be small if thoroughly representative of the fly corps its number be few but the quality be there indeed i hear the australian squadron of fly man which form part of the wing describe by the highest possible authority as probably the finest squadron in the whole of the british service this follow list of honor be perhaps the most eloquent testimony to the airman 's work in palestine : victorium cross 1 distinguished service order 4 military cross 34 croix de guerre 2 military medal 1 meritorious service medal 14 order of the nile 2 the sum total of the rfc work be not to be calculate merely from death and damage cause to the enemy from the air strategical and tactical reconnaissance form a large part of the daily round and the report bring in always add to we army 's store of information in palestine possibly to a greater extent than in any other theater of war we map-maker have to rely on aerial photograph to supply they with the detail require for military map the best map we have of palestine be those prepare by lieutenant hh kitchener re and lieutenant conder in 1881 for the palestine exploration fund they be still remarkably accurate so far as they go but ` road ' to give the track a description to which they be not entitle have alter and village have disappear and newer and additional information have to be supply the royal fly corps -- it have not yet become the royal air force -- furnish it and all important detail of hundred of square mile of country which survey party could not reach be register with wonderful accuracy by aerial photographer the work begin for the battle of rafa and the enemy position on the magruntein hill be all set out before general chetwode when the desert column attack and score a important victory then when 12000 turk be fortify the welus sheikh nuran country cover the wadi ghuzze and the shellal spring not a redoubt or trench but be record with absolute fidelity on photographic print and long before the turk abandon the place and give we a fine supply of water we have excellent map of the position in time the whole gaza-beersheba line be completely photograph and map be continually revise and if any portion of the turkish system of defence be change or add to the commander in the district concern be notify at once to such perfection do the rfc photographic branch attain that map show full detail of new or altered trench be in the hand of general within four hour of the taking of the photograph later on the work of the branch increase enormously and the result fully repay the infinite care and labor bestow upon it the rfc make long flight in this theater of war and some of they be exceptionally difficult and dangerous a french battleship when bombard a turkish port of military importance have two of we machine to spot the effect of she gunfire to be with the ship when the action open the airman have to fly in darkness for a hour and a half from a distant aerodrome and they both reach the rendezvous within five minute of the appoint time the turk on they line of communication with the hedjaz have a unpleasant recollection of be bomb at maan that be a noteworthy expedition three machine set out from a aerodrome over 150 mile away in a straight line the pilot have to steer a course above country with no prominent landmark they go over a waterless desert so rough that it would have be impossible to come down without seriously damage a plane and if a pilot have be force to land he chance of get back to we country would have be almost nil water bottle and ration be carry in the machine but they be not need for the three pilot come home together after hit the station building at maan and destroy considerable material and supply the aeroplane have be put to many use in war and it may be there be instance on other front of it be use in emergency as a ambulance when a little mobile force round up the turkish post at hassana on the eastern side of the sinaus peninsula one of we man receive so severe a wound that a immediate operation be necessary a airman at once volunteer to carry the wounded man to the nearest hospital forty-four mile away across the desert and by he action a life be save appendix i the follow telegram be send by enver pasha to field-marshal von hindenburg at supreme army command headquarters from constantinople on August 23 1917 : the news of the despatch of strong enemy force to egypt together with the nomination of general allenby as commander-in-chief on we syrian front indicate that the british contemplate a offensive on the syrian front and very probably before the middle of November the preservation of the sinaus front be a primary condition to the success of the yilderim undertaking after a further conversation with the commander of the ivth army -lrb- jemal pasha -rrb- i consider it necessary to strengthen this front by one of the infantry division intend for yilderim and to despatch this division immediately from aleppo with this reinforcement the defense of the sinaus front by the ivth army be assure general von falkenhayn take up the position that he do not consider the defense assure and that the further reduction of yilderim force be to be deprecate under any circumstance he consequently recommend that we on we side should attack the british and as far as possible surprise they before they be strengthen he wish to carry out this attack with four infantry division and the ` asia ' corps two of the four infantry division have still to be despatch to the front i can not yet decide to support the proposal nor need i do so as the transport of a infantry division from aleppo to bayak require twenty day during this period the situation as regard the enemy will become clear and one will become better able to estimate the chance of success of a attack i must however in any case be able to dispose of more force than at present either for the completion of yilderim or for the replacement of the very heavy loss which will certainly occur in the syrian attack i must consequently reiterate to my deep regret my request for the return of the vith army corps -lrb- which be operate at that time in the dobrudja -rrb- and for the despatch of this corps together with the 20th infantry division commence with the 15th infantry division in my opinion the army corps could be replace by bulgarian whose task be unquestionably be lighten through the despatch of troops -lrb- british -rrb- to egypt should this not be the case i would be ready to exchange two division from the vth army for the two infantry division of the vith army corps as the former be only suit for a war of position and would have to be make mobile by the allotment of transport and equipment if these two infantry division be give up the vth army would have only five infantry division of no great fighting value a condition of thing which be perhaps not very desirable for the moment my decision be : defense of syrium by strengthen that front by one infantry division and prosecution of the yilderim scheme should good prospects offer of beat the british decisively in syrium before they have be reinforce i will take up general von falkenhayn 's proposal again as far as it appear possible to carry it out have in view the question of transport and rationing which still have to be settle in some respects -- turkish main headquarters enver ii von falkenhayn despatch the follow telegram from constantinople on August 25 1917 to german general headquarters : the possibility of a british attack in syrium have have to be take into consideration from the begin its repercussion on the irak undertaking be obvious on that account i have already settle in my conversation in constantinople during may that if the center of gravity of operation be transfer to the sinaus front command should be give I there too the news now to hand -- reinforcement of the british troops in egypt take over of command by allenby the demand of the british press daily become louder -- make the preparation of a british attack in syrium probable jemal pasha wish to meet it with a defensive to that end he demand the division and war material which be be collect about aleppo for yilderim the natural result of grant this request will be that true safety will never be attain on the sinaus front by a pure defensive and that the irak undertaking will certainly fritter away owe to want of drive power or to delay i have consequently propose to the turkish higher command to send two division and the ` asia ' corps as quickly as possible to southern syrium so as to carry out a surprise attack on the british by means of a encircle movement before the arrival of they reinforcement railway allow of the assembly of these force -lrb- inclusive of heavy artillery material and technical store -rrb- in the neighborhood of beersheba by the end of October the disposable part of the ivth army -lrb- two to three division -rrb- would be add to it in a discussion between enver jemal and myself enver decide first of all to strengthen the ivth army by the inclusion of one division from the army group this division would suffice to ward off attack the irak undertaking could be carry through at the same time judge from all former experience i be firmly convince as soon as it come to a question of the expect attack on the sinaus front or even if the ivth army only feel itself seriously threaten further troops munitions and material will be withdraw from the army group and turkey 's force will be shatter then nothing decisive can be undertake in either theater of war the sacrifice of man money and material which germany be offer at the present moment will be in vain the treatment of the question be render all the more difficult because i can not rid myself of the impression that the decision of the turkish higher command be base far less on military exigency than on personal motive it be dictate with one eye on the mighty jemal who deprecate a definite decision but yet on the other hand oppose the slightest diminution of the area of he command consequently as the position now stand i consider the irak undertaking practicable only if it be give the necessary freedom for retirement through the removal of the danger on the syrian front the removal of this danger i regard as only possible through attack v falkenhayn iii here be another german estimate of the position create by we war cabinet 's decision to take the offensive in palestine and in consider the view of the german staff and the prospect of success any turkish attack would have it must be bear in mind that under the most favourable circumstance the enemy could not have be in position for take a offensive before the end of October von falkenhayn wish to attack the british ` before the arrival of they reinforcement ' not only have we reinforcement arrive before the end of October but they be all in position and the battle have commence beersheba be take on October 31 this appreciation be write by major von papen of yilderim headquarters on August 28 1917 : enver 's objection the improbability of attain a decisive result on the sinaus front with two division plus the ` asia corps ' and the difficulty of the aleppo-rayak transport question hold good the execution of the offensive with stronger force be desirable but be not practicable as in consequence of the beginning of the rainy weather in the middle of November the british offensive may be expect at the latest during the latter half of October ours therefore should take place during the first part of that month the transport question preclude the assembly of stronger force by that date should the idea of a offensive be abandon altogether on that account on the assumption that general allenby -- after the two unsuccessful british attack -- will attack only with a marked superiority of man and munitions a passive defense on a thirty-five kilometre front with a expose flank do not appear to offer any great chance of success the condition on the western front -lrb- defensive zone attack division -rrb- be only partially applicable here since the mobility of the artillery and the correct tactical handling of the attack division be not assure the intended passive defensive will not be improve by the theatrical attack with one division suggest by general von kress on the contrary this attack would be without result as it would be carry out too obliquely to the front and would only mean a sacrifice of man and material the attack propose by he excellency for the envelopment of the enemy 's flank -- if carry out during the first half of October with four division plus the ` asia corps ' -- will perhaps have no definite result but will at all event result in this : that the gaza front flank by the sea will tie down considerable force and defer the continuation of british operation in the wet season during which in the opinion of general von kress they can not be carry on with any prospect of success the situation on the sinaus front will then be clear naturally it be possible that the position here may demand the inclusion of further effective and the yilderim operation consequently become impracticable this however will only prove that the determine factor of the decisive operation for turkey during the winter of 1917-1918 lie in palestine and not in mesopotamium a offensive on the sinaus front be therefore -- even with reduce force and a limited objective -- the correct solution papen iv _ letter from general kress von kressenstein to yilderim headquarters dated September _ 29 1917 _ on moral of turkish troops _ a question which urgently need regulating be that of deserter accord to my experience they number will increase still more with the setting in of the bad weather and the deterioration of ration civil administration and the gendarmerie fail entirely they often have a secret understanding with the population and be open to bribery the cordon draw by I be too weak to prevent desertion i be also too short of troops to have the necessary raid undertake in the hinterland it be necessary that the hunt for deserter in the area between the front and the line jerusalem-ramleh-jaffa be formally organise under energetic management that one or two squadron exclusively for this service be detail and that a definite reward be pay for bring in each deserter but above all it be necessary that punishment should follow in consequence and that the unfortunately very frequent amnesty of he majesty the sultan be discontinue at least for some time the question of rationing have not be settle we be live continually from hand to mouth despite the binding promise of the headquarters ivth army the valus of damascus the line of communication major bathmann and other that from now on 150 ton of ration should arrive regularly each day from the 24th to the 27th of this month for example a total of 229 ton or only 75 ton per diem have arrive i can not fix the blame for these irregularity the headquarters ivth army have receive the highly gratifying order that at least up to the imminent decisive battle the bread ration be raise to 100 gramme this urgently necessary improvement of the man 's ration remain illusory if a correspondingly larger quantity of flour -lrb- about one wagon per day -rrb- be not supply to we so far the improvement exist only on paper the condition of the animal particularly give cause for anxiety not only be we about 6000 animal short of establishment but as a result of exhaustion a considerable number of animal be ruin daily the majority of division be incapable of operate on account of this shortage of animal the ammunition supply too be gradually come into question on account of the deficiency in animal the menacing danger can only be meet by a regular supply of sufficient fodder the stock of straw in the area of operation be exhaust with gold some barley can still be buy in the country every year during the rainy season the railway be interrupted again and again for period of from eight to fourteen day there be also day and week in which the motor-lorry traffic have to be suspend finally we must calculate on the possibility of a interruption of we rear communication by the enemy i therefore consider it absolutely necessary that at least a fourteen day ' reserve of ration be deposit in the depts at the front as early as possible the increase of troops on the sinaus front necessitate a very considerable increase on the supply of meat from the line of communication area damascus district v the troops of general allenby 's army before the attack on beersheba be
