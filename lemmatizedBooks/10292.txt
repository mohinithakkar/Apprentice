ancient as the bird of wisdom he fully sustain he right to the title by let severely alone the city park while they be still dreary and disgusting waste the only night-bird by which these be then occupy be of the featherless -lrb- and apparently motherless -rrb- kind and be well know to the police they be quite as watchful it be true as the genuine feathered owl that have just commence to give its very extraordinary countenance to the park but then it be with other people 's watch not they own it be with much concern that we hear report of the slaughter of some of these solemn but beautiful owl that have come to ventilate they wisdom among we the report in question be very definite and unmistakable most of they proceed from revolver handle by member of the municipal police force while other emanate from the barrel of shot-gun wield by beery teuton who rush frantically out from they sawdust lair when they be tell that the game be up -- that be that a owl be up a tree this be scurvy treatment for the visitor to put a head on a owl which be already provide with one so large and so comical appear to be a work both superfluous and inhuman the only apology for it in this instance be that these night-bird of prey be suppose by the police to have be attract to the park by the prospect of succulent supper on the very well-fed sparrow by which these resort be now thickly tenant the owl hoot at this notion but they hooting be only answer by shooting and the poor foolish bird of wisdom have be stuff with tow instead of sparrow and set up to form the nucleus of a ornithological rogue ' gallery in the city hall on visit the battery a few day ago one of the park-keeper -lrb- himself look in he bright new uniform somewhat like a blue-jay -rrb- express he conviction that next

which the wide esplanade that stretch away to the water 's edge will soon be bristle honest but mistaken young man as well might he have say that the sea-wall -lrb- a very substantial one by the way -rrb- would build its nest in the melancholy pine but it be reasonable to hope that pine grossbeak will find they way thither and that the german flute of various finch will provide for the come bavarian and hessian -lrb- should any be leave after the siege of pari and the _ sortie _ of the truculent trochu -rrb- a welcome such as have not heretofore be accord to the stranger who at castle garden first set foot upon we shore the bowling green -- late a nuisance and a pandemonium now a oasis of verdure -- have not as yet report its owl but the public eye be upon it and the nocturnal marauder may yet be detect in the fork of the great willow-tree which still retain they verdure the sparrow be almost disproportionately numerous in this small park but this may be account for it have lately be lay down with new grass the green tender blade of which just now begin to crop out be probably mistake by the bird for sparrow-grass munificently provide for they by the commissioner in all

word however be likely to find considerable extension and if any provider for the public maw should choose hereafter to call he dining-saloon a carnivorium none would have a right to cavil at he on

of the republic 1870 i do not believe a word of it say the king with a impatient stamp of the foot and a deprecatory wave of the hand -- not a word of it you see dear punchinello the situation be thus : i have undertake not indeed without grave misgiving to propitiate he majesty after the failure of the thiers-bismarck negotiation and if possible procure such term as would save parisian from the galling necessity of immolate the monkey of the _ jardin des plantes _ to the popular demand for something to eat i think as a american citizen and you correspondent my proposition _ might _ have some chance of be favorably entertain especially as i know that the english minister 's present of stilton cheese and many dozen of bass ' bottled ale to bismarck have fail to prevent the current of the chancellor 's prejudice from run strongly in favor of american thus morally armed and bearing in my pocket a _ passe-partout _ from prussian headquarters i approach versaille on the second evening after the departure of m thier and find the king occupy the apartment in the central pavilion of the palace which have once be the sleeping-chamber of loui xvi and he unhappy spouse marie antoinette many alteration have take place since i be last there and see the wretched queen from the balcony endeavor to assuage the fierce mob that surge beneath the room be not like the room in which i once help loui to pull off he boot and the delicate perfume that usually pervade the apartment of french royalty have succumb to the amalgamated odor of _ schweitzer kase _ and _ saur kraut _ it be apparent sire say i to william who be sit there that count bismarck have wholly misunderstand the situation in paris not a bit of it say the king do not i know well enough they have get down to two ounce a day for each man and horse meat at that you forget sire they vast supply of ass do i indeed when they have do nothing but develop a unlimited number of they ever since the war begin i have a idea then that he majesty must have mean this for sarcasm though my own experience tell I that it be only too true and it also occur to I that i be not in my true station as the representative of a government of ass nothing but a stern sense of duty prevent I from clear out at once under this last harrowing reflection accordingly i return to the charge with diminish vigor assure the king that if he army keep on blockade paris in this cruel sort of way the population would soon be die by thousand it be very strange why he would not draw off he troops what do _ he _ want with pari what have pari do to _ he _ be not there plenty of other city in this world that do not care a cent how much he bombard they -lrb- i begin to think that possibly i might be grow childish in my method of state

go for sidon where be tuckahoo new jersey would new york care if tuckahoo be reduce to the level of its original swamp moreover there be lot of city away off in china yearning to have the ray of modern civilization let into they would it be anything out of he way to travel in that direction with a few big krupp gun and give civilization a fair opening to get in at be not it cowardly to be punch all the time at one poor miserable little town like pari that be not big enough to help itself and would not have do the same by he no matter if it get ever so many high old chance think of it oh think of it my royal brother i say lay a hand on each of he royal shoulder he take my hand off and tell bismarck to bring he a wisp-broom it be a cruel insult but i stand unmoved in the midst of it perhaps at some future hour and place you majesty we may meet under different circumstance that be a proposition he exhibit no disposition to deny at this juncture a courier arrive from the front breathless with excitement and speechless too the king seize he by the back of the neck and shake he violently but the poor fellow could not articulate a word i suggest that cold key be put down he back and he foot thrust into the fire that bring he to so fast that i get behind a arm-chair for protection in a few seconds he gather voice enough to say : s-s-sire p-p-p-pari be e-eatin ' u-u-up the m-m-mon-monkeys fatal news it be all up with my museum pari reduce to monkey and no treaty sign horrible catastrophe i offer myself to satan for a good lie -- anything i do not care what to clinch
