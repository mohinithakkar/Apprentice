produce by distribute proofreader government and rebellion a sermon deliver in the north broad street presbyterian church Sunday morning April 28 1861 by rev e e adam publish by request 1861 government and rebellion a evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be send against he -- prov xvii 11 we have in these word this plain announcement -- that rebellion be a crime and shall be visit with terrible judgment solomon here speak he own conviction god declare he thought and utter he sanction of law this be also the expression of natural conscience -- vindicate in we breast the divine procedure when the majesty of insulted government be assert and penalty apply god never overlook rebellion against he throne -- never pardon the rebel until he repent and submit god do not command we to forgive we offend fellow-men unless they repent if thy brother trespass against thee seven time in a day and seven time in a day turn to thee say i repent thou shalt forgive he god be in a forgiving attitude so ought we to be but he do not _ express _ forgiveness until the rebel express penitence neither be we under obligation to _ pronounce _ a enemy forgive until he signify he compunction and sorrow and desist from he injurious conduct if my child rebel against my law and my rightful discipline i be not allow by the spirit of love to pursue he with vengeance neither be i bind by the law of god to release he from the penalty of he sin until he shall have exhibit sign of submission of sorrow and of obedience i may pity he and cherish toward he the _ spirit _ of forgiveness but for he own sake for the order of the household and on account of my innate sense of justice i must not pronounce he acquittal nor declare the controversy end until he shall have satisfy my governmental authority and the sentiment of justice which both he own conscience and mine constitutionally and therefore by necessity cherish and i do not see that government can safely pardon a rebel against its statute its honor and its common brotherhood until he rebellion cease until he bow to law confess he crime and signify he sorrow i speak not of oppressive government of iniquitous law but of _ good _ government of statute healthful humane equal although in the former case rebellion can not be justify until every constitutional measure have be resort to for redress -- then if redress be not give the voice of the people in all representative government may legally change oppressive for just law and oppressor for ruler who shall regard the popular will and in despotism when the people have the _ power _ to redress they wrong and to enter on a career of development in mind and moral in the art of civilization -- when every other course fail -- resistance to tyrant be obedience to god man be not _ make _ for tyranny he be not make for any form of government that crush out he intellect and he religious capability he be make to be govern morally to be under righteous law law which while it restrain passion selfishness and crime give a man all the freedom that he be able and willing to _ use _ safely for himself and for the commonwealth all that be consistent with individual development and the national good i be not one of those who believe that the voice of the people be without exception the voice of god it be not so at the deluge but quite the reverse it be not so when israel clamor for a king -- not in mercy but in anger god give they they request it be not so when absalom steal the heart of the people and stir up rebellion against he father and yet when a nation independent of party free from the excitement of momentary interest without the influence of ambitious leader under the calm guidance of reason history and the spirit of the age -- rise spontaneously against oppression against iniquity and _ demand _ just law rights for all free thought free speech free labor free worship when compact be not violate when moderation be maintain when the spirit of humanity be preserve -- _ then _ i believe the voice of the people _ be _ the voice of god i have no question that in the great principle cromwell and he puritan host be right in they revolutionary action i could never doubt that we father do a noble glorious and christian deed in throw off the yoke of britain and proclaim a new government for themselves and they posterity it be right to contend and bleed for equal representation for freedom of conscience and for a independent nationality in which these high end could be secure the first government of which we have account be a theocracy -- that be the government of god _ he _ be the only king he reveal the law appoint leader give rule for worship instruction and warfare thus in the outset do he set up he claim among man he establish the great precedent which man ought to have follow which the world have ignore but to which the thought and the will of the race shall ultimately return it be true _ now _ that government as such be ordain of god all government in its elemental authority be a theocracy all power be of god he ordain law he originate the idea of civil compact while therefore the principle of government among man may be defective and the administration wrong and hurtful the great _ fact _ of government be a _ divine fact good _ government be _ emphatically god 's _ government -- intend to suppress evil to promote holiness and happiness the power that be be ordain of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation despiser of government be enumerate by the apostle as among the most flagitious of man there be _ statute _ in almost every government which may not be absolutely right some which may be oppressive these be to be distinguish from the principle from the general bearing of a government and endure for the good therein or be rid of by constitutional and safe method it be a duty of each subject and citizen to surrender some of he desire and preference -- some of he conviction possibly -- for the _ general _ sentiment -- the comprehensive good while he have the privilege of convincing by fair argument all other and win they to he view and measure if possible without violence without infringement of law it be not to be expect that every man should be absolutely satisfy with any government if he be call to yield only he share of personal interest and preference for the sake of all the protection and blessing in which he participate in common with the state he reason he conscience he patriotism will joyfully acquiesce he will freely make so much sacrifice for the interest of the whole know very well that every other citizen be likely to be under a equal sacrifice natural individual liberty without law be only barbarism where every man be free to do whatever he worst passion prompt there be in fact no freedom there be tyranny for the strong will subdue the weak bone and muscle will govern mind and conscience in law and government man have they best thought human _ law _ be likely to be better than human nature man feel the need of restraint -- be convinced of the necessity of law they therefore make law in self-defence if thereby they would _ not _ restrain they own selfishness they _ would _ restrain the selfishness of other but that which be make a barrier to _ one _ bad subject be also a defense against all -- thus man do restrain themselves by they defence against other thus it be that with healthful conviction man may control diseased passion with a right _ ideal _ be intimately join a safe actuality with good law a comparatively good condition even in the worst administration and when the public mind be most demoralize there may remain the purity of law the sublime thought if the mind find itself sink into lawlessness and disorganism and bear away by the pressure of evil it can look upward and catch new energy from the unquenched light -- spring into the realm of the ideal we destiny be ideal we be on we way to the unseen the ideal draw we upward -- _ real _ now to the spirit of just man make perfect -- to be real to we when we be perfect -- _ once _ ideal to they as now to we we must keep above we the model of life and of law which we have not yet attain let it never be dim it be a star shine through time 's night a banner wave from the throne of god it tell we of the goal it point out we futurity -- the altitude of we virtue we exaltation we bliss we subject be government and man we proceed to consider it in a three-fold aspect inquire i _ what be good government _ ii _ what constitute rebellion against such government _ iii _ what be the duty of each citizen when rebellion exist _ i _ what be a good government _ no citizen look for a absolutely perfect form of nationality -- of law but we have a right to ask for good government we have be accustom to think that it depend more on administration than on principle and the line of the poet that which be best administer be best be a proverb to the sentiment of which we too freely yield no doubt a government with bad statute and wrong law may be so administer as to produce a tolerable degree of national comfort and development for a season while a constitution perfect in its theory and principle may be so maladminister as to corrupt and distract impoverish and demoralize a people and yet i agree with a old patriot of the past century who say there be no foundation to imagine that the goodness or badness of any government depend solely upon its administration it must be allow that the ultimate design of government be to restrain the corruption of human nature and since human nature be the same at all time and in all place the same form of government which be best for one nation be best for all nation if they would _ only agree to adopt _ it there be a deep thought in this remark we often say for example france be not fit for a republican form of government and it be true but that be _ not _ to say a republican form of government be not fit for france if the population would agree to adopt and preserve it man in he fallen state be not fit for the holy government of god but that holy government be nevertheless the _ only _ one that be fit for man as a moral being and it be man 's ignorance and folly he guilt and ruin that he do not adopt it it be owe to the ignorance and wickedness of the world that it be not fit for a representative government and that all do not choose christ to be they king be a score of the professional politician of we land to frame a constitution for we in full accordance with they own scheme and choice we would soon find ourselves under a oligarchy of schemer who care for the republic only so far as to secure from it they own fame and emolument be as many broker or merchant to make and administer we law without regard to other industrial interest we should have a oligarchy of trade be as many husbandman or mechanic or lawyer to have full control of we legislation and government we would have one interest towering above all other and true equalization true brotherhood just representation healthful nationality would be impossible or be we dependent on officer in the army or navy for we government legislative and administrative we would be likely to have many of we rights circumscribe be as many clergyman to frame a constitution and administer law we might be under a crush priesthood a government of mere scholar poet or orator would be only a sublime dream a constitution of philosophy alone would glitter with abstraction beautiful cold grand as the snow-capt alp and as distant too from the actuality of man a government of mere gentleman who have nothing to do but think for slave to enjoy the chase and the race-ground to extol they pedigree and traduce labor and lead retainer to war -- would be a government for the few over the many a aristocracy of blood and privilege of curl moustache and taper finger but not a republic of patriot of self-made man of equal privilege and just law it would be a return to semi-barbarism to the age of loui xiv or even of charle i this be now the strong tendency in the rebel state : even along we free border but below it such be the system of representation that a county contain only about 3000 inhabitant send as many representative to the legislature as another county of 30000 and a single proprietor cast as many vote as a whole commune so much liberty of citizen be already sacrifice to the chevalier to the system of forced service but be a select number of experienced man of true statesman embrace different pursuit and profession educate in different part of the world and draw together by grand national event -- statesman bear in the age when liberty have its first grand revival and be guard by soberness of thought and try by every variety and extent of sacrifice -- by man who have no professional exclusive interest to provide for but who expect to fight and die for they conviction who seek only to lay the foundation of a nationality for future generation and for the world who aim at a healthful union of all popular interest both among poor and rich among master and dependent who provide for freedom of action under law of worship and education of commerce agriculture and the art for the easy and equitable support of government -- for its perpetuity indeed infuse into it element that appeal powerfully both to the self-interest and the patriotism of the citizen -- i say be such man with such end in view by such sacrifice to frame such a government contain the most delicate balance of interest with strong check against the encroachment of any branch either the legislative executive or judicial give all trade and profession and all man a equal chance for excellence influence and honor you would not hesitate to pronounce that a good government even though you might find slight exception to some of its term though you might not interpret as other do all its constitutional phrase in view of the protection which such a constitution afford especially if it have be test for a period of eighty year by all the inward strain of domestic evil and all the outward pressure of invasion by the influence of foreign envy of intrigue of hostility by the debase power of disloyalty the incompetency of ruler and the general degeneracy of human nature i say in view of all these untoward influence the government which could still retain its majesty and power still stretch its aegis over every national and individual right -- you would pronounce the best both for ruler and people that ever bless a nation and you would not hesitate to declare _ that _ man a _ traitor _ who should attempt _ to weaken _ and destroy it now we pretend to say that _ we _ government be thus form by the choicest wisdom and patriotism of the world with the largest liberty in view under the restraint of law give equitable privilege to all its citizen and so balance its different department that they be mutually a defense we pretend to claim for we government the loftiest purpose the most comprehensive view and the best practical result we claim for it justice equality and power it do not stand out -- a thing distinct from the people and the state it be not a objective power only but subjective it be in every state and in every freeman it be not in machinery which can be set in motion and work out certain result as if every part of it be iron or steel and put into action by apply heat but in _ man _ in mind in heart in the family circle in the church in every throb of patriotism in every fiber of the husbandman and the artizan in the pastor 's prayer and the student 's living thought it be in the _ nation _ like latent fire like a hidden life -- evoke in time of peril and flash along the telegraph breathe in song utter in oratory thunder from the cannon 's mouth hang out in streaming banner whose every hue be bear in heaven feel in firm resolve illustrate in response to the call of country and of law where be we government not at washington alone that be but its symbol it be throughout all we loyal state it be enthrone on the granite hill of new hampshire send its voice along the alleghany and on the swell flood of the mississippus and spread its wing over the child of the west even to the shore of oregon it live in every cottage and every mansion and have a throne in every true free noble christian heart that it be a _ good _ government you have only in imagination to blot from the face of the earth whatever have grow up under its protection and encouragement by the will and the blessing of the almighty during the fourscore year of its existence level all the city sink the commerce prostrate the school and church obliterate all the science history and think it have foster quench the light of oratory turn back the wheel of improvement and leave we at the opening of 1776 estimate all the freedom of act of utterance of industry reckon the sum of human comfort even of luxury it have bring to we hand look at all we ship we mechanism we home we sanctuary we institution of morality of mercy and of religion we wealth intelligence order power consider the elevation give to million in the worst form of civilization in the land show that such be the vitalize force of we national life that even slavery here bad as it be -- and we know of nothing worse as a system -- lift man above the natural license of savage existence consider all this and much more that i may not stop to utter and you can not -- you _ do _ not -- no sane mind _ can _ question the supreme excellence -- i have almost say the _ divine _ excellence -- of we government and if there be need of other proof we have only to remind you with what promptness the call of we noble chief magistrate be answer from every free state -- from the city and the hamlet from the bank the bar the press and the pulpit from the workshop and the soil from the calm and comfort of home and ease and affluence and from the cottage of the poor as if the pulse of the government be beat in every vein and the will of the cabinet have its home in every bosom strong man young man aged man man of leisure christian man -- all ready to march under the star and stripe or to pour out they treasure for other mother and wife and sister with break heart and tremulous benediction bid the hero go -- offer they on they country 's altar oh it would not be thus but for the true manhood which we government infuse into loyal citizen it would not be so but for the christianity it protect without dictation and acknowledge without ostentation ii we come now to the question _ what constitute rebellion against good government _ there may be criminal rebellion even against a wicked and oppressive government the people may take the law into they own hand and put to death or imprison they ruler without _ first _ have try constitutional method of redress but i speak of rebellion against _ good _ government -- such as we have already have in review there be a difference between insurrection and rebellion the former be a act of a people or population against a single statute or against a portion of the legislative enactment without necessarily grow into warfare or revolt against the whole constitution and the law this may become rebellion there be also a difference between rebellion and revolution the latter in a political sense be a change either wholly or in part of the constitution this may be effect by argument and a peaceful vote -- by abdication by a change of national policy in view of some new relation and by general consent or by warfare the revolution in england in 1688 be occasion by the abdication of jame ii the establishment of the house of orange on the throne and the restore of the constitution to its primitive state we revolution of '76 and onward be not a rebellion it be resistance of oppression of burdensome taxation without equal representation and it result in we distinct nationality the revolution of france have be of a similar character they have spring from oppression of the most severe and unnatural kind this be the fact at least in 1797 and in 1830 in 1848 when it be my lot to be in the midst of it the revolution arise from the selfish conduct of loui philippe who enrich himself and he family out of the national treasury and encourage he son in a course which be at war with national precedent with the commercial interest and democratic individualism of the french for with they imperial prestige and taste they be extreme in they personal democracy but all these revolution result in good to the people education public spirit enterprise labor all the art of civilization and even evangelical christianity receive a new impulse mind be open and enlarged the people think for themselves and sigh for knowledge and a better faith revolution be go on silently from year to year in england the nobility yield by slow almost imperceptible degree to the demand of the people it be by this process that the government avoid the shock which startle austrium france and italy such be the variety of honest opinion among man on all subject so different be the degree of information and the opportunity of judge with regard to the best measure of government such a diversity exist in the interest and ability of a people -- that they may be good citizen without be satisfied altogether with the constitution or with those who administer its law there will be different political party it be the glory of a government that the people be allow to think and vote as they please and to express they honest opinion perhaps with we expression be too free especially in regard to public man and measure we may have diverse view and conviction and yet feel and act loyally but man who endeavor by any influence or mean to lessen the loyalty of other to alienate the love of the people from the government and who signify they own aversion not by condemn a single statute and seek its lawful repeal but by heap abuse on the constitution and on those who be choose to administer the law by avow they hostility to the government and its policy or they purpose to resist and war against it -- be in a posture of rebellion those who be in office command the arm and other property of the government cause they to be remove so as to weaken its power and strengthen those in actual rebellion or who be threaten the same those who aid and comfort a population or soldiery who be in a state of actual resistance and finally those who do openly and avowedly renounce the authority of the government to which they have swear allegiance or take up arm to attack its stronghold seize or destroy its property or injure the soldier and citizen who be send to protect it -- be in a state of rebellion against its law and against the commonwealth over which it hold the shield of its authority korah be a rebel and a traitor who have by intrigue inspire some other leader with the spirit of sedition succeed in draw from they allegiance to mose and aaron a large number of the people who come together in a mob to demand a different administration they be invite to refer the matter to the divine decision but they stoutly refuse accuse mose of assumption thus endeavor to destroy he authority over the nation that be rebellion again in the reign of david he son absalom draw the people from they allegiance then seize the rein of government and pursue he father with a army that be rebellion against wholesome law against the will of god now we have the painful fact before we that rebellion have spring up against we good government man in many quarter have secretly plot and openly avowed hostility to we federal union eight of we state have pass the ordinance of secession four or five other be assume a attitude of hostility to the general government or refuse to comply with the executive who call on they to aid in the defense of the capital this state of thing have be precede by act of treachery on the part of lead man in the state by seizure of arm money and public defence -- the property of the government a new confederacy be form contrary to oath and compact for the purpose of destroy we union and give perpetuity to slavery it have attack we fort adulterate we coin steal we arm proclaim piracy against we commerce set a price on the head of we chief magistrate threaten we capital and raise army to exterminate if possible we nationality and all this it have do without one act of the government to provoke such procedure without any oppression without any threat but in the face of every honorable proposal on we part after long and patient endurance of they encroachment and plunder even until foreign journal deride we for we forbearance and the rebel themselves insult we delay there be those who have compare this rebellion with we revolution of '76 there could hardly be a wider distinction both in principle and in fact than between these two movement the colony have be oppress by navigation law intend by the british parliament to crush out they commerce for a whole century from 1660 to 1775 they weakness during that period do not allow of resistance they be tax oppressively while they be not allow a representation this be in violation of magna charta for the government of great britain be representative have be aid by the colonist during the seven year ' war in the subjugation of canada the parent government -- without ask taxation through the regular action of the colonial government -- assume the right to tax we expand commerce and commence a vigorous enforcement of revenue law writ of assistance be issue whereby officer of the king be allow to break open any citizen 's store or dwelling to search for and seize foreign merchandise sheriff also be compel to assist in the work the sanction of private life might by this act be invade at any time by hireling and bad as it be in itself it be liable to more monstrous abuse then come the _ sugar bill _ impose enormous duty on various article of merchandise from the west indy and greatly crippling colonial commerce : then the infamous stamp act by which every legal instrument in order to validity must have the seal of the british government -- deed diploma & c cost from thirty-six cent to ten dollar apiece : then the duty on tea and finally the quartering of soldier on we citizen in time of peace for the express purpose of subjugate we industry and energy to the selfish purpose of the crown it be enough to say that the rebel against we government have suffer no oppression they do not set forth any legal ground of secession the government have do nothing to call out they indignation or to inflict on they a wrong they have have more than they share of public office they have have a larger representation in proportion to they free citizen than we have they have be protect in they claim even against the conviction of the north we yield as a political demand what we do not wholly admit as a christian duty we have assist they by enactment by money and by arm in the preservation of a system at war with we conscience and with we liberty we have pay for land which they occupy and after all they indignity and taunt and attack on we citizen they plunder and they warlike demonstration we have be patient and be even now impose on ourselves restraint from the execution of that chastisement which many of they sober and awed citizen acknowledge to be just and which if the call be make by the executive would at once be hurl on the rebel by a indignant people like the rush of destiny now i grant for i do not wish to make the matter worse than it be against they that in the north individual have demand more than the south be able at once to give some have push reform faster than it would bear faster than the law of providence would allow but it be honestly and conscientiously do we have sometimes in we warmth utter irritating word but all this have be return by blow and by savage vindictiveness we have show a willingness of late to yield some thing to abide by the sense of the whole people but these state be by they ruler declare _ out of the union _ without appeal to the people they have commence the war and now they be regard by the whole world as in a state of rebellion not of justifiable revolution they would submit to no method of adjustment that we could honorably allow they desire war as they have be for year prepare for it at the expense of the government and in its service and trust draw they life from the bosom which they now sting and because freedom will no longer bow as it have do for a whole generation to they will they rebel proclaim a system of piracy and threaten the subjugation of the whole american people it be a deep and long determine treason run into the whole national life and be become to ourselves a question of _ personal _ liberty iii what then we ask _ be the duty of all citizen when good government be assail by rebellion _ doubtless _ one _ duty be to inquire whether they have in any way contribute criminally to the occasion or the cause of such rebellion whether they have demand too much of the disaffected or encourage a wrong spirit in they by coincide with view lead to they present attitude whether they have participate in any way with a policy calculate to irritate to defy to provoke honest mind to anger whether as individual as christian they have be bitter and harsh and vengeful or be so now and if they find any such spirit it become they to repent and school themselves into christian charity and moderation but notwithstanding any possible error in the past the christian citizen must consecrate himself to the defense of the government and its _ policy _ for however there be a distinction ordinarily between the two in a crisis that involve a nation 's life the policy which would save it be the spirit of government and order the true christian will pray and speak and write and labor and die for its success will give assurance of he sympathy and support and refuse to do any act that can be construe into _ comfort _ to the rebel he will encourage troops call to support the government and its policy give they food clothing advice bible and arm he will rouse they patriotism and call down on they the benediction of heaven this be the duty of minister and magistrate of church and individual christian and if the rebellion continue it be they duty to advocate and help to form army of sufficient number and power to utterly subjugate the rebel and if they can not otherwise be bring to submit put a end to they existence that be what god do by the hand of israel to korah and absalom and it be the legitimate issue if need be of all successful resistance -- of all defensive warfare to deny it be to deny the right of self-defence it be to put a man in a position where he must love he enemy better than himself and child which even christianity do not demand though it do enjoin forbearance charity and sacrifice to deny this be to condemn the principle of we revolution and to sanction the plunder and destruction of national property and be what therefore be we duty now that rebellion actually rage against we mild equal good government -- the best on the whole that the world ever see rebellion without cause with no legitimate ground of offence rebellion for the sake of a dark and demoralizing system that have rob half the nation of its conscience and curse it with a inveterate idolatry what be we duty what be mine as a citizen a christian a minister of god -- as a man what be yours plainly to ask what have i -- either by demand too much not in abstract right but in the light of present possibility -- contribute towards this fearful condition what by my love of money my sanction of oppression my apology for wrong my complaint against government my support of wrong principle my neglect to vote and pray for the right my boast of national greatness my worship of power and neglect of goodness my forgetfulness of god what by all these and more that i do not think of have i do palpably possibly toward bring on this terrible crime against justice humanity and law then it be my duty to repent of all this and deplore it it be also my duty to strive against personal hatred and revenge and to pray for my country 's enemy just as i would for my own and _ because _ they be my own -- not that they prosper in they rebellion but that they repent and find mercy and acknowledge the authority against which they be at war it be we duty specially to pity and pray for the multitude of good citizen and they family who can not escape from among the rebel and who be in great jeopardy man who love law and the constitution and the whole country who be either resist under the greatest pressure the evil that be upon they or yield through fear and force we feel for they we call they we brother but it be also my duty and yours to support we government -- we administration to pray for and sympathize with we president and he cabinet in they most try posture in the midst of such peril and with so meager means for the moment of establish order and set the nationality in permanent security it be we duty to report traitor to the police that they may be lawfully care for to help we militia and volunteer with every comfort and defense to hold up the arm of government so long as rebel remain this be _ we _ country buy with blood it be second only to the redemption which christ purchase for we and if we be call to contend with principality and power and spiritual wickedness in high place for the safety of we soul surely we may contend with flesh and blood with rebel and traitor to save this glorious inheritance from the gulf of anarchy and the bond of a lasting servitude _ war be terrible _ but slavery and plunder and the silent gangrene of national dishonor bribery and perverted conscience be worse the burst of a thunder cloud may break down a forest of lofty pine but the slow delving of the mole may undermine a thousand habitation the secret corrosion of the ship-worm will sink a fleet this deep-working inward ruin be appear on the face of society the stupendous fact be that from baltimore onward throughout the disaffected state the population be under the guidance of mad leader and expose to mob power thousand of good citizen be fly to we for protection thousand more force into the war against the country and other thousand sigh and pray in secret that god will give success to we arm and rescue themselves and they family from ruin for these as well as for we liberty and honor be we summon to war it be a crime to be inactive the bible be militant christianity be a warfare with sin life be militant -- a perpetual fight with death if we blessing be worth pray for and praise for they be worth _ fighting _ for and if not to be otherwise secure _ must be fight for _ i want this country to live i want my child to grow up under its shield i want to see constitutional liberty mount above the obstacle of age and rise higher and higher here i want italy to look toward we now with hope i can not bear to hear the cry of shame that will come over the atlantic from the vineyard of france from the glacier of switzerland and from the steppe of russium if we permit the wall of we blood-bought inheritance to be break down for the sake of god liberty religion all over the earth i want we flag to be honor abroad in the french revolution of '48 a deputation come to I to demand the american church at havre for the purpose of hold a political meeting i refuse they intimate that it would be tear down i have only to assure they that i would plant we flag on it and if they touch it with rude hand they would have to answer to we government that be the last of the matter this power we must have still and to secure this the whole north and west must awake and act -- for the multitude who in the border state demand we aid for the thousand of labor suffer poor who tremble beneath the glance of the proud chevalier for the sake of we education we land we home we christianity we be sure that success on we part now will demonstrate to the world the inherent power of we nation they can not behold the united action and offering of _ nineteen million _ in the free state -- all animated with the spirit of liberty religion and law and resolve to crush treason and rebellion at any cost -- without a deeper conviction of we real might without a new impression of the majesty that repose in a people 's will all europe approve of this war and struggle nationality look with anxious expectancy for the issue it be a war for government for order it be against the power and rage of the mob lead on by ambitious man who be mad at the loss of power there be nothing more sublime than law hold unseen the heart and interest of million protect they rights and give they full happy development we flag represent law liberty sublime sacrifice national life it be therefore right even for the christian to fight for its perpetuity if i may defend myself and family the nation be greater than my family and myself and call more powerfully for my service and this war enter on by necessity and with the grand purpose of protect order and law and rescue a whole population from ruin be inspiring in its motive and therefore elevate in its influence we be consciously better nobler in proportion as we forget ourselves in the sublime idea of we nationality and all that this nationality can do when man fight for plunder or victory alone they labor downward they become brutish but a war for true liberty for national life for we home and we inheritance and for the oppressed be elevate purify war be terrible in itself and in some of its consequence but there be a bow on the cloud when the bolt have spend itself in the pestiferous air all nature be bright and glorious with true discipline soldier be make vigorous in body they be also quicken in mind by the tactic and incitement of warfare they be ennoble by high motive and may leave the campaign better than when they enter it courage be awaken love of liberty and order inspire benevolence increase and loyalty exalt by this war what man bleed for they value i have be delighted with the eagerness with which many soldier whom i have visit listen to christian address and receive the word of god it be a matter of gratulation that but few arrest be make in we city in these day not because the police be less watchful but because the debased portion of the population be inspire with a better think it be also hopeful to find that many who enter we city as volunteer or as draft soldier be actually be reform from they evil habit under the greater strictness of camp discipline we be cheer also by the fact that the people generally be more earnest than formerly in they attendance on divine worship more solemn and full of feeling and disposed to study the bible they need god they look to god we all feel the bible to be more than ever precious its solemn prophecy be swell into fulfillment the day of god be approach and the kingdom of the earth be give way for the come of the great king the feeling be and ought to be intense for the conflict let the question be decide let half a million of freeman be call when the time shall indicate to form a line of fire along the boundary that separate secession from loyalty let they take up they mighty march through the revolt territory if it will not otherwise submit and proclaim as they go liberty throughout the land let the flag that wave over the suffering hero of valley forge and the conqueror of yorktown wave forever on the capitol and over every village and subject in the land nay it must be so we must bow if we do not conquer they have proclaim it come down then from the northern mountain and out from the forest and the field ye son of the pilgrim with you firm force of will and you
