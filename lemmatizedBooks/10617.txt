the herr deserve to be call the king he give work to thousand of people and food to million many town exist because of he if he fail to visit we sea these big town would shrink to tiny village there be several interesting kind of herr but we will first look at the one we know so well which be such good food either fresh or as dry kipper or bloater the herr love to swim in a _ shoal _ from the time he leave the egg during he babyhood and all through he life he explore the sea with thousand of other herring crowd round he he name be from a foreign word -- _ heer _ or _ herr _ a _ army _ he enemy -- ourselves among they -- find this habit of he a good one it make he such easy prey here be a dense shoal of fish move slowly along near the surface to catch some be quite easy the dolphin or shark or other large fish-hunter merely have to rush into they rank with wide-open mouth horde of dog-fish feast on the edge of the shoal and gannet cormorant gull and other sea-bird can take they fill with ease the herr shoal be a banquet at which the fish-eating sea creature feed heartily and man come along to spread he net in the path of the shoal but what matter a few million herring when the sea be pack with billion more in the north sea one shoal be see which be over four mile long and two mile wide in such a mass there would be at the very least twenty thousand million herring and this shoal be but one out of many thousand shoal one might as well try to count the grain of sand on the shore as the herring in the wide ocean these huge shoal do not stay long in one part of the sea they make journey of many mile each shoal seem to keep to itself like every other creature the herr go where he food be what food do he find he swallow the small life of the sea tiny transparent thing like baby shrimp prawn crab and so on which swarm even in the cold water which the herr love they be good juicy food these little mite and very plentiful so no wonder the herr become plump he eat greedily of this good food for instance a young herr pick up on the beach at yarmouth be find to contain no less than one hundred and forty-three small shrimp not a bad dinner for a fish the length of this page the ocean teem with small creature even the huge greenland whale feed on they and the herr seem to live on little else well the shoal of herr begin to move from they feeding place in the deep and come nearer the coast as they get to shallower water they be crowd together near the surface where be they go and why perhaps you can guess -- they seek warmer shallower water in which to lay they egg now be the time for the fisherman if the herr keep to the deep they would be quite safe -- and we should have no nice plump herring on we breakfast table yes now be the time to spread out mile of net in the path of this living mass of silvery fish they be in fine condition well feed and ready to lay they egg they be move slowly but surely towards the right place where those egg should be lay what guide they why do they go _ this _ way and not _ that _ in the vast ocean we do not really know what guide they so we say that they obey a wonderful unfailing guide -- instinct of course you have see and taste the hard roe of a herr but i do not suppose you have ever trouble to count all those little round egg each roe contain some thirty thousand of they what a huge number of young one for one herr still this be not a large family as fish family go the cod lay about nine million egg at last the herring reach the breed grounds that they seek and the egg be lay the egg of most sea-fish just drift on the surface of the ocean at the mercy of they enemy and wash here and there as the current send they the herring 's egg sink to the bottom and be rather sticky adhere wherever they fall there they lie in mass on the bed of the sea and then guest of all kind hasten to enjoy such a rare feast of egg lay ready for they one of the first guest be the haddock he come in he thousand greedy for he part of the good food but know this the fisherman also hasten to the spot and the haddock pay dearly for he love of herr egg only a few out of each thousand egg will escape they enemy and the baby herring which hatch in about a fortnight run many danger thus in the end the huge family of mr herr be reduce to a small one even so there be countless number of the tiny fish they soon grow shine scale like those of they parent and move towards the coast it be a pretty sight these little silvery herring play in the shallow water million of they dart about and flash in the sunshine during the summer month round we coast sea-bird and other enemy hover round to feast on the tiny fish great number of these baby herring be catch and sell as whitebait the older herring have lay they egg leave the shallows and make they way into deep water they be no longer nice to eat and the herr harvest be over until the follow season in we talk on flat-fish we shall notice how they be catch near the bed of the sea in the _ trawl-net _ now this net be of no use for the capture of herring they swim in the open water near the surface and so another kind of trap the _ drift-net _ be use hundred of vessel sail from we fishing port when king herring be about each vessel carry a number of drift-net these net be to be let down like a hang wall in the path of the shoal at night cork or bladder be fasten to the upper edge of the net of course they be all mend and make ready before the vessel reach the fishing grounds it be not easy to know where to shoot the net all the skill and knowledge of the fisherman be need to locate the shoal and without this knowledge he would come home with a empty vessel even as it be he sometimes catch no more fish than would fill he hat a sharp look-out be keep a oily gleam in the sea tell the know fisherman that the shoal be there or he may see a gull swoop down and carry off a herr then the net be put out in the path of the shoal a big fleet of fishing vessel may let down a thousand mile of net the herring not see the fine wall of net swim into it now the opening in the net -- the mesh -- be one inch across just wide enough for the herr to poke he head through once through he be catch he gill-cover prevent he from draw back again thousand of other herring be hold tight all around he and the rest of the shoal scatter for the time be when the net be haul in the fisherman behold a mighty catch a sight to repay he for all he trouble on be take from its watery home each herr be dead almost at once -- as dead as a herr then come the race to the market once in port the vessel be rapidly empty hundred of thousand of shine silvery body be pile on the quay -- a sight worth see a army of packer get to work and the fresh fish be soon on the rail speeding to the great fish market on the way to you breakfast table the story of the herr fishery be one of deep interest and of great importance million of herring be catch every year form a cheap and good food yet there be uncountable number leave and there be not the least danger that we net can ever empty the sea of this wonderful little fish the herring have several smaller relative all of they be excellent food for we the pilchard be one of they the sardine be merely a young pilchard countless myriad of pilchard visit the cornish coast strangely enough they frequent only this corner of we sea another cousin of the herr the sprat be also a fine food and so cheap that poor people can enjoy it baby herring and baby sprat be catch in great quantity and sell under the name of whitebait it be think at one time that the whitebait be another kind of fish but whitebait be really the herr and sprat in they baby state exercise 1 name several enemy of the herr 2 describe the egg of the herr and where they be lay 3 what be a drift-net and how be it use 4 what be a sardine what be a whitebait lesson ii the story of the flat fish you see fish of many shape and size in the fishmonger 's shop they can be divide into two kind -- round fish and flat fish cod herr mackerel and salmon be round fish the flat fish be plaice turbot brill halibut sole dab and flounder most people know the taste as well as the look of a plaice but few know much about its life in the ocean indeed there be secret in the life of this fish and many other fish too which still puzzle we put a salmon and a plaice side by side and it be plain that they live in very different way one be make to dart like a arrow the other to lie flat one be the shape of a torpedo the other be flat like a raft the shape and color of the plaice tell they own story of a life on the sandy pebbly bed of the sea and look at the eye both be on the upper side of the head what could be better for a fish that lie flat on the ocean floor the plaice be the best know of these flat fish so we will try to find how its life be spend in the deep sea have you ever watch those little sailing-vessel which go a-shrimping they carry a large net -- a shrimp-trawl it be call -- which be draw over the sandy home of the shrimp when the trawl be haul up it may contain not only shrimp but the other dweller in sandy place among these sad to say be often a mass of baby plaice and other flat fish tiny little fellow they be some hardly as large as a postage stamp they be throw aside be of no use to the fisherman now these baby be quite flat darkish on the upper side white on the other side like the plaice you see in the shop they be not such new baby after all though such wee mite it be more than six week since they leave the egg and in that time they have pass through wonderful change as you will see plaice lay a great many egg which float about in the sea most be gobble up by those sea-creature -- and they be many -- who love fish-egg for dinner from each remain egg a baby plaice escape at first it float upside down at the surface of the sea and eat nothing at all then it rights itself and begin to swallow the tiny creature which swarm in sea-water strange to tell this baby plaice be not a bit like its mother it be not a flat fish now but a round fish it have one eye on each side of its head and you would expect it to grow up like any other round fish for about a month this small transparent youngster hardly alter then it grow deeper in the body and begin to swim near the bottom of the sea at last it lie on one side and its life as a round fish be over a fish lie thus on its side would have one eye bury in the sand and quite useless would it not but we young plaice be change its appearance very quickly its head be grow rather lopsided the eye next the sand be little by little bring round to the upper side until it look up instead of down its mouth get a queer one-sided look owe to the twist of the bone in the head many people think that the dark upper part of a flat fish be the back and the white under part be the stomach we have see however that this be not so for _ flat fish lie on one side _ for the rest of its life the plaice will remain flat with two eye look up and a twisted head but its color alter the side on which it lie be white the upper side become brown and speckled dot over with red mark this be a good disguise its enemy can not distinguish the plaice from the pebble and sand around it they might swim over it and yet not see the thin flat brownish body press down on the bed of the sea also these flat fish have a wonderful way of change color put they on light sand and they become lightish put they on dark sand and pebble and they soon match it by become brown and mottled this be a most useful dodge where so many enemy abound all swifter in the water than the slow-swimming flat fish if you look for flat fish in a aquarium you will not easily see they now and again one will swim up with a wavy motion of its body on settle again it shuffle and flap about work itself into the sand hide its edge well under and then hey presto it be go if the flat fish be so hard to find in a tank you may be sure it would be impossible to find they on the sea bed they be poor swimmer but perfect hider as far as we can tell they feed on other live creature the ocean floor be a huge dining table for they where they find very mixed dinner they eat small fish sand-worm shell-fish shrimp and young crab the plaice have strong blunt tooth in its throat and be well able to grind up the shell of cockle and other mollusc swallow the juicy contents now we have see that the plaice be first a float egg and then a tiny transparent round fish it sink to the sea bed lie on one side and become a flat fish like its parent these little baby flat fish not much larger than you thumb-nail crowd in the shallow sandy part of the sea near the coast there they often end they life in the shrimp-trawl as we have already notice after leave this infant ' school the plaice and other small flat fish go to deeper water there they feed and grow fat we fisherman know where to find they indeed these special fishing grounds be so well know that flat fish be scarcer than they use to be some kind be much too dear ever to be see on the poor man 's table there be a special net for catch flat fish call a _ trawl _ this be a large net drag over the bed of the sea by rope or steel wire attach to the sailing vessel or steam trawler the net be keep open under water by means of beam or board when the flat fish be disturb they rise a foot or two from the sea floor and be then sweep into the gaping mouth of the deadly trawl once in there be no escape there they remain press together until the net be haul up and empty exercise 1 give the name of five kind of flat fish 2 how do the plaice escape its enemy in the sea 3 what be the food of the plaice 4 how be flat fish usually catch for the market lesson iii seal there be many different kind of seal the family be a large one but all have one thing in common -- the fish-like body with toe join together by a web anyone who have see the diving power of a seal and its wonderful way in the water will agree that the flipper of the seal be as useful as the fin of the fish in fact the flipper beat the fin for the seal earn he dinner by chase and catch fish he slip through the water with perfect ease and seize the dart fish in they own home the seal be nearly always hungry but so wonderfully quick that he hunting be make easy for he it be quite another matter on land where he best pace be a waddle and a shuffle but he life be in the wide sea where he can feed and sleep as easily as other mammal can on land seal be easily tame and soon become fond of they owner some fisherman once catch a baby seal which they give to a boy know he love of animal the strange baby soon make itself at home and love to lie in the warmth of the kitchen fire it know the voice of its young master and would follow he like a dog the older it grow the more milk and fish it need each day at last this food be not to be easily obtain and so the boy have to get rid of he pet he row out to sea take the seal and let it free in the ocean to fend for itself but the seal would not leave he it swim swiftly round the boat call pitifully needless to say it be take back again and well care for -lrb- illustration : the sea-elephant -rrb- seal have even be train to catch fish for they owner be docile by nature and have larger brain than most animal they can be teach perhaps you have see sea-lion perform surprising trick show clearly how intelligent these fish-like creature really be the sea-lion at the london zoo be not specially train but they be clever enough to teach themselves especially when reward by a few extra fish they know well the voice of they keeper and clap with they flipper to let he know that feeding -- time be near and in many other amusing way they prove they intelligence -lrb- illustration : sea-lion -rrb- you have notice perhaps that these sea-lion can shuffle along on they hind flipper which be turn forward under the body the real seal however can not do this they hind limb so wonderful in the water be merely drag behind the body on land sealskin should be call sea-lion-skin to be exact for it be the sea-lion not the true seal which man kill and rob of they lovely warm coat the giant of the seal family be the sea-elephant a big lumbering fellow with a most peculiar nose of course this give he he name though it be not much like the trunk of the real elephant it be just the baggy skin of he nose a foot long which hang down past he mouth when the sea-elephant be angry or excite this loose nose of he become fill with air and bulge out we color picture show you mr sea-elephant full grow he wife and child have ordinary seal nose perhaps we should say wife not wife for he have many -lrb- illustration : a common seal -rrb- the sea-elephant go to wild lonely island and there make they nursery year after year ten of thousand of the big seal gather to fight and to rear they young the clumsy great father sea-elephant fight terrible battle and at this time always seem to be in a very bad temper tear each other with they tusk-like tooth they roaring can be hear far out at sea but the lady seal take no part in these combat we have no room in this lesson to look at all the other kind of seal sea-lion sea-bear and walrus as we have already notice the sealskin sell in shop be really the skin of a sea-lion sometimes these be call _ eared seal _ for they possess little ear while the real seal have only small hole in the side of the head for ear again there be some eared seal whose fur be of no use to we for it lack the deep under-fur of the fur seal nature give this coat to the seal to protect he from the cold but it have cause he destruction for these animal be kill by the hundred thousand worse than this they be kill in the most cruel manner law have now be make to help protect the poor fur seal from its merciless hunter it live in cold sea where its deep rich coat be a splendid protection no finer fur be there for keep out cold and wet and the skilful furrier can make it into soft garment of great value the habit of these seal be strange indeed for nine or ten month of the year they wander freely over the open sea they dive for they food and sleep calmly amidst the restless heaving of the ocean this be the happy life of the seal though enemy -- shark killer whale or grampus -- sometimes snap he up as he sleep then in the springtime there come a change the seal leave the open sea and take to the land they go to they special breeding-place or rookery as they be call the big old man seal arrive first and haul themselves on shore each choose a spot for himself among the rock he then settle down to defend it for more and more old man seal come all eager to own the best place the roaring and fight go on day and night the gentle seal be now a savage beast cover with wound then the soft-eyed female seal come ashore now the thing be for each big male seal to claim as many lady seal as he can more fight roaring and tear occur now in which the lady seal be bang about like football the strongest old man drag the female seal away in he tooth and plump she down in he special part of the beach along come another big seal to take she away and the fight begin again meanwhile the younger seal keep out of the way strange to say the fighting seal take no food at all though they be on the beach for several week a few stone be all they eat though at other time they devour number of fish at every meal exercise 1 how could you tell the sea-lion from the real seal 2 where be the seal rookery what happen there in the springtime 3 why be the sea-elephant so name lesson iv some strange nursery as a rule nest or nursery be unknown in the world of fish they lay they egg and leave they and the young one have to fight they own battle in a sea full of fierce and hungry enemy indeed it often happen that a parent fish be eager to make a meal of its own child the codfish lay about nine million egg you would hardly expect the female codfish to make a nursery for such a family she would be much worse off than the old woman who live in a shoe as a matter of fact the egg be lay in the open sea and the cod show no interest in they but leave they to become food for many a roving enemy those cousin of the shark -- the skate and the dog-fish -- be more careful of they egg have you ever find they empty egg on the sea shore child call they mermaid ' purse but they be more like little horny pillow-case than purse when first lay the dog-fish 's egg have a very long string or _ tendril _ at each corner as the fish lay the egg she wind these tendril round and round a sea-plant thus the egg be fix firmly until the young one be ready to escape from within -lrb- _ see _ p 49 -rrb- the skate 's egg be much the same only there be no tendril but a curved hook at each corner these hook of course serve as anchor to hold the egg : no doubt they catch in weed and stone one fish you see tie she egg with string the other use anchor these large purse egg be like cradle and the baby skate do not slip out of they until they be quite ready to look after themselves in the ocean there be fish in the sea which take great pain to save they egg and baby from harm they will even defend they at the risk of they own life of course these careful parent do not have huge family like the cod no the fish that care for they young have small family but the baby have a much better chance of living than the baby cod it be one of nature 's wise law we common stickleback -- tiddler or red-throat as boy call he -- build a nest in pond he have a seaside cousin the fifteen-spined stickleback who be also a nest-builder this little fish be fairly common round we coast live in weedy pool by the shore where it devour any small creature unlucky enough to come near it be about six inch long this sea stickleback with a long snout and its body be very thin near the tail to build he nest this little fish choose a quiet corner then gather piece of green and purple seaweed he take the piece in he mouth push they about until the shape be to he liking have get he nursery to the right size and shape the little builder next fasten it together how can he do this what mortar can he find in the sea it be quite simple he use thread which come from he own body he swim round the nest again and again and each time a thread be spin bind the clump of weed into a safe tight nest for the egg when the task be do there be a weed-nursery about the size of you fist now all be ready for the egg to be lay by the female stickleback you would expect they to be keep in a hole amid the nest would you not instead of that they be tuck a few here a few there in the weed then the father stickleback mount guard woe betide any small fish look for a dinner of stickleback egg the gallant little sentry will rush at he with spine as stiff as fix bayonet ready to do battle to the death when the young be hatch out he still keep guard they be not allow out of the nursery for some time the watchful parent force they back if they try to wander out into the peril of the shore-pool -lrb- illustration : _ photo : af dauncey _ skate 's egg case -rrb- let we look at another nest-builder -- the sand goby or spotted goby he be common enough in the pool at low tide but not easy to find you can look at he yet not see he for he take the same color as the rock and sand of he home amid the glint light and shadow of he rock-pool with a background of sand rock and weed this little fish be nearly invisible of course it be a dodge and a useful one to escape the eye of the enemy perhaps you will not think the spotted goby so clever at nest-building as the stickleback he like to use a ready-made house whereas the stickleback find he own brick and mortar in the pool of the shore there be no lack of house to let the empty home of shell-fish be there in plenty so the little goby when nesting time come hunt round for the empty shell of a cockle lie with its hollow side to the sand this shell be to be use as the roof for the nursery the goby 's next task be to make a hole beneath the shell he set to work and by scoop out the sand make a hole about as large as a marble to keep the sand from tumble in he smear the hole with slime which soon bind hard like mortar now the nursery be nearly ready but a passage-way be make pass under the edge of the shell and then to make thing quite safe the whole roof be cover with sand : it then look more like a bump in the sand than a fish-nursery the female goby enter the nest and leave she egg in it and then the little father fish be leave in charge he rest on the sand near the entrance when the little one appear he seem to think he have do he duty so away he swim not stay like the father stickleback to guard the youngster again we see that the father and not the mother be the builder and nurse -lrb- illustration : coral of many kind -rrb- that very strange creature the pipe-fish have the most peculiar nursery of all he use no building material no made-up nest of weed or sand for he no he prefer to carry he egg in he pocket to be more exact there be a small pouch under he body and there the egg be keep until they hatch meanwhile the pipe-fish go about he affair in the pool as if nothing particular have happen you will see more about this funny little fish when we come to we lesson on the fish of we rock-pool exercise 1 what be the egg of the skate and the dog-fish like 2 how do the sea-stickleback build he nest 3 where would you find the sand goby the pipe-fish and the sea-stickleback 4 how do the sand goby build its nest lesson v the ogre of the deep the ogre of the fairy-tale be bad enough but for evil look the octopus be worse still with he tough brownish skin knob like the toad 's back he large stare eye he parrot 's beak and ugly bag of a body the octopus be a horrid-looking creature add to this eight long arm twist and writhe like snake and you have a idea of the most hideous inhabitant of the deep then like the ogre the octopus live in a cave and go forth at night to claim he victim he tear they to piece and return to he dark cavern when daylight come before see how this ugly monster live eat breathe and fight we must know something of the way he be make in the first place it may surprise you to know that the octopus 's body be make on the same plan as that of the snail the ogre of the ocean and the garden snail be second cousin they family name -- _ mollusc _ -- mean _ soft-bodied _ but there be such number of mollusc that we split they up into different order just as a big school be split into class the octopus belong to a order of mollusc with a long name which only mean _ head-footed _ why be he call head-footed the snail as you know have one broad foot under its body the foot of the octopus be divide into eight strip these long strip be set round he head hence the name head-footed because there be eight of these long foot he be name _ octo-pus _ or eight-feet the foot -- or arm or tentacle as they be call -- be join at they base by a skin it make a sort of webbing in the center of this be a horny beak usually of a brownish color it be just like a parrot 's beak only of thinner and lighter stuff there be two part to it the top one curve down over the lower one behind this beaked mouth be a hard rasping tongue on each side of the head be a big stare eye and behind the ugly head be the ugly body like a bag the octopus breathe by means of gill water enter through a big hole under the head pass over the gill and out again through a _ funnel _ or _ siphon _ now the octopus can make good use of this siphon sometimes he be attack and wish to make himself scarce so he send the water rapidly through the siphon the force be enough to jerk he quickly backwards he arm trail behind the octopus and he relation have another dodge as well they possess a bag of inky fluid by mix this ink with the spurt of water from the funnel the octopus leave a thick cloud behind he the enemy be lose in this dark cloud while the octopus dart safely away -lrb- illustration : the octopus -- a monster of the deep -rrb- have no armor to protect he and no shelly home like that of the snail the octopus be a easy prey to large fish seal and whale so this trick of shooting backwards hide in a cloud of ink must be of great use soldier and sailor use cloud of smoke to baffle they enemy in battle the octopus use cloud of ink shark conger eel and whale be able to fight the octopus and eat he soft body but small fish and crab keep away from the ogre if they can this be not easy for he hide away under rock watch with he great eye for pass prey if anything come near enough out flick a long taper snaky arm and hold the victim tight down the inside of each arm be nearly three hundred round sucker each one act like those leather sucker with which boy sometimes play once fix it be nearly impossible to unloose they without chop or tear the arm to piece first one and then another sucker take hold and the wretched victim be draw up to the ogre 's beak with no chance of escape when one see the grasp power of even a small octopus it be easy to believe that a large one would be a dangerous enemy the strongest swimmer would stand no chance : those clinging arm could hold two or three man under water -lrb- illustration : whaling -rrb- luckily the octopus have no wish to attack people it be not fierce but to the crab it must seem a awful ogre i once watch a octopus on the lookout for food it have its lair between two rock its twining arm show outside its eye and body in the shadow along come a crab scuttle near the rock he spy the ogre at once stop and raise he claw as crab do like a boxer ready to fight the crab have strong pincers and a good suit of armor i expect to see he fight for life but no like poor bunny chase by the dreaded stoat the crab give in as soon as the ogre flick he with a arm the sucker grip he fast and still hold up he claw he be draw into the den of he dreadful enemy although arm with a beak the octopus seem not to use it against the crab he prefer to pull the poor crab to piece with he strong arm and then to pick up the crab-meat with the hooked beak when full-fed he retire to he den he sometimes pull shell and stone over the entrance and rest within until hungry in this strange order of mollusc there be dwarf and giant one kind be never more than two inch long other be vast monster the octopus be big enough and ugly enough to make one shudder to see he but the real ogre of the deep be the giant cuttle-fish beside which the octopus be a tiny mite these giant cuttle have ten arm two of they be very long the octopus 's body be round like that of a fat spider while the cuttle have a long body the cuttle have many sharp claw on its arm besides number of big strong sucker it hold and tear its prey at the same time its stare eye be like big black lantern on each side of the head the head twist this way and that so that nothing escape the glare of those horrible eye lurk in the dark depths of the sea these giant cuttle wait for large fish crab or even they own relation to come near like hideous gigantic spider they be the terror of the ocean cavern they be so large that they have few enemy to fear indeed it be surprising that any animal dare to attack such a monster but that other giant the sperm whale dive deep to the home of the cuttle purposely to attack and eat they the sperm whale _ must _ attack these big creature in order to get enough food he have such a huge barn-like body to fill that only these big cuttle will satisfy he whale-hunter sometimes catch a glimpse of terrific combat between these giant of the deep the sperm win the battle for he be nearly always find to contain great piece of the ogre 's arm although the octopus and the cuttle be related to the snail and whelk they have no shell they body be naked neither do they grow a backbone or skeleton but inside the body the cuttle have a plate of chalk which you may find on the shore some kind have a long strip of transparent substance like a large feather fisherman use the smaller kind of cuttle as bait you will find it quite easy to cut out the beak and bone for yourself or the fisherman will not mind save they for you exercise 1 what be the meaning of the word mollusc and octopus 2 how do the octopus capture its prey 3 how do the octopus escape its enemy 4 what creature prey on the cuttle and octopus lesson vi the whale now and again whale be wash up on we coast and then we can see how huge be this strange monster of the deep it be by far the largest of all live animal once on the land it be quite helpless it can not regain its home in the water and slowly die it be shape like a fish and its home be in the sea so no wonder it have often be call a fish if by chance the whale be hold under water it drown it have no gill like those of the fish to take air from the water it be a mammal a creature that must breathe the free air just as other mammal nature be full of surprise and here she surprise we with a mammal most marvellously fit to live a fish-like life the whale dive to great depths in search of food and stay under water for a long time but it be force to rise again and breathe at the surface to do this it need not put its head and mouth out of water for its nostril be at the top of the head as the whale force used-up air from its nostril -- or blow-hole as it be call -- it mix with water this cause a jet or spout of water to rise some distance into the air the blow-hole be close by a stopper or valve opening to let the air in or out but close to shut out the water some of the whale family be enormous and some be small a large sperm whale may grow to be ninety foot long and its weight would be nearly two hundred ton this huge creature would look like a deep barge in the water these sperm whale love to swim in herd or school as many as three hundred have be see in one school old bull and cow and they young one swim together far out at sea it have be notice that they all spout or breathe at the same time and then dive to great depths the old one seem to know that they baby can not stay under water as long as a full-grown whale can and they all rise at the same time these youngster may be nearly thirty foot long but they gambol like so many kitten twist and turn over and over and throw themselves into the air most whale be happy creature enjoy they roving life in the free ocean you can well imagine that a whale as big as a barge need huge dinner we should not be far wrong if we guess that he would need about a ton of food every day where be he to get all that food it be say that he feed mostly on the cuttle-fish that giant cousin of the octopus who haunt the dim cavern of the deep the sperm be of enormous strength and be as fierce as he be strong otherwise he would not dare to face the awful clinging arm of the cuttle that ogre of the deep sea the sperm whale have a great blunt head a huge mouth and a throat large enough to swallow a man he clumsy-looking head contain oil so do the deep layer of blubber with which he body be cover for the sake of this oil the sperm have always be hunt but he be not easily overcome he fight hard for life and many a whaling boat have be dash to piece with one blow from the powerful tail of a hunt sperm this great tail be set cross-wise not upright like the tail of a fish it be of immense power and divide into two big fluke as they be call with strong up-and-down stroke the tail propel the monster along at a great pace it also shoot he down to he feeding place in the depths of the sea and up again to fill he lung with sweet fresh air the fin or paddle be use only as balancer and to protect the young these sperm whale inhabit warm sea but other of the whale family haunt colder region the greatest of these be the right whale or greenland whale a monster whose bulk rival that of the sperm now it be very strange that this the largest member of the whole kingdom of animal should live on some of the smallest creature of the sea and that the mouth and throat of this monster should be so make that he can eat only this minute food food like that which the tiny herr eat in some part of those cold northern sea the water be color in band of red and blue if you take up a bucketful you would find that the color be due to myriad of tiny creature amongst these be other myriad of small animal each of less size than a house-fly the larger one be there to feed on the smaller one and that mass of small life be the food of this mountain of fat and flesh the greenland whale he swim through the sea with he mouth gaping open like a great cavern and soon thousand of the little creature be inside then he tongue come forward it be of immense size and it push out all the sea water from he mouth but the small animal remain inside for the water be force through a wonderful sieve make of fringed plate which hang from he upper jaw instead of have tooth in he mouth as many whale have the greenland whale have this sieve of whalebone of course it be a large sieve to fill so large a mouth yet it be never in the way be neatly packed away at the top of the mouth one plate over the other when not in use the mass of small animal hold back by this peculiar sieve then slide down he throat which be a tube about as wide as a boy 's wrist we say just now that nature be full of surprise be it not surprising to find a gigantic whale feeding in this way inside the great mouth the _ remora _ or suck fish be often find this fish have a oval sucker on its head by which it fix itself to whale or even to the hull of a ship it have fin and can swim perfectly well but prefer to live in this lazy way the whalebone whale lead a peaceful happy life though not without danger the bitter cold of they northern home be nothing to they for be they not snug in a deep blanket of blubber to obtain food they merely swim along with open mouth these peaceful giant do not know how to fight for they life like the sperm whale so when man come hunting the greenland whale for oil and whalebone he find a easy victim they have other enemy besides man the killer whale be one of the fiercest swiftest terror of the sea it be tiny compare with the greenland whale but much quicker and more cunning several killer band together and spring to the attack at the same time like wild cat they dash at the poor helpless whale and tear its side with terrible curved tooth the sword-fish and thresher shark also help to destroy this harmless giant of the deep the sword-fish pierce it with he pointed beak the other slash the side of the wretched whale with its long tail it be say by those who have see such a fight that the thresher 's tail cut deep into the whale 's side -lrb- illustration : the suck fish -rrb- in all part of the wide sea there be whale of one kind or another we have look briefly at the sperm and greenland whale and the killer whale besides these there be the narwhal or sea-unicorn with a wonderful tusk which be really a big tooth some six foot long another one the bottle-nose whale have a long narrow beak and be sometimes wash up on we shore the pilot whale be also see in herd in we sea another visitor the rorqual be not welcome by the fisherman this big fellow follow the shoal of mackerel and herr he live on they swallow as many at each gulp as would fill several big basket the fisherman can spare he the fish but it be another matter when he swim through valuable net tear through they as if they be so much cobweb the commonest whale of we sea be that small one the common dolphin who be a midget some five or six foot long you may have see dolphin for they swim near the surface and may often be notice not far from the shore like the rorqual they follow the herr and mackerel shoal now and again they dash into the net and be show in the fish-market exercise 1 describe how the whale breathe 2 what food do the sperm and greenland whale eat 3 how do the greenland whale eat its food 4 give the name of five kind of whale lesson vii tiger of the sea -lrb- illustration : a coral reef -rrb- the monster of the shark family fortunately for we live in warm sea and so be not often find near the shore of great britain but we sea contain smaller shark of various kind and in greater number than most people imagine shark be fierce hunter many a poor sailor or diver have be tear to piece and devour by these ravenous tiger of the deep some shark be of great size and immense power they be by far the largest of all live fish and no animal in the whole kingdom of animal own such a terrible death-trap of a mouth as the shark it be in some kind of shark arm with seven row of tooth with keen edge and point sometimes a shark follow a steamer in the open sea day after day wait for whatever may chance he way and it be astonishing what strange object he will swallow these monster be often catch on a hook bait with a lump of meat and be haul to the steamer 's deck one shark be find to contain all the rubbish that have be pitch overboard tin can a bundle of old coat a piece of rope old bone and so on what a fierce hunger must have drive the shark to swallow such a meal as that before we look at some of these fierce creature whom everyone dislike we will say a word for they nature mean they to be _ scavenger _ to clean up the sea and this they do dead and decaying flesh be a danger and the shark ever hungry clear it away quickly now and again fisherman bring a big shark to port and hang he in the market -- not for sale but as a show the blue shark be the one most often display like this see how he mouth be set well under the head as in all shark and notice the shape of the body it tell of speed and strength in the water its pointed taper form remind one of the racing yacht -lrb- illustration : the white ray -rrb- what be this fierce fellow do so near we coast he be often find off cornwall -- too often think the fisherman this shark come to seek the same prey as the fisherman -- the shoal of mackerel and pilchard -lrb- a cousin of the herr -rrb- where the shoal go the blue shark follow the silly mackerel all crowd together have no chance to escape they awful foe they be nearly as helpless as a flock of sheep with a tiger in they midst -lrb- illustration : the electric ray -rrb- if the shark come across a mass of mackerel or pilchard in a net he look on they as a fine feast dashing at they he tear the net to piece swallow lump of net with great mouthful of fish small wonder the fisherman detest this savage visitor which cause he such serious loss of time and money he naturally look on shark as useless vermin to be destroy whenever possible -lrb- illustration : _ photo : a f dauncey _ dog-fish egg case -rrb- the fox shark or thresher be another fierce visitor to these shore this savage hunter come after the herring pilchard and sprat it be say to hunt these useful little fish in a strange way as you know they travel in shoal the thresher swim rapidly round and round they nearer and nearer it come to the unlucky little fish and they crowd together huddle up in a helpless mass the thresher add to they panic by _ threshing _ the water with its terrible tail and then as you can well imagine it dash at they and devour a enormous meal half the length of the thresher be tail not long ago there be land at one of we fishing port a thresher shark of half a ton its tail be over ten foot in length even the great whale have reason to fear the fierce lashing of that long whip-like weapon we commonest shark be those small one know as dog-fish which you can often see at any fish market they be good to eat though not use much as food though small in size they be large in appetite and fierce in nature like savage dog they hunt in pack wage war against the whiting herr and other fish -lrb- illustration : the shark -rrb- there be several kind of these small shark know as spur-dog smooth hound greater-spotted and lesser-spotted dog-fish and tope and you will hear fisherman call they by such name as rig robin huss and shovel-nose fisher-folk dislike shark the dog-fish among they all those creature like the cormorant seal and shark which catch fish for breakfast dinner and supper be rival of the fisherman he often pull up he line to find but a part of a fish on the hook -- the rest be snatch by a dog at time he net be tear by these nuisance when they attack the catch of fish or he line come up from the deep all tangled round and round a writhe dog-fish which have swallow the bait hook we come now to those flat shark whose flesh you may have taste no shark be nice-looking but these flat one -- the skate or ray -- be really hideous many of they be of great size and strength and arm with spine on they body -lrb- _ see _ p 52 no 3 -rrb- as well as tooth in they ugly jaw they have broad flat body with wide wing and a long thin tail the whole shape remind you of a kite and you would hardly know the ray or skate as the shark 's first cousin yet it be only a shark with flatten body and whose side fin be so large that they spread out like fleshy wing the mouth be on the under part as it be in all shark -lrb- illustration : fish -lrb- no1 -rrb- 1 blue shark 2 see fish 3 starry ray 4 ox ray 5 plaice 6 trunk fish 7 blue striped wrasse 8 malt gurnard 9 muroena -rrb- these flatten shark must be a terror to they neighbor we shall see in we next lesson what strange weapon be use in the battle of the fish the ray or skate have they share of spine sting and poison one glance at they shape tell you that speed be not they strong point if they wish to eat fast-swimming fish -- and they often do -- they must use cunning the skate be sandy-coloured and flat be nearly invisible as it lie on the bed of the sea there it lurk wait for the first unwary fish a sudden spring and its wide body smother its unlucky victim skate also flap they way slowly over the ocean floor look for a dinner they can eat shell-fish and be fit with tooth suit to the work of crush such hard fare but as we have see they have also the shark 's love of eat other fish these skate be the only member of the shark family that we value as food you can see skate of several kind in the fish market they go by such name as thorn-back ray blue skate spot ray starry ray cuckoo ray long-nosed skate and sting ray exercise 1 of what use be shark 2 how do the thresher shark hunt its prey 3 give the name of several dogfish and ray 4 what be the food of the skate and how be it obtain lesson viii the danger of the deep the game of hide-and-seek be play by most of the dweller in the sea many of they be hider and seeker by turn that be to say they be always seek other creature to devour but must also be ready to hide from they own enemy _ eat and be eat _ -- that be the life of the sea the small and weak one must hide and they life depend on they skill in hide perhaps we should not call it a game as it be not do for fun but though the sea be full of danger for some creature you must not think that they live in fear there be no doubt that they enjoy they life each in its own way many be the quaint dodge and trick of the hider and seeker in the sea we can mention but a few in this lesson look at the spider crab and they trick of dress up they have hook on they back which catch in the seaweed some of they even tear off weed with they pincers and fix it on to these hook and succeed in look like bundle of weed and not a bit like live crab then there be the fish which wear a color scaly coat many of they be not easily see in the glint water as you know other be lazy they lie on the bed of the sea and wear a disguise which hide they from prowl foe the plaice and other flat-fish as we notice in lesson 2 be color and mark like the sand and pebble of they home and they can even change color to suit they background they be wonderfully hide owe to this useful dodge it be as if mother nature have give they the marvellous cloak of invisibility of which we read in fairy-tale shrimp and young crab wear a coat of sand-colour or weed-colour we soldier for much the same reason wear suit of _ khaki _ another common hide-and-seek trick be to look like nothing at all that sound difficult but it be a favorite dodge in the sea if a number of very young herring or eel be place in a glass tank of sea-water you would have a hard task to find they you can look _ at _ they and yet not see they they be transparent -- you look through they as if they be water or glass you can imagine how well hide they be in the open sea it be well to be able to hide when all around you be enemy who look on you as good food but there be another way and that be to wear armor then you can frighten you enemy or at least prevent he from eat you some fish like the trunk fish -lrb- p 52 no 6 -rrb- be cover with bony plate joint together like armor spine and prickle be a commoner defense the little stickleback of we pond wear sharp spine and know well how to use they even the terrible pike will not swallow such a dangerous mouthful unless drive by hunger sea-fish be the most hunt of all live thing from the day they leave the egg enemy lurk on all side to gobble they up the weak one be eat and none of they have the chance to die of old age so we find a defense of spine and prickle worn by many sea-fish spine on the fin be the commonest and no doubt help to keep away enemy but some fish go one better than that and wear a complete suit of spine the porcupine-fish as he name tell we be one of these he be a small fish living in warm sea no doubt he have many enemy eager to meet he and eat he but when they see this little fish puff out he side like a balloon and when pointed spine rise up all over the balloon they think better of it they leave he alone and the porcupine-fish go back to he usual shape the spine lie flat until want again he be sometimes call the sea-hedgehog or urchin-fish and well deserve he name many of the skate or ray wear terrible spike the starry ray -lrb- p 52 no 7 -rrb- be not easy to handle dead or alive for he have spine all over he body the thornback be another ugly fellow of this family have spine on he back and a double row of they down he tail fisherman be careful to avoid the lash of this armed tail the sting ray show we still another weapon at the end of its long tail it have a horrible jagged three-inch spike as this fish like to bury itself in wet sand bather sometimes tread on it in a flash the tail whip round a poisonous slime cover the spike cause great pain to the unlucky bather several poisonous fish be common near we coast you may have see the one call the great weaver also its small cousin the sting fish the weaver be dread by fisherman for the spine on its back fin as well as the one on its gill-cover cause poison wound they be groove to hold a very poisonous slime some fish have the power to kill they prey and stun they enemy at a distance instead of a spiny defense they be _ arm with electricity _ the best-known sea-fish of this sort be the electric ray also call the cramp fish or torpedo -lrb- _ see _ p 48 -rrb- it be a clumsy fish about a yard long and very ugly be too slow to catch its swift prey in fair chase it stun they with a electric shock and then eat they the electric power come from the body of the ray if it wish it can send a deadly shock through any fish which venture near without chance of escape it be at once stunned and fall helpless we come now to some formidable danger of the deep -- big strong fish so well arm that they roam the sea without fear on page 52 you see a picture -lrb- no 2 -rrb- of the saw-fish one of the shark family it be a large fish and carry a big saw on its head with which it stab sideways at its prey imagine if you can a shark about fifteen foot long and weigh a ton or so now suppose the top jaw of this monster to be draw out into a hard flat blade six foot in length then suppose there be sharp ivory tooth one inch apart fix on each side the blade and you have a idea of the saw-fish this strange shark be say to be as strong as it be fierce it kill its prey by tear they open with side blow from its sharp two-edged see its big mouth be fit with a great many row of needle-like tooth the sword-fish wear a different weapon -- a lance instead of a saw he be not a shark but a cousin of the beautiful mackerel this warrior of the deep be more dreaded than the saw-fish and braver than any shark he speed in the water be marvellous it make he safe from attack he carry in front of he a terrible weapon and all sea-creature hasten from he path as fast as they can you may have see the sword-fish in a museum there be a fine one in the london natural history museum where there be also a sword from one of these fish drive eighteen inch into the solid oak of a ship the sword-fish never think twice about attack no matter if he enemy be ten or twenty time as large as himself he see a whale and like a flash hurl himself at it stab he sword as deep as it will go into the whale 's side with a twist of he body the sword be wrench free only to be drive savagely in again exercise 1 mention three way in which sea-creature try to escape they enemy 2 how do the sting-fish and sting ray defend themselves 3 what be the saw-fish like 4 how do the sword-fish attack its prey lesson ix the fish of we rock-pool the pool leave by the fall tide have many a interesting thing to show we there be live creature in plenty besides the pretty weed shell and other object shrimp prawn and crab abound in the rock-pool and shallows with anemone and shellfish of all kind in the rock-pool we shall also find the interesting little fish whose story we glance at in this lesson of course there be baby flat-fish and large fish too along the shore but these be only visitor the real rock-pool fish be those which live they life there some of they be tiny thing two or three inch long with quick movement like shrimp they dart away as you approach they have a way of hide under weed and rock be very clever at hide-and-seek and know all the dodge but by use a net you will soon capture a few of they then you can put they in a small pool and examine they or even keep they in a aquarium give they clean sea-water seaweed and the small shrimp on which they feed -lrb- illustration : pipe-fish and flute mouth -rrb- in we lesson on fish-nursery we see how the sea-stickleback sand goby and pipe-fish care for they egg or young one these three fish be often to be find by the shore as you look into the clear and still water of a pool you may see a pipe-fish get its dinner this funny creature look more like a pencil swimming than a fish it may be a foot in length but its body be no thicker than a pipe-stem -lrb- illustration : fish -lrb- no 2 -rrb- 1 john dory 2 rock cod 3 sand eel 4 small pipe fish 5 cuckoo-wrasse 6 angler 7 whiting 8 gattorngine 9 sapphirnal gurnard 10 three-bearded rockling 11 red gurnard 12 pipe fish 13 bass 14 red mullet 15 turbot -rrb- it have very long jaw they be quite useless however be fasten together at they tip be a opening though a very small one and that be the mouth of the pipe-fish of course with such a mouth the fish can not bite its prey and so have to suck in small creature and swallow they its method of hunting they be strange it stand on its head as it be take in a mouthful of water and spurt it out at the sandy bed of the sea this stir up the small living thing which be at once swallow by the pipe-fish we have already see how the male pipe-fish carry he egg in he pocket another curious thing be he suit of armor instead of scale he have hard plate all over he body very often you may see young pipe-fish among sprat and whitebait in the fishmonger 's shop most of the little shore-fish be either goby or blenny no doubt they have to avoid the sharp eye of gull and cormorant for they be very anxious not to be see some of these rock-pool fish do not mind be out of water for hour at a time in every way nature have fit they for they life between sea and shore they have cousin in warmer sea which love to come ashore at time this be how a traveller describe one of these foreign goby : -- though they be fish and breathe by gill they have a passion for the land and during the daytime may always be see ashore especially where the coast be muddy they bask in the sun and hunt for food raise themselves on they fleshy fin when pursue they take great spring use they tail and fin for the purpose and if they can not escape into the sea they will dive down the burrow of a land-crab or dash into a bunch of mangrove-root they be very wary have eye like swivel to turn in all direction -lrb- illustration : a butterfly blenny -rrb- the spotted goby as we have already notice make a nest under a shell and guard it until the egg hatch two other goby be quite common in the pool of we south coast -- the one-spot goby and the two-spot goby the back fin have the one spot or two spot from which they get they name though they be such mite they have sharp tooth as you may already know if you have catch they with you finger these lively little fellow be not very easy to catch they have a cunning way of hide amid sand and rock and be color to suit such place one strange thing about the goby be they trick of anchor themselves to a stone you may wonder what kind of anchor they can use it be a simple matter however the fin on the stomach be press together to form a little disc this act as a strong sucker much like that of the suck fish -lrb- p 43 -rrb- if the goby wish to stay still in one place it press its sucker to a stone then it can not be wash away by the ever-moving water in the blenny family we find big ugly fish as well as pretty little one of strange shape and lovely color there be several kind of small blenny in we rock-pool the eyed blenny or butterfly blenny be not very common along we shore but may be see now and again it be only a few inch in length with eye like jewel a kind of tuft over each eye and a pretty spot on its tall back fin it will live quite well in a glass tank of sea-water someone who keep many interesting fish say of this blenny : -- we little butterfly blenny be not often to be see it be use a old whelk shell for a nursery in this broken old shell the dainty fish be able to hide and be so nervous that we seldom see it but we place some food near the hole in the shell and be reward by the sight of the butterfly 's head and its lovely eye each with a little movable tassel above it -lrb- illustration : a smooth blenny -rrb- hide under weed and stone be another small brownish fish of the shore the gunnell or butter-fish you may turn it out of its snug hiding-place but you will have a hard task to catch it even in a small rock-pool and once catch it slip through you finger like a eel its body be eel-shaped with a narrow fin on the back and cover with a layer of slime it well deserve the name of butter-fish the egg of this strange little fish be roll into a mass by the two parent by curl they long slimy body around the egg a closely-packed ball be the result this precious ball of egg be then take care of and guard by the two fish in this nursery both the father and mother fish take they share as guardian exercise 1 name three rock-pool fish 2 describe the pipe-fish 3 how do the sand goby anchor itself 4 in what way be these rock-pool fish so well fitted to live in such place lesson x some curious fish now and again that queer fish call the sea-horse be find by we coast a little brown fish with bluish-white spot and line on the side and tail but sea-horse be common in warmer sea in the bank of seaweed where they love to dwell you would never guess that these curious creature be fish the shape of the head and the curved neck remind you of a horse it be also rather like the knight of the chess-board or it may make you think of the dragon of the fable but really the sea-horse be like nothing on the earth or in the water nature have give it a special pattern of its own sea-horse use they twisty tail as monkey do cling to the seaweed with they they swim along slowly in a upright position every now and then they seem to be fall forward on they nose and pull themselves up again only to begin fall a moment after it be fun to see they play hide-and-seek among the weed in a aquarium some sea-horse be like float scrap of tear weed this of course hide they from the eye of enemy -lrb- illustration : sea-horse -rrb- they have no tooth but a long mouth like a pipe so you can be sure they eat only the smallest sea-creature to add to he odd look the seahorse move he eye in a comic fashion one eye may roll round and look at you while the other gaze forward as if this be not strange enough he surprise we again mr sea-horse turn himself into a living nursery he carry the egg about with he in a special pouch of skin you will remember that the pipe-fish also carry the egg in he pocket as it be so you will not be surprise to hear that these two quaint fish belong to the same family we will leave the funny little sea-horse and look at a very different fish -- the sunfish this remarkable fish often reach a good size even near we coast big one be catch now and again and in warmer sea where they be often kill for the sake of the oil they contain big fellow of half a ton be quite common this sunfish have a peculiar shape it look as if it have once be a immense fish of the usual fish shape but someone cut off the head and shoulder and place a short fin where the rest of the body have be above and below there be a long pointed fin the mouth be very small and have no real tooth so the sunfish life on small prey such as the young of other fish or small shell-fish far away from land these strange sunfish be meet with asleep near the surface with the back fin show above water they roll along lazily not unlike big cart-wheel the top and bottom fin be for balancing and guide the body which be move forward by the fin which frill the back part of this odd fish -lrb- illustration : globe fish -rrb- in the fishmonger 's shop you may sometimes see that ugly monster of the deep the angler-fish or fishing-frog now and again he find he way into the fisherman 's net and be also catch on the line for he be so greedy that he will snap at a hooked fish rather than let go of he prey he will be draw to the surface then he be knock on the head and throw into the boat with the other fish be slow and clumsy the angler-fish can not chase he prey so get he dinner by fraud nature have give he a fishing line and a bait he have long spine on he head so beautifully join to the bone of the head that they can wave to and fro very easily at the tip of the front spine there be a loose shine strip of skin -- that be the bait now all angler know how a fish be lure by a shine bait the angler-fish seem to know this too he bury himself in the wet mud and sand at the bottom of the sea then he wave the long spine so that the shine tip glisten as it shake in the water until a fish swim up to see what it be all about a sudden snap and that inquisitive fish be inside a huge toad-like mouth well furnished with row of sharp tooth the angler-fish put he catch in he pocket and begin fishing again for he be never satisfy he pocket be a loose bag of skin in the throat this bag be always examine by fisherman who capture the angler for it may contain a nice big plaice or sole worth money in the market there be angler-fish in every ocean and some live in the very deepest part in those black depths the little wave bait would not be see so it be make to shine like a bluish spark move to and fro over the cold black slime of the sea-bed down in those awful deep it be for ever dark and freezing cold there be no day or night summer or winter no plant can live there yet in that strange still world there be number of live thing though we know very little about they there be weird crab blind lobster and fish terror such as be never see elsewhere in that darkness you would think that eye would be of no use but some of the deep-sea fish have great black owl-like eye other be quite blind or have eye like pin-point some of they make they own light glowing with row of little lamp on they body each like the lamp of the glow-worm of we country lane blue red and green these light be but no one can tell you they real use or why they be so color the blind fish feel they way with long feeler stretch out like the thread of a web -lrb- illustration : the fishing frog -rrb- as there be no plant down there these strange fish must live mostly on one another and here be a puzzle for some of they have great big body but small head and tiny mouth other have body like ribbon but large head and huge mouth and some be such glutton that they swallow fish twice they own size this sound absurd but it be true they mouth gape open like trap-door and they stomach be make to stretch to hold they huge meal there be other terror of the deep with such big tooth that they can not shut they mouth no doubt the sea hold yet other weird fish which no man have see exercise 1 in what way be the sea-horse so different from most other fish 2 in what way be the sea-horse and pipe-fish alike 3 how do the angler-fish catch its prey 4 mention a few strange fact about the deep-sea fish lesson xi the garden of the sea for many century man be puzzle over those strange growth in the sea -- coral and sponge be they to be class as animal or as vegetable it be by no mean a easy question to answer coral with they pretty color and they stem and branch grow up from the sea-bed be say to be shrub but they be as hard as rock say some people so how could they be vegetable the reply to this be that the coral become hard as soon as it reach the air then of course it be find that coral be as hard under water as above it and the question be still unanswered sponge too be think to be sea-plant for many many year though some people even say that they must really be make of harden sea-foam the sponge take its place in the vegetable kingdom then it be move to the animal kingdom and back again this go on for long year then by careful watch it be find that the sponge be a animal true it be a very lowly member of the great kingdom of animal yet it be one and not a plant like all other animal the sponge animal must eat and its way of do so be rather strange if you look at any ordinary washing-sponge you notice a great many very small opening and some larger one amongst they it be through the smaller hole or pore that the sponge get its supply of food when it be alive and in its own home there be a current of water always pass through its and the sponge depend on the food which the water bring now if you could watch this water-current you would see that it rush into some of the hole and out of other it have a certain path to follow it enter the small pore or opening of the sponge and go along narrow canal and be then lead into larger one finally it rush out again through those large opening we notice we may compare it with traffic come into a city by many narrow street then pass into broader road and at last out again by big main road -lrb- illustration : cup and solid sponge -rrb- -lrb- illustration : _ photo : a f dauncey _ sea furze -rrb- how do the sponge animal cause this current and how be it make to follow a certain path the narrow canal in the sponge be line with lash or tiny hair so very small that you can just see they through a microscope now the secret of the wonderful water-current be a secret no longer as long as the sponge live these little lash be always move always lash the water along in one direction they cause it to follow its proper course through and through the sponge and out again into the sea on its way it lose the tiny scrap of food which it contain and carry away any waste stuff out of the sponge you will have notice that there be various kind of sponge in the market some be large and flat other small and cup-shaped some be soft and other rather hard they be all somewhat horny and elastic this spongy material be the skeleton of the sponge animal clean and dry for you use some kind of sponge would tear you skin if you try to use they for they have a hard skeleton it be make of lime and sometimes of flint which the sponge obtain from its food of course we use only those sponge-skeleton which be soft but the cheaper kind do often contain little flinty needle the best washing-sponge live in warm sea attach to the rock on the sea-bed diver go down and obtain they or else they be dredge up clean dry and sort and then send to the market some sponge call slime sponge have no skeleton be merely a living mass of slime coral be also the hard skeleton of a little animal know as the coral polyp the rest of the polyp 's body be soft jelly which many fish regard as good food the sea anemone -- another jelly-animal -- be first cousin to the coral polyp and we may call the jellyfish second cousin to these two for it be in the same big division of the animal kingdom the pretty red coral then be really the hard part of a little jelly-animal this animal be much like a sea-anemone with a hard skeleton of lime coral as you know look like a solid rock it be really make of needle of lime fasten together into a solid mass by the little coral polyp now many of the coral animal have the strange habit of bud the bud become perfect polyp and then they too begin to bud in this way those marvellous _ coral-reef _ and _
