1805-1806 first edition 1807 text of second edition 1809 _ -rrb- preface the follow tale be mean to be submit to the young reader as a introduction to the study of shakespear for which purpose he word be use whenever it seem possible to bring they in and in whatever have be add to give they the regular form of a connected story diligent care have be take to select such word as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful english tongue in which he write : therefore word introduce into we language since he time have be as far as possible avoid in those tale which have be take from the tragedy as my young reader will perceive when they come to see the source from which these story be derive shakespear 's own word with little alteration recur very frequently in the narrative as well as in the dialogue but in those make from the comedy i find myself scarcely ever able to turn he word into the narrative form therefore i fear in they i have make use of dialogue too frequently for young people not use to the dramatic form of write but this fault if it be as i fear a fault have be cause by my earnest wish to give as much of shakespear 's own word as possible : and if the _ he say _ and _ she say _ the question and the reply should sometimes seem tedious to they young ear they must pardon it because it be the only way i know of in which i could give they a few hint and little foretaste of the great pleasure which await they in they elder year when they come to the rich treasure from which these small and valueless coin be extract pretend to no other merit than as faint and imperfect stamp of shakespear 's matchless image faint and imperfect image they must be call because the beauty of he language be too frequently destroy by the necessity of change many of he excellent word into word far less expressive of he true sense to make it read something like prose and even in some few place where he blank verse be give unaltered as hope from its simple plainness to cheat the young reader into the belief that they be read prose yet still he language be transplant from its own natural soil and wild poetic garden it must want much of its native beauty i have wish to make these tale easy reading for very young child to the utmost of my ability i have constantly keep this in my mind but the subject of most of they make this a very difficult task it be no easy matter to give the history of man and woman in term familiar to the apprehension of a very young mind for young lady too it have be my intention chiefly to write because boy be generally permit the use of they father ' library at a much earlier age than girl be they frequently have the best scene of shakespear by heart before they sister be permit to look into this manly book and therefore instead of recommend these tale to the perusal of young gentleman who can read they so much better in the original i must rather beg they kind assistance in explain to they sister such part as be hardest for they to understand and when they have help they to get over the difficulty then perhaps they will read to they -lrb- carefully select what be proper for a young sister 's ear -rrb- some passage which have please they in one of these story in the very word of the scene from which it be take and i trust they will find that the beautiful extract the select passage they may chuse to give they sister in this way will be much better relish and understand from they have some notion of the general story from one of these imperfect abridgment : -- which if they be fortunately so do as to prove delightful to any of you my young reader i hope will have no worse effect upon you than to make you wish yourselve a little older that you may be allow to read the play at full length -lrb- such a wish will be neither peevish nor irrational -rrb- when time and leave of judicious friend shall put they into you hand you will discover in such of they as be here abridged -lrb- not to mention almost as many more which be leave untouched -rrb- many surprising event and turn of fortune which for they infinite variety could not be contain in this little book besides a world of sprightly and cheerful character both man and woman the humor of which i be fearful of lose if i attempt to reduce the length of they what these tale have be to you in childhood that and much more it be my wish that the true play of shakespear may prove to you in older year -- enricher of the fancy strengthener of virtue a withdraw from all selfish and mercenary thought a lesson of all sweet and honorable thought and action to teach you courtesy benignity generosity humanity : for of example teach these virtue he page be full the tempest -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- there be a certain island in the sea the only inhabitant of which be a old man whose name be prospero and he daughter miranda a very beautiful young lady she come to this island so young that she have no memory of have see any other human face than she father 's they live in a cave or cell make out of a rock : it be divide into several apartment one of which prospero call he study there he keep he book which chiefly treat of magic a study at that time much affect by all learn man : and the knowledge of this art he find very useful to he for be throw by a strange chance upon this island which have be inchant by a witch call sycorax who die there a short time before he arrival prospero by virtue of he art release many good spirit that sycorax have imprison in the body of large tree because they have refuse to execute she wicked command these gentle spirit be ever after obedient to the will of prospero of these ariel be the chief the lively little sprite ariel have nothing mischievous in he nature except that he take rather too much pleasure in torment a ugly monster call caliban for he owe he a grudge because he be the son of he old enemy sycorax this caliban prospero find in the wood a strange misshapen thing far less human in form than a ape : he take he home to he cell and teach he to speak and prospero would have be very kind to he but the bad nature which caliban inherit from he mother sycorax would not let he learn any thing good or useful : therefore he be employ like a slave to fetch wood and do the most laborious office and ariel have the charge of compelling he to these service when caliban be lazy and neglect he work ariel -lrb- who be invisible to all eye but prospero 's -rrb- would come slyly and pinch he and sometimes tumble he down in the mire and then ariel in the likeness of a ape would make mouth at he then swiftly change he shape in the likeness of a hedgehog he would lie tumble in caliban 's way who fear the hedgehog 's sharp quill would prick he bare foot with a variety of such-like vexatious trick ariel would often torment he whenever caliban neglect the work which prospero command he to do have these powerful spirit obedient to he will prospero could by they means command the wind and the wave of the sea by he order they raise a violent storm in the midst of which and struggle with the wild sea-wave that every moment threaten to swallow it up he shew he daughter a fine large ship which he tell she be full of live being like themselves o my dear father say she if by you art you have raise this dreadful storm have pity on they sad distress see the

the crown of naple and that she should be he queen ah sir say she i be a fool to weep at what i be glad of i will answer you in plain and holy innocence i be you wife if you will marry I prospero prevent ferdinand 's thanks by appear visible before they fear nothing my child say he i have overhear and approve of all you have say and ferdinand if i have too severely use you i will make you rich amends by give you my daughter all you vexation be but my trial of you love and you have nobly stand the test then as my gift which you true love have worthily purchase take my daughter and do not

not at all disposed to disobey when prospero leave they he call he spirit ariel who quickly appear before he eager to relate what he have do with prospero 's brother and the king of naple ariel say he have leave they almost out of they sens with fear at the strange thing he have cause they to see and hear when fatigue with wander about and famish for want of food he have suddenly set before they a delicious banquet and then just as they be go to eat he appear visible before they in the shape of a harpy a voracious monster with wing and the feast vanish away then to they utter amazement this seeming harpy speak to they remind they of they cruelty in drive prospero from he dukedom and leave he and he infant daughter to perish in the sea say that for this cause these terror be suffer to afflict they the king of naple and antonio the false brother repent the injustice they have do to prospero : and ariel tell he master he be certain they penitence be sincere and that he though a spirit could not but pity they then bring they hither ariel say prospero : if you who be but a spirit feel for they distress shall not i who be a human be like themselves have compassion on they bring they quickly my dainty ariel ariel soon return with the king antonio and old gonzalo in they train who have follow he wonder at the wild music he play in the air to draw they on to he master 's presence this gonzalo be the same who have so kindly provide prospero formerly with book and provision when he wicked brother leave he as he think to perish in a open boat in the sea grief and terror have so stupified they sens that they do not know prospero he first discover himself to the good old gonzalo call he the preserver of he life and then he brother and the king know that he be the injured prospero antonio with tear and sad word of sorrow and true repentance implore he brother 's forgiveness and the king express he sincere remorse for have assist antonio to depose he brother : and prospero forgive they and upon they engage to restore he dukedom he say to the king of naple i have a gift in store for you too and open a door shew he he son ferdinand play at chess with miranda nothing could exceed the joy of the father and the son at this unexpected meeting for they each think the other drown in the storm o wonder say miranda what noble creature these be it must surely be a brave world that have such people in it the king of naple be almost as much astonished at the beauty and excellent grace of the young miranda as he son have be who be this maid say he she seem the goddess that have part we and bring we thus together no sir answer ferdinand smile to find he father have fall into the same mistake that he have do when he first see miranda she be a mortal but by immortal providence she be mine i choose she when i could not ask you my father for you consent not think you be alive she be the daughter to this prospero who be the famous duke of milan of whose renown i have hear so much but never see he till now : of he i have receive a new life : he have make himself to I a second father give I this dear lady then i must be she father say the king but oh how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness no more of that say prospero : let we not remember we trouble past since they so happily have end and then prospero embrace he brother and again assure he of he forgiveness and say that a wise over-ruling providence have permit that he should be drive from he poor dukedom of milan that he daughter might inherit the crown of naple for that by they meeting in this desert island it have happen that the king 's son have love miranda these kind word which prospero speak mean to comfort he brother so fill antonio with shame and remorse that he weep and be unable to speak and the kind old gonzalo weep to see this joyful reconciliation and pray for blessing on the young couple prospero now tell they that they ship be safe in the harbor and the sailor all on board she and that he and he daughter would accompany they home the next morning in the meantime say he partake of such refreshment as my poor cave afford and for you evening 's entertainment i will relate the history of my life from my first landing in this desert island he then call for caliban to prepare some food and set the cave in order and the company be astonish at the uncouth form and savage appearance of this ugly monster who -lrb- prospero say -rrb- be the only attendant he have to wait upon he before prospero leave the island he dismiss ariel from he service to the great joy of that lively little spirit who though he have be a faithful servant to he master be always longing to enjoy he free liberty to wander uncontrolled in the air like a wild bird under green tree among pleasant fruit and sweet-smelling flower my quaint ariel say prospero to the little sprite when he make he free i shall miss you yet you shall have you freedom thank you my dear master say ariel but give I leave to attend you ship home with prosperous gale before you bid farewel to the assistance of you faithful spirit and then master when i be free how merrily i shall live here ariel sing this pretty song : where the bee suck there suck i in a cowslip 's bell i lie : there i couch when owl do cry on the bat 's back i do fly after summer merrily merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hang on the bough prospero then bury deep in the earth he magical book and wand for he be resolve never more to make use of the magic art and have thus overcome he enemy and be reconcile to he brother and the king of naple nothing now remain to complete he happiness but to revisit he native land to take possession of he dukedom and to witness the happy nuptials of he daughter miranda and prince ferdinand which the king say should be instantly celebrate with great splendor on they return to naple at which place under the safe convoy of the spirit ariel they after a pleasant voyage soon arrive a midsummer night 's dream -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- there be a law in the city of athen which give to its citizen the power of compelling they daughter to marry whomsoever they please : for upon a daughter 's refuse to marry the man she father have choose to be she husband the father be empower by this law to cause she to be put to death but as father do not often desire the death of they own daughter even though they do happen to prove a little refractory this law be seldom or never put in execution though perhaps the young lady of that city be not unfrequently threaten by they parent with the terror of it there be one instance however of a old man whose name be egeus who actually do come before theseus -lrb- at that time the reign duke of athen -rrb- to complain that he daughter hermium whom he have command to marry demetrius a young man of a noble athenian family refuse to obey he because she love another young athenian name lysander egeus demand justice of theseus and desire that this cruel law might be put in force against he daughter hermium plead in excuse for she disobedience that demetrius have formerly profess love for she dear friend helena and that helena love demetrius to distraction but this honorable reason which hermia give for not obey she father 's command move not the stern egeus theseus though a great and merciful prince have no power to alter the law of he country therefore he could only give hermium four day to consider of it : and at the end of that time if she still refuse to marry demetrius she be to be put to death when hermium be dismiss from the presence of the duke she go to she lover lysander and tell he the peril she be in and that she must either give he up and marry demetrius or lose she life in four day lysander be in great affliction at hear these evil tiding but recollect that he have a aunt who live at some distance from athen and that at the place where she live the cruel law could not be put in force against hermium -lrb- this law not extend beyond the boundary of the city -rrb- he propose to hermia that she should steal out of she father 's house that night and go with he to he aunt 's house where he would marry she i will meet you say lysander in the wood a few mile without the city in that delightful wood where we have so often walk with helena in the pleasant month of may to this proposal hermium joyfully agree and she tell no one of she intended flight but she friend helena helena -lrb- as maiden will do foolish thing for love -rrb- very ungenerously resolve to go and tell this to demetrius though she could hope no benefit from betray she friend 's secret but the poor pleasure of follow she faithless lover to the wood for she well know that demetrius would go thither in pursuit of hermium the wood in which lysander and hermium propose to meet be the favorite haunt of those little being know by the name of _ fairy _ oberon the king and titanium the queen of the fairy with all they tiny train of follower in this wood hold they midnight revel between this little king and queen of sprite there happen at this time a sad disagreement : they never meet by moonlight in the shady walk of this pleasant wood but they be quarrel till all they fairy elf would creep into acorn-cup and hide themselves for fear the cause of this unhappy disagreement be titanium 's refuse to give oberon a little changele boy whose mother have be titanium 's friend : and upon she death the fairy queen steal the child from its nurse and bring he up in the wood the night on which the lover be to meet in this wood as titanium be walk with some of she maid of honor she meet oberon attend by he train of fairy courtier ill meet by moonlight proud titanium say the fairy king the queen reply what jealous oberon be it you fairy skip hence i have forswear he company tarry rash fairy say oberon be not i thy lord why do titanium

while he be dance he fantastic shape in the vessel in vain the dairy-maid would labor to change she cream into butter : nor have the village swain any better success whenever puck choose to play he freak in the brewing-copper the ale be sure to be spoil when a few good neighbor be meet to drink some comfortable ale together puck would jump into the bowl of ale in the likeness of a roasted crab and when some old goody be go to drink he would bob against she lip and spill the ale over she withered chin and presently after when the same old dame be gravely seat herself to tell she neighbor a sad and melancholy story puck would slip she three-legged stool from under she and down topple the poor old woman and then the old gossip would hold they side and laugh at she and swear they never waste a merrier hour come hither puck say oberon to this little merry wanderer of the night fetch I the flower which maid call _ love in idleness _ the juice of that little purple flower lay on the eyelid of those who sleep will make they when they awake doat on the first thing they see some of the juice of that flower i will drop on the eyelid of my titanium when she be asleep and the first thing she look upon when she open she eye she will fall in love with even though it be a lion or a bear a meddle monkey or a busy ape : and before i will take this charm from off she sight which i can do with another charm i know of i will make she give I that boy to be my page puck who love mischief to he heart be highly divert with this intended frolic of he master and run to seek the flower and while oberon be wait the return of puck he observe demetrius and helena enter the wood : he overhear demetrius reproach helena for follow he and after many unkind word on he part and gentle expostulation from helena remind he of he former love and profession of true faith to she he leave she -lrb- as he say -rrb- to the mercy of the wild beast and she run after he as swiftly as she could the fairy king who be always friendly to true lover feel great compassion for helena and perhaps as lysander say they use to walk by moonlight in this pleasant wood oberon might have see helena in those happy time when she be beloved by demetrius however that might be when puck return with the little purple flower oberon say to he favorite take a part of this flower : there have be a sweet athenian lady here who be in love with a disdainful youth if you find he sleep drop some of the love-juice in he eye but contrive to do it when she be near he that the first thing he see when he awake may be this despise lady you will know the man by the athenian garment which he wear puck promise to manage this matter very dextrously and then oberon go unperceived by titanium to she bower where she be prepare to go to rest she fairy bower be a bank where grow wild thyme cowslip and sweet violet under a canopy of woodbine musk-rose and eglantine there titanium always sleep some part of the night she coverlet the enamelled skin of a snake which though a small mantle be wide enough to wrap a fairy in he find titanium give order to she fairy how they be to employ themselves while she sleep some of you say she majesty must kill canker in the musk-rose-bud and some wage war with the bat for they leathern wing to make my small elf coat and some of you keep watch that the clamorous owl that nightly hoot come not near I : but first sing I to sleep then they begin to sing this song : -- you spot snake with double tongue thorny hedgehog be not see newt and blind-worm do no wrong come not near we fairy queen philomel with melody sing in we sweet lullaby lullum lullum lullaby lullum lullum lullaby : never harm nor spell nor charm come we lovely lady nigh so good night with lullaby when the fairy have sing they queen asleep with this pretty lullaby they leave she to perform the important service she have enjoin they oberon then softly draw near he titanium and dropt some of the love-juice on she eye-lid say what thou seest when thou dost wake do it for thy true-love take but to return to hermium who make she escape out of she father 's house that night to avoid the death she be doom to for refuse to marry demetrius when she enter the wood she find she dear lysander wait for she to conduct she to he aunt 's house but before they have pass half through the wood hermium be so much fatigue that lysander who be very careful of this dear lady that have prove she affection for he even by hazard she life for he sake persuade she to rest till morning on a bank of soft moss and lie down himself on the ground at some little distance they soon fall fast asleep here they be find by puck who see a handsome young man asleep and perceive that he clothes be make in the athenian fashion and that a pretty lady be sleep near he conclude that this must be the athenian maid and she disdainful lover whom oberon have send he to seek and he naturally enough conjecture that as they be alone together she must be the first thing he would see when he awake : so without more ado he proceed to pour some of the juice of the little purple flower into he eye but it so fall out that helena come that way and instead of hermium be the first object lysander behold when he open he eye : and strange to relate so powerful be the love-charm all he love for hermium vanish away and lysander fall in love with helena have he first see hermium when he awake the blunder puck commit would have be of no consequence for he could not love that faithful lady too well but for poor lysander to be force by a fairy love-charm to forget he own true hermium and to run after another lady and leave hermium asleep quite alone in a wood at midnight be a sad chance indeed thus this misfortune happen helena as have be before related endeavor to keep pace with demetrius when he run away so rudely from she but she could not continue this unequal race long man be always better runner in a long race than lady helena soon lose sight of demetrius and as she be wander about dejected and forlorn she arrive at the place where lysander be sleep ah say she this be lysander lie on the ground : be he dead or asleep then gently touch he she say good sir if you be alive awake upon this lysander open he eye and -lrb- the love-charm begin to work -rrb- immediately address she in term of extravagant love and admiration tell she she as much excel hermium in beauty as a dive do a raven and that he would run through fire for she sweet sake and many more such lover-like speech helena know lysander be she friend hermium 's lover and that he be solemnly engage to marry she be in the utmost rage when she hear herself address in this manner for she think -lrb- as well she might -rrb- that lysander be make a jest of she oh say she why be i bear to be mock and scorn by every one be it not enough be it not enough young man that i can never get a sweet look or a kind word from demetrius but you sir must pretend in this disdainful manner to court I i think lysander you be a lord of more true gentleness say these word in great anger she run away and lysander follow she quite forgetful of he own hermium who be still asleep when hermium awake she be in a sad fright at find herself alone she wander about the wood not know what be become of lysander or which way to go to seek for he in the mean time demetrius not be able to find hermium and he rival lysander and fatigue with he fruitless search be observe by oberon fast asleep oberon have learn by some question he have ask of puck that he have apply the love-charm to the wrong person 's eye and now have find the person first intend he touch the eyelid of the sleep demetrius with the love-juice and he instantly awake and the first thing he see be helena he as lysander have do before begin to address love-speech to she : and just at that moment lysander follow by hermium -lrb- for through puck 's unlucky mistake it be now become hermium 's turn to run after she lover -rrb- make he appearance and then lysander and demetrius both speak together make love to helena they be each one under the influence of the same potent charm the astonished helena think that demetrius lysander and she once dear friend hermium be all in a plot together to make a jest of she hermium be as much surprised as helena : she know not why lysander and demetrius who both before love she be now become the lover of helena and to hermia the matter seem to be no jest the lady who before have always be the dearest of friend now fall to high word together unkind hermium say helena it be you have set lysander on to vex I with mock praise and you other lover demetrius who use almost to spurn I with he foot have you not bid he call I goddess nymph rare precious and celestial he would not speak thus to I whom he hate if you do not set he on to make a jest of I unkind hermium to join with man in scorn you poor friend have you forget we school-day friendship how often hermium have we two sit on one cushion both singing one song with we needle work the same flower both on the same sampler work grow up together in fashion of a double cherry scarcely seem part hermium it be not friendly in you it be not maidenly to join with man in scorn you poor friend i be amaze at you passionate word say hermium : i scorn you not it seem you scorn I aye do return helena persevere counterfeit serious look and make mouth at I when i turn my back then wink at each other and hold the sweet jest up if you have any pity grace or manners you would not use I thus while helena and hermium be speak these angry word to each other demetrius and lysander leave they to fight together in the wood for the love of helena when they find the gentleman have leave they they depart and once more wander weary in the wood in search of they lover as soon as they be go the fairy king who with little puck have be listen to they quarrel say to he

temper and love to divert she cousin hero who be of a more serious disposition with she sprightly sally whatever be go forward be sure to make matter of mirth for the light-hearted beatrice at the time the history of these lady commence some young man of high rank in the army as they be pass through messina on they return from a war that be just end in which they have distinguish themselves by they great bravery come to visit leonato among these be don pedro the prince of arragon and he friend claudio who be a lord of florence and with they come the wild and witty benedick and he be a lord of padua these stranger have be at messina before and the hospitable governor introduce they to he daughter and he niece as they old friend and acquaintance benedick the moment he enter the room begin a lively conversation with leonato and the prince beatrice who like not to be leave out of any discourse interrupted benedick with say i wonder that you will still be talk signior benedick nobody mark you benedick be just such another rattle-brain as beatrice yet he be not please at this free salutation : he think it do not become a well-bred lady to be so flippant with she tongue and he remember when he be last at messina that beatrice use to select he to make she merry jest upon and as there be no one who so little likes to be make a jest of as those who be apt to take the same liberty themselves so it be with benedick and beatrice these two sharp wit never meet in former time but a perfect war of raillery be keep up between they and they always part mutually displeased with each other therefore when beatrice stop he in the middle of he discourse with tell he nobody mark what he be say benedick affect not to have observe before that she be present say what my dear lady disdain be you yet live and now war break out afresh between they and a long jangling argument ensue during which beatrice although she know he have so well approve he valor in the late war say that she would eat all he have kill there : and observe the prince take delight in benedick 's conversation she call he the prince 's jester this sarcasm sink deeper into the mind of benedick than all beatrice have say before the hint she give he that he be a coward by say she would eat all he have kill he do not regard know himself to be a brave man : but there be nothing that great wit so much dread as the imputation of buffoonery because the charge come sometimes a little too near the truth therefore benedick perfectly hate beatrice when she call he the prince 's jester the modest lady hero be silent before the noble guest and while claudio be attentively observe the improvement which time have make in she beauty and be contemplate the exquisite grace of she fine figure -lrb- for she be a admirable young lady -rrb- the prince be highly amuse with listen to the humorous dialogue between benedick and beatrice and he say in a whisper to leonato this be a pleasant-spirited young lady she be a excellent wife for benedick leonato reply to this suggestion o my lord my lord if they be but a week marry they would talk themselves mad but though leonato think they would make a discordant pair the prince do not give up the idea of match these two keen wit together when the prince return with claudio from the palace he find that the marriage he have devise between benedick and beatrice be not the only one project in that good company for claudio speak in such term of hero as make the prince guess at what be pass in he heart and he like it well and he say to claudio do you affect hero to this question claudio reply o my lord when i be last at messina i look upon she with a soldier 's eye that like but have no leisure for loving but now in this happy time of peace thought of war have leave they place vacant in my mind and in they room come throng soft and delicate thought all prompt I how fair young hero be remind I that i like she before i go to the war claudio 's confession of he love for hero so work upon the prince that he lose no time in solicit the consent of leonato to accept of claudio for a son-in-law leonato agree to this proposal and the prince find no great difficulty in persuade the gentle hero herself to listen to the suit of the noble claudio who be a lord of rare endowment and highly accomplish and claudio assist by he kind prince soon prevail upon leonato to fix a early day for the celebration of he marriage with hero claudio be to wait but a few day before he be to be marry to he fair lady yet he complain of the interval be tedious as indeed most young man be impatient when they be wait for the accomplishment of any event they have set they heart upon : the prince therefore to make the time seem short to he propose as a kind of merry pastime that they should invent some artful scheme to make benedick and beatrice fall in love with each other claudio enter with great satisfaction into this whim of the prince and leonato promise they he assistance and even hero say she would do any modest office to help she cousin to a good husband the device the prince invent be that the gentleman should make benedick believe that beatrice be in love with he and that hero should make beatrice believe that benedick be in love with she the prince leonato and claudio begin they operation first and watch a opportunity when benedick be quietly seat reading in a arbor the prince and he assistant take they station among the tree behind the arbor so near that benedick could not choose but hear all they say and after some careless talk the prince say come hither leonato what be it you tell I the other day -- that you niece beatrice be in love with signior benedick i do never think that lady would have love any man no nor i neither my lord answer leonato it be most wonderful that she should so doat on benedick whom she in all outward behavior seem ever to dislike claudio confirm all this with say that hero have tell he beatrice be so in love with benedick that she would certainly die of grief if he could not be bring to love she which leonato and claudio seem to agree be impossible he have always be such a railer against all fair lady and in particular against beatrice the prince affect to hearken to all this with great compassion for beatrice and he say it be good that benedick be tell of this to what end say claudio he would but make sport of it and torment the poor lady worse and if he should say the prince it be a good deed to hang he for beatrice be a excellent sweet lady and exceed wise in every thing but in loving benedick then the prince motion to he companion that they should walk on and leave benedick to meditate upon what he have overhear benedick have be listen with great eagerness to this conversation and he say to himself when he hear beatrice love he be it possible sit the wind in that corner and when they be go he begin to reason in this manner with himself this can be no trick they be very serious and they have the truth from hero and seem to pity the lady love I why it must be requite i do never think to marry but when i say i should die a bachelor i do not think i should live to be marry they say the lady be virtuous and fair she be so and wise in every thing but in loving I why that be no great argument of she folly but here come beatrice by this day she be a fair lady i do spy some mark of love in she beatrice now approach he and say with she usual tartness against my will i be send to bid you come in to dinner benedick who never feel himself dispose to speak so politely to she before reply fair beatrice i thank you for you pain : and when beatrice after two or three more rude speech leave he benedick think he observe a conceal meaning of kindness under the uncivil word she utter and he say aloud if i do not take pity on she i be a villain if i do not love she i be a jew i will go get she picture the gentleman be thus catch in the net they have spread for he it be now hero 's turn to play she part with beatrice and for this purpose she send for ursulum and margaret two gentlewoman who attend upon she and she say to margaret good margaret run to the parlor there you will find my cousin beatrice talk with the prince and claudio whisper in she ear that i and ursulum be walk in the orchard and that we discourse be all of she bid she steal into that pleasant arbor where honey-suckle ripen by the sun like ungrateful minion forbid the sun to enter this arbor into which hero desire margaret to entice beatrice be the very same pleasant arbor where benedick have so lately be a attentive listener i will make she come i warrant presently say margaret hero then take ursulum with she into the orchard say to she now ursulum when beatrice come we will walk up and down this alley and we talk must be only of benedick and when i name he let it be you part to praise he more than ever man do merit my talk to you must be how benedick be in love with beatrice now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing run close by the ground to hear we conference they then begin hero say as if in answer to something which ursulum have say no truly ursula she be too disdainful she spirit be as coy as wild bird of the rock but be you sure say ursulum that benedick love beatrice so entirely hero reply so say the prince and my lord claudio and they intreat I to acquaint she with it but i persuade they if they love benedick never to let beatrice know of it certainly reply ursulum it be not good she know he love lest she make sport of it why to say truth say hero i never yet see a man how wise soever or noble young or rarely feature but she would dispraise he sure sure such carping be not commendable say ursulum no reply hero but who dare tell she so if i should speak she would mock I into air o you wrong you cousin say ursulum : she can not be so much without true judgment as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick he have a excellent good name say hero : indeed he be the first man in italy always except my dear claudio and now hero give she attendant a hint that it be time to change the discourse ursulum say and when be you to be marry madam hero then tell she that she be to be marry to claudio the next day and desire she would go in with she and look at some new attire as she wish to consult with she on what she should wear on the morrow beatrice who have be listen with breathless eagerness to this dialogue when they go away exclaim what fire be in my ear can this be true farewel contempt and scorn and maiden pride adieu benedick love on i will requite you tame my wild heart to you loving hand it must have be a pleasant sight to see these old enemy convert into new and loving friend and to behold they first meeting after be cheat into mutual liking by the merry artifice of the good-humoured prince but a sad reverse in the fortune of hero must now be think of the morrow which be to have be she wedding day bring sorrow on the heart of hero and she good father leonato the prince have a half-brother who come from the war along with he to messina this brother -lrb- he name be don john -rrb- be a melancholy discontented man whose spirit seem to labor in the contriving of villany he hate the prince he brother and he hate claudio because he be the prince 's friend and determine to prevent claudio 's marriage with hero only for the malicious pleasure of make claudio and the prince unhappy : for he know the prince have set he heart upon this marriage almost as much as claudio himself : and to effect this wicked purpose he employ one borachio a man as bad as himself whom he encourage with the offer of a great reward this borachio pay he court to margaret hero 's attendant and don john know this prevail upon he to make margaret promise to talk with he from she lady 's chamber-window that night after hero be asleep and also to dress herself in hero 's clothes the better to deceive claudio into the belief that it be hero for that be the end he mean to compass by this wicked plot don john then go to the prince and claudio and tell they that hero be a imprudent lady and that she talk with man from she chamber-window at midnight now this be the evening before the wedding and he offer to take they that night where they should themselves hear hero discourse with a man from she window and they consent to go along with he and claudio say if i see any thing to-night why i should not marry she to-morrow in the congregation where i intend to wed she there will i shame she the prince also say and as i assist you to obtain she i will join with you to disgrace she when don john bring they near hero 's chamber that night they see borachio standing under the window and they see margaret look out of hero 's window and hear she talking with borachio and margaret be dress in the same clothes they have see hero wear the prince and claudio believe it be the lady hero herself nothing could equal the anger of claudio when he have make -lrb- as he think -rrb- this discovery all he love for the innocent hero be at once convert into hatred and he resolve to expose she in the church as he have say he would the next day and the prince agree to this think no punishment could be too severe for the naughty lady who talk with a man from she window the very night before she be go to be marry to the noble claudio the next day when they be all meet to celebrate the marriage and claudio and hero be stand before the priest and the priest or friar as he be call be proceed to pronounce the marriage-ceremony claudio in the most passionate language proclaim the guilt of the blameless hero who amaze at the strange word he utter say meekly be my lord well that he do speak so wide leonato in the utmost horror say to the prince my lord why speak not you what should i speak say the prince i stand dishonour that have go about to link my dear friend to a unworthy woman leonato upon my honor myself my brother and this grieve claudio do see and hear she last night at midnight talk with a man at she chamber-window benedick in astonishment at what he hear say this look not like a nuptial true o god reply the heart-struck hero and then this hapless lady sink down in a faint fit to all appearance dead the prince and claudio leave the church without stay to see if hero would recover or at all regard the distress into which they have throw leonato so hard-hearted have they anger make they benedick remain and assist beatrice to recover hero from she swoon say how do the lady dead i think reply beatrice in great agony for she love she cousin and know she virtuous principle she believe nothing of what she have hear speak against she not so the poor old father he believe the story of he child 's shame and it be piteous to hear he lament over she as she lay like one dead before he wish she might never more open she eye but the ancient friar be a wise man and full of observation on human nature and he have attentively mark the lady 's countenance when she hear herself accuse and note a thousand blush shame to start into she face and then he see a angel-like whiteness bear away those blush and in she eye he see a fire that do belie the error that the prince do speak against she maiden truth and he say to the sorrowing father call I a fool trust not my reading nor my observation trust not my age my reverence nor my call if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some bite error when hero have recover from the swoon into which she have fall the friar say to she lady what man be he you be accuse of hero reply they know that do accuse I i know of none : then turn to leonato she say o my father if you can prove that any man have ever converse with I at hour unmeet or that i yesternight change word with any creature refuse I hate I torture I to death there be say the friar some strange misunderstanding in the prince and claudio and then he counsel leonato that he should report that hero be dead and he say that the death-like swoon in which they have leave hero would make this easy of belief and he also advise he that he should put on mourning and erect a monument for she and do all rite that appertain to a burial what shall become of this say leonato what will this do the friar reply this report of she death shall change slander into pity that be some good but that be not all the good i hope for when claudio shall hear she die upon hear he word the idea of she life shall sweetly creep into he imagination then shall he mourn if ever love have interest in he heart and wish he have not so accuse she : yea though he think he accusation true benedick now say leonato let the friar advise you and though you know how well i love the prince and claudio yet on my honor i will not reveal this secret to they leonato thus persuade yield and he say sorrowfully i be so grieve that the smallest twine may lead I the kind friar then lead leonato and hero away to comfort and console they and beatrice and benedick remain alone and this be the meeting from which they friend who contrived the merry plot against they expect so much diversion those friend who be now overwhelm with affliction and from whose mind all thought of merriment seem for ever banish benedick be the first who speak and he say lady beatrice have you weep all this while yea and i will weep a while longer say beatrice surely say benedick i do believe you fair cousin be wrong ah say beatrice how much might that man deserve of I who would right she benedick then say be there any way to show such friendship i do love nothing in the world so well as you be not that strange it be as possible say beatrice for I to say i love nothing in the world so well as you but believe I not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i be sorry for my cousin by my sword say benedick you love I and i protest i love you come bid I do any thing for you kill claudio say beatrice ha not for the wide world say benedick : for he love he friend claudio and he believe he have be impose upon be not claudio a villain that have slander scorn and dishonour my cousin say beatrice : o that i be a man hear I beatrice say benedick but beatrice would hear nothing in claudio 's defense and she continue to urge on benedick to revenge she cousin 's wrong : and she say talk with a man out of the window a proper say sweet hero she be wrong she be slander she be undo o that i be a man for claudio 's sake or that i have any friend who would be a man for my sake but valor be melt into courtesy and compliment i can not be a man with wish therefore i will die a woman with grieve tarry good beatrice say benedick : by this hand i love you use it for my love some other way than swearing by it say beatrice think you on you soul that claudio have wrong hero ask benedick yea answer beatrice as sure as i have a thought or a soul enough say benedick i be engage i will challenge he i will kiss you hand and so leave you by this hand claudio shall render I a dear account as you hear from I so think of I go comfort you cousin while beatrice be thus powerfully plead with benedick and work he gallant temper by the spirit of she angry word to engage in the cause of hero and fight even with he dear friend claudio leonato be challenge the prince and claudio to answer with they sword the injury they have do he child who he affirm have die for grief but they respect he age and he sorrow and they say nay do not quarrel with we good old man and now come benedick and he also challenge claudio to answer with he sword the injury he have do to hero : and claudio and the prince say to each other beatrice have set he on to do this claudio nevertheless must have accept this challenge of benedick have not the justice of heaven at the moment bring to pass a better proof of the innocence of hero than the uncertain fortune of a duel while the prince and claudio be yet talk of the challenge of benedick a magistrate bring borachio as a prisoner before the prince borachio have be overhear talk with one of he companion of the mischief he have be employ by don john to do borachio make a full confession to the prince in claudio 's hearing that it be margaret dress in she lady 's clothes that he have talk with from the window whom they have mistake for the lady hero herself and no doubt continue on the mind of claudio and the prince of the innocence of hero if a suspicion have remain it must have be remove by the flight of don john who find he villany be detect flee from messina to avoid the just anger of he brother the heart of claudio be sorely grieve when he find he have falsely accuse hero who he think die upon hear he cruel word and the memory of he beloved hero 's image come over he in the rare semblance that he love it first : and the prince ask he if what he hear do not run like iron through he soul he answer that he feel as if he have take poison while borachio be speak and the repentant claudio implore forgiveness of the old man leonato for the injury he have do he child and promise that whatever penance leonato would lay upon he for he fault in believe the false accusation against he betrothed wife for she dear sake he would endure it the penance leonato enjoin he be to marry the next morning a cousin of hero 's who he say be now he heir and in person very like hero claudio regard the solemn promise he have make to leonato say he would marry this unknown lady even though she be a ethiop : but he heart be very sorrowful and he pass that night in tear and in remorseful grief at the tomb which leonato have erect for hero when the morning come the prince accompany claudio to the church where the good friar and leonato and he niece be already assemble to celebrate a second nuptial : and leonato present to claudio he promise bride and she wear a mask that claudio might not discover she face and claudio say to the lady in the mask give I you hand before this holy friar i be you husband if you will marry I and when i live i be you other wife say this unknown lady and take off she mask she prove to be no niece -lrb- as be pretended -rrb- but leonato 's very daughter the lady hero herself we may be sure that this prove a most agreeable surprise to claudio who think she dead so that he could scarcely for joy believe he eye : and the prince who be equally amaze at what he see exclaim be not this hero hero that be dead leonato reply she die my lord but while she slander live the friar promise they a explanation of this seem miracle after the ceremony be end and be proceed to marry they when he be interrupt by benedick who desire to be marry at the same time to beatrice beatrice make some demur to this match and benedick challenging she with she love for he which he have learn from hero a pleasant explanation take place and they find they have both be trick into a belief of love which have never exist and have become lover in truth by the power of a false jest : but the affection which a merry invention have cheat they into be grow too powerful to be shake by a serious explanation and since benedick propose to marry he be resolve to think nothing to the purpose that the world could say against it and he merrily keep up the jest and swear to beatrice that he take she but for pity and because he hear she be die of love for he and beatrice protest that she yield but upon great persuasion and partly to save he life for she hear he be in a consumption so these two mad wit be reconcile and make a match of it after claudio and hero be marry and to complete the history don john the contriver of the villany be take in he flight and bring back to messina and a brave punishment it be to this gloomy discontented man to see the joy and feasting which by the disappointment of he plot take place at the palace in messina as you like it -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- during the time that france be divide into province -lrb- or dukedom as they be call -rrb- there reign in one of these province a usurper who have depose and banish he elder brother the lawful duke the duke who be thus drive from he dominion retire with a few faithful follower to the forest of arden and here the good duke live with he loving friend who have put themselves into a voluntary exile for he sake while they land and revenue enrich the false usurper and custom soon make the life of careless ease they lead here more sweet to they than the pomp and uneasy splendor of a courtier 's life here they live like the old robin hood of england and to this forest many noble youth daily resort from the court and do fleet the time carelessly as they do who live in the golden age in the summer they lay along under the fine shade of the large forest tree mark the playful sport of the wild deer and so fond be they of these poor dappled fool who seem to be the native inhabitant of the forest that it grieve they to be force to kill they to supply themselves with venison for they food when the cold wind of winter make the duke feel the change of he adverse fortune he would endure it patiently and say these chill wind which blow upon my body be true counsellor they do not flatter but represent truly to I my condition and though they bite sharply they tooth be nothing like so keen as that of unkindness and ingratitude i find that howsoever man speak against adversity yet some sweet use be to be extract from it like the jewel precious for medicine which be take from the head of the venomous and despise toad in this manner do the patient duke draw a useful moral from everything that he see and by the help of this moralise turn in that life of he remote from public haunt he could find tongue in tree book in the run brook sermon in stone and good in every thing the banish duke have a only daughter name rosalind whom the usurper duke frederick when he banish she father still retain in he court as a companion for he own daughter celium a strict friendship subsist between these lady which the disagreement between they father do not in the least interrupt celium strive by every kindness in she power to make amends to rosalind for the injustice of she own father in depose the father of rosalind and whenever the thought of she father 's banishment and she own dependance on the false usurper make rosalind melancholy celium 's whole care be to comfort and console she one day when celium be talk in she usual kind manner to rosalind say i pray you rosalind my sweet cousin be merry a messenger enter from the duke to tell they that if they wish to see a wrestling match which be just go to begin they must come instantly to the court before the palace and celium think it would amuse rosalind agree to go and see it in those time wrestle which be only practice now by country clown be a favorite sport even in the court of prince and before fair lady and princess to this wrestling-match therefore celium and rosalind go they find that it be likely to prove a very tragical sight for a large and powerful man who have long be practice in the art of wrestling and have slay many man in contest of this kind be just go to wrestle with a very young man who from he extreme youth and inexperience in the art the beholder all think would certainly be kill when the duke see celium and rosalind he say how now daughter and niece be you creep hither to see the wrestling you will take little delight in it there be such odds in the man : in pity to this young roan i would wish to persuade he from wrestle speak to he lady and see if you can move he the lady be well pleased to perform this humane office and first celium entreat the young stranger that he would desist from the attempt and then rosalind speak so kindly to he and with such feeling consideration for the danger he be about to undergo that instead of be persuade by she gentle word to forego he purpose all he thought be bent to distinguish himself by he courage in this lovely lady 's eye he refuse the request of celium and rosalind in such graceful and modest word that they feel still more concern for he he conclude he refusal with say i be sorry to deny such fair and excellent lady any thing but let you fair eye and gentle wish go with I to my trial wherein if i be conquer there be one shame that be never gracious if i be kill there be one dead that be willing to die : i shall do my friend no wrong for i have none to lament I the world no injury for in it i have nothing for i only fill up a place in the world which may be better supply when i have make it empty and now the wrestling-match begin celium wish the young stranger might not be hurt but rosalind feel most for he the friendless state which he say he be in and that he wish to die make rosalind think that he be like herself unfortunate and she pity he so much and so deep a interest she take in he danger while he be wrestle that she might almost be say at that moment to have fall in love with he the kindness shewn this unknown youth by these fair and noble lady give he courage and strength so that he perform wonder and in the end completely conquer he antagonist who be so much hurt that for a while he be unable to speak or move the duke frederick be much pleased with the courage and skill shewn by this young stranger and desire to know he name and parentage meaning to take he under he protection the stranger say he name be orlando and that he be the youngest son of sir rowland de boy sir rowland de boy the father of orlando have be dead some year but when he be live he have be a true subject and dear friend of the banish duke : therefore when frederick hear orlando be the son of he banish brother 's friend all he liking for this brave young man be change into displeasure and he leave the place in very ill humor hate to hear the very name of any of he brother 's friend and yet still admire the valor of the youth he say as he go out that he wish orlando have be the son of any other man rosalind be delighted to hear that she new favorite be the son of she father 's old friend and she say to celia my father love sir rowland de boy and if i have know this young man be he son i would have add tear to my entreaty before he should have venture the lady then go up to he and see he abashed by the sudden displeasure shewn by the duke they speak kind and encouraging word to he and rosalind when they be go away turn back to speak some more civil thing to the brave young son of she father 's old friend and take a chain from off she neck she say gentleman wear this for I i be out of suit with fortune or i would give you a more valuable present when the lady be alone rosalind 's talk be still of orlando celium begin to perceive she cousin have fall in love with the handsome young wrestler and she say to rosalind be it possible you should fall in love so suddenly rosalind reply the duke my father love he father dearly but say celium do it therefore follow that you should love he son dearly for then i ought to hate he for my father hate he father yet i do not hate orlando frederick be enrage at the sight of sir rowland de boy ' son which remind he of the many friend the banish duke have among the nobility and have be for some time displeased with he niece because the people praise she for she virtue and pity she for she good father 's sake he malice suddenly break out against she and while celium and rosalind be talk of orlando frederick enter the room and with look full of anger order rosalind instantly to leave the palace and follow she father into banishment tell celium who in vain plead for she that he have only suffer rosalind to stay upon she account i do not then say celium entreat you to let she stay for i be too young at that time to value she but now that i know she worth and that we so long have sleep together rise at the same instant learn play and eat together i can not live out of she company frederick reply she be too subtle for you she smoothness she very silence and she patience speak to the people and they pity she you be a fool to plead for she for you will seem more bright and virtuous when she be go therefore open not you lip in she favor for the doom which i have pass upon she be irrevocable when celium find she could not prevail upon she father to let rosalind remain with she she generously resolve to accompany she and leave she father 's palace that night she go along with she friend to seek rosalind 's father the banish duke in the forest of arden before they set out celium consider that it would be unsafe for two young lady to travel in the rich clothes they then wear she therefore propose that they should disguise they rank by dress themselves like country maid rosalind say it would be a still greater protection if one of they be to be dress like a man and so it be quickly agree on between they that as rosalind be the tallest she should wear the dress of a young countryman and celium should be habit like a country lass and that they should say they be brother and sister and rosalind say she would be call ganimed and celium choose the name of aliena in this disguise and take they money and jewel to defray they expence these fair princess set out on they long travel for the forest of arden be a long way off beyond the boundary of the duke 's dominion the lady rosalind -lrb- or ganime as she must now be call -rrb- with she manly garb seem to have put on a manly courage the faithful friendship celium have shew in accompany rosalind so many weary mile make the new brother in recompence for this true love exert a cheerful spirit as if he be indeed ganime the rustic and stout-hearted brother of the gentle village maiden aliena when at last they come to the forest of arden they no longer find the convenient inn and good accommodation they have meet with on the road and be in want of food and rest ganime who have so merrily cheer he sister with pleasant speech and happy remark all the way now own to aliena that he be so weary he could find in he heart to disgrace he man 's apparel and cry like a woman and aliena declare she could go no farther and then again ganime try to recollect that it be a man 's duty to comfort and console a woman as the weaker vessel : and to seem courageous to he new sister he say come have a good heart my sister aliena we be now at the end of we travel in the forest of arden but feigned manliness and force courage would no longer support they for though they be in the forest of arden they know not where to find the duke : and here the travel of these weary lady might have come to a sad conclusion for they might have lose themselves and have perish for want of food but providentially as they be sit on the grass almost die with fatigue and hopeless of any relief a countryman chance to pass that way and ganime once more try to speak with a manly boldness say shepherd if love or gold can in this desert place procure we entertainment i pray you bring we where we may rest ourselves for this young maid my sister be much fatigue with travel and faint for want of food the man reply that he be only a servant to a shepherd and that he master 's house be just go to be sell and therefore they would find but poor entertainment but that if they would go with he they should be welcome to what there be they follow the man the near prospect of relief give they fresh strength and buy the house and sheep of the shepherd and take the man who conduct they to the shepherd 's house to wait on they and be by this mean so fortunately provide with a neat cottage and well supply with provision they agree to stay here till they could learn in what part of the forest the duke dwelt when they be rest after the fatigue of they journey they begin to like they new way of life and almost fancy themselves the shepherd and shepherdess they feign to be yet sometimes ganimed remember he have once be the same lady rosalind who have so dearly love the brave orlando because he be the son of old sir rowland she father 's friend and though ganimed thought that orlando be many mile distant even so many weary mile as they have travel yet it soon appear that orlando be also in the forest of arden : and in this manner this strange event come to pass orlando be the youngest son of sir rowland de boy who when he die leave he -lrb- orlando be then very young -rrb- to the care of he eldest brother oliver charge oliver on he blessing to give he brother a good education and provide for he as become the dignity of they ancient house oliver prove a unworthy brother and disregard the command of he die father he never put he brother to school but keep he at home untaught and entirely neglect but in he nature and in the noble quality of he mind orlando so much resemble he excellent father that without any advantage of education he seem like a youth who have be breed with the utmost care and oliver so envy the fine person and dignified manners of he untutored brother that at last he wish to destroy he and to effect this he set on people to persuade he to wrestle with the famous wrestler who as have be before relate have kill so many man now it be this cruel brother 's neglect of he which make orlando say he wish to die be so friendless when contrary to the wicked hope he have form he brother prove victorious he envy and malice know no bound and he swear he would burn the chamber where orlando sleep he be overhear make this vow by one that have be a old and faithful servant to they father and that loved orlando because he resemble sir rowland this old man go out to meet he when he return from the duke 's palace and when he see orlando the peril he dear young master be in make he break out into these passionate exclamation : o my gentle master my sweet master o you memory of old sir rowland why be you virtuous why be you gentle strong and valiant and why would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler you praise be come too swiftly home before you orlando wonder what all this mean ask he what be the matter and then the old man tell he how he wicked brother envy the love all people bear he and now hear the fame he have gain by he victory in the duke 's palace intend to destroy he by set fire to he chamber that night and in conclusion advise he to escape the danger he be in by instant flight : and know orlando have no money adam -lrb- for that be the good old man 's name -rrb- have bring out with he he own little hoard and he say i have five hundred crown the thrifty hire i save under you father and lay by to be provision for I when my old limb should become

in all you business and necessity o good old man say orlando how well appear in you the constant service of the old world you be not for the fashion of these time we will go along together and before you youthful wages be spend i shall light upon some means for both we maintenance together then this faithful servant and he loved master set out and orlando and adam travel on uncertain what course to pursue till they come to the forest of arden and there they find themselves in the same distress for want of food that ganime and aliena have be they wander on seek some human habitation till they be almost spend with hunger and fatigue adam at last say o my dear master i die for want of food i can go no farther he then lay himself down think to make that place he grave and bid he dear master farewel orlando see he in this weak state take he old servant up in he arm and carry he under the shelter of some pleasant tree and he say to he cheerly old adam rest you weary limb here a while and do not talk of die orlando then search about to find some food and he happen to arrive at that part of the forest where the duke be and he and he friend be just go to eat they dinner this royal duke be seat on the grass under no other canopy than the shady covert of some large tree orlando whom hunger have make desperate draw he sword intend to take they meat by force and say forbear and eat no more i must have you food the duke ask he if distress have make he so bold or if he be a rude despiser of good manners on this orlando say he be die with hunger and then the duke tell he he be welcome to sit down and eat with they orlando hear he speak so gently put up he sword and blush with shame at the rude manner in which he have demand they food pardon I i pray you say he : i think that all

it be to pity or be pity may gentle speech now move you to do I human courtesy the duke reply true it be that we be man -lrb- as you say -rrb- who have see better day and though we have now we habitation in this wild forest we have live in town and city and have with holy bell be knoll to church have sate at good man 's feast and from we eye have wipe the drop which sacred pity have engender : therefore sit you down and take of we refreshment as much as will minister to you want there be a old poor man answer orlando who have limp after I many a weary step in pure love oppress at once with two sad infirmity age and hunger till he be satisfied i must not touch a bit go find he out and bring he hither say the duke we will forbear to eat till you return then orlando go like a doe to find its fawn and give it food and presently return bring adam in he arm and the duke say set down you venerable burthen you be both welcome : and they feed the old man and cheer he heart and he revive and recover he health and strength again the duke enquire who orlando be and when he find that he be the son of he old friend sir rowland de boy he take he under he protection and orlando and he old servant live with the duke in the forest orlando have not be in the forest many day before ganime and aliena arrive there and -lrb- as have be before related -rrb- buy the shepherd 's cottage ganime and aliena be strangely surprise to find the name of rosalind carve on the tree and love-sonnet fasten to they all address to rosalind and while they be wonder how this could be they meet orlando and they perceive the chain which rosalind have give he about he neck orlando little thought that ganime be the fair princess rosalind who by she noble condescension and favor have so win he heart that he pass he whole time in carve she name upon the tree and write sonnet in praise of she beauty : but be much pleased with the graceful air of this pretty shepherd-youth he enter into conversation with he and he think he see a likeness in ganime to he beloved rosalind but that he have none of the dignified deportment of that noble lady for ganimed assume the forward manners often see in youth when they be between boy and man and with much archness and humor talk to orlando of a certain lover who say he haunt we forest and spoil we young tree with carve rosalind upon they bark and he hang ode upon hawthorn and elegy on bramble all praise this same rosalind if i could find this lover i would give he some good counsel that would soon cure he of he love orlando confess that he be the fond lover of whom he speak and ask ganime to give he the good counsel he talk of the remedy ganime propose and the counsel he give he be that orlando should come every day to the cottage where he and he sister aliena dwelt : and then say ganime i will feign myself to be rosalind and you shall feign to court I in the same manner as you would do if i be rosalind and then i will imitate the fantastic way of whimsical lady to they lover till i make you ashamed of you love and this be the way i propose to cure you orlando have no great faith in the remedy yet he agree to come every day to ganime 's cottage and feign a playful courtship and every day orlando visit ganimed and aliena and orlando call the shepherd ganime he rosalind and every day talk over all the fine word and flattering compliment which young man delight to use when they court they mistress it do not appear however that ganime make any progress in cure orlando of he love for rosalind though orlando think all this be but a sportive play -lrb- not dream that ganime be he very rosalind -rrb- yet the opportunity it give he of say all the fond thing he have in he heart please he fancy almost as well as it do ganimed 's who enjoy the secret jest in know these fine love-speech be all address to the right person in this manner many day pass pleasantly on with these young people and the good-natured aliena see it make ganimed happy let he have he own way and be divert at the mock courtship and do not care to remind ganime that the lady rosalind have not yet make herself know to the duke she father whose place of resort in the forest they have learn from orlando ganime meet the duke one day and have some talk with he and the duke ask of what parentage he come : ganime answer that he come of as good parentage as he do which make the duke smile for he do not suspect the pretty shepherd-boy come of royal lineage then see the duke look well and happy ganimed be content to put off all further explanation for a few day longer one morning as orlando be go to visit ganimed he see a man lie asleep on the ground and a large green snake have twist itself about he neck the snake see orlando approach glide away among the bush orlando go nearer and then he discover a lioness lie couch with she head on the ground with a cat-like watch wait till the sleep man awake -lrb- for it be say that lion will prey on nothing that be dead or sleeping -rrb- it seem as if orlando be send by providence to free the man from the danger of the snake and the lioness : but when orlando look in the man 's face he perceive that the sleeper who be expose to this double peril be he own brother oliver who have so cruelly use he and have threaten to destroy he by fire and he be almost tempt to leave he a prey to the hungry lioness : but brotherly affection and the gentleness of he nature soon overcome he first anger against he brother and he draw he sword and attack the lioness and slew she and thus preserve he brother 's life both from the venomous snake and from the furious lioness : but before orlando could conquer the lioness she have tear one of he arm with she sharp claw while orlando be engage with the lioness oliver awake and perceive that he brother orlando whom he have so cruelly treat be save he from the fury of a wild beast at the risk of he own life shame and remorse at once seize he and he repent of he unworthy conduct and besought with many tear he brother 's pardon for the injury he have do he orlando rejoice to see he so penitent and readily forgive he : they embrace each other and from that hour oliver love orlando with a true brotherly affection though he have come to the forest bent on he destruction the wound in orlando 's arm have bleed very much he find himself too weak to go to visit ganimed and therefore he desire he brother to go and tell ganimed whom say orlando i in sport do call my rosalind the accident which have befall he thither then oliver go and tell to ganime and aliena how orlando have save he life : and when he have finish the story of orlando 's bravery and he own providential escape he own to they that he be orlando 's brother who have so cruelly use he and then he tell they of they reconciliation the sincere sorrow that oliver express for he offence make such a lively impression on the kind heart of aliena that she instantly fall in love with he and oliver observe how much she pity the distress he tell she he feel for he fault he as suddenly fall in love with she but while love be thus steal into the heart of aliena and oliver he be no less busy with ganime who hearing of the danger orlando have be in and that he be wound by the lioness faint and when he recover he pretend that he have counterfeit the swoon in the imaginary character of rosalind and ganime say to oliver tell you brother orlando how well i counterfeit a swoon but oliver saw by the paleness of he complexion that he do really faint and much wonder at the weakness of the young man he say well if you do counterfeit take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man so i do reply ganime -lrb- truly -rrb- but i should have be a woman by right oliver make this visit a very long one and when at last he return back to he brother he have much news to tell he for besides the account of ganimed 's fainting at the hearing that orlando be wound oliver tell he how he have fall in love with the fair shepherdess aliena and that she have lend a favourable ear to he suit even in this they first interview and he talk to he brother as of a thing almost settle that he should marry aliena say that he so well love she that he would live here as a shepherd and settle he estate and house at home upon orlando you have my consent say orlando let you wedding be to-morrow and i will invite the duke and he friend go and persuade you shepherdess to agree to this : she be now alone for look here come she brother oliver go to aliena and ganimed whom orlando have perceive approach come to enquire after the health of he wounded friend when orlando and ganimed begin to talk over the sudden love which have take place between oliver and aliena orlando say he have advise he brother to persuade he fair shepherdess to be marry on the morrow and then he add how much he could wish to be marry on the same day to he rosalind ganime who well approve of this arrangement say that if orlando really love rosalind as well as he profess to do he should have he wish for on the morrow he would engage to make rosalind appear in she own person and also that rosalind should be willing to marry orlando this seemingly wonderful event which as ganimed be the lady rosalind he could so easily perform he pretend he would bring to pass by the aid of magic which he say he have learn of a uncle who be a famous magician the fond lover orlando half believe and half doubt what he hear ask ganime if he speak in sober meaning by my life i do say ganime therefore put on you best clothes and bid the duke and you friend to you wedding for if you desire to be marry to-morrow to rosalind she shall be here the next morning oliver have obtain the consent of aliena they come into the presence of the duke and with they also come orlando they be all assemble to celebrate this double marriage and as yet only one of the bride appear there be much of wonder and conjecture but they mostly think that ganimed be make a jest of orlando the duke hearing that it be he own daughter that be to be bring in this strange way ask orlando if he believe the shepherd-boy could really do what he have promise and while orlando be answer that he know not what to think ganimed enter and ask the duke if he bring he daughter whether he would consent to she marriage with orlando that i would say the duke if i have kingdom to give with she ganimed then say to orlando and you say you will marry she if i bring she here that i would say orlando if i be king of many kingdom ganime and aliena then go out together and ganime throw off he male attire and be once more dress in woman 's apparel quickly become rosalind without the power of magic and aliena change she country garb for she own rich clothes be with as little trouble transform into the lady celium while they be go the duke say to orlando that he think the shepherd ganime very like he daughter rosalind and orlando say he also have observe the resemblance they have no time to wonder how all this would end for rosalind and celium in they own clothes enter and no longer pretend that it be by the power of magic that she come there rosalind throw herself on she knee before she father and beg he blessing it seem so wonderful to all present that she should so suddenly appear that it might well have pass for magic but rosalind would no longer trifle with she father and tell he the story of she banishment and of she dwelling in the forest as a shepherd-boy she cousin celium pass as she sister the duke ratify the consent he have already give to the marriage and orlando and rosalind oliver and celium be marry at the same time and though they wedding could not be celebrate in this wild forest with any of the parade or splendor usual on such occasion yet a happier wedding-day be never pass : and while they be eat they venison under the cool shade of the pleasant tree as if nothing should be want to complete the felicity of this good duke and the true lover a unexpected messenger arrive to tell the duke the joyful news that he dukedom be restore to he the usurper enrage at the flight of he daughter celium and hear that every day man of great worth resort to the forest of arden to join the lawful duke in he exile much envy that he brother should be so highly respect in he adversity put himself at the head of a large force and advance towards the forest intend to seize he brother and put he with all he faithful follower to the sword but by a wonderful interposition of providence this bad brother be convert from he evil intention : for just as he enter the skirt of the wild forest he be meet by a old religious man a hermit with whom he have much talk and who in the end completely turn he heart from he wicked design thenceforward he become a true penitent and resolve relinquish he unjust dominion to spend the remainder of he day in a religious house the first act of he newly-conceived penitence be to send a messenger to he brother -lrb- as have be related -rrb- to offer to restore to he he dukedom which he have usurp so long and with it the land and revenue of he friend the faithful follower of he adversity this joyful news as unexpected as it be welcome come opportunely to heighten the festivity and rejoicing at the wedding of the princess celia compliment she cousin on this good fortune which have happen to the duke rosalind 's father and wish she joy very sincerely though she herself be no longer heir to the dukedom but by this restoration which she father have make rosalind be now the heir : so completely be the love of these two cousin unmixed with any thing of jealousy or envy the duke have now a opportunity of reward those true friend who have staid with he in he banishment and these worthy follower though they have patiently share he adverse fortune be very well pleased to return in peace and prosperity to the palace of they lawful duke the two gentleman of verona -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- there live in the city of verona two young gentleman whose name be valentine and protheus between whom a firm and uninterrupted friendship have long subsist they pursue they study together and they hour of leisure be always pass in each other 's company except when protheus visit a lady he be in love with and these visit to he mistress and this passion of protheus for the fair julium be the only topic on which these two friend disagree : for valentine not be himself a lover be sometimes a little weary of hear he friend for ever talk of he julium and then he would laugh at protheus and in pleasant term ridicule the passion of love and declare that no such idle fancy should ever enter he head greatly prefer -lrb- as he say -rrb- the free and happy life he lead to the anxious hope and fear of the lover protheus one morning valentine come to protheus to tell he that they must for a time be separate for that he be go to milan protheus unwilling to part with he friend use many argument to prevail upon valentine not to leave he but valentine say cease to persuade I my loving protheus i will not like a sluggard wear out my youth in idleness at home home-keeping youth have ever homely wit if you affection be not chained to the sweet glance of you honor julium i would entreat you to accompany I to see the wonder of the world abroad : but since you be a lover love on still and may you love be prosperous they part with mutual expression of unalterable friendship sweet valentine adieu say protheus think on I when you see some rare object worthy of notice in you travels and wish I partaker of you happiness valentine begin he journey that same day towards milan and when he friend have leave he protheus sit down to write a letter to julium which he give to she maid lucetta to deliver to she mistress julium love protheus as well as he do she but she be a lady of a noble spirit and she think it do not become she maiden dignity too easily to be win therefore she affect to be insensible of he passion and give he much uneasiness in the prosecution of he suit and when lucetta offer the letter to julia she would not receive it and chide she maid for take letter from protheus and order she to leave the room but she so much wish to see what be write in the letter that she soon call in she maid again and when lucetta return she say what o'clock be it lucetta who know she mistress more desire to see the letter than to know the time of day without answer she question again offer the reject letter julium angry that she maid should thus take the liberty of seem to know what she really want tear the letter in piece and throw it on the floor order she maid once more out of the room as lucetta be retire she stoop to pick up the fragment of the torn letter but julium who mean not so to part with they say in pretended anger go get you go and let the papers lie you would be finger they to anger I julia then begin to piece together as well as she could the tear fragment she first make out these word love-wounded protheus and lament over these and such-like loving word which she make out though they be all tear asunder or she say _ wound _ -lrb- the expression love-wounded protheus give she that idea -rrb- she talk to these kind word tell they she would lodge they in she bosom as in a bed till they wound be heal and that she would kiss each several piece to make amends in this manner she go on talk with a pretty lady-like childishness till find herself unable to make out the whole and vext at she own ingratitude in destroy such sweet and loving word as she call they she write a much kinder letter to protheus than she have ever do before protheus be greatly delight at receive this favourable answer to he letter and while he be read it he exclaim sweet love sweet line sweet life in the midst of he rapture he be interrupt by he father how now say the old gentleman what letter be you read there my lord reply protheus it be a letter from my friend valentine at milan lend I the letter say he father : let I see what news there be no news my lord say protheus greatly alarmed but that he write how well beloved he be of the duke of milan who daily grace he with favor and how he wish I with he the partner of he fortune and how stand you affect to he wish ask the father as one rely on you lordship 's will and not depend on he friendly wish say protheus now it have happen that protheus ' father have just be talk with a friend on this very subject : he friend have say he wonder he lordship suffer he son to spend he youth at home while most man be send they son to seek preferment abroad some say he to the war to try they fortune there and some to discover island far away and some to study in foreign university and there be he companion valentine he be go to the duke of milan 's court you son be fit for any of these thing and it will be a great disadvantage to he in he riper age not to have travel in he youth protheus ' father think the advice of he friend be very good and upon protheus tell he that valentine wish he with he the partner of he fortune he at once determine to send he son to milan and without give protheus any reason for this sudden resolution it be the usual habit of this positive old gentleman to command he son not reason with he he say my will be the same as valentine 's wish : and see he son look astonished he add look not amaze that i so suddenly resolve you shall spend some time in the duke of milan 's court for what i will i will and there be a end to-morrow be in readiness to go make no excuse for i be peremptory protheus know it be of no use to make objection to he father who never suffer he to dispute he will and he blame himself for tell he father a untruth about julium 's letter which have bring upon he the sad necessity of leave she now that julium find she be go to lose protheus for so long a time she no longer pretend indifference and they bid each other a mournful farewell with many vow of love and constancy protheus and julium exchange ring which they both promise to keep for ever in remembrance of each other and thus take a sorrowful leave protheus set out on he journey to milan the abode of he friend valentine valentine be in reality what protheus have feign to he father in high favor with the duke of milan and another event have happen to he of which protheus do not even dream for valentine have give up the freedom of which he use so much to boast and be become as passionate a lover as protheus she who have work this wondrous change in valentine be the lady silvium daughter of the duke of milan and she also love he but they conceal they love from the duke because although he shew much kindness for valentine and invite he every day to he palace yet he design to marry he daughter to a young courtier whose name be thurio silvium despise this thurio for he have none of the fine sense and excellent quality of valentine these two rival thurio and valentine be one day on a visit to silvium and valentine be entertaining silvium with turn every thing thurio say into ridicule when the duke himself enter the room and tell valentine the welcome news of he friend protheus ' arrival valentine say if i have wish a thing it would have be to have see he here and then he highly praise protheus to the duke say my lord though i have be a truant of my time yet have my friend make use and fair advantage of he day and be complete in person and in mind in all good grace to grace a gentleman welcome he then accord to he worth say the duke : silvium i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not bid he do so they be here interrupt by the entrance of protheus and valentine introduce he to silvia say sweet lady entertain he to be my fellow-servant to you ladyship when valentine and protheus have end they visit and be alone together valentine say now tell I how all do from whence you come how do you lady and how thrive you love protheus reply my tale of love use to weary you i know you joy not in a love-discourse aye protheus return valentine but that life be alter now i have do penance for condemn love for in revenge of my contempt of love love have chase sleep from my enthralled eye o gentle protheus love be a mighty lord and have so humble I that i confess there be no woe like he correction nor no such joy on earth as in he service i now like no discourse except it be of love now i can break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very name of love this acknowledgment of the change which love have make in the disposition of valentine be a great triumph to he friend protheus but _ friend _ protheus must be call no longer for the same all-powerful deity love of whom they be speak -lrb- yea even while they be talk of the change he have make in valentine -rrb- be work in the heart of protheus and he who have till this time be a pattern of true love and perfect friendship be now in one short interview with silvium become a false friend and a faithless lover for at the first sight of silvium all he love for julium vanish away like a dream nor do he long friendship for valentine deter he from endeavor to supplant he in she affection and although as it will always be when people of disposition naturally good become unjust he have many scruple before he determine to forsake julium and become the rival of valentine yet he at length overcome he sense of duty and yield himself up almost without remorse to he new unhappy passion valentine impart to he in confidence the whole history of he love and how carefully they have conceal it from the duke she father and tell he that despair of ever be able to obtain he consent he have prevail upon silvium to leave she father 's palace that night and go with he to mantua then he shew protheus a ladder of rope by help of which he mean to assist silvium to get out of one of the window of the palace after it be dark upon hear this faithful recital of he friend 's dearest secret it be hardly possible to be believe but so it be that protheus resolve to go to the duke and disclose the whole to he this false friend begin he tale with many artful speech to the duke such as that by the law of friendship he ought to conceal what he be go to reveal but that the gracious favor the duke have shew he and the duty he owe he grace urge he to tell that which else no worldly good should draw from he : he then tell all he have hear from valentine not omit the ladder of rope and the manner in which valentine mean to conceal they under a long cloak the duke think protheus quite a miracle of integrity in that he prefer tell he friend 's intention rather than he would conceal a unjust action highly commend he and promise he not to let valentine know from whom he have learn this intelligence but by some artifice to make valentine betray the secret himself for this purpose the duke await the come of valentine in the evening whom he soon see hurry towards the palace and he perceive somewhat be wrap within he cloak which he conclude be the rope-ladder the duke upon this stop he say whither away so fast valentine may it please you grace say valentine there be a messenger that stay to bear my letter to my friend and i be go to deliver they now this falsehood of valentine 's have no better success in the event than the untruth protheus tell he father be they of much import say the duke no more my lord say valentine than to tell my father i be well and happy at you grace 's court nay then say the duke no matter : stay with I a while i wish you counsel about some affair that concern I nearly he then tell valentine a artful story as a prelude to draw he secret from he say that valentine know he wish to match he daughter with thurio but that she be stubborn and disobedient to he command neither regard say he that she be my child nor fear I as if i be she father and i may say to thee this pride of hers have draw my love from she i have think my age should have be cherish by she childlike duty i now be resolve to take a wife and turn she out to whosoever will take she in let she beauty be she wedding-dower for I and my possession she esteem not valentine wonder where all this would end make answer and what would you grace have I to do in all this why say the duke the lady i would wish to marry be nice and coy and do not much esteem my aged eloquence besides the fashion of courtship be much change since i be young : now i would willingly have you to be my tutor to instruct I how i be to woo valentine give he a general idea of the mode of courtship then practice by young man when they wish to win a fair lady 's love such as present frequent visit and the like the duke reply to this that the lady do refuse a present which he send she and that she be so strictly keep by she father that no man might have access to she by day why then say valentine you must visit she by night but at night say the artful duke who be now come to the drift of he discourse she door be fast lock valentine then unfortunately propose that the duke should get into the lady 's chamber at night by means of a ladder of rope say he would procure he one fitting for that purpose and in conclusion advise he to conceal this ladder of rope under such a cloak as that which he now wear lend I you cloak say the duke who have feign this long story on purpose to have a pretence to get off the cloak : so upon say these word he catch hold of valentine 's cloak and throw it back he discover not only the ladder of rope but also a letter of silvium 's which he instantly open and read and this letter contain a full account of they intended elopement the duke after upbraid valentine for he ingratitude in thus return the favor he have shew he by endeavor to steal away he daughter banish he from the court and city of milan for ever and valentine be force to depart that night without even see silvium while protheus at milan be thus injure valentine julium at verona be regret the absence of protheus and she regard for he at last so far overcome she sense of propriety that she resolve to leave verona and seek she lover at milan and to secure herself from danger on the road she dress she maid lucetta and herself in man 's clothes and they set out in this disguise and arrive at milan soon after valentine be banish from that city through the treachery of protheus julium enter milan about noon and she take up she abode at a inn and she thought be all on she dear protheus she enter into conversation with the innkeeper or host as he be call think by that mean to learn some news of protheus the host be greatly pleased that this handsome young gentleman -lrb- as he take she to be -rrb- who from he appearance he conclude be of high rank speak so familiarly to he and be a good-natured man he be sorry to see he look so melancholy and to amuse he young guest he offer to take he to hear some fine music with which he say a gentleman that evening be go to serenade he mistress the reason julium look so very melancholy be that she do not well know what protheus would think of the imprudent step she have take for she know he have love she for she noble maiden-pride and dignity of character and she fear she should lower herself in he esteem : and this it be that make she wear a sad and thoughtful countenance she gladly accept the offer of the host to go with he and hear the music for she secretly hope she might meet protheus by the way but when she come to the palace whither the host conduct she a very different effect be produce to what the kind host intend for there to she heart 's sorrow she behold she lover the inconstant protheus serenade the lady silvium with music and address discourse of love and admiration to she and julium overheard silvium from a window talk with protheus and reproach he for forsake he own true lady and for he ingratitude to he friend valentine : and then silvium leave the window not choose to listen to he music and he fine speech for she be a faithful lady to she banish valentine and abhor the ungenerous conduct of he false friend protheus though julium be in despair at what she have just witness yet do she still love the truant protheus and hearing that he have lately part with a servant she contrived with the assistance of she host the friendly innkeeper to hire herself to protheus as a page and protheus know not she be julium and he send she with letter and present to she rival silvium and he even send by she the very ring she give he as a parting gift at verona when she go to that lady with the ring she be most glad to find that silvium utterly reject the suit of protheus and julium or the page sebastian as she be call enter into conversation with silvium about protheus ' first love the forsake lady julium she put in -lrb- as one may say -rrb- a good word for herself say she know julium as well she might be herself the julium of whom she speak : tell how fondly julium love she master protheus and how he unkind neglect would grieve she : and then she with a pretty equivocation go on : julium be about my height and of my complexion the color of she eye and hair the same as mine and indeed julium look a most beautiful youth in she boy 's attire silvium be move to pity this lovely lady who be so sadly forsake by the man she love and when julium offer she the ring which protheus have send refuse it say the more shame for he that he send I that ring i will not take it for i have often hear he say he julium give it to he i love thee gentle youth for pity she poor lady here be a purse i give it you for julium 's sake these comfortable word come from she kind rival 's tongue cheer the drooping heart of the disguised lady but to return to the banish valentine who scarce know which way to bend he course be unwilling to return home to he father a disgraced and banish man : as he be wander over a lonely forest not far distant from milan where he have leave he heart 's dear treasure the lady silvium he be set upon by robber who demand he money valentine tell they that he be a man cross by adversity that he be go into banishment and that he have no money the clothes he have on be all he riches the robber hear that he be a distressed man and be strike

kill he valentine who care little what become of himself say he would consent to live with they and be they captain provide they do no outrage on woman or poor passenger thus the noble valentine become like robin hood of whom we read in ballad a captain of robber and outlaw bandit : and in this situation he be find by silvium and in this manner it come to pass silvium to avoid a marriage with thurio whom she father insist upon she no longer refusing come at last to the resolution of follow valentine to mantua at which place she have hear she lover have take refuge but in this account she

and relieve she protheus be court silvium and he be so much ashamed of be catch by he friend that he be all at once seize with penitence and remorse and he express such a lively sorrow for the injury he have do to valentine that valentine whose nature be noble and generous even to a romantic degree not only forgive and restore he to he former place in he friendship but in a sudden flight of heroism he say i freely do forgive you and all the interest i have in silvium i give it up to you julia who be stand beside she master as a page hearing this strange offer and fear protheus would not be able with this new-found virtue to refuse silvium faint and they be all employ in recover she : else would silvia have be offend at be thus make over to protheus though she could scarcely think that valentine would long persevere in this overstrained and too generous act of friendship when julium recover from the faint fit she say i have forget my master order I to deliver this ring to

applaud you spirit valentine and think you worthy of a empress 's love you shall have silvium for you have well deserve she valentine then with great humility kiss the duke 's hand and accept the noble present which he have make he of he daughter with become thankfulness : take occasion of this joyful minute to entreat the good-humoured duke to pardon the thief with whom he have associate in the forest assure he that when reform and restore to society there would be find among they many good and fit for great employment for the most of they have be banish like valentine for state offence rather than for any black crime they have be guilty of to this the duke readily consent : and now nothing remain but that protheus the false friend be ordain by way of penance for he love-prompted fault to be present at the recital of the whole story of he love and falsehood before the duke and the shame of the recital to he awaken conscience be judge sufficient punishment : which be do the lover all four return back to milan and they nuptials be solemnise in presence of the duke with high triumph and feast the merchant of venice -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- shylock the jew live at venice : he be a usurer who have amass a immense fortune by lend money at great interest to christian merchant shylock be a hard-hearted man exact the payment of the money he lend with such severity that he be much dislike by all good man and particularly by anthonio a young merchant of venice and shylock as much hate anthonio because he use to lend money to people in distress and would never take any interest for the money he lend therefore there be great enmity between this covetous jew and the generous merchant anthonio whenever anthonio meet shylock on the rialto -lrb- or exchange -rrb- he use to reproach he with he usury and hard dealings which the jew would bear with seeming patience while he secretly meditate revenge anthonio be the kindest man that live the best condition

bassanio come to anthonio and tell he that he wish to repair he fortune by a wealthy marriage with a lady whom he dearly love whose father that be lately dead have leave she sole heiress to a large estate and that in she father 's lifetime he use to visit at she house when he think he have observe this lady have sometimes from she eye send speechless message that seem to say he would be no

merchandise contain in he ship at sea on this shylock think within himself : if i can once catch he on the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear he : he hate we jewish nation he lend out money

shylock how you storm i would be friend with you and have you love i will forget the shame you have put upon I i will supply you want and take no interest for my money this seemingly kind offer greatly surprised anthonio and then shylock still pretend kindness and that all he do be to gain anthonio 's love again say he would lend he the three thousand ducat and take no interest for he money only anthonio should go with he to a lawyer and there sign in merry sport a bond that if he do not repay the money by a certain day he would forfeit a pound of flesh to be cut off from any part of he body that shylock pleased content say anthonio : i will sign to this bond and say there be much kindness in the jew bassanio say anthonio should not sign to such a bond for he but still anthonio

the two son of cymbeline be steal out of they nursery when the eldest be but three year of age and the youngest quite a infant : and cymbeline could never discover what be become of they or by whom they be convey away cymbeline be twice marry : he second wife be a wicked plot woman and a cruel stepmother to imogen cymbeline 's daughter by he first wife the queen though she hate imogen yet wish she to marry a son of she own by a former husband -lrb- she also have be twice marry -rrb- : for by this mean she hope upon the death of cymbeline to place the crown of britain upon the head of she son cloten for she know that if the king 's son be not find the princess imogen must be the king 's heir but this design be prevent by imogen herself who marry without the consent or even knowledge of she father or the queen posthumus -lrb- for that be the name of imogen 's husband -rrb- be the best scholar and most accomplished gentleman of that age he father die fight in the war for cymbeline and soon after he birth he mother die also for grief at the loss of she husband cymbeline pity the helpless state of this orphan take posthumus -lrb- cymbeline have give he that name because he be bear after he father 's death -rrb- and educate he in he own court imogen and posthumus be both teach by the same master and be play-fellow from they infancy : they love each other tenderly when they be child and they affection continue to increase with they year when they grow up they privately marry the disappointed queen soon learn this secret for she keep spy constantly in watch upon the action of she daughter-in-law and she immediately tell the king of the marriage of imogen with posthumus nothing could exceed the wrath of cymbeline when he hear that he daughter have be so forgetful of she high dignity as to marry a subject he command posthumus to leave britain and banish he from he native country for ever the queen who pretend to pity imogen for the grief she suffer at lose she husband offer to procure they a private meeting before posthumus set out on he journey to rome which place he have choose for he residence in he banishment : this seeming kindness she shew the better to succeed in she future design in regard to she son cloten for she mean to persuade imogen when she husband be go that she marriage be not lawful be contract without the consent of the king imogen and posthumus take a most affectionate leave of each other imogen give she husband a diamond ring which have be she mother 's and posthumus promise never to part with the ring and he fasten a bracelet on the arm of he wife which he beg she would preserve with great care as a token of he love : they then bid each other farewel with many vow of everlasting love and fidelity imogen remain a solitary and dejected lady in she father 's court and posthumus arrive at rome the place of he banishment posthumus fall into company at rome with some gay young man of different nation who be talk freely of lady : each one praise the lady of he own country and he own mistress posthumus who have ever he own dear lady in he mind affirm that he wife the fair imogen be the most virtuous wise and constant lady in the world one of these gentleman whose name be iachimo be offend that a lady of britain should be so praise above the roman lady he countrywoman provoke posthumus by seem to doubt the constancy of he so highly-praised wife and at length after much altercation posthumus consent to a proposal of iachimo 's that he -lrb- iachimo -rrb- should go to britain and endeavor to gain the love of the married imogen they then lay a wager that if iachimo do not succeed in this wicked design he be to forfeit a large sum of money but if he could win imogen 's favor and prevail upon she to give he the bracelet which posthumus have so earnestly desire she would keep as a token of he love then the wager be to terminate with posthumus give to iachimo the ring which be imogen 's love-present when she part with she husband such firm faith have posthumus in the fidelity of imogen that he think he run no hazard in this trial of she honor iachimo on he arrival in britain gain admittance and a courteous welcome from imogen as a friend of she husband but when he begin to make profession of love to she she repulse he with disdain and he soon find that he could have no hope of succeed in he dishonourable design the desire iachimo have to win the wager make he now have recourse to a stratagem to impose upon posthumus and for this purpose he bribe some of imogen 's attendant and be by they convey into she bedchamber conceal in a large trunk where he remain shut up till imogen be retire to rest and have fall asleep and then get out of the trunk he examine the chamber with great attention and write down every thing he see there and particularly notice a mole which he observe upon imogen 's neck and then softly unloose the bracelet from she arm which posthumus have give to she he retire into the chest again and the next day he set off for rome with great expedition and boast to posthumus that imogen have give he the bracelet and likewise permit he to pass a night in she chamber : and in this manner iachimo tell he false tale she bed-chamber say he be hang with tapestry of silk and silver the story be _ the proud cleopatra when she meet she anthony _ a piece of work most bravely work this be true say posthumus but this you might have hear speak of without see then the chimney say iachimo be south of the chamber and the chimney-piece be _ diana bathing _ never see i figure livelier express this be a thing you might have likewise hear say posthumus for it be much talk of iachimo as accurately describe the roof of the chamber and add i have almost forget she andiron they be _ two wink cupid _ make of silver each on one foot standing he then take out the bracelet and say know you this jewel sir she give I this she take it from she arm i see she yet she pretty action do out-sell she gift and yet enriched it too she give it I and say _ she prize it once _ he last of all describe the mole he have observe upon she neck posthumus who have hear the whole of this artful recital in a agony of doubt now break out into the most passionate exclamation against imogen he deliver up the diamond ring to iachimo which he have agree to forfeit to he if he obtain the bracelet from imogen posthumus then in a jealous rage write to pisanio a gentleman of britain who be one of imogen 's attendant and have long be a faithful friend to posthumus and after tell he what proof he have of he wife 's disloyalty he desire pisanio would take imogen to milford-haven a seaport of wale and there kill she and at the same time he write a deceitful letter to imogen desire she to go with pisanio for that finding he could live no longer without see she though he be forbid upon pain of death to return to britain he would come to milford-haven at which place he beg she would meet he she good unsuspecting lady who love she husband above all thing and desire more than she life to see he hasten she departure with pisanio and the same night she receive the letter she set out when they journey be nearly at a end pisanio who though faithful to posthumus be not faithful to serve he in a evil deed disclose to imogen the cruel order he have receive imogen who instead of meet a loving and beloved husband find herself doom by that husband to suffer death be afflict beyond measure pisanio persuade she to take comfort and wait with patient fortitude for the time when posthumus should see and repent he injustice : in the mean time as she refuse in she distress to return to she father 's court he advise she to dress herself in boy 's clothes for more security in travel to which advice she agree and think in that disguise she would go over to rome and see she husband whom though he have use she so barbarously she could not forget to love when pisanio have provide she with she new apparel he leave she to she uncertain fortune be oblige to return to court but before he depart he give she a phial of cordial which he say the queen have give he as a sovereign remedy in all disorder the queen who hate pisanio because he be a friend to imogen and posthumus give he this phial which she suppose contain poison she have order she physician to give she some poison to try its effect -lrb- as she say -rrb- upon animal : but the physician know she malicious disposition would not trust she with real poison but give she a drug which would do no other mischief than cause a person to sleep with every appearance of death for a few hour this mixture which pisanio think a choice cordial he give to imogen desire she if she find herself ill upon the road to take it and so with blessing and prayer for she safety and happy deliverance from she undeserved trouble he leave she providence strangely direct imogen 's step to the dwelling of she two brother who have be steal away in they infancy bellarius who steal they away be a lord in the court of cymbeline and have be falsely accuse to the king of treason and banish from the court in revenge he steal away the two son of cymbeline and bring they up

princely spirit lead they to bold and daring action and as they subsist by hunting they be active and hardy and be always press they suppose father to let they seek they fortune in the war at the cave where these youth dwell it be imogen 's fortune to arrive she have lose she way in a large forest through which she road lay to milford-haven -lrb- from whence she mean to embark for rome -rrb- and be unable to find any place where she could purchase food she be with weariness and hunger almost die for it be not merely put on a man 's apparel that will enable a young lady tenderly bring up to bear the fatigue of wander about lonely forest like a man see this cave she enter hope to find some one within of whom she could procure food she find the cave empty but look about she discover some cold

together i have make the ground my bed : my resolution help I or i should be sick when pisanio shew I milford-haven from the mountain-top how near it seem then the thought of she husband and he cruel mandate come across she and she say my dear posthumus thou art a false one the two brother of imogen who have be hunting with they reputed father bellarius be by this time return home bellarius have give they the name of polidore and cadwal and they know no better but suppose that bellarius be they father : but the real name of these prince be guiderius and arviragus bellarius enter the cave first and see imogen stop they say come not in yet it eat we victuals or i should think it be a fairy what be the matter sir say the young man by jupiter say bellarius again there be a angel in the cave or if not a earthly paragon so beautiful do imogen look in she boy 's apparel she hear the sound of voice come forth from the cave and address they in these word : good master do not harm I before i enter you cave i have think to have beg or buy what i have eat indeed i have steal nothing nor would i though i have find gold strew on the floor here be money for my meat which i would have

with many kind expression say they would love she -lrb- or as they say _ he _ -rrb- as a brother and they enter the cave where -lrb- they have kill venison when they be hunting -rrb- imogen delight they with she neat housewifery assist they in prepare they supper for though it be not the custom now for young woman of high birth to understand cookery it be then and imogen excel in this useful art and as she brother prettily express it fidele cut they root in character and sauce they broth as if juno have be sick and fidele be she dieter and then say polidore to he brother how angel-like he sing they also remark to each other that though fidele smile so sweetly yet so sad a melancholy do overcloud he lovely face as if grief and patience have together take possession of he for these she gentle quality -lrb- or perhaps it be they near relationship though they know it not -rrb- imogen -lrb- or as the boy call she _ fidele _ -rrb- become the doating-piece of she brother and she scarcely less love they think that but for the memory of she dear posthumus she could live and die in the cave with these wild forest-youth and she gladly consent to stay with they till she be enough rest from the fatigue of travel to pursue she way to milford-haven when the venison they have take be all eat and they be go out to hunt for more fidele could not accompany they because she be unwell sorrow no doubt for she husband 's cruel usage as well as the fatigue of wander in the forest be the cause of she illness they then bid she farewel and go to they hunt praise all the way the noble part and graceful demeanor of the youth fidele imogen be no sooner left alone than she recollect the cordial pisanio have give she and drink it off and presently fall into a sound and death-like sleep when bellarius and she brother return from hunting polidore go first into the cave and suppose she asleep pull off he heavy shoe that he might tread softly and not awake she so do true gentleness spring up in the mind of these princely forester : but he soon discover that she could not be awaken by any noise and conclude she to be dead and polidore lament over she with dear and brotherly regret as if they have never from they infancy be part bellarius also propose to carry she out into the forest and there celebrate she funeral with song and solemn dirge as be then the custom imogen 's two brother then carry she to a shady covert and there lay she gently on the grass they sing repose to she depart spirit and cover she over with leaf and flower polidore say while summer last and i live here fidele i will daily strew thy sad grave the pale primrose that flower most like thy face the blue-bell like thy clear vein and the leaf of eglantine which be not sweeter than be thy breath all these i will strew over thee yea and the furred moss in winter when there be no flower to cover thy sweet corse when they have finish she funeral obsequy they depart very sorrowful imogen have not be long left alone when the effect of the sleepy drug go off she awake and easily shake off the slight covering of leaf and flower they have throw over she she arise and imagine she have be dream she say i think i be a cave-keeper and cook to honest creature how come i here cover with flower not be able to find she way back to the cave and see nothing of she new companion she conclude it be certainly all a dream and once more imogen set out on she weary pilgrimage hope at last she should find she way to milford-haven and thence get a passage in some ship bind for italy for all she thought be still with she husband posthumus whom she intend to seek in the disguise of a page but great event be happen at this time of which imogen know nothing for a war have suddenly break out between the roman emperor augustus cæsar and cymbeline the king of britain : and a roman army have land to invade britain and be advance into the very forest over which imogen be journey with this army come posthumus though posthumus come over to britain with the roman army he do not mean to fight on they side against he own countryman but intend to join the army of britain and fight in the cause of he king who have banish he he still believe imogen false to he yet the death of she he have so fondly love and by he own order too -lrb- pisanio have write he a letter to say he have obey he command and that imogen be dead -rrb- sit heavy on he heart and therefore he return to britain desire either to be slay in battle or to be put to death by cymbeline for return home from banishment imogen before she reach milford-haven fall into the hand of the roman army and she presence and deportment recommend she she be make a page to lucius the roman general cymbeline 's army now advance to meet the enemy and when they enter this forest polidore and cadwal join the king 's army the young man be eager to engage in act of valor though they little think they be go to fight for they own royal father and old bellarius go with they to the battle he have long since repent of the injury he have do to cymbeline in carry away he son and have be a warrior in he youth he gladly join the army to fight for the king he have so injured and now a great battle commence between the two army and the briton would have be defeat and cymbeline himself kill but for the extraordinary valor of posthumus and bellarius and the two son of cymbeline they rescue the king and save he life and so entirely turn the fortune of the day that the briton gain the victory when the battle be over posthumus who have not find the death he seek for surrender himself up to one of the officer of cymbeline willing to suffer the death which be to be he punishment if he return from banishment imogen and the master she serve be take prisoner and bring before cymbeline as be also she old enemy iachimo who be a officer in the roman army and when these prisoner be before the king posthumus be bring in to receive he sentence of death and at this strange juncture of time bellarius with polidore and cadwal be also bring before cymbeline to receive the reward due to the great service they have by they valor do for the king pisanio be one of the king 's attendant be likewise present therefore there be now stand in the king 's presence -lrb- but with very different hope and fear -rrb- posthumus and imogen with she new master the roman general the faithful servant pisanio and the false friend iachimo and likewise the two lose son of cymbeline with bellarius who have steal they away the roman general be the first who speak the rest stand silent before the king though there be many a beating heart amongst they imogen saw posthumus and know he though he be in the disguise of a peasant but he do not know she in she male attire : and she know iachimo and she see a ring on he finger which she perceive to be she own but she do not know he as yet to have be the author of all she trouble : and she stand before she own father a prisoner of war pisanio know imogen for it be he who have dress she in the garb of a boy it be my mistress think he since she be live let the time run on to good or bad bellarius know she too and softly say to cadwal be not this boy revive from death one sand reply cadwal do not more resemble another than that sweet rosy lad be like the dead fidele the same dead thing alive say polidore peace peace say bellarius if it be he i be sure he would have speak to we but we see he dead again whisper polidore be silent reply bellarius posthumus wait in silence to hear the welcome sentence of he own death and he resolve not to disclose to the king that he have save he life in the battle lest that should move cymbeline to pardon he lucius the roman general who have take imogen under he protection as he page be the first -lrb- as have be before say -rrb- who speak to the king he be a man of high courage and noble dignity and this be he speech to the king : i hear you take no ransom for you prisoner but doom they all to death i be a roman and with a roman heart will suffer death but there be one thing for which i would intreat then bring imogen before the king he say this boy be a briton bear let he be ransom he be my page never master have a page so kind so duteous so diligent on all occasion so true so nurse-like he have do no briton wrong though he have serve a roman save he if you spare no one beside cymbeline look earnestly on he daughter imogen he know she not in that disguise but it seem that all-powerful nature spake in he heart for he say i have surely see he he face appear familiar to I i know not why or wherefore i say live boy : but i give you you life and ask of I what boon you will and i will grant it you yea even though it be the life of the noblest prisoner i have i humbly thank you highness say imogen what be then call grant a boon be the same as a promise to give any one thing whatever it might be that the person on whom that favor be confer choose to ask for they all be attentive to hear what thing the page would ask for and lucius she master say to she i do not beg my life good lad but i know that be what you will ask for no no alas say imogen i have other work in hand good master you life i can not ask for this seeming want of gratitude in the boy astonish the roman general imogen then fix she eye on iachimo demand no other boon than this that iachimo should be make to confess whence he have the ring he wear on he finger cymbeline grant she this boon and threaten iachimo with the torture if he do not confess how he come by the diamond ring on he finger iachimo then make a full acknowledgment of all he villainy tell as have be before relate the whole story of he wager with posthumus and how he have succeed in impose upon he credulity what posthumus feel at hear this proof of the innocence of he lady can not be express he instantly come forward and confess to cymbeline the cruel sentence which he have enjoin pisanio to execute upon the princess : exclaim wildly o imogen my queen my life my wife o imogen imogen imogen imogen could not see she beloved husband in this distress without discover herself to the unutterable joy of posthumus who be thus relieve from a weight of guilt and woe and restore to the good grace of the dear lady he have so cruelly treat cymbeline almost as much overwhelm as he with joy at find he lose daughter so strangely recover receive she to she former place in he fatherly affection and not only give she husband posthumus he life but consent to acknowledge he for he son-in-law bellarius choose this time of joy and reconciliation to make he confession he present polidore and cadwal to the king tell he they be he two lose son guiderius and arviragus cymbeline forgive old bellarius for who could think of punishment at a season of such universal happiness : to find he daughter living and he lose son in the person of he young deliverer that he have see so bravely fight in he defense be unlooked-for joy indeed imogen be now at leisure to perform good service for she late master the roman general lucius whose life the king she father readily grant at she request and by the mediation of the same lucius a peace be conclude between the roman and the briton which be keep inviolate many year how cymbeline 's wicked queen through despair of bring she project to pass and touch with remorse of conscience sicken and die have first live to see she foolish son cloten slay in a quarrel which he have provoke be event too tragical to interrupt this happy conclusion by more than merely touch upon it be sufficient that all be make happy who be deserving and even the treacherous iachimo in consideration of he villainy have miss its final aim be dismiss without punishment king lear -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- lear king of britain have three daughter gonerill wife to the duke of albany regan wife to the duke of cornwall and cordelium a young maid for whose love the king of france and duke of burgundy be joint suitor and be at this time make stay for that purpose in the court of lear the old king wear out with age and the fatigue of government he be more than fourscore year old determine to take no further part in state affair but to leave the management to younger strength that he might have time to prepare for death which must at no long period ensue with this intent he call he three daughter to he to know from they own lip which of they love he best that he might part he kingdom among they in such proportion as they affection for he should seem to deserve gonerill the eldest declare that she love she father more than word could give out that he be dearer to she than the light of she own eye dearer than life and liberty with a deal of such profess stuff which be easy to counterfeit where there be no real love only a few fine word deliver with confidence be want in that case the king delighted to hear from she own mouth this assurance of she love and think truly that she heart go with it in a fit of fatherly fondness bestow upon she and she husband one third of he ample kingdom then call to he he second daughter he demand what she have to say regan who be make of the same hollow metal as she sister be not a whit behind in she profession but rather declare that what she sister have speak come short of the love which she profess to bear for he highness : insomuch that she find all other joy dead in comparison with the pleasure which she take in the love of she dear king and father lear blest himself in have such loving child as he think and could do no less after the handsome assurance which regan have make than bestow a third of he kingdom upon she and she husband equal in size to that which he have already give away to gonerill then turn to he youngest daughter cordelium whom he call he joy he ask what she have to say think no doubt that she would glad he ear with the same loving speech which she sister have utter or rather that she expression would be so much stronger than theirs as she have always be he darling and favor by he above either of they but cordelium disgusted with the flattery of she sister whose heart she know be far from they lip and see that all they coax speech be only intend to wheedle the old king out of he dominion that they and they husband might reign in he life-time make no other reply but this that she love he majesty accord to she duty neither more nor less the king shock with this appearance of ingratitude in he favorite child desire she to consider she word and to mend she speech lest it should mar she fortune cordelia then tell she father that he be she father that he have give she breeding and love she that she return those duty back as be most fit and do obey he love he and most honor he but that she could not frame she mouth to such large speech as she sister have do or promise to love nothing else in the world why have she sister husband if -lrb- as they say -rrb- they have no love for any thing but they father if she should ever wed she be sure the lord to whom she give she hand would want half she love half of she care and duty she should never marry like she sister to love she father all cordelium who in earnest love she old father even almost as extravagantly as she sister pretend to do would have plainly tell he so at any other time in more daughter-like and loving term and without these qualification which do indeed sound a little ungracious : but after the crafty flattering speech of she sister which she have see draw such extravagant reward she think the handsomest thing she could do be to love and be silent this put she affection out of suspicion of mercenary end and shew that she love but not for gain and that she profession the less ostentatious they be have so much the more of truth and sincerity than she sister this plainness of speech which lear call pride so enrage the old monarch -- who in he best of time always shew much of spleen and rashness and in whom the dotage incident to old age have so clouded over he reason that he could not discern truth from flattery nor a gay paint speech from word that come from the heart -- that in a fury of resentment he retract the third part of he kingdom which yet remain and which he have reserve for cordelium and give it away from she sharing it equally between she two sister and they husband the duke of albany and cornwall : whom he now call to he and in presence of all he courtier bestow a coronet between they invest they jointly with all the power revenue and execution of government only retain to himself the name of king all the rest of royalty he resign : with this reservation that himself with a hundred knight for he attendant be to be maintain by monthly course in each of he daughter 's palace in turn so preposterous a disposal of he kingdom so little guide by reason and so much by passion fill all he courtier with astonishment and sorrow but none of they have the courage to interpose between this incensed king and he wrath except the earl of kent who be begin to speak a good word for cordelium when the passionate lear on pain of death command he to desist : but the good kent be not so to be repel he have be ever loyal to lear whom he have honor as a king love as a father follow as a master : and have never esteem he life further than as a pawn to wage against he royal master 's enemy nor fear to lose it when lear 's safety be the motive : nor now that lear be most he own enemy do this faithful servant of the king forget he old principle but manfully oppose lear to do lear good and be unmannerly only because lear be mad he have be a most faithful counsellor in time past to the king and he beseech he now that he would see with he eye -lrb- as he have do in many weighty matter -rrb- and go by he advice still and in he best consideration recall this hideous rashness : for he would answer with he life he judgment that lear 's youngest daughter do not love he least nor be those empty-hearted whose low sound give no token of hollowness when power bow to flattery honor be bind to plainness for lear 's threat what could he do to he whose life be already at he service that should not hinder duty from speak the honest freedom of this good earl of kent only stir up the king 's wrath the more and like a frantic patient who kill he physician and love he mortal disease he banish this true servant and allot he but five day to make he preparation for departure but if on the sixth he hate person be find within the realm of britain that moment be to be he death and kent bid farewel to the king and say that since he choose to shew himself in such fashion it be but banishment to stay there : and before he go he recommend cordelium to the protection of the god the maid who have so rightly think and so discreetly speak and only wish that she sister ' large speech might be answer with deed of love : and then he go as he say to shape he old course to a new country the king of france and duke of burgundy be now call in to hear the determination of lear about he youngest daughter and to know whether they would persist in they courtship to cordelium now that she be under she father 's displeasure and have no fortune but she own person to recommend she : and the duke of burgundy decline the match and would not take she to wife upon such condition but the king of france understand what the nature of the fault have be which have lose she the love of she father that it be only a tardiness of speech and the not be able to frame she tongue to flattery like she sister take this young maid by the hand and say that she virtue be a dowry above a kingdom bid cordelium to take farewel of she sister and of she father though he have be unkind and she should go with he and be queen of he and of fair france and reign over fairer possession than she sister : and he call the duke of burgundy in contempt a waterish duke because he love for this young maid have in a moment run all away like water then cordelium with weep eye take leave of she sister and besought they to love they father well and make good they profession : and they sullenly tell she not to prescribe to they for they know they duty but to strive to content she husband who have take she -lrb- as they tauntingly express it -rrb- as fortune 's alms and cordelium with a heavy heart depart for she know the cunning of she sister and she wish she father in better hand than she be about to leave he in cordelium be no sooner go than the devilish disposition of she sister begin to shew themselves in they true color even before the expiration of the first month which lear be to spend by agreement with he eldest daughter gonerill the old king begin to find out the difference between promise and performance this wretch have get from she father all that he have to bestow even to the give away of the crown from off he head begin to grudge even those small remnant of royalty which the old man have reserve to himself to please he fancy with the idea of be still a king she could not bear to see he and he hundred knight every time she meet she father she put on a frowning countenance and when the old man want to speak with she she would feign sickness or any thing to be rid of the sight of he for it be plain that she esteem he old age a useless burden and he attendant a unnecessary expence : not only she herself slacken in she expression of duty to the king but by she example and -lrb- it be to be fear -rrb- not without she private instruction she very servant affect to treat he with neglect and would either refuse to obey he order or still more contemptuously pretend not to hear they lear could not but perceive this alteration in the behavior of he daughter but he shut he eye against it as long as he could as people commonly be unwilling to believe the unpleasant consequence which they own mistake and obstinacy have bring upon they true love and fidelity be no more to be estrange by _ ill _ than falsehood and hollow-heartedness can be conciliate by _ good usage _ this eminently appear in the instance of the good earl of kent who though banish by lear and he life make forfeit if he be find in britain choose to stay and abide all consequence as long as there be a chance of he be useful to the king he master see to what mean shift and disguise poor loyalty be force to submit sometimes yet it count nothing base or unworthy so as it can but do service where it owe a obligation in the disguise of a serving-man all he greatness and pomp lay aside this good earl proffer he service to the king who not know he to be kent in that disguise but pleased with a certain plainness or rather bluntness in he answer which the earl put on -lrb- so different from that smooth oily flattery which he have so much reason to be sick of have find the effect not answerable in he daughter -rrb- a bargain be quickly strike and lear take kent into he service by the name of caius as he call himself never suspect he to be he once great favorite the high and mighty earl of kent this caius quickly find means to shew he fidelity and love to he royal master : for gonerill 's steward that same day behave in a disrespectful manner to lear and give he saucy look and language as no doubt he be secretly encourage to do by he mistress caius not endure to hear so open a affront put upon majesty make no more ado but presently tript up he heel and lay the unmannerly slave in the kennel : for which friendly service lear become more and more attach to he nor be kent the only friend lear have in he degree and as far as so insignificant a personage could shew he love the poor fool or jester that have be of he palace while lear have a palace as it be the custom of king and great personage at that time to keep a fool -lrb- as he be call -rrb- to make they sport after serious business : -- this poor fool cling to lear after he have give away he crown and by he witty saying would keep up he good humor though he could not refrain sometimes from jeer at he master for he imprudence in uncrown himself and give all away to he daughter : at which time as he rhymingly express it these daughter for sudden joy do weep and he for sorrow sing that such a king should play bo-peep and go the fool among and in such wild saying and scrap of song of which he have plenty this pleasant honest fool pour out he heart even in the presence of gonerill herself in many a bitter taunt and jest which cut to the quick such as compare the king to the hedge-sparrow who feed the young of the cuckoo till they grow old enough and then have its head bit off for its pain : and say that a ass may know when the cart draw the horse -lrb- meaning that lear 's daughter that ought to go behind now rank before they father -rrb- and that lear be no longer lear but the shadow of lear : for which free speech he be once or twice threaten to be whipt the coolness and fall off of respect which lear have begin to perceive be not all which this foolish-fond father be to suffer from he unworthy daughter : she now plainly tell he that he stay in she palace be inconvenient so long as he insist upon keep up a establishment of a hundred knight that this establishment be useless and expensive and only serve to fill she court with riot and feast and she pray he that he would lessen they number and keep none but old man about he such as himself and fitting he age lear at first could not believe he eye or ear nor that it be he daughter who speak so unkindly he could not believe that she who have receive a crown from he could seek to cut off he train and grudge he the respect due to he old age but she persist in she undutiful demand the old man 's rage be so excited that he call she a detest kite and say that she speak a untruth : and so indeed she do for the hundred knight be all man of choice behavior and sobriety of manners skilled in all particulars of duty and not give to rioting or feast as she say and he bid he horse to be prepare for he would go to he other daughter regan he and he hundred knight : and he speak of ingratitude and say it be a marble-hearted devil and shew more hideous in a child than the sea-monster and he curse he eldest daughter gonerill so as be terrible to hear : pray that she might never have a child or if she have that it might live to return that scorn and contempt upon she which she have shew to he : that she might feel how sharper than a serpent 's tooth it be to have a thankless child and gonerill 's husband the duke of albany begin to excuse himself for any share which lear might suppose he have in the unkindness lear would not hear he out but in a rage order he horse to be saddle and set out with he follower for the abode of regan he other daughter and lear think to himself how small the fault of cordelium -lrb- if it be a fault -rrb- now appear in comparison with she sister 's and he weep and then he be ashamed that such a creature as gonerill should have so much power over he manhood as to make he weep regan and she husband be keep they court in great pomp and state at they palace : and lear dispatch he servant caius with letter to he daughter that she might be prepare for he reception while he and he train follow after but it seem that gonerill have be beforehand with he send letter also to regan accuse she father of waywardness and ill humor and advise she not to receive so great a train as he be bring with he this messenger arrive at the same time with caius and caius and he meet : and who should it be but caius ' old enemy the steward whom he have formerly tript up by the heel for he saucy behavior to lear caius not like the fellow 's look and suspect what he come for begin to revile he and challenge he to fight which the fellow refusing caius in a fit of honest passion beat he soundly as such a mischief-maker and carrier of wicked message deserve : which come to the ear of regan and she husband they order caius to be put in the stock though he be a messenger from the king she father and in that character demand the highest respect : so that the first thing the king see when he enter the castle be he faithful servant caius sit in that disgraceful situation this be but a bad omen of the reception which he be to expect but a worse follow when upon enquiry for he daughter and she husband he be tell they be weary with travel all night and could not see he : and when lastly upon he insist in a positive and angry manner to see they they come to greet he whom should he see in they company but the hate gonerill who have come to tell she own story and set she sister against the king she father this sight much move the old man and still more to see regan take she by the hand : and he ask gonerill if she be not ashamed to look upon he old white beard and regan advise he to go home again with gonerill and live with she peaceably dismiss half of he attendant and to ask she forgiveness for he be old and want discretion and must be rule and lead by person that have more discretion than himself and lear shewed how preposterous that would sound if he be to down on he knee and beg of he own daughter for food and raiment and he argue against such a unnatural dependence declare he resolution never to return with she but to stay where he be with regan he and he hundred knight : for he say that she have not forget the half of the kingdom which he have endow she with and that she eye be not fierce like gonerill 's but mild and kind and he say that rather than return to gonerill with half he train cut off he would go over to france and beg a wretched pension of the king there who have marry he youngest daughter without a portion but he be mistake in expect kinder treatment of regan than he have experience from she sister gonerill as if willing to outdo she sister in unfilial behavior she declare that she think fifty knight too many to wait upon he : that five-and-twenty be enough then lear nigh heart-broken turn to gonerill and say that he would go back with she for she fifty double five-and-twenty and so she love be twice as much as regan 's but gonerill excuse herself and say what need of so many as five-and-twenty or even ten or five when he might be wait upon by she servant or she sister 's servant so these two wicked daughter as if they strive to exceed each other in cruelty to they old father who have be so good to they by little and little would have abate he of all he train all respect -lrb- little enough for he that once command a kingdom -rrb- which be leave he to shew that he have once be a king not that a splendid train be essential to happiness but from a king to a beggar be a hard change from command million to be without one attendant and it be the ingratitude in he daughter ' deny it more than what he would suffer by the want of it which pierce this poor king to the heart : insomuch that with this double ill usage and vexation for have so foolishly give away a kingdom he wit begin to be unsettled and while he say he know not what he vow revenge against those unnatural hag and to make example of they that should be a terror to the earth while he be thus idly threaten what he weak arm could never execute night come on and a loud storm of thunder and lightning with rain and he daughter still persist in they resolution not to admit he follower he call for he horse and choose rather to encounter the utmost fury of the storm abroad than stay under the same roof with these ungrateful daughter : and they say that the injury which wilful man procure to themselves be they just punishment suffer he to go in that condition and shut they door upon he the wind be high and the rain and storm increase when the old man sally forth to combat with the element less sharp than he daughter ' unkindness for many mile about there be scarce a bush and there upon a heath expose to the fury of the storm in a dark night do king lear wander out and defy the wind and the thunder : and he bid the wind to blow the earth into the sea or swell the wave of the sea till they drown the earth that no token might remain of any such ungrateful animal as man the old king be now leave with no other companion than the poor fool who still abide with he with he merry conceit strive to out-jest misfortune say it be but a naughty night to swim in and truly the king have better go in and ask he daughter 's blessing : but he that have a little tiny wit with heigh ho the wind and the rain must make content with he fortune fit though the rain it raineth every day : and swearing it be a brave night to cool a lady 's pride thus poorly accompany this once great monarch be find by he ever faithful servant the good earl of kent now transform to caius who ever follow close at he side though the king do not know he to be the earl and he say alas sir be you here creature that love night love not such night as these this dreadful storm have drive the beast to they hide place man 's nature can not endure the affliction or the fear and lear rebuke he and say these lesser evil be not feel where a greater malady be fix when the mind be at ease the body have leisure to be delicate but the tempest in he mind do take all feeling else from he sens but of that which beat at he heart and he speak of filial ingratitude and say it be all one as if the mouth should tear the hand for lift food to it for parent be hand and food and everything to child but the good caius still persist in he intreaty that the king would not stay out in the open air at last persuade he to enter a little wretched hovel which stand upon the heath where the fool first enter suddenly run back terrify say that he have see a spirit but upon examination this spirit prove to be nothing more than a poor bedlam-beggar who have creep into this desert hovel for shelter and with he talk about devil fright the fool one of those poor lunatic who be either mad or feign to be so the better to extort charity from the compassionate country-people who go about the country call themselves poor tom and poor turlygood say who give any thing to poor tom sticking pin and nail and sprig of rosemary into they arm to make they bleed and with such horrible action partly by prayer and partly with lunatic curse they move or terrify the ignorant country-folk into give they alms this poor fellow be such a one and the king see he in so wretched a plight with nothing but a blanket about he loin to cover he nakedness could not be persuade but that the fellow be some father who have give all away to he daughter and bring himself to that pass : for nothing he think could bring a man to such wretchedness but the have unkind daughter and from this and many such wild speech which he utter the good caius plainly perceive that he be not in he perfect mind but that he daughter ' ill usage have really make he go mad and now the loyalty of this worthy earl of kent shew itself in more essential service than he have hitherto find opportunity to perform for with the assistance of some of the king 's attendant who remain loyal he have the person of he royal master remove at day-break to the castle of dover where he own friend and influence as earl of kent chiefly lay : and himself embark for france hasten to the court of cordelium and do there in such move term represent the pitiful condition of she royal father and set out in such lively color the inhumanity of she sister that this good and loving child with many tear beseech the king she husband that he would give she leave to embark for england with a sufficient power to subdue these cruel daughter and they husband and restore the old king she father to he throne which be grant she set forth and with a royal army land at dover lear have by some chance escape from the guardian which the good earl of kent have put over he to take care of he in he lunacy be find by some of cordelium 's train wander about the field near dover in a pitiable condition stark mad and singing aloud to himself with a crown upon he head which he have make of straw and nettle and other wild weed that he have pick up in the corn-field by the advice of the physician cordelia though earnestly desirous of see she father be prevail upon to put off the meeting till by sleep and the operation of herb which they give he he should be restore to greater composure by the aid of these skilful physician to whom cordelia promise all she gold and jewel for the recovery of the old king lear be soon in a condition to see he daughter a tender sight it be to see the meeting between this father and daughter : to see the struggle between the joy of this poor old king at behold again he once darling child and the shame at receive such filial kindness from she whom he have cast off for so small a fault in he displeasure both these passion struggle with the remains of he malady which in he half-crazed brain sometimes make he that he scarce remember where he be or who it be that so kindly kiss he and speak to he : and then he would beg the standers-by not to laugh at he if he be mistake in think this lady to be he daughter cordelium and then to see he fall on he knee to beg pardon of he child and she good lady kneel all the while to ask a blessing of he and tell he that it do not become he to kneel but it be she duty for she be he child he true and very child cordelium and she kiss he -lrb- as she say -rrb- to kiss away all she sister ' unkindness and say that they might be ashamed of themselves to turn they old kind father with he white beard out into the cold air when she enemy 's dog though it have bite she -lrb- as she prettily express it -rrb- should have staid by she fire such a night as that and warm himself and she tell she father how she have come from france with purpose to bring he assistance and he say that she must forget and forgive for he be old and foolish and do not know what he do but that to be sure she have great cause not to love he but she sister have none and cordelium say that she have no cause no more than they have so we will leave this old king in the protection of this dutiful and loving child where by the help of sleep and medicine she and she physician at length succeed in wind up the untuned and jarring sens which the cruelty of he other daughter have so violently shake let we return to say a word or two about those cruel daughter these monster of ingratitude who have be so false to they old father could not be expect to prove more faithful to they own husband they soon grow tired of pay even the appearance of duty and affection and in a open way shew they have fix they love upon another it happen that the object of they guilty love be the same it be edmund a natural son of the late earl of gloucester who by he treachery have succeed in disinherit he brother edgar the lawful heir from he earldom and by he wicked practice be now earl himself : a wicked man and a fit object for the love of such wicked creature as gonerill and regan it fall out about this time that the duke of cornwall regan 's husband die regan immediately declare she intention of wedding this earl of gloucester which rouse the jealousy of she sister to whom as well as to regan this wicked earl have at sundry time profess love gonerill find means to make away with she sister by poison : but be detect in she practice and imprison by she husband the duke of albany for this deed and for she guilty passion for the earl which have come to he ear she in a fit of disappointed love and rage shortly put a end to she own life thus the justice of heaven at last overtake these wicked daughter while the eye of all man be upon this event admire the justice display in they deserve death the same eye be suddenly take off from this sight to admire at the mysterious way of the same power in the melancholy fate of the young and virtuous daughter the lady cordelium whose good deed do seem to deserve a more fortunate conclusion : but it be a awful truth that innocence and piety be not always successful in this world the force which gonerill and regan have send out under the command of the bad earl of gloucester be victorious and cordelium by the practice of this wicked earl who do not like that any should stand between he and the throne end she life in prison thus heaven take this innocent lady to itself in she young year after shew she to the world a illustrious example of filial duty lear do not long survive this kind child before he die the good earl of kent who have still attend he old master 's step from the first of he daughter ' ill usage to this sad period of he decay try to make he understand that it be he who have follow he under the name of caius but lear 's care-crazed brain at that time could not comprehend how that could be or how kent and caius could be the same person : so kent think it needless to trouble he with explanation at such a time and lear soon after expire this faithful servant to the king between age and grief for he old master 's vexation soon follow he to the grave how the judgment of heaven overtake the bad earl of gloucester whose treason be discover and himself slay in single combat with he brother the lawful earl and how gonerill 's husband the duke of albany who be innocent of the death of cordelium and have never encourage he lady in she wicked proceedings against she father ascend the throne of britain after the death of lear be needless here to narrate lear and he three daughter be dead whose adventure alone concern we story macbeth -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- when duncan the meek reign king of scotland there live a great thane or lord call macbeth this macbeth be a near kinsman to the king and in great esteem at court for he valor and conduct in the war a example of which he have lately give in defeat a rebel army assist by the troops of norway in terrible number the two scottish general macbeth and banquo return victorious from this great battle they way lay over a blast heath where they be stop by the strange appearance of three figure like woman except that they have beard and they withered skin and wild attire make they look not like any earthly creature macbeth first address they when they seemingly offend lay each one she choppy finger upon she skinny lip in token of silence : and the first of they salute macbeth with the title of thane of glami the general be not a little startled to find himself know by such creature but how much more when the second of they follow up that salute by give he the title of thane of cawdor to which honor he have no pretension and again the third bid he all hail king that shall be hereafter such a prophetic greet might well amaze he who know that while the king 's son live he could not hope to succeed to the throne then turn to banquo they pronounce he in a sort of riddle term to be _ lesser than macbeth and greater not so happy but much happier _ and prophesy that though he should never reign yet he son after he should be king in scotland they then turn into air and vanish : by which the general know they to be the weird sister or witch while they stand ponder on the strangeness of this adventure there arrive certain messenger from the king who be empower by he to confer upon macbeth the dignity of thane of cawdor a event so miraculously correspond with the prediction of the witch astonished macbeth and he stand wrapt in amazement unable to make reply to the messenger : and in that point of time swell hope arise in he mind that the prediction of the third witch might in like manner have its accomplishment and that he should one day reign king in scotland turn to banquo he say do you not hope that you child shall be king when what the witch promise to I have so wonderfully come to pass that hope answer the general might enkindle you to aim at the throne but oftentimes these minister of darkness tell we truth in little thing to betray we into deed of greatest consequence but the wicked suggestion of the witch have sink too deep into the mind of macbeth to allow he to attend to the warning of the good banquo from that time he bent all he thought how to compass the crown of scotland macbeth have a wife to whom he communicate the strange prediction of the weird sister and its partial accomplishment she be a bad ambitious woman and so as she husband and herself could arrive at greatness she care not much by what mean she spur on the reluctant purpose of macbeth who feel compunction at the thought of blood and do not cease to represent the murder of the king as a step absolutely necessary to the fulfilment of the flattering prophecy it happen at this time that the king who out of he royal condescension would oftentimes visit he principal nobility upon gracious term come to macbeth 's house attend by he two son malcolm and donalbain and a numerous train of thane and attendant the more to honor macbeth for the triumphal success of he war the castle of macbeth be pleasantly situate and the air about it be sweet and wholesome which appear by the nest which the martlet or swallow have build under all the jut frieze and buttress of the building wherever it find a place of advantage : for where those bird most breed and haunt the air be observe to be delicate the king enter well please with the place and not less so with the attention and respect of he honor hostess lady macbeth who have the art of cover treacherous purpose with smile and could look like the innocent flower while she be indeed the serpent under it the king be tire with he journey go early to bed and in he state-room two groom of he chamber -lrb- as be the custom -rrb- sleep beside he he have be unusually please with he reception and have make present before he retire to he principal officer and among the rest have send a rich diamond to lady macbeth greet she by the name of he most kind hostess now be the middle of the night when over half the world nature seem dead and wicked dream abuse man 's mind asleep and none but the wolf and the murderer be abroad this be the time when lady macbeth wake to plot the murder of the king she would not have undertake a deed so abhorrent to she sex but that she fear she husband 's nature that it be too full of the milk of human kindness to do a contrived murder she know he to be ambitious but withal to be scrupulous and not yet prepare for that height of crime which commonly in the end accompany inordinate ambition she have win he to consent to the murder but she doubt he resolution : and she fear that the natural tenderness of he disposition -lrb- more humane than she own -rrb- would come between and defeat the purpose so with she own hand arm with a dagger she approach the king 's bed have take care to ply the groom of he chamber so with wine that they sleep intoxicated and careless of they charge there lay duncan in a sound sleep after the fatigue of he journey and as she view he earnestly there be something in he face as he sleep which resemble she own father and she have not the courage to proceed she return to confer with she husband he resolution have begin to stagger he consider that there be strong reason against the deed in the first place he be not only a subject but a near kinsman to the king and he have be he host and entertainer that day whose duty by the law of hospitality it be to shut the door against he murderer not bear the knife himself then he consider how just and merciful a king this duncan have be how clear of offence to he subject how loving to he nobility and in particular to he that such king be the peculiar care of heaven and they subject doubly bind to revenge they death besides by the favor of the king macbeth stand high in the opinion of all sort of man and how would those honor be stain by the reputation of so foul a murder in these conflict of the mind lady macbeth find she husband incline to the better part and resolve to proceed no further but she be a woman not easily shake from she evil purpose begin to pour in at he ear word which infuse a portion of she own spirit into he mind assign reason upon reason why he should not shrink from what he have undertake how easy the deed be how soon it would be over and how the action of one short night would give to all they night and day to come sovereign sway and royalty then she throw contempt on he change of purpose and accuse he of fickleness and cowardice and declare that she have give suck and know how tender it be to love the babe that milk she but she would while it be smile in she face have pluck it from she breast and dash its brain out if she have so swear to do it as he have swear to perform that murder then she add how practicable it be to lay the guilt of the deed upon the drunken sleepy groom and with the valor of she tongue she so chastise he sluggish resolution that he once more summon up courage to the bloody business so take the dagger in he hand he softly steal in the dark to the room where duncan lay and as he go he think he see another dagger in the air with the handle towards he and on the blade and at the point of it drop of blood : but when he try to grasp at it it be nothing but air a mere phantasm proceeding from he own hot and oppressed brain and the business he have in hand get rid of this fear he enter the king 's room whom he dispatch with one stroke of he dagger just as he have do the murder one of the groom who sleep in the chamber laugh in he sleep and the other cry murder which wake they both : but they say a short prayer one of they say god bless we and the other answer aman and address themselves to sleep again macbeth who stand listen to they try to say aman when the fellow say god bless we but though he have most need of a blessing the word stick in he throat and he could not pronounce it again he think he hear a voice which cry sleep no more : macbeth doth murder sleep the innocent sleep that nourish life still it cry sleep no more to all the house glami have murder sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more with such horrible imagination macbeth return to he listen wife who begin to think he have fail of he purpose and that the deed be somehow frustrated he come in so distract a state that she reproach he with he want of firmness and send he to wash he hand of the blood which stain they while she take he dagger with purpose to stain the cheek of the groom with blood to make it seem they guilt morning come and with it the discovery of the murder which could not be conceal and though macbeth and he lady make great show of grief and the proof against the groom -lrb- the dagger be produce against they and they face smear with blood -rrb- be sufficiently strong yet the entire suspicion fall upon macbeth whose inducement to such a deed be so much more forcible than such poor silly groom could be suppose to have and duncan 's two son flee malcolm the eldest seek for refuge in the english court and the youngest donalbain make he escape to ireland the king 's son who should have succeed he have thus vacate the throne macbeth as next heir be crown king and thus the prediction of the weird sister be literally accomplish though place so high macbeth and he queen could not forget the prophecy of the weird sister that though macbeth should be king yet not he child but the child of banquo should be king after he the thought of this and that they have defile they hand with blood and do so great crime only to place the posterity of banquo upon the throne so rankle within they that they determine to put to death both banquo and he son to make void the prediction of the weird sister which in they own case have be so remarkably bring to pass for this purpose they make a great supper to which they invite all the chief thane and among the rest with mark of particular respect banquo and he son fleance be invite the way by which banquo be to pass to the palace at night be beset by murderer appoint by macbeth who stab banquo but in the scuffle fleance escape from that fleance descend a race of monarch who afterwards fill the scottish throne end with jame the sixth of scotland and the first of england under whom the two crown of england and scotland be unite at supper the queen whose manners be in the highest degree affable and royal play the hostess with a gracefulness and attention which conciliate every one present and macbeth discourse freely with he thane and noble say that all that be honorable in the country be under he roof if he have but he good friend banquo present whom yet he hope he should rather have to chide for neglect than to lament for any mischance just at these word the ghost of banquo whom he have cause to be murder enter the room and place himself on the chair which macbeth be about to occupy though macbeth be a bold man and one that could have face the devil without tremble at this horrible sight he cheek turn white with fear and he stand quite unmanned with he eye fix upon the ghost he queen and all the noble who see nothing but perceive he gaze -lrb- as they think -rrb- upon a empty chair take it for a fit of distraction and she reproach he whisper that it be but the same fancy which have make he see the dagger in the air when he be about to kill duncan but macbeth continue to see the ghost and give no heed to all they could say while he address it with distract word yet so significant that he queen fear the dreadful secret would be disclose in great haste dismiss the guest excuse the infirmity of macbeth as a disorder he be often trouble with to such dreadful fancy macbeth be subject he queen and he have they sleep afflict with terrible dream and the blood of banquo trouble they not more than the escape of fleance whom now they look upon as father to a line of king who should keep they posterity out of the throne with these miserable thought they find no peace and macbeth determine once more to seek out the weird sister and know from they the worst he seek they in a cave upon the heath where they who know by foresight of he come be engage in prepare they dreadful charm by which they conjure up infernal spirit to reveal to they futurity they horrid ingredient be toad bat and serpent the eye of a newt and the tongue of a dog the leg of a lizard and the wing of the night-owl the scale of a dragon the tooth of a wolf the maw of the ravenous salt-sea shark the mummy of a witch the root of the poisonous hemlock -lrb- this to have effect must be dig in the dark -rrb- the gall of a goat and the liver of a jew with slip of the yew tree that root itself in grave and the finger of a dead child : all these be set on to boil in a great kettle or cauldron which as fast as it grow too hot be cool with a baboon 's blood : to these they pour in the blood of a sow that have eat she young and they throw into the flame the grease that have sweaten from a murderer 's gibbet by these charm they bind the infernal spirit to answer they question it be demand of macbeth whether he would have he doubt resolve by they or by they master the spirit he nothing daunt by the dreadful ceremony which he see boldly answer where be they let I see they and they call the spirit which be three and the first arise in the likeness of a armed head and he call macbeth by name and bid he beware of the thane of fife for which caution macbeth thank he : for macbeth have entertain a jealousy of macduff the thane of fife and the second spirit arise in the likeness of a bloody child and he call macbeth by name and bid he have no fear but laugh to scorn the power of man for none of woman bear should have power to hurt he : and he advise he to be bloody bold and resolute then live macduff cry the king what need i fear of thee but yet i will make assurance doubly sure thou shall not live that i may tell pale-hearted fear it lie and sleep in spite of thunder that spirit be dismiss a third arise in the form of a child crown with a tree in he hand he call macbeth by name and comfort he against conspiracy say that he should never be vanquish until the wood of birnam to dunsinane-hill should come against he sweet bodement good cry macbeth who can unfix the forest and move it from its earth-bound root i see i shall live the usual period of man 's life and not be cut off by a violent death but my heart throb to know one thing tell I if you art can tell so much if banquo 's issue shall ever reign in this kingdom here the cauldron sink into the ground and a noise of music be hear and eight shadow like king pass by macbeth and banquo last who bear a glass which shew the figure of many more and banquo all bloody smile upon macbeth and point to they by which macbeth know that these be the posterity of banquo who should reign after he in scotland and the witch with a sound of soft music and with dancing make a shew of duty and welcome to macbeth vanish and from this time the thought of macbeth be all bloody and dreadful the first thing he hear when he get out of the witch ' cave be that macduff thane of fife have flee to england to join the army which be form against he under malcolm the eldest son of the late king with intent to displace macbeth and set malcolm the right heir upon the throne macbeth sting with rage set upon the castle of macduff and put he wife and child whom the thane have leave behind to the sword and extend the slaughter to all who claim the least relationship to macduff these and such-like deed alienate the mind of all he chief nobility from he such as could flee to join with malcolm and macduff who be now approach with a powerful army which they have raise in england and the rest secretly wish success to they arm though for fear of macbeth they could take no active part he recruit go on slowly every body hate the tyrant nobody love or honor he but all suspect he and he begin to envy the condition of duncan whom he have murder who sleep soundly in he grave against whom treason have do its worst : steel nor poison domestic malice nor foreign levy could hurt he any longer while these thing be act the queen who have be the sole partner in he wickedness in whose bosom he could sometimes seek a momentary repose from those terrible dream which afflict they both nightly die it be suppose by she own hand unable to bear the remorse of guilt and public hate by which event he be leave alone without a soul to love or care for he or a friend to whom he could confide he wicked purpose he grow careless of life and wish for death but the near approach of malcolm 's army rouse in he what remain of he ancient courage and he determine to die -lrb- as he express it -rrb- with armor on he back besides this the hollow promise of the witch have fill he with false confidence and he remember the saying of the spirit that none of woman bear be to hurt he and that he be never to be vanquish till birnam wood should come to dunsinane which he think could never be so he shut himself up in he castle whose impregnable strength be such as defy a siege : here he sullenly wait the approach of malcolm when upon a day there come a messenger to he pale and shake with fear almost unable to report that which he have see : for he aver that as he stand upon he watch on the hill he look towards birnam and to he think the wood begin to move liar and slave cry macbeth if thou speakest false thou shalt hang alive upon the next tree till famine end thee if thy tale be true i care not if thou dost as much by I : for

florence he have fall in love with diana a fair young gentlewoman the daughter of this widow who be helena 's hostess and every night with music of all sort and song compose in praise of diana 's beauty he would come under she window and solicit she love : and all he suit to she be that she would permit he to visit she by stealth after the family be retire to rest but diana would by no means be persuade to grant this improper request nor give any encouragement to he suit know he to be a married man for diana have be bring up under the counsel of a prudent mother who though she be now in reduce circumstance be well-born and descend from the noble family of the capulet all this the good lady relate to helena highly praise the virtuous principle of she discreet daughter which she say be

hostess and she daughter would suffer this visit from bertram to take place and allow she to pass herself upon bertram for diana tell they she chief motive for desire to have this secret meeting with she husband be to get a ring from he which he have say if ever she be in possession of he would acknowledge she as he wife the widow and she daughter promise to assist she in this affair partly move by pity for this unhappy forsake wife and partly win over to she interest by the promise of reward which helena make they give they a purse of money in earnest of she future favor in the course of that day helena cause information to be send to bertram that she be dead hope that when he think himself free to make a second choice by the news of she death he would offer marriage to she in she feigned character of diana and if she could obtain the ring and this promise too she doubt not she should make some future good come of it in the evening after it be dark bertram be admit into diana 's chamber and helena be there ready to receive he the flattering compliment and love-discourse he address to helena be precious sound to she though she know they be mean for diana and bertram be so well pleased with she that he make she a solemn promise to be she husband and to love she for ever which she hope would be prophetic of a real affection when he should know it be he own wife the despise helena whose conversation have so delighted he bertram never know how sensible a lady helena be else perhaps he would not have be so regardless of she and see she every day he have entirely overlook she beauty a face we be accustom to see constantly lose the effect which be cause by the first sight either of beauty or of plainness and of she understanding it be impossible he should judge because she feel such reverence mix with she love for he that she be always silent in he presence but now that she future fate and the happy ending of all she love-project seem to depend on she leave a favourable impression on the mind of bertram from this night 's interview she exert all she wit to please he and the simple grace of she lively conversation and the endearing sweetness of she manners so charm bertram that he vow she should be he wife helena beg the ring from off he finger as a token of he regard and he give it to she and in return for this ring which it be of such importance to she to possess she give he another ring which be one the king have make she a present of before it be light in the morning she send bertram away and he immediately set out on he journey towards he mother 's house helena prevail on the widow and diana to accompany she to pari they farther assistance be necessary to the full accomplishment of the plan she have form when they arrive there they find the king be go upon a visit to the countess of rossilion and helena follow the king with all the speed she could make the king be still in perfect health and he gratitude to she who have be the means of he recovery be so lively in he mind that the moment he see the countess of rossilion he begin to talk of helena call she a precious jewel that be lose by the folly of she son but see the subject distressed the countess who sincerely lament the death of helena he say my good lady i have forgive and forget all but the good-natured old lafeu who be present and could not bear that the memory of he favorite helena should be so lightly pass over say this i must say the young lord do great offence to he majesty he mother and he lady but to himself he do the greatest wrong of all for he have lose a wife whose beauty astonish all eye whose word take all ear captive whose deep perfection make all heart wish to serve she the king say praise what be lose make the remembrance dear well -- call he hither mean bertram who now present himself before the king : and on he express deep sorrow for the injury he have do to helena the king for he dead father 's and he admirable mother 's sake pardon he and restore he once more to he favor but the gracious countenance of the king be soon change towards he for he perceive that bertram wear the very ring upon he finger which he have give to helena and he well remember that helena have call all the saint in heaven to witness she would never part with that ring unless she send it to the king himself upon some great disaster befall she and bertram on the king 's question he how he come by the ring tell a improbable story of a lady throw it to he out of a window and deny ever have see helena since the day of they marriage the king know bertram 's dislike to he wife fear he have destroy she and he order he guard to seize bertram say i be wrapt in dismal thinking for i fear the life of helena be foully snatch at this moment diana and she mother enter and present a petition to the king wherein they beg he majesty to exert he royal power to compel bertram to marry diana he have make she a solemn promise of marriage bertram fear the king 's anger deny he have make any such promise and then diana produce the ring -lrb- which helena have put into she hand -rrb- to confirm the truth of she word and she say that she have give bertram the ring he then wear in exchange for that at the time he vow to marry she on hear this the king order the guard to seize she also and she account of the ring differ from bertram 's the king 's suspicion be confirm and he say if they do not confess how they come by this ring of helena 's they should be both put to death diana request she mother might be permit to fetch the jeweller of whom she buy the ring which be grant the widow go out and presently return lead in helena herself the good countess who in silent grief have behold she son 's danger and have even dread that the suspicion of he have destroy he wife might possibly be true find she dear helena whom she love with even a maternal affection be still live feel a delight she be hardly able to support and the king scarce believe for joy that it be helena say be this indeed the wife of bertram that i see helena feeling herself yet a unacknowledged wife reply no my good lord it be but the shadow of a wife you see the name and not the thing bertram cry out both both o pardon o my lord say helena when i personated this fair maid i find you wondrous kind and look here be you letter read to he in a joyful tone those word which she have once repeat so sorrowfully _ when from my finger you can get this ring _ -- this be do it be to I you give the ring will you be mine now you be doubly win bertram reply if you can make it plain that you be the lady i talk with that night i will love you dearly ever ever dearly this be no difficult task for the widow and diana come with helena purposely to prove this fact and the king be so well pleased with diana for the friendly assistance she have render the dear lady he so truly value for the service she have do he that he promise she also a noble husband : helena 's history give he a hint that it be a suitable reward for king to bestow upon fair lady when they perform notable service thus helena at last find that she father 's legacy be indeed sanctify by the luckiest star in heaven for she be now the beloved wife of she dear bertram the daughter-in-law of she noble mistress and herself the countess of rossilion the tame of the shrew -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- katherine the shrew be the eldest daughter of baptista a rich gentleman of padua she be a lady of such a ungovernable spirit and fiery temper such a loud-tongued scold that she be know in padua by no other name than katherine the shrew it seem very unlikely indeed impossible that any gentleman would ever be find who would venture to marry this lady and therefore baptista be much blame for defer he consent to many excellent offer that be make to she gentle sister bianca put off all bianca 's suitor with this excuse that when the eldest sister be fairly off he hand they should have free leave to address young bianca it happen however that a gentleman name petruchio come to padua purposely to look out for a wife who nothing discourage by these report of katherine 's temper and hearing she be rich and handsome resolve upon marry this famous termagant and tame she into a meek and manageable wife and truly none be so fit to set about this herculean labor as petruchio whose spirit be as high as katherine 's and he be a witty and most happy-tempered humourist and withal so wise and of such a true judgment that he well know how to feign a passionate and furious deportment when he spirit be so calm that he himself could have laugh merrily at he own angry feign for he natural temper be careless and easy the boisterous air he assume when he become the husband of katherine be but in sport or more properly speak affect by he excellent discernment as the only means to overcome in she own way the passionate way of the furious katherine a court then petruchio go to katherine the shrew and first of all he apply to baptista she father for leave to woo he _ gentle daughter _ katherine as petruchio call she say archly that have hear of she bashful modesty and mild behavior he have come from verona to solicit she love she father though he wish she marry be force to confess katherine would ill answer this character it be soon apparent of what manner of gentleness she be compose for she music-master rush into the room to complain that the gentle katherine he pupil have break he head with she lute for presume to find fault with she performance which when petruchio hear he say it be a brave wench i love she more than ever and long to have some chat with she and hurry the old gentleman for a positive answer he say my business be in haste signior baptista i can not come every day to woo you know my father he be dead and have leave I heir to all he land and goods then tell I if i get you daughter 's love what dowry you will give with she baptista think he manner be somewhat blunt for a lover but be glad to get katherine marry he answer that he would give she twenty thousand crown for she dowry and half he estate at he death : so this odd match be quickly agree on and baptista go to apprise he shrewish daughter of she lover 's address and send she in to petruchio to listen to he suit in the mean time petruchio be settle with himself the mode of courtship he should pursue : and he say i will woo she with some spirit when she come if she rail at I why then i will tell she she sing as sweetly as a nightingale and if she frown i will say she look as clear as rose newly wash with dew if she will not speak a word i will praise the eloquence of she language and if she bid I leave she i will give she thanks as if she bid I stay with she a week now the stately katherine enter and petruchio first address she with good morrow kate for that be you name i hear katherine not like this plain salutation say disdainfully they call I katherine who do speak to I you lie reply the lover for you be call plain kate and bonny kate and sometimes kate the shrew but kate you be the prettiest kate in christendom and therefore kate hear you mildness praise in every town i be come to woo you for my wife a strange courtship they make of it she in loud and angry term shew he how justly she have gain the name of shrew while he still praise she sweet and courteous word till at length hear she father come he say -lrb- intend to make as quick a woo as possible -rrb- sweet katherine let we set this idle chat aside for you father have consent that you shall be my wife you dowry be agree on and whether you will or no i will marry you and now baptista enter petruchio tell he he daughter have receive he kindly and that she have promise to be marry the next Sunday this katherine deny say she would rather see he hang on Sunday and reproach she father for wish to wed she to such a mad-cap ruffian as petruchio petruchio desire she father not to regard she angry word for they have agree she should seem reluctant before he but that when they be alone he have find she very fond and loving and he say give I you hand kate i will go to venice to buy you fine apparel against we wedding-day provide the feast father and bid the wedding guest i will be sure to bring ring fine array and rich clothes that my katherine may be fine and kiss I kate for we will be marry on Sunday on the Sunday all the wedding guest be assemble but they wait long before petruchio come and katherine weep for vexation to think that petruchio have only be make a jest of she at last however he appear but he bring none of the bridal finery he have promise katherine nor be he dress himself like a bridegroom but in strange disorder attire as if he mean to make a sport of the serious business he come about and he servant and the very horse on which they ride be in like manner in mean and fantastic fashion habit petruchio could not be persuade to change he dress he say katherine be to be marry to he and not to he clothes and find it be in vain to argue with he to the church they go he still behave in the same mad way for when the priest ask petruchio if katherine should be he wife he swear so loud that she should that all amaze the priest let fall he book and as he stoop to take it up this mad-brained bridegroom give he such a cuff that down fall the priest and he book again and all the while they be be marry he stampt and swear so that the high-spirited katherine tremble and shake with fear after the ceremony be over while they be yet in the church he call for wine and drink a loud health to the company and throw a sop which be at the bottom of the glass full in the sexton 's face give no other reason for this strange act than that the sexton 's beard grow thin and hungerly and seem to ask the sop as he be drink never sure be there such a mad marriage but petruchio do but put this wildness on the better to succeed in the plot he have form to tame he shrewish wife baptista have provide a sumptuous marriage-feast but when they return from church petruchio take hold of katherine declare he intention of carry he wife home instantly and no remonstrance of he father-in-law or angry word of the enraged katherine could make he change he purpose he claim a husband 's right to dispose of he wife as he please and away he hurry katherine off : he seem so daring and resolute that no one dare attempt to stop he petruchio mount he wife upon a miserable horse lean and lank which he have pick out for the purpose and himself and he servant no better mount they journey on through rough and miry way and ever when this horse of katherine 's stumble he would storm and swear at the poor jaded beast who could scarce crawl under he burthen as if he have be the most passionate man alive at length after a weary journey during which katherine have hear nothing but the wild ravings of petruchio at the servant and the horse they arrive at he house petruchio welcome she kindly to she home but he resolve she should have neither rest nor food that night the table be spread and supper soon serve but petruchio pretend to find fault with every dish throw the meat about the floor and order the servant to remove it away and all this he do as he say in love for he katherine that she might not eat meat that be not well dress and when katherine weary and supperless retire to rest he find the same fault with the bed throw the pillow and bed-clothes about the room so that she be force to sit down in a chair where if she

more become famous in padua not as heretofore as katherine the shrew but as katherine the most obedient and duteous wife in padua the comedy of error -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- the state of syracuse and ephesus be at variance there be a cruel law make at ephesus ordain that if any merchant of syracuse be see in the city of ephesus he be to be put to death unless he could pay a thousand mark for the ransom of he life ægeon a old merchant of syracuse be discover in the street of ephesus and bring before the duke either to pay this heavy fine or to receive sentence of death ægeon have no money to pay the fine and the duke before he pronounce the sentence of death upon he desire he to relate the history of he life and to tell for what cause he have venture to come to the city of ephesus which it be death for any syracusan merchant to enter ægeon say that he do not fear to die for sorrow have make he weary of he life but that a heavier task could not have be impose upon he than to relate the event of he unfortunate life he then begin he own history in the follow word : -- i be bear at syracuse and bring up to the profession of a merchant i marry a lady with whom i live very happily but be oblige to go to epidamnium i be detain there by my business six month and then find i should be oblige to stay some time longer i send for my wife who as soon as she arrive be bring to bed of two son and what be very strange they be both so exactly alike that it be impossible to distinguish the one from the other at the same time that my wife be bring to bed of these twin-boy a poor woman in the inn where my wife lodge be bring to bed of two son and these twin be as much like each other as my two son be the parent of these child be exceedingly poor i buy the two boy and bring they up to attend upon my son my son be very fine child and my wife be not a little proud of two such boy : and she daily wish to return home i unwillingly agree and in a evil hour we get on shipboard for we have not sail above a league from epidamnium before a dreadful storm arise which continue with such violence that the sailor see no chance of save the ship crowd into the boat to save they own life leave we alone in the ship which we every moment expect would be destroy by the fury of the storm the incessant weep of my wife and the piteous complaint of the pretty babe who not know what to fear weep for fashion because they see they mother weep fill I with terror for they though i do not for myself fear death and all my thought be bent to contrive means for they safety i tie my youngest son to the end of a small spare mast such as seafaring man provide against storm at the other end i bind the youngest of the twin-slave and at the same time i direct my wife how to fasten the other child in like manner to another mast she thus have the care of the two eldest child and i of the two younger we bind ourselves separately to these mast with the child and but for this contrivance we have all be lose for the ship split on a mighty rock and be dash in piece and we cling to these slender mast be support above the water where i have the care of two child be unable to assist my wife who with the other child be soon separate from I but while they be yet in my sight they be take up by a boat of fisherman from corinth -lrb- as i suppose -rrb- and see they in safety i have no care but to struggle with the wild sea wave to preserve my dear son and the youngest slave at length we in we turn be take up by a ship and the sailor know I give we kind welcome and assistance and land we in safety at syracuse but from that sad hour i have never know what become of my wife and eldest child my youngest son and now my only care when he be eighteen year of age begin to be inquisitive after he mother and he brother and often importune I that he might take he attendant the young slave who have also lose he brother and go in search of they : at length i unwillingly give consent for though i anxiously desire to hear tiding of my wife and eldest son yet in send my younger one to find they i hazard the loss of he also it be now seven year since my son leave I five year have i past in travel through the world in search of he : i have be in farthest greece and through the bound of asia and coast homewards i land here in ephesus be unwilling to leave any place unsought that harbor man but this day must end the story of my life and happy should i think myself in my death if i be assure my wife and son be live here the hapless ægeon end the account of he misfortune and the duke pity this unfortunate father who have bring upon himself this great peril by he love for he lost son say if it be not against the law which he oath and dignity do not permit he to alter he would freely pardon he yet instead of doom he to instant death as the strict letter of the law require he would give he that day to try if he could beg or borrow the money to pay the fine this day of grace do seem no great favor to ægeon for not know any man in ephesus there seem to he but little chance that any stranger would lend or give he a thousand mark to pay the fine and helpless and hopeless of any relief he retire from the presence of the duke in the custody of a jailor ægeon suppose he know no person in ephesus but at the very time he be in danger of lose he life through the careful search he be make after he youngest son that son and he eldest son also be both in the city of ephesus ægeon 's son besides be exactly alike in face and person be both name alike be both call antipholi and the two twin slave be also both name dromio ægeon 's youngest son antipholi of syracuse he whom the old man have come to ephesus to seek happen to arrive at ephesus with he slave dromio that very same day that ægeon do and he be also a merchant of syracuse he would have be in the same danger that he father be but by good fortune he meet a friend who tell he the peril a old merchant of syracuse be in and advise he to pass for a merchant of epidamnium this antipholis agreed to do and he be sorry to hear one of he own countryman be in this danger but he little think this old merchant be he own father the eldest son of ægeon -lrb- who must be call antipholi of ephesus to distinguish he from he brother antipholi of syracuse -rrb- have live at ephesus twenty year and be a rich man be well able to have pay the money for the ransom of he father 's life but antipholis know nothing of he father be so young when he be take out of the sea with he mother by the fisherman that he only remember he have be so preserved but he have no recollection of either he father or he mother the fisherman who take up this antipholi and he mother and the young slave dromio have carry the two child away from she -lrb- to the great grief of that unhappy lady -rrb- intend to sell they antipholis and dromio be sell by they to duke menaphon a famous warrior who be uncle to the duke of ephesus and he carry the boy to ephesus when he go to visit the duke he nephew the duke of ephesus take a liking to young antipholi when he grow up make he a officer in he army in which he distinguish himself by he great bravery in the war where he save the life of he patron the duke who reward he merit by marry he to adriana a rich lady of ephesus with whom he be live -lrb- he slave dromio still attend he -rrb- at the time he father come there antipholi of syracuse when he part with he friend who advise he to say he come from epidamnium give he slave dromio some money to carry to the inn where he intend to dine and in the mean time he say he would walk about and view the city and observe the manners of the people dromio be a pleasant fellow and when antipholi be dull and melancholy he use to divert himself with the odd humor and merry jest of he slave so that the freedom of speech he allow in dromio be greater than be usual between master and they servant when antipholi of syracuse have send dromio away he stand a while think over he solitary wanderings in search of he mother and he brother of whom in no place where he land could he hear the least tiding and he say sorrowfully to himself i be like a drop of water in the ocean which seek to find its fellow-drop lose itself in the wide sea so i unhappily to find a mother and a brother do lose myself while he be thus meditate on he weary travels which have hitherto be so useless dromio -lrb- as he think -rrb- return antipholis wonder that he come back so soon ask he where he have leave the money now it be not he own dromio but the twin-brother that live with antipholi of ephesus that he speak to the two dromio and the two antipholise be still as much alike as ægeon have say they be in they infancy therefore no wonder antipholi think it be he own slave return and ask he why he come back so soon dromio reply my mistress send I to bid you come to dinner the capon burn and the pig fall from the spit and the meat will be all cold if you do not come home these jest be out of season say antipholi : where do you leave the money dromio still answer that he mistress have send he to fetch antipholi to dinner : what mistress say antipholi why you worship 's wife sir reply dromio antipholi have no wife he be very angry with dromio and say because i familiarly sometimes chat with you you presume to jest with I in this free manner i be not in a sportive humor now : where be the money we be stranger here how dare you trust so great a charge from you own custody dromio hear he master as he think he talk of they be stranger suppose antipholi be jest reply merrily i pray you sir jest as you sit at dinner : i have no charge but to fetch you home to dine with my mistress and she sister now antipholi lose all patience and beat dromio who run home and tell he mistress that he master have refuse to come to dinner and say that he have no wife adriana the wife of antipholi of ephesus be very angry when she hear that she husband say he have no wife for she be of a jealous temper and she say she husband mean that he love another lady better than herself and she begin to fret and say unkind word of jealousy and reproach of she husband and she sister luciana who live with she try in vain to persuade she out of she groundless suspicion antipholi of syracuse go to the inn and find dromio with the money in safety there and see he own dromio he be go again to chide he for he free jest when adriana come up to he and not doubt but it be she husband she see she begin to reproach he for look strange upon she -lrb- as well he might never have see this angry lady before -rrb- and then she tell he how well he love she before they be marry and that now he love some other lady instead of she how come it now my husband say she o how come it that i have lose you love plead you to I fair dame say the astonished antipholi it be in vain he tell she he be not she husband and that he have be in ephesus but two hour she insist on he go home with she and antipholi at last be unable to get away go with she to he brother 's house and dine with adriana and she sister the one call he husband and the other brother he all amaze thinking he must have be marry to she in he sleep or that he be sleep now and dromio who follow they be no less surprised for the cook-maid who be he brother 's wife also claim he for she husband while antipholi of syracuse be dine with he brother 's wife he brother the real husband return home to dinner with he slave dromio but the servant would not open the door because they mistress have order they not to admit any company and when they repeatedly knock and say they be antipholis and dromio the maid laugh at they and say that antipholi be at dinner with they mistress and dromio be in the kitchen and though they almost knock the door down they could not gain admittance and at last antipholis go away very angry and strangely surprise at hear a gentleman be dine with he wife when antipholi of syracuse have finish he dinner he be so perplexed at the lady 's still persist in call he husband and at hear that dromio have also be claim by the cook-maid that he leave the house as soon as he could find any pretence to get away for though he be very much pleased with luciana the sister yet the jealous-tempered adriana he dislike very much nor be dromio at all better satisfy with he fair wife in the kitchen therefore both master and man be glad to get away from they new wife as fast as they could the moment antipholi of syracuse have leave the house he be meet by a goldsmith who mistake he as adriana have do for antipholi of ephesus give he a gold chain call he by he name and when antipholi would have refuse the chain say it do not belong to he the goldsmith reply he make it by he own order and go away leave the chain in the hand of antipholi who order he man dromio to get he thing on board a ship not choose to stay in a place any longer where he meet with such strange adventure that he surely think himself bewitch the goldsmith who have give the chain to the wrong antipholi be arrest immediately after for a sum of money he owe and antipholi the married brother to whom the goldsmith think he have give the chain happen to come to the place where the officer be arrest the goldsmith who when he see antipholis ask he to pay for the gold chain he have just deliver to he the price amounting to nearly the same sum as that for which he have be arrest antipholis deny the have receive the chain and the goldsmith persist to declare that he have but a few minute before give it to he they dispute this matter a long time both think they be right for antipholis know the goldsmith never give he the chain and so like be the two brother the goldsmith be as certain he have deliver the chain into he hand till at last the officer take the goldsmith away to prison for the debt he owe and at the same time the goldsmith make the officer arrest antipholi for the price of the chain so that at the conclusion of they dispute antipholi and the merchant be both take away to prison together as antipholi be go to prison he meet dromio of syracuse he brother 's slave and mistake he for he own he order he to go to adriana he wife and tell she to send the money for which he be arrest dromio wonder that he master should send he back to the strange house where he dine and from which he have just before be in such haste to depart do not dare to reply though he come to tell he master the ship be ready to sail for he see antipholi be in no humor to be jest with therefore he go away grumble within himself that he must return to adriana 's house where say he dowsabel claim I for a husband : but i must go for servant must obey they master ' command adriana give he the money and as dromio be return he meet antipholi of syracuse who be still in amaze at the surprising adventure he meet with for he brother be well know in ephesus there be hardly a man he meet in the street but salute he as a old acquaintance : some offer he money which they say be owe to he some invite he to come and see they and some give he thanks for kindness they say he have do they all mistake he for he brother a taylor shew he some silk he have buy for he and insist upon take measure of he for some clothes antipholis begin to think he be among a nation of sorcerer and witch and dromio do not at all relieve he master from he bewildered thought by ask he how he get free from the officer who be carry he to prison and give he the purse of gold which adriana have send to pay the debt with this talk of dromio 's of the arrest and of a prison and of the money he have bring from adriana perfectly confound antipholis and he say this fellow dromio be certainly distract and we wander here in illusion and quite terrify at he own confused thought he cry out some bless power deliver we from this strange place and now another stranger come up to he and she be a lady and she too call he antipholis and tell he he have dine with she that day and ask he for a gold chain which she say he have promise to give she antipholi now lose all patience and call she a sorceress he deny that he have ever promise she a chain or dine with she or have even see she face before that moment the lady persist in affirm he have dine with she and have promise she a chain which antipholi still deny she farther say that she have give he a valuable ring and if he would not give she the gold chain she insist upon have she own ring again on this antipholis become quite frantic and again call she sorceress and witch and deny all knowledge of she or she ring run away from she leave she astonished at he word and he wild look for nothing to she appear more certain than that he have dine with she and that she have give he a ring in consequence of he promise to make she a present of a gold chain but this lady have fall into the same mistake the other have do for she have take he for he brother the married antipholi have do all the thing she tax this antipholi with when the married antipholi be deny entrance into he own house -lrb- those within suppose he to be already there -rrb- he have go away very angry believe it to be one of he wife 's jealous freak to which she be very subject and remember that she have often falsely accuse he of visit other lady he to be revenge on she for shut he out of he own house determine to go and dine with this lady and she receive he with great civility and he wife have so highly offend he antipholis promise to give she a gold chain which he have intend as a present for he wife it be the same chain which the goldsmith by mistake have give to he brother the lady like so well the thought of have a fine gold chain that she give the married antipholi a ring which when as she suppose -lrb- take he brother for he -rrb- he deny and say he do not know she and leave she in such a wild passion she begin to think he be certainly out of he sens and presently she resolve to go and tell adriana that she husband be mad and while she be tell it to adriana he come attend by the jailor -lrb- who allow he to come home to get the money to pay the debt -rrb- for the purse of money which adriana have send by dromio and he have deliver to the other antipholis adriana believe the story the lady tell she of she husband 's madness must be true when he reproach she for shut he out of he own house and remember how he have protest all dinner-time that he be not she husband and have never be in ephesus till that day she have no doubt that he be mad she therefore pay the jailor the money and have discharge he she order she servant to bind she husband with rope and have he convey into a dark room and send for a doctor to come and cure he of he madness : antipholi all the while hotly exclaim against this false accusation which the exact likeness he bear to he brother have bring upon he but he rage only the more confirm they in the belief that he be mad and dromio persist in the same story they bind he also and take he away along with he master soon after adriana have put she husband into confinement a servant come to tell she that antipholi and dromio must have break loose from they keeper for that they be both walk at liberty in the next street on hearing this adriana run out to fetch he home take some people with she to secure she husband again and she sister go along with she when they come to the gate of a convent in they neighborhood there they see antipholi and dromio as they think be again deceive by the likeness of the twin-brother antipholi of syracuse be still beset with the perplexity this likeness have bring upon he the chain which the goldsmith have give he be about he neck and the goldsmith be reproach he for deny that he have it and refuse to pay for it and antipholi be protest that the goldsmith freely give he the chain in the morning and that from that hour he have never see the goldsmith again and now adriana come up to he and claim he as she lunatic husband who have escape from he keeper and the man she bring with she be go to lay violent hand on antipholi and dromio but they run into the convent and antipholis beg the abbess to give he shelter in she house and now come out the lady abbess herself to enquire into the cause of this disturbance she be a grave and venerable lady and wise to judge of what she see and she would not too hastily give up the man who have seek protection in she house so she strictly question the wife about the story she tell of she husband 's madness and she say what be the cause of this sudden distemper of you husband 's have he lose he wealth at sea or be it the death of some dear friend that have disturb he mind adriana reply that no such thing as these have be the cause perhaps say the abbess he have fix he affection on some other lady than you he wife and that have drive he to this state adriana say she have long think the love of some other lady be the cause of he frequent absence from home now it be not he love for another but the teazing jealousy of he wife 's temper that often oblige antipholi to leave he home and -lrb- the abbess suspect this from the vehemence of adriana 's manner -rrb- to learn the truth she say you should have reprehend he for this why so i do reply adriana aye say the abbess but perhaps not enough adriana willing to convince the abbess that she have say enough to antipholi on this subject reply it be the constant subject of we conversation : in bed i would not let he sleep for speaking of it at table i would not let he eat for speaking of it when i be alone with he i talk of nothing else and in company i give he frequent hint of it still all my talk be how vile and bad it be in he to love any lady better than I the lady abbess have draw this full confession from the jealous adriana now say and therefore come it that you husband be mad the venomous clamor of a jealous woman be a more deadly poison than a mad dog 's tooth it seem he sleep be hinder by you railing no wonder that he head be light and he meat be sauce with you upbraiding unquiet meal make ill digestion and that have throw he into this fever you say he sport be disturb by you brawl be debar from the enjoyment of society and recreation what could ensue but dull melancholy and comfortless despair the consequence be then that you jealous fit have make you husband mad luciana would have excuse she sister say she always reprehend she husband mildly and she say to she sister why do you hear these rebuke without answer they but the abbess have make she so plainly perceive she fault that she could only answer she have betray I to my own reproof adriana though ashamed of she own conduct still insist on have she husband deliver up to she but the abbess would suffer no person to enter she house nor would she deliver up this unhappy man to the care of the jealous wife determine herself to use gentle means for he recovery and she retire into she house again and order she gate to be shut against they during the course of this eventful day in which so many error have happen from the likeness the twin brother bear to each other old ægeon 's day of grace be pass away it be now near sunset : and at sunset he be doom to die if he could not pay the money the place of he execution be near this convent and here he arrive just as the abbess retire into the convent the duke attend in person that if any offer to pay the money he might be present to pardon he adriana stop this melancholy procession and cry out to the duke for justice tell he that the abbess have refuse to deliver up she lunatic husband to she care while she be speak she real husband and he servant dromio who have get loose come before the duke to demand justice complain that he wife have confine he on a false charge of lunacy and tell in what manner he have break he band and elude the vigilance of he keeper adriana be strangely surprise to see she husband when she think he have be within the convent ægeon see he son conclude this be the son who have leave he to go in search of he mother and he brother and he feel secure that this dear son would readily pay the money demand for he ransom he therefore speak to antipholi in word of fatherly affection with joyful hope that he should now be release but to the utter astonishment of ægeon he son deny all knowledge of he as well he might for this antipholi have never see he father since they be separate in the storm in he infancy but while the poor old ægeon be in vain endeavor to make he son acknowledge he think surely that either he grief and the anxiety he have suffer have so strangely altered he that he son do not know he or else that he be ashamed to acknowledge he father in he misery in the midst of this perplexity the lady abbess and the other antipholi and dromio come out and the wonder adriana see two husband and two dromio stand before she and now these riddle error which have so perplexed they all be clearly make out when the duke see the two antipholise and the two dromio both so exactly alike he at once conjecture aright of these seeming mystery for he remember the story ægeon have tell he in the morning and he say these man must be the two son of ægeon and they twin slave but now a unlooked-for joy

she wise and virtuous conduct she be at length make lady abbess of this convent and in discharge the rite of hospitality to a unhappy stranger she have unknowingly protect she own son joyful congratulation and affectionate greeting between these long separated parent and they child make they for a while forget that ægeon be yet under sentence of death but when they be become a little calm antipholi of ephesus offer the duke the ransom-money for he father 's life but the duke freely pardon ægeon and would not take the money and the duke go with the abbess and she newly find husband and child into the convent to hear this happy family discourse at leisure of the bless ending of they adverse fortune and the two dromio ' humble joy must not be forget they have they congratulation and greeting too and each dromio pleasantly compliment he brother on he good look be well pleased to see he own person -lrb- as in a glass -rrb- shew so handsome in he brother adriana have so well profit by the good counsel of she mother-in-law that she never after cherish unjust suspicion or be jealous of she husband antipholi of syracuse marry the fair luciana the sister of he brother 's wife and the good old ægeon with he wife and son live at ephesus many year nor do the unravelling of these perplexity so entirely remove every ground of mistake for the future but that sometimes to remind they of adventure past comical blunder would happen and the one antipholi and the one dromio be mistake for the other make altogether a pleasant and divert comedy of error measure for measure -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- in the city of vienna there once reign a duke of such a mild and gentle temper that he suffer he subject to neglect the law with impunity and there be in particular one law the

from preserved soul from fast maid whose mind be dedicate to nothing temporal well come to I to-morrow say angelo and for this short respite of she brother 's life and for this permission that she might be hear again she leave he with the joyful hope that she should at last prevail over he stern nature : and as she go away she say heaven keep you honor safe heaven save you honor which when angelo hear he say within he heart amen i would be save from thee and from thy virtue : and then affright at he own evil thought he say what be this what be this do i love she that i desire to hear

for in the prison claudio be visit by the good duke who in he friar 's habit teach the young man the way to heaven preaching to he the word of penitence and peace but angelo feel all the pang of irresolute guilt : now wish to seduce isabel from the path of innocence and honor and now suffer remorse and horror for a crime as yet but intentional but in the end he evil thought prevail and he who have so lately start at the offer of a bribe resolve to tempt this maiden with so high a bribe as she might not be able to resist even with the precious gift of she dear brother 's life when isabel come in the morning angelo desire she might be admit alone to he presence and be there he say to she if she would yield to he she virgin honor and transgress even as juliet have do with claudio he

do know assail he he cry out sweet sister let I live the sin you do to save a brother 's life nature dispense with the deed so far that it become a virtue o faithless coward o dishonest wretch say isabel : would you preserve you life by you sister 's shame o fie fie fie i think my brother you have in you such a mind of honor that have you twenty head to render up on twenty block you would have yield they up all before you sister should stoop to such dishonor nay hear I isabel say claudio but what he would have say in defense of he weakness in desire to live by the dishonor of he virtuous sister be interrupt by the entrance of the duke who say claudio i have overhear what have past between you and you sister angelo have never the purpose to corrupt she what he say have only be to make trial of she virtue she have the truth of honor in she have give he that gracious denial which he be most glad to receive there be no hope that he will pardon you therefore pass you hour in prayer and make ready for death then claudio repent of he weakness and say let I ask my sister 's pardon i be so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it and claudio retire overwhelm with shame and sorrow for he fault the duke be now alone with isabel commend she virtuous resolution say the hand that make you fair have make you good o say isabel how much be the good duke deceive in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to he i will discover he government isabel know not that she be even now make the discovery she threaten the duke reply that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stand angelo will repel you accusation therefore lend a attentive ear to my advising i believe that you may most righteously do a poor wrong lady a merit benefit redeem you brother from the angry law do no stain to you own most gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have notice of this business isabel say she have a spirit to do anything he desire provide it be nothing wrong virtue be bold and never fearful say the duke : and then he ask she if she have ever hear of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who be drown at sea i have hear of the lady say isabel and good word go with she name this lady say the duke be the wife of angelo but she marriage dowry be on board the vessel in which she brother perish and mark how heavily this befall to the poor gentlewoman for beside the loss of a most noble and renowned brother who in he love towards she be ever most kind and natural in the wreck of she fortune she lose the affection of she husband the well-seeming angelo who pretend to discover some dishonor in this honorable lady -lrb- though the true cause be the loss of she dowry -rrb- leave she in she tear and dry not one of they with he comfort he unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quench she love have like a impediment in the current make it more unruly and mariana love she cruel husband with the full continuance of she first affection the duke then more plainly unfold he plan it be that isabel should go to lord angelo and seemingly consent to come to he as he desire at midnight that by this mean she would obtain the promise pardon and that mariana should go in she stead to the appointment and pass herself upon angelo in the dark for isabel nor gentle daughter say the feigned friar fear you to do this thing angelo be she husband and to bring they thus together be no sin isabel be please with this project depart to do as he direct she and he go to apprize mariana of they intention he have before this time visit this unhappy lady in he assumed character give she religious instruction and friendly consolation at which time he have learn she sad story from she own lip and now she look upon he as a holy man readily consent to be direct by he in this undertaking when isabel return from she interview with angelo to the house of mariana where the duke have appoint she to meet he he say well meet and in good time what be the news from this good deputy isabel related the manner in which she have settle the affair angelo say she have a garden surround with a brick wall on the western side of which be a vineyard and to that vineyard be a gate and then she shew to the duke and mariana two key that angelo have give she and she say this bigger key open the vineyard gate this other a little door which lead from the vineyard to the garden there i have make my promise at the dead of the night to call upon he and have get from he he word of assurance for my brother 's life i have take a due and wary note of the place and with whispering and most guilty diligence he shew I the way twice over be there no other token agree upon between you that mariana must observe say the duke no none say isabel only to go when it be dark i have tell he my time can be but short for i have make he think a servant come along with I and that this servant be persuade i come about my brother the duke commend she discreet management and she turn to mariana say little have you to say to angelo when you depart from he but soft and low _ remember now my brother _ mariana be that night conduct to the appoint place by isabel who rejoice that she have as she suppose by this device preserve both she brother 's life and she own honor but that she brother 's life be safe the duke be not so well satisfied and therefore at midnight he again repair to the prison and it be well for claudio that he do so else would claudio have that night be behead for soon after the duke enter the prison a order come from the cruel deputy command that claudio should be behead and he head send to he by five o'clock in the morning but the duke persuade the provost to put off the execution of claudio and to deceive angelo by send he the head of a man who die that morning in the prison and to prevail upon the provost to agree to this the duke whom still the provost suspect not to be any thing more or greater than he seem shew the provost a letter write with the duke 's hand and seal with he seal which when the provost see he conclude this friar must have some secret order from the absent duke and therefore he consent to spare claudio and he cut off the dead man 's head and carry it to angelo then the duke in he own name write to angelo a letter say that certain accident have put a stop to he journey and that he should be in vienna by the follow morning require angelo to meet he at the entrance of the city there to deliver up he authority and the duke also command it to be proclaim that if any of he subject crave redress for injustice they should exhibit they petition in the street on he first entrance into the city early in the morning isabel come to the prison and the duke who there await she come for secret reason think it good to tell she that claudio be behead therefore when isabel enquire if angelo have send the pardon for she brother he say angelo have release claudio from this world he head be off and send to the deputy the much-grieved sister cry out o unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most wicked angelo the seeming friar bid she take comfort and when she be become a little calm he acquaint she with the near prospect of the duke 's return and tell she in what manner she should proceed in prefer she complaint against angelo and he bid she not to fear if the cause should seem to go against she for a while leave isabel sufficiently instruct he next go to mariana and give she counsel in what manner she also should act then the duke lay aside he friar 's habit and in he own royal robe amidst a joyful crowd of he faithful subject assemble to greet he arrival enter the city of vienna where he be meet by angelo who deliver up he authority in the proper form and there come isabel in the manner of a petitioner for redress and say justice most royal duke i be the sister of one claudio who for the seduce a young maid be condemn to lose he head i make my suit to lord angelo for my brother 's pardon it be needless to tell you grace how i prayed and kneel how he repel I and how i reply for this be of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter angelo would not but by my yield to he dishonourable love release my brother and after much debate within myself my sisterly remorse overcome my virtue and i do yield to he but the next morning betime angelo forfeit he promise send a warrant for my poor brother 's head the duke affect to disbelieve she story and angelo say that grief for she brother 's death who have suffer by the due course of the law have disorder she sens and now another suitor approach which be mariana and mariana say noble prince as there come light from heaven and truth from breath as there be sense in truth and truth in virtue i be this man 's wife and my good lord the word of isabel be false for the night she say she be with angelo i pass that night with he in the garden-house as this be true let I in safety rise or else for ever be fix here a marble monument then do isabel appeal for the truth of what she have say to friar lodowick that be the name the duke have assume in he disguise isabel and mariana have both obey he instruction in what they say the duke intend that the innocence of isabel should be plainly prove in that public manner before the whole city of vienna but angelo little thought that it be from such a cause that they thus differ in they story and he hope from they contradictory evidence to be able to clear himself from the accusation of isabel and he say assume a look of offended innocence i do but smile till now but good my lord my patience here be touch and i perceive these poor distract woman be but the instrument of some greater one who set they on let I have way my lord to find this practice out aye with all my heart say the duke and punish they to the height of you pleasure you lord escalus sit with lord angelo lend he you pain to discover this abuse the friar be send for that set they on and when he come do with you injury as may seem best in any chastisement i for a while will leave you but stir not you

of husband and of prince twelfth night or what you will -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- sebastian and he sister viola a young gentleman and lady of messaline be twin and -lrb- which be account a great wonder -rrb- from they birth they so much resemble each other that but for the difference in they dress they could not be know apart they be both bear in one hour and in one hour they be both in danger of perish for they be shipwreck on the coast of illyrium as they be make a sea-voyage together the ship on board of which they be split on a rock in a violent storm and a very small number of the ship 's company escape with they life the captain of the vessel with a few of the sailor that be save get to land in a small boat and with they they bring viola safe on shore where she poor lady instead of rejoice at she own deliverance begin to lament she brother 's loss but the captain comfort she with the assurance that he have see she brother when the ship split fasten himself to a strong mast on which as long as he could see any thing of he for the distance he perceive he bear up above the wave viola be much console by the hope this account give she and now consider how she be to dispose of herself in a strange country so far from home and she ask the captain if he know any thing of illyrium aye very well madam reply the captain for i be bear not three hour ' travel from this place who govern here say viola the captain tell she illyrium be govern by orsino a duke noble in nature as well as dignity viola say she have hear she father speak of orsino and that he be unmarried then and he be so now say the captain or be so very lately for but a month ago i go from here and then it be the general talk -lrb- as you know what great one do the people will prattle of -rrb- that

dear brother they say she have abjure the sight and company of man viola who be herself in such a sad affliction for she brother 's loss wish she could live with this lady who so tenderly mourn a brother 's death she ask the captain if he could introduce she to olivia say she would willingly serve this lady but he reply this would be a hard thing to accomplish because the lady olivium would admit no person into she house since she brother 's death not even the duke himself then viola form another project in she mind which be in a man 's habit to serve the duke orsino as a page it be a strange fancy in a young lady to put on male attire and pass for a boy but the forlorn and unprotected state of viola who be young and of uncommon beauty alone and in a foreign land must plead she excuse she have observe a fair behavior in the captain and that he shew a friendly concern for she welfare intrust he with she design and he readily engage to assist she viola give he money and direct

exactly like she brother that some strange error happen by means of they be mistake for each other for as will afterwards appear sebastian be also save viola 's good friend the captain when he have transform this pretty lady into a gentleman have some interest at court get she present to orsino under the feigned name of cesario the duke be wonderfully please with the address and graceful deportment of this handsome youth and make cesario one of he page that be the office viola wish to obtain : and she so well fulfil the duty of she new station and shew such a ready observance and faithful attachment to she lord that she soon become he most favored attendant to cesario orsino confide the whole history of he love for the lady olivium to cesario he tell the long and unsuccessful suit he have make to one who reject he long service and despise he person refuse to admit he to she presence and for the love of this lady who have so unkindly treat he the noble orsino forsake the sport of the field and all manly exercise in which he use to delight pass he hour in ignoble sloth listen to the effeminate sound of soft music gentle air and passionate love-song and neglect the company of the wise and learn lord with whom he use to associate he be now all day long converse with young cesario unmeet companion no doubt he grave courtier think cesario be for they once noble master the great duke orsino it be a dangerous matter for young maiden to be the confidant of handsome young duke which viola too soon find to she sorrow for all that orsino tell she he endure for olivium she presently perceive she suffer for the love of he : and much it move she wonder that olivium could be so regardless of this she peerless lord and master whom she think no one should behold without the deepest admiration and she venture gently to hint to orsino that it be pity he should affect a lady who be so blind to he worthy quality and she say if a lady be to love you my lord as you love olivium -lrb- and perhaps there may be one who do -rrb- if you could not love she in return would you not tell she that you could not love and must not she be content with this answer but orsino would not admit of this reasoning for he deny that it be possible for any woman to love as he do he say no woman 's heart be big enough to hold so much love and therefore it be unfair to compare the love of any lady for he to he love for olivium now though viola have the utmost deference for the duke 's opinion she could not help think this be not quite true for she think she heart have full as much love in it as orsino 's have and she say ah but i know my lord -- what do you know cesario say orsino too well i know reply viola what love woman may owe to man they be as true of heart as we be my father have a daughter love a man as i perhaps be i a woman should love you lordship and what be she history say orsino a blank my lord reply viola : she never tell she love but let concealment like a worm in the bud prey on she damask cheek she pine in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sit like patience on a monument smile at grief the duke enquire if this lady die of she

gentleman enter whom the duke have send to olivia and he say so please you my lord i might not be admit to the lady but by she handmaid she return you this answer : until seven year hence the element

heart of this fine frame to pay this debt of love to a dead brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft have touch she heart and then he say to viola you know cesario i have tell you all the secret of my heart therefore good youth go to olivium 's house be not deny access stand at she door and tell she there you fixed foot shall grow till you have audience and if i do speak to she my lord

page she say to the veil lady most radiant exquisite and matchless beauty i pray you tell I if you be the lady of the house for i should be sorry to cast away my speech upon another for besides that it be excellently well pen i have take great pain to learn it whence come you sir say olivium i can say little more than i have study reply viola and that question be out of my part be you a comedian say olivium no reply viola and yet i be not that which i play mean that she be a woman feign herself to be a man and again she ask olivia if she be the lady of the house olivium say she be and then viola have more curiosity to see she rival 's feature than haste to deliver she master 's message say good madam let I see you face with this bold request olivium be not averse to comply for this haughty beauty whom the duke orsino have love so long in vain at first sight conceive a passion for the suppose page the humble cesario when viola ask to see she face olivium say have you any commission from you lord and master to negotiate with my face and then forget she determination to go veil for seven long year she draw aside she veil say but i will draw the curtain and shew the picture be it not well do viola reply it be beauty truly mix the red and white upon you cheek be by nature 's own cunning hand lay on you be the most cruel lady living if you will lead these grace to

though you be crown the queen of beauty : for orsino love you with adoration and with tear with groan that thunder love and sigh of fire you lord say olivium know well my mind i can not love he yet i doubt not he be virtuous i know he to be noble and of high estate of fresh and spotless youth all voice proclaim he learn courteous and valiant yet i can not love he he might have take he answer long ago if i do love you as my master do say viola i would make I a willow cabin at you gate and call upon you name i would write complain sonnet on olivium and sing they in the dead of the night you name should sound among the hill and i would make echo the babble gossip of the air cry out _ olivia _ o you should not rest between the element of earth and air but you should pity I you might do much say olivium : what be you parentage viola reply above my fortune yet my state be well i be a gentleman olivium now reluctantly dismiss viola say go to you master and tell he i can not love he let he send no more unless perchance you come again to tell I how he take it and viola depart bid the lady farewel by the name of fair cruelty when she be go olivia repeat the word _ above my fortune yet my state be well i be a gentleman _ and she say aloud i will be swear he be he tongue he face he limb action and spirit plainly shew he be a gentleman and then she wish cesario be the duke and perceive the fast hold he have take on she affection she blame herself for she sudden love : but the gentle blame which people lay upon they own fault have no deep root : and presently the noble lady olivium so far forget the inequality between she fortune and those of this seeming page as well as the maidenly reserve which be the chief ornament of a lady 's character that she resolve to court the love of young cesario and send a servant after he with a diamond ring under the pretence that he have leave it with she as a present from orsino she hope by thus artfully make cesario a present of the ring she should give he some intimation of she design and truly it do make viola suspect for know that orsino have send no ring by she she begin to recollect that olivium 's look and manner be expressive of admiration and she presently guess she master 's mistress have fall in love with she alas say she the poor lady might as well love a dream disguise i see be wicked for it have cause olivium to breathe as fruitless sigh for I as i do for orsino viola return to orsino 's palace and related to she lord the ill success of the negociation repeat the command of olivium that the duke should trouble she no more yet still the duke persist in hope that the gentle cesario would in time be able to persuade she to shew some pity and therefore he bid he he should go to she again the next day in the mean time to pass away the tedious interval he command a song which he love to be sing and he say my good cesario when i hear that song last night methought it do relieve my passion much mark it cesario it be old and plain the spinster and the knitter when they sit in the sun and the young maid that weave they thread with bone chaunt this song it be silly yet i love it for it tell of the innocence of love in the old time song come away come away death and in sad cypress let I be lay fly away fly away breath i be slay by a fair cruel maid my shroud of white stick all with yew o prepare

thousand thousand sigh to save lay I o where sad true lover never find my grave to weep there viola do not fail to mark the word of the old song which in such true simplicity describe the pang of unrequited love and she bear testimony in she countenance of feel what the song express she sad look be observe by orsino who say to she my life upon it cesario though you be so young you eye have look upon some face that it love have it not boy a little with you leave reply viola and what kind of woman and of what age be she say orsino of you age and of you complexion my lord say viola which

second visit to olivia she find no difficulty in gain access to she servant soon discover when they lady delight to converse with handsome young messenger and the instant viola arrive the gate be throw wide open and the duke 's page be shewn into olivium 's apartment with great respect and when viola tell olivium that she be come once more to plead in she lord 's behalf this lady say i desire you never to speak of he again but if you would undertake another suit i have rather hear you solicit than music from the sphere this be pretty plain speaking but olivia soon explain herself still more plainly and openly confess she love and when she see displeasure with perplexity express in viola 's face she say o what a deal of scorn look beautiful in the contempt and anger of he lip cesario by the rose of the spring by maidhood honor and by truth i love you so that in spite of you pride i have neither wit nor reason to conceal my passion but in vain the lady woo viola hasten from she presence threaten never more to come to plead orsino 's love and all the reply she make to olivium 's fond solicitation be a declaration of a resolution _ never to love any woman _ no sooner have viola leave the lady than a claim be make upon she valor a gentleman a reject suitor of olivium who have learn how that lady have favor the duke 's messenger challenge he to fight a duel what should poor viola do who though she carry a manlike outside have a true woman 's heart and fear to look on she own sword when she see she formidable rival advance towards she with he sword draw she begin to think of confess that she be a woman but she be relieve at once from she terror and the shame of such a discovery by a stranger that be pass by who make up to they and as if he have be long know to she and be she dearest friend say to she opponent if this young gentleman have do offence i will take the fault on I and if you offend he i will for he sake defy you before viola have time to thank he for he protection or to enquire the reason of he kind interference she new friend meet with a enemy where he bravery be of no use to he for the officer of justice come up in that instant apprehend the stranger in the duke 's name to answer for a offence he have commit some year before and he say to viola this come with seek you : and then he ask she for a purse say now my necessity make I ask for my purse and it grieve I much more for what i can not do for you than for what befall myself you stand amaze but be of comfort he word do indeed amaze viola and she protest she know he not nor have

ingratitude and unkindness he say this youth whom you see here i snatch from the jaw of death and for he sake alone i come to illyria and have fall into this danger but the officer care little for hearken to the complaint of they prisoner and they hurry he off say what be that to we and as he be carry away he call viola by the name of sebastian reproach the suppose sebastian for disown he friend as long as he be within hearing when viola hear herself call sebastian though the stranger be take away too hastily for she to ask a explanation she conjecture that this seem mystery might arise from she be mistake for she brother and she begin to cherish hope that it be she brother whose life this man say he have preserve and so indeed it be the stranger whose name be anthonio be a sea-captain he have take sebastian up into he ship when almost exhaust with fatigue he be float on the mast to which he have fasten himself in the storm anthonio conceive such a friendship for sebastian that he resolve to accompany he whithersoever he go and when the youth express a curiosity to visit orsino 's court anthonio rather than part from he come to illyria though he know if he person should be know there he life would be in danger because in a sea-fight he have once dangerously wound the duke orsino 's nephew this be the offence for which he be now make a prisoner anthonio and sebastian have land together but a few hour before anthonio meet viola he have give he purse to sebastian desire he to use it freely if he see any thing he wish to purchase tell he he would wait at the inn while sebastian go to view the town : but sebastian not return at the time appoint anthonio have venture out to look for he and viola be dress the same and in face so exactly resemble she brother anthonio draw he sword -lrb- as he think -rrb- in defense of the youth he have save and when sebastian -lrb- as he suppose -rrb- disown he and deny he he own purse no wonder he accuse he of ingratitude viola when anthonio be go fear a second invitation to fight slunk home as fast as she could she have not be long go when she adversary think he see she return but it be she brother sebastian who happen to arrive at this place and he say now sir have i meet with you again there be for you and strike he a blow sebastian be no coward he return the blow with interest and draw he sword a lady now put a stop to this duel for olivium come out of the house and she too mistake sebastian for cesario invite he to come into she house express much sorrow at the rude attack he have meet with though sebastian be as much surprised at the courtesy of this lady as at the rudeness of he unknown foe yet he go very willingly into the house and olivium be delighted to find cesario -lrb- as she think he -rrb- become more sensible of she attention for though they feature be exactly the same there be none of the contempt and anger to be see in he face which she have complain of when she tell she love to cesario sebastian do not at all object to the fondness the lady lavish on he he seem to take it in very good part yet he wonder how it have come to pass and he be rather incline to think olivium be not in she right sens but perceive that she be mistress of a fine house and that she order she affair and seem to govern she family discreetly and that in all but she sudden love for he she appear in the full possession of she reason he well approve of the courtship and olivium finding cesario in this good humor and fear he might change he mind propose that as she have a priest in the house they should be instantly marry sebastian assent to this proposal and when the marriage-ceremony be over he leave he lady for a short time intend to go and tell he friend anthonio the good fortune that he have meet with in the mean time orsino come to visit olivium and at the moment he arrive before olivium 's house the officer of justice bring they prisoner anthonio before the duke viola be with orsino she master and when anthonio saw viola whom he still imagine to be sebastian he tell the duke in what manner he have rescue this youth from the peril of the sea and after fully relate all the kindness he have really shewn to sebastian he end he complaint by say that for three month both day and night this ungrateful youth have be with he but now the lady olivium come forth from she house the duke could no longer attend to anthonio 's story and he say here come the countess : now heaven walk on earth but for thee fellow thy word be madness three month have this youth attend on I : and then he order anthonio to be take aside but orsino 's heavenly countess soon give the duke cause to accuse cesario as much of ingratitude as anthonio have do for all the word he could hear olivia speak be word of kindness to cesario : and when he find he page have obtain this high place in olivium 's favor he threaten he with all the terror of he just revenge and as he be go to depart he call viola to follow he say come boy with I my thought be ripe for mischief though it seem in he jealous rage he be go to doom viola to instant death yet she love make she no longer a coward and she say she would most joyfully suffer death to give she master ease but olivium would not so lose she husband and she cry where go my cesario viola reply after he i love more than my life olivium however prevent they departure by loudly proclaim that cesario be she husband and send for the priest who declare that not two hour have pass since he have marry the lady olivium to this young man in vain viola protest she be not marry to olivia the evidence of that lady and the priest make orsino believe that he page have rob he of the treasure he prize above he life but think that it be past recall he be bid farewel to he faithless mistress and the _ young dissembler _ she husband as he call viola warn she never to come in he sight again when -lrb- as it seem to they -rrb- a miracle appear for another cesario enter and address olivium as he wife this new cesario be sebastian the real husband of olivium and when they wonder have a little cease at see two person with the same face the same voice and the same habit the brother and sister begin to question each other for viola could scarce be persuade that she brother be live and sebastian know not how to account for the sister he suppose drown be find in the habit of a young man but viola presently acknowledge that she be indeed viola and he sister under that disguise when all the error be clear up which the extreme likeness between this twin brother and sister have occasion they laugh at the lady olivium for the pleasant mistake she have make in fall in love with a woman and olivium shew no dislike to she exchange when she find she have wed the brother instead of the sister the hope of orsino be for ever at a end by this marriage of olivium and with he hope all he fruitless love seem to vanish away and all he thought be fix on the event of he favorite young cesario be change into a fair lady he view viola with great attention and he remember how very handsome he have always think cesario be and he conclude she would look very beautiful in a woman 's attire and then he remember how often she have say _ she love he _ which at the time seem only the dutiful expression of a faithful page but now he guess that something more be mean for many of she pretty saying which be like riddle to he come now into he mind and he no sooner remembered all these thing than he resolve to make viola he wife and he say to she -lrb- he still could not help call she _ cesario _ and _ boy _ -rrb- boy you have say to I a thousand time that you should never love a woman like to I and for the faithful service you have do for I so much beneath you soft and tender breeding and since you have call I master so long you shall now be you master 's mistress and orsino 's true duchess olivium perceive orsino be make over that heart which she have so ungraciously reject to viola invite they to enter she house and offer the assistance of the good priest who have marry she to sebastian in the morning to perform the same ceremony in the remain part of the day for orsino and viola thus the twin brother and sister be both wed on the same day : the storm and shipwreck which have separate they be the means of bring to pass they high and mighty fortune viola be the wife of orsino the duke of illyrium and sebastian the husband of the rich and noble countess the lady olivia timon of athen -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- timon a lord of athen in the enjoyment of a princely fortune affect a humor of liberality which know no limit he almost infinite wealth could not flow in so fast but he pour it out faster upon all sort and degree of people not the poor only taste of he bounty but great lord do not disdain to rank themselves among he dependant and follower he table be resort to by all the luxurious feaster and he house be open to all comer and goer at athen he large wealth combine with he free and prodigal nature to subdue all heart to he love man of all mind and disposition tender they service to lord timon from the glass-faced flatterer whose face reflect as in a mirror the present humor of he patron to the rough and unbending cynic who affect a contempt of man 's person and a indifference to worldly thing yet could not stand out against the gracious manners and munificent soul of lord timon but would come -lrb- against he nature -rrb- to partake of he royal entertainment and return most rich in he own estimation if he have receive a nod or a salutation from timon if a poet have compose a work which want a recommendatory introduction to the world he have no more to do but to dedicate it to lord timon and the poem be sure of sale besides a present purse from the patron and daily access to he house and table if a painter have a picture to dispose of he have only to take it to lord timon and pretend to consult he taste as to the merit of it nothing more be want to persuade the liberal-hearted lord to buy it if a jeweller have a stone of price or a mercer rich costly stuff which for they costliness lay upon he hand lord timon 's house be a ready mart always open where they might get off they wares or they jewellery at any price and the good natured lord would thank they into the bargain as if they have do he a piece of courtesy in let he have the refusal of such precious commodity so that by this mean he house be throng with superfluous purchase of no use but to swell uneasy and ostentatious pomp and he person be still more inconveniently beset with a crowd of these idle visitor lie poet painter shark tradesman lord lady needy courtier and expectant who continually fill he lobby rain they fulsome flattery in whisper in he ear sacrifice to he with adulation as to a god make sacred the very stirrup by which he mount he horse and seem as though they drink the free air but through he permission and bounty some of these daily dependent be young man of birth who -lrb- they means not answer to they extravagance -rrb- have be put in prison by creditor and redeem thence by lord timon these young prodigal thenceforward fasten upon he lordship as if by common sympathy he be necessarily endear to all such spendthrift and loose liver who not be able to follow he in he wealth find it easier to copy he in prodigality and copious spending of what be not they own one of these flesh-fly be ventidius for whose debt unjustly contract timon but lately have pay down the sum of five talent but among this confluence this great flood of visitor none be more conspicuous than the maker of present and giver of gift it be fortunate for these man if timon take a fancy to a dog or a horse or any piece of cheap furniture which be theirs the thing so praise whatever it be be sure to be send the next morning with the compliment of the giver for lord timon 's acceptance and apology for the unworthiness of the gift and this dog or horse or whatever it might be do not fail to produce from timon 's bounty who would not be outdo in gift perhaps twenty dog or horse certainly present of far richer worth as these pretended donor know well enough and that they false present be but the put out of so much money at large and speedy interest in this way lord lucius have lately send to timon a present of four milk-white horse trap in silver which this cunning lord have observe timon upon some occasion to commend and another lord lucullus have bestow upon he in the same pretended way of free gift a brace of greyhound whose make and fleetness timon have be hear to admire these present the easy-hearted lord accept without suspicion of the dishonest view of the presenter : and the giver of course be reward with some rich return a diamond or some jewel of twenty time the value of they false and mercenary donation sometimes these creature would go to work in a more direct way and with gross and palpable artifice which yet the credulous timon be too blind to see would affect to admire and praise something that timon possess a bargain that he have buy or some late purchase which be sure to draw from this yielding and soft-hearted lord a gift of the thing commend for no service in the world do for it but the easy expence of a little cheap and obvious flattery in this way timon but the other day have give to one of these mean lord the bay courser which he himself ride upon because he lordship have be please to say that it be a handsome beast and go well and timon know that no man ever justly praise what he do not wish to possess for lord timon weigh he friend ' affection with he own and so fond be he of bestow that he could have deal kingdom to these suppose friend and never have be weary not that timon 's wealth all go to enrich these wicked flatterer he could do noble and praise-worthy action and when a servant of he once love the daughter of a rich athenian but could not hope to obtain she by reason that in wealth and rank the maid be so far above he lord timon freely bestow upon he servant three athenian talent to make he fortune equal with the dowry which the father of the young maid demand of he who should be she husband but for the most part knave and parasite have the command of he fortune false friend whom he do not know to be such but because they flock around he person he think they must need love he and because they smile and flatter he he think surely that he conduct be approve by all the wise and good and when he be feast in the midst of all these flatterer and mock friend when they be eat he up and drain he fortune dry with large draught of richest wine drunk to he health and prosperity he could not perceive the difference of a friend from a flatterer but to he deluded eye -lrb- make proud with the sight -rrb- it seem a precious comfort to have so many like brother command one another 's fortune -lrb- though it be he own fortune which pay all the cost -rrb- and with joy they would run over at the spectacle of such as it appear to he truly festive and fraternal meeting but while he thus outgo the very heart of kindness and pour out he bounty as if plutus the god of gold have be but he steward while thus he proceed without care or stop so senseless of expence that he would neither enquire how he could maintain it nor cease he wild flow of riot he riches which be not infinite must need melt away before a prodigality which know no limit but who should tell he so he flatterer they have a interest in shut he eye in vain do he honest steward flavius try to represent to he he condition lay he account before he beg of he pray of he with a importunity that on any other occasion would have be unmannerly in a servant beseech he with tear to look into the state of he affair timon would still put he off and turn the discourse to something else for nothing be so deaf to remonstrance as riches turn to poverty nothing be so unwilling to believe its situation nothing so incredulous to its own true state and hard to give credit to a reverse often have this good steward this honest creature when all the room of timon 's great house have be choke up with riotous feeder at he master 's cost when the floor have weep with drunken spilling of wine and every apartment have blaze with light and resound with music and feast often have he retire by himself to some solitary spot and weep faster than the wine run from the wasteful cask within to see the mad bounty of he lord and to think when the means be go which buy he praise from all sort of people how quickly the breath would be go of which the praise be make praise win in feast would be lose in fasting and at one cloud of winter-shower these fly would disappear but now the time be come that timon could shut he ear no longer to the representation of this faithful steward money must be have and when he order flavius to sell some of he land for that purpose flavius inform he what he have in vain endeavor at several time before to make he listen to that most of he land be already sell or forfeit and that all he possess at present be not enough to pay the one half of what he owe strike with wonder at this presentation timon hastily reply my land extend from athen to lacedemon o my good lord say flavius the world be but a world and have bound be it all yours to give in a breath how quickly be it go timon console himself that no villainous bounty have yet come from he that if he have give he wealth away unwisely it have not be bestow to feed he vice but to cherish he friend and he bid the kind-hearted steward -lrb- who be weep -rrb- to take comfort in the assurance that he master could never lack means while he have so many noble friend and this infatuated lord persuade himself that he have nothing to do but to send and borrow to use every man 's fortune -lrb- that have ever taste he bounty -rrb- in this extremity as freely as he own then with a cheerful look as if confident of the trial he severally dispatch messenger to lord lucius to lord lucullus and sempronius man upon whom he have lavish he gift in past time without measure or moderation and to ventidius whom he have lately release out of prison by pay he debt and who by the death of he father be now come into the possession of a ample fortune and well enable to requite timon 's courtesy to request of ventidius the return of those five talent which he have pay for he and of each of those noble lord the loan of fifty talent : nothing doubt that they gratitude would supply he want -lrb- if he need it -rrb- to the amount of five hundred time fifty talent lucullus be the first apply to this mean lord have be dream over-night of a silver bason and cup and when timon 's servant be announce he sordid mind suggest to he that this be surely a make out of he dream and that timon have send he such a present : but when he understand the truth of the matter and that timon want money the quality of he faint and watery friendship shew itself for with many protestation he vow to the servant that he have long foresee the ruin of he master 's affair and many a time have he come to dinner to tell he of it and have come again to supper to try to persuade he to spend less but he would take no counsel nor warning by he come : and true it be that he have be a constant attender -lrb- as he say -rrb- at timon 's feast as he have in greater thing taste he bounty but that he ever come with that intent or give good counsel or reproof to timon be a base unworthy lie which he suitably follow up with meanly offer the servant a bribe to go home to he master and tell he that he have not find lucullus at home as little success have the messenger who be send to lord lucius this lie lord who be full of timon 's meat and enriched almost to burst with timon 's costly present when he find the wind change and the fountain of so much bounty suddenly stopt at first could hardly believe it but on its be confirm he affect great regret that he should not have it in he power to serve lord timon for unfortunately -lrb- which be a base falsehood -rrb- he have make a great purchase the day before which have quite disfurnished he of the means at present the more beast he he call himself to put it out of he power to serve so good a friend and he count it one of he greatest affliction that he ability should fail he to pleasure such a honorable gentleman who can call any man friend that dip in the same dish with he just of this metal be every flatterer in the recollection of every body timon have be a father to this lucius have keep up he credit with he purse timon 's money have go to pay the wages of he servant to pay the hire of the labourer who have sweat to build the fine house which lucius 's pride have make necessary to he : yet oh the monster which man make himself when he prove ungrateful this lucius now deny to timon a sum which in respect of what timon have bestow on he be less than charitable man afford to beggar sempronius and every one of these mercenary lord to whom timon apply in they turn return the same evasive answer or direct denial even ventidius the redeem and now rich ventidius refuse to assist he with those five talent which timon have not lend but generously give he in he distress now be timon as much avoid in he poverty as he have be court and resort to in he riches now the same tongue which have be loudest in he praise extol he as bountiful liberal and open-handed be not ashamed to censure that very bounty as folly that liberality as profuseness though it have shew itself folly in nothing so truly as in the selection of such unworthy creature as themselves for its object now be timon 's princely mansion forsake and become a shun and hate place a place for man to pass by not a place as formerly where every passenger must stop and taste of he wine and good cheer now instead of be throng with feast and tumultuous guest it be beset with impatient and clamorous creditor usurer extortioner fierce and intolerable in they demand plead bond interest mortgage iron-hearted man that would take no denial nor put off that timon 's house be now he jail where he could not pass nor go in nor out for they one demand he due of fifty talent another bringing in a bill of five thousand crown which if he would tell out he blood by drop and pay they so he have not enough in he body to discharge drop by drop in this desperate and irremediable state -lrb- as it seem -rrb- of he affair the eye of all man be suddenly surprise at a new and incredible lustre which this set sun put forth once more lord timon proclaim a feast to which he invite he accustomed guest lord lady all that be great or fashionable in athen lord lucius and lucullus come ventidius sempronius and the rest who more sorry now than these fawn wretch when they find -lrb- as they think -rrb- that lord timon 's poverty be all pretence and have be only put on to make trial of they love to think that they should not have see through the artifice at the time and have have the cheap credit of oblige he lordship yet who more glad to find the fountain of that noble bounty which they have think dry up still fresh and run they come dissemble protest express deepest sorrow and shame that when he lordship send to they they should have be so unfortunate as to want the present means to oblige so honorable a friend but timon beg they not to give such trifle a thought for he have altogether forget it and these base fawn lord though they have deny he money in he adversity yet could not refuse they presence at this new blaze of he return prosperity for the swallow follow not summer more willingly than man of these disposition follow the good fortune of the great nor more willingly leave winter than these shrink from the first appearance of a reverse such summer-bird be man but now with music and state the banquet of smoking dish be serve up and when the guest have a little do admiring whence the bankrupt timon could find means to furnish so costly a feast some doubt whether the scene which they see be real as scarce trust they own eye at a signal give the dish be uncovered and timon 's drift appear : instead of those variety and far-fetched dainty which they expect that timon 's epicurean table in past time have so liberally present now appear under the cover of these dish a preparation more suitable to timon 's poverty nothing but a little smoke and luke-warm water fit feast for this knot of mouth-friend whose profession be indeed smoke and they heart luke-warm and slippery as the water with which timon welcome he astonished guest bid they uncover dog and lap and before they could recover they surprise sprinkle it in they face that they might have enough and throw dish and all after they who now run huddle out lord lady with they cap snatch up in haste a splendid confusion timon pursue they still call they what they be smooth smile parasite destroyer under the mask of courtesy affable wolf meek bear fool of fortune feast-friend

mad lord and the ridicule of he mock banquet this be the last feast which ever timon make and in it he take farewell of athen and the society of man for after that he betake himself to the wood turn he back upon the hate city and upon all mankind wish the wall of that detestable city might sink and the house fall upon they owner wish all plague which infest humanity war outrage poverty disease might fasten upon its inhabitant pray the just god to confound all athenian both young and old high and low so wish he go to the wood where he say he should find the unkindest beast much kinder than those of he own species he strip himself naked that he might retain no fashion of a man and dig a cave to live in and live solitary in the manner of a beast eat the wild root and drinking water fly from the face of he kind and choose rather to herd with wild beast as more harmless and friendly than man what a change from lord timon the rich lord timon the delight of mankind to timon the naked timon the manhater where be he flatterer now where be he attendant and retinue would the bleak air that boisterous servitor be he chamberlain to put he shirt on warm would those stiff tree that have outlive the eagle turn young and airy page to he to skip on he errand when he bid they would the cool brook when it be iced with winter administer to he he warm broth and caudle when sick of a over-night 's surfeit or would the creature that live in those wild wood come and lick he hand and flatter he here on a day when he be digging for root he poor sustenance he spade strike against something heavy which prove to be gold a great heap which some miser have probably bury in a time of alarm think to have come again and take it from its prison but die before the opportunity have arrive without make any man privy to the concealment so it lay do neither good nor harm in the bowels of the earth its mother as if it have never come from thence till the accidental striking of timon 's spade against it once more bring it to light here be a mass of treasure which if timon have retain he old mind be enough to have purchase he friend and flatterer again but timon be sick of the false world and the sight of gold be poisonous to he eye and he would have restore it to the earth but that thinking of the infinite calamity which by means of gold happen to mankind how the lucre of it cause robbery oppression injustice bribery violence and murder among man he have a pleasure in imagine -lrb- such a rooted hatred do he bear to he species -rrb- that out of this heap which in digging he have discover might arise some mischief to plague mankind and some soldier pass through the wood near to he cave at that instant which prove to be a part of the troops of the athenian captain alcibiade who upon some disgust take against the senator of athen -lrb- the athenian be ever note to be a thankless and ungrateful people give disgust to they general and best friend -rrb- be march at the head of the same triumphant army which he have formerly head in they defense to war against they timon who like they business well bestow upon they captain the gold to pay he soldier require no other service from he than that he should with he conquer army lay athen level with the ground and burn slay kill all she inhabitant not spare the old man for they white beard for -lrb- he say -rrb- they be usurer nor the young child for they seeming innocent smile for those -lrb- he say -rrb- would live if they grow up to be traitor but to steel he eye and ear against any sight or sound that might awaken compassion and not to let the cry of virgin babe or mother hinder he from make one universal massacre of the city but to confound they all in he conquest and when he have conquer he pray that the god would confound he also the conqueror : so thoroughly do timon hate athen athenian and all mankind while he live in this forlorn state lead a life more brutal than human he be suddenly surprised one day with the appearance of a man standing in a admiring posture at the door of he cave it be flavius the honest steward whom love and zealous affection to he master have lead to seek he out at he wretched dwelling and to offer he service and the first sight of he master the once noble timon in that abject condition naked as he be bear living in the manner of a beast among beast look like he own sad ruin and a monument of decay so affect this good servant that he stand speechless wrapt up in horror and confound and when he find utterance at last to he word they be so choaked with tear that timon have much ado to know he again or to make out who it be that have come -lrb- so contrary to the experience he have have of mankind -rrb- to offer he service in extremity and be in the form and shape of a man he suspect he for a traitor and he tear for false but the good servant by so many token confirm the truth of he fidelity and make it clear that nothing but love and zealous duty to he once dear master have bring he there that timon be force to confess that the world contain one honest man yet be in the shape and form of a man he could not look upon he man 's face without abhorrence or hear word utter from he man 's lip without loathing and this singly honest man be force to depart because he be a man and because with a heart more gentle and compassionate than be usual to man he bear man 's detested form and outward feature but greater visitant than a poor steward be about to interrupt the savage quiet of timon 's solitude for now the day be come when the ungrateful lord of athen sorely repent the injustice which they have do to the noble timon for alcibiade like a incensed wild boar be rage at the wall of they city and with he hot siege threaten to lay fair athen in the dust and now the memory of lord timon 's former prowess and military conduct come fresh into they forgetful mind for timon have be they general in past time and be a valiant and expert soldier who alone of all the athenian be deem able to cope with a besiege army such as then threaten they or to drive back the furious approach of alcibiade a deputation of the senator be choose in this emergency to wait upon timon to he they come in they extremity to whom when he be in extremity they have shewn but small regard as if they presume upon he gratitude whom they have disoblige and have derive a claim to he courtesy from they own most discourteous and unpiteous treatment now they earnestly beseech he implore he with tear to return and save that city from which they ingratitude have so lately drive he now they offer he riches power dignity satisfaction for past injury and public honor and the public love they person life and fortune to be at he disposal if he will but come back and save they but timon the naked timon the man-hater be no longer lord timon the lord of bounty the flower of valor they defense in war they ornament in peace if alcibiade kill he countryman timon care not if he sack fair athen and slew she old man and she infant timon would rejoice so he tell they and that there be not a knife in the unruly camp which he do not prize above the reverendest throat in athen this be all the answer he vouchsafe to the weep disappointed senator only at parting he bid they commend he to he countryman and tell they that to ease they of they grief and anxiety and to prevent the consequence of fierce alcibiade ' wrath there be yet a way leave which he would teach they for he have yet so much affection leave for he dear countryman as to be willing to do they a kindness before he death these word a little revive the senator who hope that he kindness for they city be return then timon tell they that he have a tree which grow near he cave which he should shortly have occasion to cut down and he invite all he friend in athen high or low of what degree soever who wish to shun affliction to come and take a taste of he tree before he cut it down meaning that they might come and hang themselves on it and escape affliction that way and this be the last courtesy of all he noble bounty which timon shew to mankind and this the last sight of he which he countryman have : for not many day after a poor soldier passing by the sea-beach which be at a little distance from the wood which timon frequented find a tomb on the verge of the sea with a inscription upon it purport that it be the grave of timon the man-hater who while he live do hate all live man and die wish a plague might consume all caitiff leave whether he finish he life by violence or whether mere distaste of life and the loathing he have for mankind bring timon to he conclusion be not clear yet all man admire the fitness of he epitaph and the consistency of he end die as he have live a hater of mankind : and some there be who fancy a conceit in the very choice which he have make of the sea-beach for he place of burial where the vast sea might weep for ever upon he grave as in contempt of the transient and shallow tear of hypocritical and deceitful mankind romeo and juliet -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- the two chief family in verona be the rich capulet and the mountague there have be a old quarrel between these family which be grow to such a height and so deadly be the enmity between they that it extend to the remotest kindred to the follower and retainer of both side insomuch that a servant of the house of mountague could not meet a servant of the house of capulet nor a capulet encounter with a mountague by chance but fierce word and sometimes bloodsh ensue and frequent be the brawl from such accidental meeting which disturb the happy quiet of verona 's street old lord capulet make a great supper to which many fair lady and many noble guest be invite all the admire beauty of verona be present and all comer be make welcome if they be not of the house of mountague at this feast of capulet rosaline beloved of romeo son to the old lord mountague be present and though it be dangerous for a mountague to be see in this assembly yet benvolio a friend of romeo persuade the young lord to go to this assembly in the disguise of a mask that he might see he rosaline and see she compare she with some choice beauty of verona who -lrb- he say -rrb- would make he think he swan a crow romeo have small faith in benvolio 's word nevertheless for the love of rosaline he be persuade to go for romeo be a sincere and passionate lover and one that lose he sleep for love and flee society to be alone think on rosaline who disdain he and never requite he love with the least show of courtesy or affection and benvolio wish to cure he friend of this love by shew he diversity of lady and company to this feast of capulet then young romeo with benvolio and they friend mercutio go mask old capulet bid they welcome and tell they that lady who have they toe unplagued with corn would dance with they and the old man be light-hearted and merry and say that he have wear a mask when he be young and could have tell a whisper tale in a fair lady 's ear and they fall to dancing and romeo be suddenly strike with the exceed beauty of a lady who dance there who seem to he to teach the torch to burn bright and she beauty to shew by night like a rich jewel worn by a blackamoor : beauty too rich for use too dear for earth like a snowy dive troop with crow -lrb- he say -rrb- so richly do she beauty and perfection shine above the lady she companion while he utter these praise he be overhear by tybalt a nephew of lord capulet who know he by he voice to be romeo and this tybalt being of a fiery and passionate temper could not endure that a mountague should come under cover of a mask to fleer and scorn -lrb- as he say -rrb- at they solemnity and he storm and rage exceedingly and would have strike young romeo dead but he uncle the old lord capulet would not suffer he to do any injury at that time both out of respect to he guest and because romeo have bear himself like a gentleman and all tongue in verona brag of he to be a virtuous and well-governed youth tybalt force to be patient against he will restrain himself but swear that this vile mountague should at another time dearly pay for he intrusion the dancing be do romeo watch the place where the lady stand and under favor of he mask habit which might seem to excuse in part the liberty he presume in the gentlest manner to take she by the hand call it a shrine which if he prophan by touch it he be a blush pilgrim and would kiss it for atonement good pilgrim answer the lady you devotion shew by far too mannerly and too courtly : saint have hand which pilgrim may touch but kiss not have not saint lip and pilgrim too say romeo aye say the lady lip which they must use in prayer o then my dear saint say romeo hear my prayer and grant it lest i despair in such like allusion and loving conceit they be engage when the lady be call away to she mother and romeo enquire who she mother be discover that the lady whose peerless beauty he be so much strike with be young juliet daughter and heir to the lord capulet the great enemy of the mountague and that he have unknowingly engage he heart to he foe this trouble he but it could not dissuade he from love as little rest have juliet when she find that the gentleman that she have be talk with be romeo and a mountague for she have be suddenly smit with the same hasty and inconsiderate passion for romeo which he have conceive for she and a prodigious birth of love it seem to she that she must love she enemy and that she affection should settle there where family consideration should induce she chiefly to hate it be midnight romeo with he companion depart but they soon miss he for unable to stay away from the house where he have leave he heart he leap the wall of a orchard which be at the back of juliet 's house here he have not be long ruminate on he new love when juliet appear above at a window through which she exceed beauty seem to break like the light of the sun in the east and the moon which shine in the orchard with a faint light appear to romeo as if sick and pale with grief at the superior lustre of this new sun and she lean she hand upon she cheek he passionately wish himself a glove upon that hand that he might touch she cheek she all this while think herself alone fetch a deep sigh and exclaim ah I romeo enrapture to hear she speak say softly and unheard by she o speak again bright angel for such you appear be over my head like a winged messenger from heaven whom mortal fall back to gaze upon she unconscious of be overhear and full of the new passion which that night 's adventure have give birth to call upon she lover by name -lrb- whom she suppose absent -rrb- : o romeo romeo say she wherefore art thou romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name for my sake or if thou wilt not be but my swear love and i no longer will be a capulet romeo have this encouragement would fain have speak but he be desirous of hear more and the lady continue she passionate discourse with herself -lrb- as she think -rrb- still chide romeo for be romeo and a mountague and wish he some other name or that he would put away that hate name and for that name which be no part of himself he should take all herself at this loving word romeo could no longer refrain but take up the dialogue as if she word have be address to he personally and not merely in fancy he bid she call he love or by whatever other name she please for he be no longer romeo if that name be displease to she juliet alarm to hear a man 's voice in the garden do not at first know who it be that by favor of the night and darkness have thus stumble upon the discovery of she secret but when he speak again though she ear have not yet drunk a hundred word of that tongue 's utter yet so nice be a lover 's hearing that she immediately know he to be young romeo and she expostulate with he on the danger to which he have expose himself by climb the orchard wall for if any of she kinsman should find he there it would be death to he be a mountague alack say romeo there be more peril in you eye than in twenty of they sword do you but look kind upon I lady and i be proof against they enmity better my life should be end by they hate than that hate life should be prolong to live without you love how come you into this place say juliet and by whose direction love direct I answer romeo : i be no pilot yet wert thou as far apart from I as that vast shore which be wash with the farthest sea i should adventure for such merchandize a crimson blush come over juliet 's face yet unseen by romeo by reason of the night when she reflect upon the discovery which she have make yet not mean to make it of she love to romeo she would fain have recall she word but that be impossible : fain would she have stand upon form and have keep she lover at a distance as the custom of discreet lady be to frown and be perverse and give they suitor harsh denial at first to stand off and affect a coyness or indifference where they most love that they lover may not think they too lightly or too easily win : for the difficulty of attainment increase the value of the object but there be no room in she case for denial or putting off or any of the customary art of delay and protracted courtship romeo have hear from she own tongue when she do not dream that he be near she a confession of she love so with a honest frankness which the novelty of she situation excuse she confirm the truth of what he have before hear and address he by the name of _ fair mountague _ -lrb- love can sweeten a sour name -rrb- she beg he not to impute she easy yield to levity or a unworthy mind but that he must lay the fault of it -lrb- if it be a fault -rrb- upon the accident of the night which have so strangely discover she thought and she add that though she behavior to he might not be sufficiently prudent measure by the custom of she sex yet that she would prove more true than many whose prudence be dissemble and they modesty artificial cunning romeo be begin to call the heaven to witness that nothing be farther from he thought than to impute a shadow of dishonor to such a honor lady when she stop he beg he not to swear for although she joy in he yet she have no joy of that night 's contract it be too rash too unadvised too sudden but he be urgent with she to exchange a vow of love with he that night she say that she already have give he hers before he request it mean when he overhear she confession but she would retract what she then bestow for the pleasure of give it again for she bounty be as infinite as the sea and she love as deep from this loving conference she be call away by she nurse who sleep with she and think it time for she to be in bed for it be near to day-break but hastily return she say three or four word more to romeo the purport of which be that if he love be indeed honorable and he purpose marriage she would send a messenger to he to-morrow to appoint a time for they marriage when she would lay all she fortune at he foot and follow he as she lord through the world while they be settle this point juliet be repeatedly call for by she nurse and go in and return and go and return again for she seem as jealous of romeo go from she as a young girl of she bird which she will let hop a little from she hand and pluck it back with a silken thread and romeo be as loth to part as she : for the sweetest music to lover be the sound of each other 's tongue at night but at last they part wish mutually sweet sleep and rest for that night the day be break when they part and romeo who be too full of thought of he mistress and that bless meeting to allow he to sleep instead of go home bent he course to a monastery hard by to find friar lawrence the good friar be already up at he devotions but see young romeo abroad so early he conjecture rightly that he have not be a-bed that night but that some distemper of youthful affection have keep he wake he be right in impute the cause of romeo 's wakefulness to love but he make a wrong guess at the object for he think that he love for rosaline have keep he wake but when romeo reveal he new passion for juliet and request the assistance of the friar to marry they that day the holy man lift up he eye and hand in a sort of wonder at the sudden change in romeo 's affection for he have be privy to all romeo 's love for rosaline and he many complaint of she disdain and he say that young man 's love lay not truly in they heart but in they eye but romeo reply that he himself have often chidden he for dote on rosaline who could not love he again whereas juliet both loved and be beloved by he the friar assent in some measure to he reason and think that a matrimonial alliance between young juliet and romeo might happily be a means of make up the long breach between the capulet and the mountague which no one more lament than this good friar who be a friend to both the family and have often interpose he mediation to make up the quarrel without effect partly move by policy and partly by he fondness for young romeo to whom he could deny nothing the old man consent to join they hand in marriage now be romeo blest indeed and juliet who know he intent from a messenger which she have dispatch accord to promise do not fail to be early at the cell of friar lawrence where they hand be join in holy marriage the good friar pray the heaven to smile upon that act and in the union of this young mountague and young capulet to bury the old strife and long dissension of they family the ceremony be over juliet hasten home where she staid impatient for the come of night at which time romeo promise to come and meet she in the orchard where they have meet the night before and the time between seem as tedious to she as the night before some great festival seem to a impatient child that have get new finery which it may not put on till the morning that same day about noon romeo 's friend benvolio and mercutio walk through the street of verona be meet by a party of the capulet with the impetuous tybalt at they head this be the same angry tybalt who would have fight with romeo at old lord capulet 's feast he see mercutio accuse he bluntly of associate with romeo a mountague mercutio who have as much fire and youthful blood in he as tybalt reply to this accusation with some sharpness and in spite of all benvolio could say to moderate they wrath a quarrel be begin when romeo himself pass that way the fierce tybalt turn from mercutio to romeo and give he the disgraceful appellation of villain romeo wish to avoid a quarrel with tybalt above all man because he be the kinsman of juliet and much beloved by she besides this young mountague have never thoroughly enter into the family quarrel be by nature wise and gentle and the name of a capulet which be he dear lady 's name be now rather a charm to allay resentment than a watch-word to excite fury so he try to reason with tybalt whom he salute mildly by the name of _ good capulet _ as if he though a mountague have some secret pleasure in utter that name : but tybalt who hate all mountague as he hate hell would hear no reason but draw he weapon and mercutio who know not of romeo 's secret motive for desire peace with tybalt but look upon he present forbearance as a sort of calm dishonourable submission with many disdainful word provoke tybalt to the prosecution of he first quarrel with he and tybalt and mercutio fight till mercutio fall receive he death 's wound while romeo and benvolio be vainly endeavor to part the combatant mercutio be dead romeo keep he temper no longer but return the scornful appellation of villain which tybalt have give he and they fight till tybalt be slay by romeo this deadly broil fall out in the midst of verona at noonday the news of it quickly bring a crowd of citizen to the spot and among they the old lord capulet and mountague with they wife and soon after arrive the prince himself who be relate to mercutio whom tybalt have slay and have have the peace of he government often disturb by these brawl of mountague and capulet come determine to put the law in strictest force against those who should be find to be offender benvolio who have be eye-witness to the fray be command by the prince to relate the origin of it which he do keep as near the truth as he could without injury to romeo softening and excuse the part which he friend take in it lady capulet whose extreme grief for the loss of she kinsman tybalt make she keep no bound in she revenge exhort the prince to do strict justice upon he murderer and to pay no attention to benvolio 's representation who be romeo 's friend and a mountague speak partially thus she plead against she new son-in-law but she know not yet that he be she son-in-law and juliet 's husband on the other hand be to be see lady mountague plead for she child 's life and argue with some justice that romeo have do nothing worthy of punishment in take the life of tybalt which be already forfeit to the law by he have slay mercutio the prince unmoved by the passionate exclamation of these woman on a careful examination of the fact pronounce he sentence and by that sentence romeo be banish from verona heavy news to young juliet who have be but a few hour a bride and now by this decree seem everlastingly divorce when the tiding reach she she at first give way to rage against romeo who have slay she dear cousin : she call he a beautiful tyrant a fiend angelical a ravenous dive a lamb with a wolf 's nature a serpent-heart hide with a flowering face and other like contradictory name which denote the struggle in she mind between she love and she resentment : but in the end love get the mastery and the tear which she shed for grief that romeo have slay she cousin turn to drop of joy that she husband live whom tybalt would have slay then come fresh tear and they be altogether of grief for romeo 's banishment that word be more terrible to she than the death of many tybalt romeo after the fray have take refuge in friar lawrence 's cell where he be first make acquaint with the prince 's sentence which seem to he far more terrible than death to he it appear there be no world out of verona 's wall no living out of the sight of juliet heaven be there where juliet live and all beyond be purgatory torture hell the good friar would have apply the consolation of philosophy to he grief but this frantic young man would hear of none but like a madman he tear he hair and throw himself all along upon the ground as he say to take the measure of he grave from this unseemly state he be rouse by a message from he dear lady which a little revive he and then the friar take the advantage to expostulate with he on the unmanly weakness which he have show he have slay tybalt but would he also slay himself slay he dear lady who live but in he life the noble form of man he say be but a shape of wax when it want the courage which should keep it firm the law have be lenient to he that instead of death which he have incur have pronounce by the prince 's mouth only banishment he have slay tybalt but tybalt would have slay he : there be a sort of happiness in that juliet be alive and -lrb- beyond all hope -rrb- have become he dear wife therein he be most happy all these blessing as the friar make they out to be do romeo put from he like a sullen misbehaved wench and the friar bid he beware for such as despaired -lrb- he say -rrb- die miserable then when romeo be a little calm he counsel he that he should go that night and secretly take he leave of juliet and thence proceed straitway to mantua at which place he should sojourn till the friar find a fit occasion to publish he marriage which might be a joyful means of reconcile they family and then he do not doubt but the prince would be move to pardon he and he would return with twenty time more joy than he go forth with grief romeo be convince by these wise counsel of the friar and take he leave to go and seek he lady propose to stay with she that night and by day-break pursue he journey alone to mantua to which place the good friar promise to send he letter from time to time acquaint he with the state of affair at home that night romeo pass with he dear wife gain secret admission to she chamber from the orchard in which he have hear she confession of love the night before that have be a night of unmixed joy and rapture but the pleasure of this night and the delight which these lover take in each other 's society be sadly allay with the prospect of parting and the fatal adventure of the past day the unwelcome day-break seem to come too soon and when juliet hear the morning-song of the lark she would have persuade herself that it be the nightingale which sing by night but it be too truly the lark which sing and a discordant and unpleasing note it seem to she and the streak of day in the east too certainly point out that it be time for these lover to part romeo take he leave of he dear wife with a heavy heart promise to write to she from mantua every hour in the day and when he have descend from she chamber-window as he stand below she on the ground in that sad foreboding state of mind in which she be he appear to she eye as one dead in the bottom of a tomb romeo 's mind misgave he in like manner but now he be force hastily to depart for it be death for he to be find within the wall of verona after day-break this be but the beginning of the tragedy of this pair of star-crossed lover romeo have not be go many day before the old lord capulet propose a match for juliet the husband he have choose for she not dream that she be marry already be count pari a gallant young and noble gentleman no unworthy suitor to the young juliet if she have never see romeo the terrify juliet be in a sad perplexity at she father 's offer she plead she youth unsuitable to marriage the recent death of tybalt which have leave she spirit too weak to meet a husband with any face of joy and how indecorous it would shew for the family of the capulet to be celebrate a nuptial-feast when he funeral solemnity be hardly over : she plead every reason against the match but the true one namely that she be marry already but lord capulet be deaf to all she excuse and in a peremptory manner order she to get ready for by the follow Thursday she should be marry to paris : and have find she a husband rich young and noble such as the proudest maid in verona might joyfully accept he could not bear that out of a affected coyness as he construe she denial she should oppose obstacle to she own good fortune in this extremity juliet apply to the friendly friar always she counsellor in distress and he ask she if she have resolution to undertake a desperate remedy and she answer that she would go into the grave alive rather than marry paris she own dear husband living he direct she to go home and appear merry and give she consent to marry paris accord to she father 's desire and on the next night which be the night before the marriage to drink of the contents of a phial which he then give she the effect of which would be that for two-and-forty hour after drink it she should appear cold and lifeless that when the bridegroom come to fetch she in the morning he would find she to appearance dead that then she would be bear as the manner in that country be uncover on a bier to be bury in the family vault that if she could put off womanish fear and consent to this terrible trial in forty-two hour after swallow the liquid -lrb- such be its certain operation -rrb- she would be sure to awake as from a dream and before she should awake he would let she husband know they drift and he should come in the night and bear she thence to mantua love and the dread of marry paris give young juliet strength to undertake this horrible adventure and she take the phial of the friar promise to observe he direction go from the monastery she meet the young count pari and modestly dissemble promise to become he bride this be joyful news to the lord capulet and he wife it seem to put youth into the old man : and juliet who have displeased he exceedingly by she refusal of the count be he darling again now she promise to be obedient all thing in the house be in a bustle against the approach nuptials no cost be spare to prepare such festival rejoicing as verona have never before witness on the Wednesday night juliet drink off the potion she have many misgiving lest the friar to avoid the blame which might be imputed to he for marry she to romeo have give she poison but then he be always know for a holy man : then lest she should awake before the time that romeo be to come for she whether the terror of the place a vault full of dead capulet ' bone and where tybalt all bloody lay festering in he shroud would not be enough to drive she distract : again she think of all the story she have hear of spirit haunt the place where they body be bestow but then she love for romeo and she aversion for pari return and she desperately swallow the draught and become insensible when young pari come early in the morning with music to awaken he bride instead of a live juliet she chamber present the dreary spectacle of a lifeless corse what death to he hope what confusion then reign through the whole house poor pari lament he bride whom most detestable death have beguile he of have divorce from he even before they hand be join but still more piteous it be to hear the mourning of the old lord and lady capulet who have but this one one poor loving child to rejoice and solace in cruel death have snatch she from they sight just as these careful parent be on the point of see she advanced -lrb- as they think -rrb- by a promising and advantageous match now all thing that be ordain for the festival be turn from they property to do the office of a black funeral the wedding cheer serve for a sad burial feast the bridal hymn be change to sullen dirge the sprightly instrument to melancholy bell and the flower that should have be strew in the bride 's path now serve but to strew she corse now instead of a priest to marry she a priest be need to bury she and she be bear to church indeed not to augment the cheerful hope of the living but to swell the dreary number of the dead bad news which always travel faster than good now bring the dismal story of he juliet 's death to romeo at mantua before the messenger could arrive who be send from friar lawrence to apprize he that these be mock funeral only and but the shadow and representation of death and that he dear lady lay in the tomb but for a short while expect when romeo would come to release she from that dreary mansion just before romeo have be unusually joyful and light-hearted he have dream in the night that he be dead -lrb- a strange dream that give a dead man leave to think -rrb- and that he lady come and find he dead and breathe such life with kiss in he lip that he revive and be a emperor and now that a messenger come from verona he think surely it be to confirm some good news which he dream have presage but when the contrary to this flattering vision appear and that it be he lady who be dead in truth whom he could not revive by any kiss he order horse to be get ready for he determine that night to visit verona and to see he lady in she tomb and as mischief be swift to enter into the thought of desperate man he call to mind a poor apothecary whose shop in mantua he have lately pass and from the beggarly appearance of the man who seem famished and the wretched show in he shop of empty box range on dirty shelf and other token of extreme wretchedness he have say at the time -lrb- perhaps have some misgiving that he own disastrous life might haply meet with a conclusion so desperate -rrb- if a man be to need poison which by the law of mantua it be death to sell here live a poor wretch who would sell it he these word of he now come into he mind and he seek out the apothecary who after some pretended scruple romeo offer he gold which he poverty could not resist sell he a poison which if he swallow he tell he if he have the strength of twenty man would quickly dispatch he with this poison he set out for verona to have a sight of he dear lady in she tomb meaning when he have satisfy he sight to swallow the poison and be bury by she side he reach verona at midnight and find the church-yard in the midst of which be situate the ancient tomb of the capulet he have provide a light and a spade and wrenching iron and be proceed to break open the monument when he be interrupt by a voice which by the name of _ vile mountague _ bid he desist from he unlawful business it be the young count pari who have come to the tomb of juliet at that unseasonable time of night to strew flower and to weep over the grave of she that should have be he bride he know not what a interest romeo have in the dead but know he to be a mountague and -lrb- as he suppose -rrb- a swear foe to all the capulet he judge that he be come by night to do some villanous shame to the dead body therefore in a angry tone he bid he desist and as a criminal condemn by the law of verona to die if he be find within the wall of the city he would have apprehend he romeo urge pari to leave he and warn he by the fate of tybalt who lay bury there not to provoke he anger or draw down another sin upon he head by force he to kill he but the count in scorn refuse he warning and lay hand on he as a felon which romeo resist they fight and pari fall when romeo by the help of a light come to see who it be that he have slay that it be paris who -lrb- he learn in he way from mantua -rrb- should have marry juliet he take the dead youth by the hand as one whom misfortune have make a companion and say that he would bury he in a triumphal grave meaning in juliet 's grave which he now open : and there lay he lady as one whom death have no power upon to change a feature or complexion in she matchless beauty or as if death be amorous and the lean abhorred monster keep she there for he delight for she lay yet fresh and bloom as she have fall to sleep when she swallow that benumb potion : and near she lay tybalt in he bloody shroud whom romeo see begged pardon of he lifeless corse and for juliet 's sake call he _ cousin _ and say that he be about to do he a favor by put he enemy to death here romeo take he last leave of he lady 's lip kiss they and here he shake the burden of he cross star from he weary body swallow that poison which the apothecary have sell he whose operation be fatal and real not like that dissemble potion which juliet have swallow the effect of which be now nearly expire and she about to awake to complain that romeo have not keep he time or that he have come too soon for now the hour be arrive at which the friar have promise that she should awake and he have learn that he letter which he have send to mantua by some unlucky detention of the messenger have never reach romeo come himself provide with a pick-axe and lantern to deliver the lady from she confinement but he be surprise to find a light already burn in the capulet ' monument and to see sword and blood near it and romeo and pari lie breathless by the monument before he could entertain a conjecture to imagine how these fatal accident have fall out juliet awake out of she trance and see the friar near she she remember the place where she be and the occasion of she be there and ask for romeo : but the friar hear a noise bid she come out of that place of death and of unnatural sleep for a greater power than they could contradict have thwart they intent and be fright by the noise of people come he flee but when juliet see the cup close in she true love 's hand she guess that poison have be the cause of he end and she would have swallow the dregs if any have be leave and she kiss he still warm lip to try if any poison yet do hang upon they : then hear a nearer noise of people come she quickly unsheathe a dagger which she wear and stab herself die by she true romeo 's side the watch by this time have come up to the place a page belong to count paris who have witness the fight between he master and romeo have give the alarm which have spread among the citizen who go up and down the street of verona confusedly exclaim a pari a romeo a juliet as the rumor have imperfectly reach they till the uproar bring lord mountague and lord capulet out of they bed with the prince to enquire into the cause of the disturbance the friar have be apprehend by some of the watch come from the church-yard tremble sigh and weep in a suspicious manner a great multitude be assemble at the capulet ' monument the friar be command by the prince to deliver what he know of these strange and disastrous accident and there in the presence of the old lord mountague and capulet he faithfully relate the story of they child 's fatal love the part he take in promote they marriage in the hope in that union to end the long quarrel between they family how romeo there dead be husband to juliet and juliet there dead be romeo 's faithful wife : how before he could find a fit opportunity to divulge they marriage another match be project for juliet who to avoid the crime of a second marriage swallow the sleep draught -lrb- as he advise -rrb- and all think she dead : how meantime he write to romeo to come and take she thence when the force of the potion should cease and by what unfortunate miscarriage of the messenger the letter never reach romeo : further than this the friar could not follow the story nor know more than that come himself to deliver juliet from that place of death he find the count pari and romeo slay the remainder of the transaction be supply by the narration of the page who have see pari and romeo fight and by the servant who come with romeo from verona to whom this faithful lover have give letter to be deliver to he father in the event of he death which make good the friar 's word confess he marriage with juliet implore the forgiveness of he parent acknowledge the buying of the poison of the poor apothecary and he intent in come to the monument to die and lie with juliet all these circumstance agree together to clear the friar from any hand he could be suppose to have have in these complicated slaughter further than as the unintended consequence of he own well mean yet too artificial and subtle contrivance and the prince turn to these old lord mountague and capulet rebuke they for they brutal and irrational enmity and shew they what a scourge heaven have lay upon such offence that it have find means even through the love of they child to punish they unnatural hate and these old rival no longer enemy agree to bury they long strife in they child 's grave and lord capulet request lord mountague to give he he hand call he by the name of brother as if in acknowledgment of the union of they family by the marriage of the young capulet and mountague and say that lord mountague 's hand -lrb- in token of reconcilement -rrb- be all he demand for he daughter 's jointure : but lord mountague say he would give he more for he would raise she statue of pure gold that while verona keep its name no figure should be so esteem for its richness and workmanship as that of the true and faithful juliet and lord capulet in return say that he would raise another statue to romeo so do these poor old lord when it be too late strive to outgo each other in mutual courtesy : while so deadly have be they rage and enmity in past time that nothing but the fearful overthrow of they child -lrb- poor sacrifice to they quarrel and dissension -rrb- could remove the rooted hate and jealousy of the noble family hamlet prince of denmark -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- gertrude queen of denmark become a widow by the sudden death of king hamlet in less than two month after he death marry he brother claudius which be note by all people at the time for a strange act of indiscretion or unfeelingness or worse : for this claudius do no way resemble she late husband in the quality of he person or he mind but be as contemptible in outward appearance as he be base and unworthy in disposition and suspicion do not fail to arise in the mind of some that he have privately make away with he brother the late king with the view of marry he widow and ascend the throne of denmark to the exclusion of young hamlet the son of the bury king and lawful successor to the throne but upon no one do this unadvised action of the queen make such impression as upon this young prince who love and venerate the memory of he dead father almost to idolatry and being of a nice sense of honor and a most exquisite practiser of propriety himself do sorely take to heart this unworthy conduct of he mother gertrude : insomuch that between grief for he father 's death and shame for he mother 's marriage this young prince be overcloud with a deep melancholy and lose all he mirth and all he good look all he customary pleasure in book forsake he he princely exercise and sport proper to he youth be no longer acceptable he grow weary of the world which seem to he a unweeded garden where all the wholesome flower be choak up and nothing but weed could thrive not that the prospect of exclusion from the throne he lawful inheritance weigh so much upon he spirit though that to a young and high-minded prince be a bitter wound and a sore indignity but what so gall he and take away all he cheerful spirit be that he mother have shew herself so forgetful to he father 's memory : and such a father who have be to she so loving and so gentle a husband and then she always appear as loving and obedient a wife to he and would hang upon he as if she affection grow to he : and now within two month or as it seem to young hamlet less than two month she have marry again marry he uncle she dead husband 's brother in itself a highly improper and unlawful marriage from the nearness of relationship but make much more so by the indecent haste with which it be conclude and the unkingly character of the man whom she have choose to be the partner of she throne and bed this it be which more than the loss of ten kingdom dash the spirit and bring a cloud over the mind of this honorable young prince in vain be all that he mother gertrude or the king could do to contrive to divert he he still appear in court in a suit of deep black as mourning for the king he father 's death which mode of dress he have never lay aside not even in compliment to he mother upon the day she be marry nor could he be bring to join in any of the festivity or rejoicing of that -lrb- as appear to he -rrb- disgraceful day what mostly trouble he be a uncertainty about the manner of he father 's death it be give out by claudius that a serpent have sting he : but young hamlet have shrewd suspicion that claudius himself be the serpent in plain english that he have murder he for he crown and that the serpent who sting he father do now sit on the throne how far he be right in this conjecture and what he ought to think of he mother how far she be privy to this murder and whether by she consent or knowledge or without it come to pass be the doubt which continually harass and distract he a rumor have reach the ear of young hamlet that a apparition exactly resemble the dead king he father have be see by the soldier upon watch on the platform before the palace at midnight for two or three night successively the figure come constantly clothe in the same suit of armor from head to foot which the dead king be know to have worn : and they who see it -lrb- hamlet 's bosom-friend horatio be one -rrb- agree in they testimony as to the time and manner of its appearance : that it come just as the clock strike twelve that it look pale with a face more of sorrow than of anger that its beard be grisly and the color a _ sable silvered _ as they have see it in he life-time : that it make no answer when they speak to it yet once they think it lift up its head and address itself to motion as if it be about to speak but in that moment the morning cock crew and it shrink in haste away and vanish out of they sight the young prince strangely amaze at they relation which be too consistent and agree with itself to disbelieve conclude that it be he father 's ghost which they have see and determine to take he watch with the soldier that night that he might have a chance of see it : for he reason with himself that such a appearance do not come for nothing but that the ghost have something to impart and though it have be silent hitherto yet it would speak to he and he wait with impatience for the come of night when night come he take he stand with horatio and marcellus one of the guard upon the platform where this apparition be accustom to walk : and it be a cold night and the air unusually raw and nipping hamlet and horatio and they companion fall into some talk about the coldness of the night which be suddenly break off by horatio announce that the ghost be come at the sight of he father 's spirit hamlet be strike with a sudden surprize and fear he at first call upon the angel and heavenly minister to defend they for he know not whether it be a good spirit or bad whether it come for good or for evil : but he gradually assume more courage and he father -lrb- as it seem to he -rrb- look upon he so piteously and as it be desire to have conversation with he and do in all respects appear so like himself as he be when he live that hamlet could not help address he : he call he by he name hamlet king father and conjure he that he would tell the reason why he have leave he grave where they have see he quietly bestow to come again and visit the earth and the moonlight : and besought he that he would let they know if there be any thing which they could do to give peace to he spirit and the ghost beckon to hamlet that he should go with he to some more remove place where they might be alone : and horatio and marcellus would have dissuade the young prince from follow it for they fear lest it should be some evil spirit who would tempt he to the neighbouring sea or to the top of some dreadful cliff and there put on some horrible shape which might deprive the prince of he reason but they counsel and intreaty could not alter hamlet 's determination who care too little about life to fear the losing of it and as to he soul he say what could the spirit do to that be a thing immortal as itself and he feel as hardy as a lion and burst from they who do all they could to hold he he follow whithersoever the spirit lead he and when they be alone together the spirit break silence and tell he that he be the ghost of hamlet he father who have be cruelly murder and he tell the manner of it that it be do by he own brother claudius hamlet 's uncle as hamlet have already but too much suspect for the hope of succeed to he bed and crown that as he be sleep in he garden he custom always in the afternoon he treasonous brother steal upon he in he sleep and pour the juice of poisonous henbane into he ear which have such a antipathy to the life of man that swift as quicksilver it course through all the vein of the body bake up the blood and spread a crust-like leprosy all over the skin : thus sleep by a brother 's hand he be cut off at once from he crown he queen and he life : and he adjure hamlet if he do ever he dear father love that he would revenge he foul murder and the ghost lament to he son that he mother should so fall off from virtue as to prove false to the wed love of she first husband and to marry he murderer : but he caution hamlet howsoever he proceed in he revenge against he wicked uncle by no means to act any violence against the person of he mother but to leave she to heaven and to the sting and thorn of conscience and hamlet promise to observe the ghost 's direction in all thing and the ghost vanish and when hamlet be leave alone he take up a solemn resolution that all he have in he memory all that he have ever learn by book or observation should be instantly forget by he and nothing live in he brain but the memory of what the ghost have tell he and enjoin he to do and hamlet related the particulars of the conversation which have pass to none but he dear friend horatio and he enjoin both to he and marcellus the strictest secrecy as to what they have see that night the terror which the sight of the ghost have leave upon the sens of hamlet he be weak and dispirited before almost unhinge he mind and drive he beside he reason and he fear that it would continue to have this effect which might subject he to observation and set he uncle upon he guard if he suspect that he be meditate any thing against he or that hamlet really know more of he father 's death than he profess take up a strange resolution from that time to counterfeit as if he be really and truly mad thinking that he would be less a object of suspicion when he uncle should believe he incapable of any serious project and that he real perturbation of mind would be best cover and pass conceal under a disguise of pretended lunacy from this time hamlet affect a certain wildness and strangeness in he apparel he speech and behavior and do so excellently counterfeit the madman that the king and queen be both deceive and not think he grief for he father 's death a sufficient cause to produce such a distemper for they know not of the appearance of the ghost they conclude that he malady be love and they think they have find out the object before hamlet fall into the melancholy way which have be relate he have dearly love a fair maid call ophelia the daughter of polonius the king 's chief counsellor in affair of state he have send she letter and ring and make many tender of he affection to she and importune she with love in honorable fashion : and she have give belief to he vow and importunity but the melancholy which he fall into latterly have make he neglect she and from the time he conceive the project of counterfeit madness he affect to treat she with unkindness and a sort of rudeness but she good lady rather than reproach he with be false to she persuade herself that it be nothing but the disease in he mind and no settle unkindness which have make he less observant of she than formerly and she compare the faculty of he once noble mind and excellent understanding impair as they be with the deep melancholy that oppressed he to sweet bell which in themselves be capable of most exquisite music but when jangle out of tune or rudely handle produce only a harsh and unpleasing sound though the rough business which hamlet have in hand the revenging of he father 's death upon he murderer do not suit with the playful state of courtship or admit of the society of so idle a passion as love now seem to he yet it could not hinder but that soft thought of he ophelium would come between and in one of these moment when he think that he treatment of this gentle lady have be unreasonably harsh he write she a letter full of wild start of passion and in extravagant term such as agree with he suppose madness but mixed with some gentle touch of affection which could not but shew to this honor lady that a deep love for she yet lay at the bottom of he heart he bid she to doubt the star be fire and to doubt that the sun do move to doubt truth to be a liar but never to doubt that he love with more of such extravagant phrase this letter ophelia dutifully shew to she father and the old man think himself bind to communicate it to the king and queen who from that time suppose that the true cause of hamlet 's madness be love and the queen wish that the good beauty of ophelium might be the happy cause of he wildness for so she hope that she virtue might happily restore he to he accustomed way again to both they honor but hamlet 's malady lay deeper than she suppose or than could be so cure he father 's ghost which he have see still haunt he imagination and the sacred injunction to revenge he murder give he no rest till it be accomplish every hour of delay seem to he a sin and a violation of he father 's command yet how to compass the death of the king surround as he constantly be with he guard be no easy matter or if it have be the presence of the queen hamlet 's mother who be generally with the king be a restraint upon he purpose which he could not break through besides the very circumstance that the usurper be he mother 's husband fill he with some remorse and still blunt the edge of he purpose the mere act of put a fellow-creature to death be in itself odious and terrible to a disposition naturally so gentle as hamlet 's be he very melancholy and the dejection of spirit he have so long be in produce a irresoluteness and wavering of purpose which keep he from proceed to extremity moreover he could not help have some scruple upon he mind whether the spirit which he have see be indeed he father or whether it might not be the devil who he have hear have power to take any form he please and who might have assume he father 's shape only to take advantage of he weakness and he melancholy to drive he to the do of so desperate a act as murder and he determine that he would have more certain grounds to go upon than a vision or apparition which might be a delusion while he be in this irresolute mind there come to the court certain player in whom hamlet formerly use to take delight and particularly to hear one of they speak a tragical speech describe the death of old priam king of troy with the grief of hecuba he queen hamlet welcome he old friend the player and remember how that speech have formerly give he pleasure request the player to repeat it which he do in so lively a manner setting forth the cruel murder of the feeble old king with the destruction of he people and city by fire and the mad grief of the old queen run barefoot up and down the palace with a poor clout upon that head where a crown have be and with nothing but a blanket upon she loin snatch up in haste where she have wear a royal robe : that not only it draw tear from all that stand by who think they see the real scene so livelily be it represent but even the player himself deliver it with a broken voice and real tear this put hamlet upon think if that player could so work himself up to passion by a mere fictitious speech to weep for one that he have never see for hecuba that have be dead so many hundred year how dull be he who have a real motive and cue for passion a real king and a dear father murder be yet so little move that he revenge all this while have seem to have sleep in dull and muddy forgetfulness and while he meditate on actor and act and the powerful effect which a good play represent to the life have upon the spectator he remember the instance of some murderer who see a murder on the stage be by the mere force of the scene and resemblance of circumstance so affect that on the spot he confess the crime which he have commit and he determine that these player should play something like the murder of he father before he uncle and he would watch narrowly what effect it might have upon he and from he look he would be able to gather with more certainty if he be the murderer or not to this effect he order a play to be prepare to the representation of which he invite the king and queen the story of the play be of a murder do in vienna upon a duke the duke 's name be gonzago he wife baptista the play shew how one lucianus a near relation to the duke poison he in he garden for he estate and how the murderer in a short time after get the love of gonzago 's wife at the representation of this play the king who do not know the trap which be lay for he be present with he queen and the whole court : hamlet sit attentively near he to observe he look the play begin with a conversation between gonzago and he wife in which the lady make many protestation of love and of never marry a second husband if she should outlive gonzago wish she might be accurse if she ever take a second husband and add that no woman ever do so but those wicked woman who kill they first husband hamlet observe the king he uncle change color at this expression and that it be as bad as wormwood both to he and to the queen but when lucianus accord to the story come to poison gonzago sleep in the garden the strong resemblance which it bear to he own wicked act upon the late king he brother whom he have poison in he garden so strike upon the conscience of this usurper that he be unable to sit out the rest of the play but on a sudden call for light to he chamber and affect or partly feel a sudden sickness he abruptly leave the theater the king be depart the play be give over now hamlet have see enough to be satisfy that the word of the ghost be true and no illusion and in a fit of gaiety like that which come over a man who suddenly have some great doubt or scruple resolve he swear to horatio that he would take the ghost 's word for a thousand pound but before he could make up he resolution as to what measure of revenge he should take now he be certainly inform that he uncle be he father 's murderer he be send for by the queen he mother to a private conference in she closet it be by desire of the king that the queen send for hamlet that she might signify to she son how much he late behavior have displeased they both and the king wish to know all that pass at that conference and think that the too partial report of a mother might let slip some part of hamlet 's word which it might much import the king to know polonius the old counsellor of state be order to plant himself behind the hanging in the queen 's closet where he might unseen hear all that pass this artifice be particularly adapt to the disposition of polonius who be a man grow old in crooked maxim and policy of state and delighted to get at the knowledge of matter in a indirect and cunning way hamlet be come to he mother she begin to tax he in the roundest way with he action and behavior and she tell he that he have give great offence to _ he father _ mean the king he uncle whom because he have marry she she call hamlet 's father hamlet sorely indignant that she should give so dear and honor a name as father seem to he to a wretch who be indeed no better than the murderer of he true father with some sharpness reply mother _ you _ have much offended _ my father _ the queen say that be but a idle answer as good as the question deserve say hamlet the queen ask he if he have forget who it be he be speak to alas reply hamlet i wish i could forget you be the queen you husband 's brother 's wife and you be my mother : i wish you be not what you be nay then say the queen if you shew I so little respect i will set those to you that can speak and be go to send the king or polonius to he but hamlet would not let she go now he have she alone till he have try if he word could not bring she to some sense of she wicked life and take she by the wrist he hold she fast and make she sit down she affright at he earnest manner and fearful lest in he lunacy he should do she a mischief cry out : and a voice be hear from behind the hanging help help the queen which hamlet hearing and verily think that it be the king himself there conceal he draw he sword and stab at the place where the voice come from as he would have stab a rat that run there till the voice cease he conclude the person to be dead but when he drag forth the body it be not the king but polonius the old officious counsellor that have plant himself as a spy behind the hanging oh I exclaim the queen what a rash and bloody deed have you do a bloody deed mother reply hamlet but not so bad as yours who kill a king and marry he brother hamlet have go too far to leave off here he be now in the humor to speak plainly to he mother and he pursue it and though the fault of parent be to be tenderly treat by they child yet in the case of great crime the son may have leave to speak even to he own mother with some harshness so as that harshness be mean for she good and to turn she from she wicked way and not do for the purpose of upbraid and now this virtuous prince do in move term represent to the queen the heinousness of she offence in be so forgetful of the dead king he father as in so short a space of time to marry with he brother and reputed murderer : such a act as after the vow which she have swear to she first husband be enough to make all vow of woman suspect and all virtue to be account hypocrisy wedding contract to be less than gamester ' oath and religion to be a mockery and a mere form of word he say she have do such a deed that the heaven blush at it and the earth be sick of she because of it and he shew she two picture the one of the late king she first husband and the other of the present king she second husband and he bid she mark the difference : what a grace be on the brow of he father how like a god he look the curl of apollo the forehead of jupiter the eye of mar and a posture like to mercury newly alight on some heaven-kissing hill this man he say _ have be _ she husband and then he shew she whom she have get in he stead : how like a blight or a mildew he look for so he have blast he wholesome brother and the queen be sore ashamed that he should so turn she eye inward upon she soul which she now see so black and deform and he ask she how she could continue to live with this man and be a wife to he who have murder she first husband and get the crown by as false means as a thief -- and just as he speak the ghost of he father such as he be in he lifetime and such as he have lately see it enter the room and hamlet in great terror ask what it would have and the ghost say that it come to remind he of the revenge he have promise which hamlet seem to have forget : and the ghost bid he speak to he mother for the grief and terror she be in would else kill she it then vanish and be see by none but hamlet neither could he by point to where it stand or by any description make he mother perceive it who be terribly fright all this while to hear he converse as it seem to she with nothing : and she imputed it to the disorder of he mind but hamlet beg she not to flatter she wicked soul in such a manner as to think that it be he madness and not she own offence which have bring he father 's spirit again on the earth and he bid she feel he pulse how temperately it beat not like a madman 's and he beg of she with tear to confess herself to heaven for what be past and for the future to avoid the company of the king and be no more as a wife to he : and when she should shew herself a mother to he by respect he father 's memory he would ask a blessing of she as a son and she promise to observe he direction the conference end and now hamlet be at leisure to consider who it be that in he unfortunate rashness he have kill : and when he come to see that it be polonius the father of the lady ophelium whom he so dearly love he draw apart the dead body and he spirit be now a little quieter he weep for what he have do the unfortunate death of polonius give the king a pretence for send hamlet out of the kingdom he would willingly have put he to death fear he as dangerous but he dread the people who love hamlet and the queen who with all she fault dote upon the prince she son so this subtle king under pretence of provide for hamlet 's safety that he might not be call to account for polonius ' death cause he to be convey on board a ship bind for england under the care of two courtier by whom he dispatch letter to the english court which at that time be in subjection and pay tribute to denmark require for special reason there pretend that hamlet should be put to death as soon as he land on english ground hamlet suspect some treachery in the night-time secretly get at the letter and skilfully erase he own name he in the stead of it put in the name of those two courtier who have the charge of he to be put to death : then seal up the letter he put they into they place again soon after the ship be attack by pirate and a sea-fight commence in the course of which hamlet desirous to shew he valor with sword in hand singly board the enemy 's vessel while he own ship in a cowardly manner bear away and leave he to he fate the two courtier make the best of they way to england charge with those letter the sense of which hamlet have alter to they own deserve destruction the pirate who have the prince in they power shew themselves gentle enemy and know whom they have get prisoner in the hope that the prince might do they a good turn at court in recompence for any favor they might shew he they set hamlet on shore at the nearest port in denmark from that place hamlet write to the king acquaint he with the strange chance which have bring he back to he own country and say that on the next day he should present himself before he majesty when he get home a sad spectacle offer itself the first thing to he eye this be the funeral of the young and beautiful ophelium he once dear mistress the wit of this young lady have begin to turn ever since she poor father 's death that he should die a violent death and by the hand of the prince whom she love so affect this tender young maid that in a little time she grow perfectly distract and would go about give flower away to the lady of the court and say that they be for she father 's burial singing song about love and about death and sometimes such as have no meaning at all as if she have no memory of what have happen to she there be a willow which grow slant over a brook and reflect its leaf in the stream to this brook she come one day when she be unwatched with garland she have be make mix up of daisy and nettle flower and weed together and clamber up to hang she garland upon the bough of the willow a bow break and precipitate this fair young maid garland and all that she have gather into the water where she clothes bear she up for a while during which she chaunt scrap of old tune like one insensible to she own distress or as if she be a creature natural to that element : but long it be not before she garment heavy with the wet pull she in from she melodious singing to a muddy and miserable death it be the funeral of this fair maid which she brother laerte be celebrate the king and queen and whole court be present when hamlet arrive he know not what all this shew import but stand on one side not incline to interrupt the ceremony he see the flower strew upon she grave as the custom be in maiden burial which the queen herself throw in and as she throw they she say sweet to the sweet i think to have deck thy bride-bed sweet maid not to have strew thy grave thou shouldst have be my hamlet 's wife and he hear she brother wish that violet might spring from she grave : and he see he leap into the grave all frantic with grief and bid the attendant pile mountain of earth upon he that he might be bury with she and hamlet 's love for this fair maid come back to he and he could not bear that a brother should shew so much transport of grief for he think that he love ophelia better than forty thousand brother then discover himself he leap into the grave where laerte be all as frantic or more frantic than he and laerte know he to be hamlet who have be the cause of he father 's and he sister 's death grapple he by the throat as a enemy till the attendant part they : and hamlet after the funeral excuse he hasty act in throw himself into the grave as if to brave laerte but he say he could not bear that any one should seem to outgo he in grief for the death of the fair ophelium and for the time these two noble youth seem reconcile but out of the grief and anger of laerte for the death of he father and ophelium the king hamlet 's wicked uncle contrived destruction for hamlet he set on laerte under cover of peace and reconciliation to challenge hamlet to a friendly trial of skill at fencing which hamlet accept a day be appoint to try the match at this match all the court be present and laerte by direction of the king prepare a poison weapon upon this match great wager be lay by the courtier as both hamlet and laerte be know to excel at this sword-play and hamlet take up the foil choose one not at all suspect the treachery of laerte or be careful to examine laerte ' weapon who instead of a foil or blunt sword which the law of fencing require make use of one with a point and poison at first laerte do but play with hamlet and suffer he to gain some advantage which the dissemble king magnify and extol beyond measure drinking to hamlet 's success and wagering rich bet upon the issue : but after a few pass laerte grow warm make a deadly thrust at hamlet with he poison weapon and give he a mortal blow hamlet incensed but not know the whole of the treachery in the scuffle exchange he own innocent weapon for laerte ' deadly one and with a thrust of laerte ' own sword repay laerte home who be thus justly catch in he own treachery in this instant the queen shriek out that she be poison she have inadvertently drunk out of a bowl which the king have prepare for hamlet in case that be warm in fencing he should call for drink : into this the treacherous king have infuse a deadly poison to make sure of hamlet if laerte have fail he have forget to warn the queen of the bowl which she drink of and immediately die exclaim with she last breath that she be poison hamlet suspect some treachery order the door to be shut while he seek it out laerte tell he to seek no further for he be the traitor and feel he life go away with the wound which hamlet have give he he make confession of the treachery he have use and how he have fall a victim to it : and he tell hamlet of the envenomed point and say that hamlet have not half a hour to live for no medicine could cure he and beg forgiveness of hamlet he die with he last word accuse the king of be the contriver of the mischief when hamlet see he end draw near there be yet some venom leave upon the sword he suddenly turn upon he false uncle and thrust the point of it to he heart fulfil the promise which he have make to he father 's spirit whose injunction be now accomplish and he foul murder revenge upon the murderer then hamlet feel he breath fail and life depart turn to he dear friend horatio who have be spectator of this fatal tragedy and with he die breath request he that he would live to tell he story to the world -lrb- for horatio have make a motion as if he would slay himself to accompany the prince in death -rrb- and horatio promise that he would make a true report as one that be privy to all the circumstance and thus satisfy the noble heart of hamlet crack : and horatio and the bystander with many tear commend the spirit of they sweet prince to the guardianship of angel for hamlet be a loving and a gentle prince and greatly beloved for he many noble and prince-like quality and if he have live would no doubt have prove a most royal and complete king to denmark othello -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- brabantio the rich senator of venice have a fair daughter the gentle desdemona she be seek to by diver suitor both on account of she many virtuous quality and for she rich expectation but among the suitor of she own clime and complexion she see none whom she could affect : for this noble lady who regard the mind more than the feature of man with a singularity rather to be admire than imitate have choose for the object of she affection a moor a black whom she father love and often invite to he house neither be desdemona to be altogether condemn for the unsuitableness of the person whom she select for she lover bate that othello be black the noble moor want nothing which might recommend he to the affection of the greatest lady he be a soldier and a brave one and by he conduct in bloody war against the turk have rise to the rank of general in the venetian service and be esteem and trust by the state he have be a traveller and desdemona -lrb- as be the manner of lady -rrb- love to hear he tell the story of he adventure which he would run through from he earliest recollection the battle siege and encounter which he have past through the peril he have be expose to by land and by water he hair-breadth escape when he have enter a breach or march up to the mouth of a cannon and how he have be take prisoner by the insolent enemy and sell to slavery : how he demean himself in that state and how he escape : all these account add to the narration of the strange thing he have see in foreign country the vast wilderness and romantic cavern the quarry the rock and mountain whose head be in the cloud of the savage nation the cannibal who be man-eater and a race of people in africa whose head do grow beneath they shoulder : these traveller ' story would so enchain the attention of desdemona that if she be call off at any time by household affair she would dispatch with all haste that business and return and with a greedy ear devour othello 's discourse and once he take advantage of a pliant hour and draw from she a prayer that he would tell she the whole story of he life at large of which she have hear so much but only by part : to which he consent and beguile she of many a tear when he speak of some distressful stroke which he youth suffer he story be do she give he for he pain a world of sigh : she swear a pretty oath that it be all pass strange and pitiful wondrous pitiful : she wish -lrb- she say -rrb- she have not hear it yet she wish that heaven have make she such a man : and then she thank he and tell he if he have a friend who love she he have only to teach he how to tell he story and that would woo she upon this hint deliver not with more frankness than modesty accompany with a certain bewitching prettiness and blush which othello could not but understand he speak more openly of he love and in this golden opportunity gain the consent of the generous lady desdemona privately to marry he neither othello 's color nor he fortune be such that it could be hope brabantio would accept he for a son-in-law he have leave he daughter free but he do expect that as the manner of noble venetian lady be she would choose ere long a husband of senatorial rank or expectation : but in this he be deceive desdemona love the moor though he be black and devoted she heart and fortune to he valiant part and quality : so be she heart subdue to a implicit devotion to the man she have select for a husband that he very color which to all but this discerning lady would have prove a insurmountable objection be by she esteem above all the white skin and clear complexion of the young venetian nobility she suitor they marriage which though privately carry could not long be keep a secret come to the ear of the old man brabantio who appear in a solemn council of the senate as a accuser of the moor othello who by spell and witchcraft -lrb- he maintain -rrb- have seduce the affection of the fair desdemona to marry he without the consent of she father and against the obligation of hospitality at this juncture of time it happen that the state of venice have immediate need of the service of othello news have arrive that the turk with mighty preparation have fit out a fleet which be bend its course to the island of cyprus with intent to regain that strong post from the venetian who then hold it : in this emergency the state turn its eye upon othello who alone be deem adequate to conduct the defense of cyprus against the turk so that othello now summon before the senate stand in they presence at once as a candidate for a great state-employment and as a culprit charge with offence which by the law of venice be make capital the age and senatorial character of old brabantio command a most patient hearing from that grave assembly but the incensed father conduct he accusation with so much intemperance produce likelihood and allegation for proof that when othello be call upon for he defense he have only to relate a plain tale of the course of he love which he do with such a artless eloquence recount the whole story of he woo as we have relate it above and deliver he speech with so noble a plainness -lrb- the evidence of truth -rrb- that the duke who sit as chief judge could not help confess that a tale so tell would have win he daughter too : and the spell and conjuration which othello have use in he courtship plainly appear to have be no more than the honest art of man in love and the only witchcraft which he have use the faculty of tell a soft tale to win a lady 's ear this statement of othello be confirm by the testimony of the lady desdemona herself who appear in court and profess a duty to she father for life and education challenge leave of he to profess a yet higher duty to she lord and husband even so much as she mother have shew in prefer he -lrb- brabantio -rrb- above _ she _ father the old senator unable to maintain he plea call the moor to he with many expression of sorrow and as a act of necessity bestow upon he he daughter whom if he have be free to withhold she -lrb- he tell he -rrb- he would with all he heart have keep from he add that he be glad at soul that he have no other child for this behavior of desdemona would have teach he to be a tyrant and hang clog on they for she desertion this difficulty be get over othello to whom custom have render the hardship of a military life as natural as food and rest be to other man readily undertake the management of the war in cyprus : and desdemona prefer the honor of she lord -lrb- though with danger -rrb- before the indulgence of those idle delight in which new-married people usually waste they time cheerfully consent to he go no sooner be othello and he lady land in cyprus than news arrive that a desperate tempest have disperse the turkish fleet and thus the island be secure from any immediate apprehension of a attack but the war which othello be to suffer be now begin and the enemy which malice stir up against he innocent lady prove in they nature more deadly than stranger or infidel among all the general 's friend no one possess the confidence of othello more entirely than cassio michael cassio be a young soldier a florentine gay amorous and of please address favorite quality with woman he be handsome and eloquent and exactly such a person as might alarm the jealousy of a man advance in year -lrb- as othello in some measure be -rrb- who have marry a young and beautiful wife but othello be as free from jealousy as he be noble and as incapable of suspect as of do a base action he have employ this cassio in he love-affair with desdemona and cassio have be a sort of go-between in he suit : for othello fear that himself have not those soft part of conversation which please lady and find these quality in he friend would often depute cassio to go -lrb- as he phrase it -rrb- a court for he : such innocent simplicity be rather a honor than a blemish to the character of the valiant moor so that no wonder if next to othello himself -lrb- but at far distance as beseem a virtuous wife -rrb- the gentle desdemona loved and trust cassio nor have the marriage of this couple make any difference in they behavior to michael cassio he frequent they house and he free and rattle talk be no unpleasing variety to othello who be himself of a more serious temper : for such temper be observe often to delight in they contrary as a relief from the oppressive excess of they own : and desdemona and cassio would talk and laugh together as in the day when he go a court for he friend othello have lately promote cassio to be the lieutenant a place of trust and nearest to the general 's person this promotion give great offence to iago a older officer who think he have a better claim than cassio and would often ridicule cassio as a fellow fit only for the company of lady and one that know no more of the art of war or how to set a army in array for battle than a girl iago hate cassio and he hate othello as well for favor cassio as for a unjust suspicion which he have lightly take up against othello that the moor be too fond of iago 's wife emilium from these imaginary provocation the plot mind of iago conceive a horrid scheme of revenge which should involve both cassio the moor and desdemona in one common ruin iago be artful and have study human nature deeply and he know that of all the torment which afflict the mind of man -lrb- and far beyond bodily torture -rrb- the pain of jealousy be the most intolerable and have the sorest sting if he could succeed in make othello jealous of cassio he think it would be a exquisite plot of revenge and might end in the death of cassio or othello or both he care not the arrival of the general and he lady in cyprus meeting with the news of the dispersion of the enemy 's fleet make a sort of holiday in the island every body give themselves up to feast and make merry wine flow in abundance and cup go round to the health of the black othello and he lady the fair desdemona cassio have the direction of the guard that night with a charge from othello to keep the soldier from excess in drinking that no brawl might arise to fright the inhabitant or disgust they with the new-landed force that night iago begin he deep-laid plan of mischief under cover of loyalty and love to the general he entice cassio to make rather too free with the bottle -lrb- a great fault in a officer upon guard -rrb- cassio for a time resist but he could not long hold out against the honest freedom which iago know how to put on but keep swallow glass after glass -lrb- as iago still ply he with drink and encouraging song -rrb- and cassio 's tongue run over in praise of the lady desdemona whom he again and again toast affirm that she be a most exquisite lady : until at last the enemy which he put into he mouth steal away he brain and upon some provocation give he by a fellow whom iago have set on sword be draw and montano a worthy officer who interfere to appease the dispute be wound in the scuffle the riot now begin to be general and iago who have set on foot the mischief be foremost in spread the alarm cause the castle-bell to be ring -lrb- as if some dangerous mutiny instead of a slight drunken quarrel have arise -rrb- : the alarm-bell ringing awaken othello who dress in a hurry and come to the scene of action question cassio of the cause cassio be now come to himself the effect of the wine have a little go off but be too much ashamed to reply and iago pretend a great reluctance to accuse cassio but as it be force into it by othello who insist to know the truth give a account of the whole matter -lrb- leave out he own share in it which cassio be too far go to remember -rrb- in such a manner as while he seem to make cassio 's offence less do indeed make it appear greater than it be the result be that othello who be a strict observer of discipline be compel to take away cassio 's place of lieutenant from he thus do iago 's first artifice succeed completely he have now undermine he hate rival and thrust he out of he place : but a further use be hereafter to be make of the adventure of this disastrous night cassio whom this misfortune have entirely sober now lament to he seem friend iago that he should have be such a fool as to transform himself into a beast he be undo for how could he ask the general for he place again he would tell he he be a drunkard he despise himself iago affect to make light of it say that he or any man living might be drunk upon occasion it remain now to make the best of a bad bargain the general 's wife be now the general and could do any thing with othello that he be best to apply to the lady desdemona to mediate for he with she lord that she be of a frank obliging disposition and would readily undertake a good office of this sort and set cassio right again in the general 's favor and then this crack in they love would be make stronger than ever a good advice of iago if it have not be give for wicked purpose which will after appear cassio do as iago advise he and make application to the lady desdemona who be easy to be win over in any honest suit and she promise cassio that she would be he solicitor with she lord and rather die than give up he cause this she immediately set about in so earnest and pretty a manner that othello who be mortally offend with cassio could not put she off when he plead delay and that it be too soon to pardon such a offender she would not be beat back but insist that it should be the next night or the morning after or the next morning to that at farthest then she shew how penitent and humble poor cassio be and that he offence do not deserve so sharp a check and when othello still hang back what my lord say she that i should have so much to do to plead for cassio michael cassio that come a court for you and oftentimes when i have speak in dispraise of you have take you part i count this but a little thing to ask of you when i mean to try you love indeed i shall ask a weighty matter othello could deny nothing to such a pleader and only request that desdemona would leave the time to he promise to receive michael cassio again into favor it happen that othello and iago have enter into the room where desdemona be just as cassio who have be implore she intercession be depart at the opposite door and iago who be full of art say in a low voice as if to himself i like not that othello take no great notice of what he say indeed the conference which immediately take place with he lady put it out of he head but he remember it afterwards for when desdemona be go iago as if for mere satisfaction of he thought question othello whether michael cassio when othello be court he lady know of he love to this the general answering in the affirmative and add that he have go between they very often during the courtship iago knit he brow as if he have get fresh light of some terrible matter and cry indeed this bring into othello 's mind the word which iago have let fall upon enter the room and see cassio with desdemona and he begin to think there be some meaning in all this : for he deem iago to be a just man and full of love and honesty and what in a false knave would be trick in he seem to be the natural workings of a honest mind big with something too great for utterance : and othello pray iago to speak what he know and to give he worst thought word and what say iago if some thought very vile should have intrude into my breast as where be the palace into which foul thing do not enter then iago go on to say what a pity it be if any trouble should arise to othello out of he imperfect observation that it would not be for othello 's peace to know he thought that people 's good name be not to be take away for slight suspicion and when othello 's curiosity be raise almost to distraction with these hint and scatter word iago as if in earnest care for othello 's peace of mind besought he to beware of jealousy : with such art do this villain raise suspicion in the unguarded othello by the very caution which he pretend to give he against suspicion i know say othello that my wife be fair love company and feasting be free of speech sing play and dance well : but where virtue be these quality be virtuous i must have proof before i think she dishonest then iago as if glad that othello be slow to believe ill of he lady frankly declare that he have no proof but beg othello to observe she behavior well when cassio be by not to be jealous nor too secure neither for that he -lrb- iago -rrb- know the disposition of the italian lady he country-woman better than othello could do and that in venice the wife let heaven see many prank they dare not shew they husband then he artfully insinuate that desdemona deceive she father in marry with othello and carry it so closely that the poor old man think that witchcraft have be use othello be much move with this argument which bring the matter home to he for if she have deceive she father why might she not deceive she husband iago beg pardon for have move he but othello assume a indifference while he be really shake with inward grief at iago 's word beg he to go on which iago do with many apology as if unwilling to produce any thing against cassio whom he call he friend : he then come strongly to the point and remind othello how desdemona have refuse many suitable match of she own clime and complexion and have marry he a moor which shew unnatural in she and prove she to have a headstrong will : and when she better judgment return how probable it be she should fall upon compare othello with the fine form and clear white complexion of the young italian she countryman he conclude with advise othello to put off he reconcilement with cassio a little longer and in the mean while to note with what earnestness desdemona should intercede in he behalf for that much would be see in that so mischievously do this artful villain lay he plot to turn the gentle quality of this innocent lady into she destruction and make a net for she out of she own goodness to entrap she : first setting cassio on to intreat she mediation and then out of that very mediation contrive stratagem for she ruin the conference end with iago 's beg othello to account he wife innocent until he have more decisive proof and othello promise to be patient : but from that moment the deceive othello never taste content of mind poppy nor the juice of mandragora nor all the sleep potion in the world could ever again restore to he that sweet rest which he have enjoy but yesterday he occupation sicken upon he he no longer take delight in arm he heart that use to be rouse at the sight of troops and banner and battle-array and would stir and leap at the sound of a drum or a trumpet or a neighing war-horse seem to have lose all that pride and ambition which be a soldier 's virtue and he military ardor and all he old joy forsake he sometimes he think he wife honest and at time he think she not so sometimes he think iago just and at time he think he not so then he would wish that he have never know of it he be not the worse for she loving cassio so long as he know it not : tear in piece with these distracting thought he once lay hold on iago 's throat and demand proof of desdemona 's guilt or threaten instant death for he have belie she iago feign indignation that he honesty should be take for a vice ask othello if he have not sometimes see a handkerchief spot with strawberry in he wife 's hand othello answer that he have give she such a one and that it be he first gift that same handkerchief say iago do i see michael cassio this day wipe he face with if it be as you say say othello i will not rest till a wide revenge swallow they up : and first for a token of you fidelity i expect that cassio shall be put to death within three day and for that fair devil -lrb- mean he lady -rrb- i will withdraw and devise some swift means of death for she trifle light as air be to the jealous proof as strong as holy writ a handkerchief of he wife 's see in cassio 's hand be motive enough to the deluded othello to pass sentence of death upon they both without once enquire how cassio come by it desdemona have never give such a present to cassio nor would this constant lady have wrong she lord with do so naughty a thing as give he present to another man both cassio and desdemona be innocent of any offence against othello : but the wicked iago whose spirit never sleep in contrivance of villainy have make he wife -lrb- a good but a weak woman -rrb- steal this handkerchief from desdemona under pretence of get the work copy but in reality to drop it in cassio 's way where he might find it and give a handle to iago 's suggestion that it be desdemona 's present othello soon after meet he wife pretend that he have a head-ach -lrb- as he might indeed with truth -rrb- and desire she to lend he she handkerchief to hold to he temple she do so not this say othello but that handkerchief i give you desdemona have it not about she -lrb- for indeed it be steal as we have relate -rrb- how say othello this be a fault indeed that handkerchief a egyptian woman give to my mother the woman be a witch and could read people 's thought she tell my mother while she keep it it would make she amiable and my father would love she but if she lose it or give it away my father 's fancy would turn and he would lothe she as much as he have love she she die give it I and bid I if i ever marry to give it to my wife i do so take heed of it make it a darling as precious as you eye be it possible say the frighted lady ` tis true : continue othello it be a magical handkerchief a sibyl that have live in the world two hundred year in a fit of prophetic fury work it the silk-worm that furnish the silk be hallowed and it be dye in mummy of maiden ' heart conserve desdemona hear the wondrous virtue of the handkerchief be ready to die with fear for she plainly perceive she have lose it and with it she fear the affection of she husband then othello start and look as if he be go to do some rash thing and still he demand the handkerchief which when she could not produce she try to divert she husband from too serious thought and cheerfully tell he she see all he talk about the handkerchief be only to put she off from she suit about michael cassio whom she go on to praise -lrb- as iago have foretell -rrb- till othello in perfect distraction burst out of the room and then desdemona though unwillingly begin to suspect she lord be jealous what cause she could have minister to he she know not and then she accuse herself for accuse the noble othello and think to be sure that some untoward news from venice or some state trouble have puddle he spirit and make he temper not so sweet as formerly and she say man be not god and we must not look for that observance from they when they be marry which they shew we on the bridal day and she beshrew herself for so unkindly judge of he unkindness again othello and desdemona meet and he accuse she more plainly of be unfaithful and of loving another man but he do not name whom : and othello weep and desdemona say alas the heavy day why do you weep and othello tell she he could have bear all sort of evil with fortitude -- poverty and disease and disgrace but she infidelity have break he heart : and he call she a weed that look so fair and smell so sweet that the sense ache at it and wish she have never be bear and when he have leave she this innocent lady be so stupefied with wonder at she lord 's untrue suspicion of she that a weight-like sleep come over she and she only desire she attendant to make she bed and to lay she wedding-sheet upon it say that when people teach they babe they do it by gentle means and easy task and othello might have chide she so for in good faith she be but a child when she be chidden and this be all the complaint which this gentle lady make desdemona be retire to bed expect she lord would follow she soon fall into a slumber the effect of she troubled spirit when othello enter the chamber full of the black purpose which he have meditate of put he lady to death but when he see she asleep he think he would not shed she blood nor scar that white skin of hers more white than alabaster but he be resolve she should die else -lrb- as he say -rrb- she would live to betray more man as she have do he then he kiss she for the last time -lrb- as he say -rrb- and that kiss be so sweet he must need kiss she again : and he weep but he say they be cruel tear desdemona be awaken with he kiss and she look upon othello and she see he gnaw he under-lip and roll he eye and she know he be always fatal when he look so : and he bid she prepare for death and to say she prayer for he would not kill she soul and this innocent wife as she lay at he mercy beg for compassion and to know she fault and then he name cassio and the handkerchief which -lrb- he say -rrb- she have give he and as the guiltless lady be proceed to clear herself he suddenly would hear no more but cover she up in the bed-clothes stifle she till she die in this instant of time be bring into the house cassio wound and bleeding whom iago have set one of he creature on to assassinate but the fellow not succeed in he attempt to kill cassio -lrb- whom he wound but not mortally -rrb- and be himself kill by iago to prevent discovery in he pocket be find certain letter which make the guilt of iago and the innocence of cassio clear beyond all doubt and cassio now come to beg pardon of othello and to ask wherein he have offend he that he have employ iago to murder he this discovery be as a thunderstroke to othello who now plainly see that he be no better than a murderer and that he wife -lrb- poor innocent lady -rrb- have be ever faithful to he the extreme anguish of which discovery make life insupportable he fall upon he sword and throw himself upon the body of he dear injured lady expire these rash act raise much passion of horror and amazement in the by-stander for othello have bear a fair reputation and till he be work upon by the art of a villain which he own noble nature never give he leave to suspect he be a loving and a doting husband he have love not wisely but too well and he manly eye -lrb- when he learn he mistake -rrb- though not use to weep on every small occasion dropt tear as fast as the arabian tree they gum and when he be dead all he former merit and he valiant act be remembered nothing now remain for he successor but to put the utmost censure of the law in force against iago who be execute with strict torture and to send word to the state of venice of the lamentable death of they renowned general pericle prince of tyre -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- pericle prince of tyre become a voluntary exile from he dominion to avert the

sell become rich by the money she earn for he she teach music dancing and fine needle work and the money she get by she scholar she give to she master and mistress and the fame of she learning and she great industry come to the knowledge of lysimachus a young nobleman who be the governor of metaline and lysimachus go himself to the house where marina dwelt to see this paragon of excellence whom all the city praise so highly she conversation delighted lysimachus beyond measure for though he have hear much of this admire maiden he do not expect to find she so sensible a lady so virtuous and so good as he perceive marina to be and he leave she say he hope she would persevere in she industrious and virtuous course and that if ever she hear from he again it should be for she good lysimachus think marina such a miracle for sense fine breeding and excellent quality as well as for beauty and all outward grace that he wish to marry she and notwithstanding she humble situation he hope to find that she birth be noble but ever when they ask she parentage she would sit still and weep meantime at tharsus leoline fear the anger of dionysium tell she he have kill marina and that wicked woman give out that she be dead and make a pretended funeral for she and erect a stately monument and shortly after pericle accompany by he loyal minister hellicanus make a voyage from tyre to tharsus on purpose to see he daughter intend to take she home with he and he never have behold she since he leave she a infant in the care of cleon and he wife how do this good prince rejoice at the thought of see this dear child of he bury queen but when they tell he marina be dead and show the monument they have erect for she great be the misery this most wretched father endure and not be able to bear the sight of that country where he last hope and only memory of he dear thaisa be entomb he take ship and hastily depart from tharsus from the day he enter the ship a dull and heavy melancholy seize he he never speak and seem totally insensible to every thing around he sail from tharsus to tyre the ship in its course pass by metaline where marina dwelt the governor of which place lysimachus observe this royal vessel from the shore and desirous of know who be on board go in a barge to the side of the ship to satisfy he curiosity hellicanus receive he very courteously and tell he that the ship come from tyre and that they be conduct thither pericle they prince a man sir say hellicanus who have not speak to any one these three month nor take any sustenance but just to prolong he grief it would be tedious to repeat the whole ground of he distemper but the main spring from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife lysimachus beg to see this afflict prince and when he behold pericle he see he have be once a goodly person and he say to he sir king all hail the god preserve you hail royal sir but in vain lysimachus speak to he pericle make no answer nor do he appear to perceive any stranger approach and then lysimachus bethought he of the peerless maid marina that haply with she sweet tongue she might win some answer from the silent prince : and with the consent of hellicanus he send for marina and when she enter the ship in which she own father sit motionless with grief they welcome she on board as if they have know she be they princess and they cry she be a gallant lady lysimachus be well pleased to hear they commendation and he say she be such a one that be i well assure she come of noble birth i would wish no better choice and think I rarely bless in a wife and then he address she in courtly term as if the lowly-seeming maid have be the high-born lady he wish to find she call _ she fair and beautiful marina _ tell she a great prince on board that ship have fall into a sad and mournful silence and as if marina have the power of confer health and felicity he beg she would undertake to cure the royal stranger of he melancholy sir say marina i will use my utmost skill in he recovery provide none but i and my maid be suffer to come near he she who at metaline have so carefully conceal she birth ashamed to tell that one of royal ancestry be now a slave first begin to speak to pericle of the wayward change in she own fate tell he from what a high estate herself have fall as if she have know it be she royal father she stand before all the word she speak be of she own sorrow but she reason for so do be that she know nothing more win the attention of the unfortunate than the recital of some sad calamity to match they own the sound of she sweet voice arouse the droop prince he lift up he eye which have be so long fix and motionless and marina who be the perfect image of she mother present to he amaze sight the feature of he dead queen the long-silent prince be once more hear to speak my dearest wife say the awaken pericle be like this maid and such a one might my daughter have be my queen 's square brow she stature to a inch as

blood be you no fairy speak on where be you bear and wherefore call marina she reply i be call marina because i be bear at sea my mother be the daughter of a king she die the minute i be bear as my good nurse lychorida have often tell I weep the king my father leave I at tharsus till the cruel wife of cleon seek to murder I a crew of pirate come and rescue I and bring I here to metaline but good sir why do you weep it may be you think I a impostor but indeed sir i be the daughter to king pericle if good king pericle be live then pericle terrify as it seem at he own sudden joy and doubtful if this could be real loudly call for he attendant who rejoice at the sound of they beloved king 's voice and he say to hellicanus o hellicanus strike I give I a gash put I to present pain lest this great sea of joy rush upon I overbear the shore of my mortality o come hither thou that wast bear at sea bury at tharsus and find at sea again o hellicanus down on you knee thank the holy god this be marina now blessing on thee my child give I fresh garment mine own hellicanus she be not dead at tharsus as she should have be by the savage dionysium she shall tell you all when you shall kneel to

embrace you sir say pericle give I my robe i be well with beholding -- o heaven bless my girl but hark what music be that -- for now either send by some kind god or by he own delighted fancy deceive he seem to hear soft music my lord i hear none reply hellicanus none say pericle why it be the music of the sphere as there be no music to be hear lysimachus conclude that the sudden joy have unsettle the prince 's understanding and he say it be not good to cross he let he have he way : and then they tell he they hear the music and he now complain of a drowsy slumber come over he lysimachus persuade he to rest on a couch and place a pillow under he head he quite overpower with excess of joy sink into a sound sleep and marina watch in silence by the couch of she sleeping parent while he sleep pericle dream a dream which make he resolve to go to ephesus he dream be that diana the goddess of the ephesian appear to he and command he to go to she temple at ephesus and there before she altar to declare the story of he life and misfortune and by she silver bow she swear that if he perform she injunction he should meet with some rare felicity when he awake be miraculously refresh he tell he dream and that he resolution be to obey the bidding of the goddess then lysimachus invite pericle to come on shore and refresh himself with such entertainment as he should find at metaline which courteous offer pericle accept agree to tarry with he for the space of a day or two during which time we may well suppose what feasting what rejoicing what costly shew and entertainment the governor make in metaline to greet the royal father of he dear marina whom in she obscure fortune he have so respect nor do pericle frown upon lysimachus 's suit when he understand how he have honor he child in the day of she low estate and that marina shew herself not averse to he proposal only he make it a condition before he give he consent that they should visit with he the shrine of the ephesian diana : to whose temple they shortly after all three undertake a voyage and the goddess herself fill they sail with prosperous wind after a few week they arrive in safety at ephesus there be stand near the altar of the goddess when pericle with he train enter the temple the good cerimon -lrb- now grow very aged -rrb- who have restore thaisa the wife of pericle to life and thaisa now a priestess of the temple be stand before the altar and though the many year he have pass in sorrow for she loss have much altered pericle thaisa think she know she husband 's feature and when he approach the altar and begin to speak she remember he voice and listen to he word with wonder and a joyful amazement and these be the word that pericle speak before the altar : hail diana to perform thy just command i here confess myself the prince of tyre who fright from my country at pentapoli wed the fair thaisa : she die at sea in childbed but bring forth a maid-child call marina the maid at tharsus be nurse with dionysium who at fourteen year think to kill she but she better star bring she to metaline by whose shore as i sail she good fortune bring this child on board where by she most clear remembrance she make herself know to be my daughter thaisa unable to bear the transport which he word have raise in she cry out you be you be o royal pericle -- and faint what mean this woman say pericle : she die help gentleman sir say cerimon if you have tell diana 's altar true this be you wife reverend gentleman no say pericle : i throw she overboard with these very arm cerimon then recount how early one tempestuous morning this lady be throw upon the ephesian shore how open the coffin he find therein rich jewel and a paper how happily he recover she and place she here in diana 's temple and now thaisa be restore from she swoon say o my lord be you not pericle like he you speak like he you be do you not name a tempest a birth and death he astonish say the voice of dead thaisa that thaisa be i she reply suppose dead and drown o true diana exclaim pericle in a passion of devout astonishment and now say thaisa i know you better such a ring as i see on you finger do the king my father give you when we with tear part from he at pentapoli enough you god cry pericle you present kindness make my past misery sport o come thaisa be bury a second time within these arm and marina say my heart leap to be go into my mother 's bosom then do pericles shew he daughter to she mother say look who kneel here flesh of thy flesh thy burthen at sea and call marina because she be yield there blest and my own say thaisa : and while she hang in rapturous joy over she child pericle knelt before the altar say pure diana bless thee for thy vision for this i will offer oblation nightly to thee and then and there do pericle with the consent of thaisa solemnly affiance they daughter the virtuous marina to the well-deserving lysimachus in marriage thus have we see in pericle he queen and daughter a famous example of virtue assail by calamity -lrb- through the sufferance of heaven to teach patience and constancy to man -rrb- under the same guidance become finally successful and triumphing over chance and change in hellicanus we have behold a notable pattern of truth of faith and loyalty who when he might have succeed to a throne choose rather to recall the rightful owner to he possession than to become great by another 's wrong in the worthy cerimon who restore thaisa to life we be instruct how goodness direct by knowledge in bestow benefit upon mankind approach to the nature of the god it only remain to be tell that dionysium the wicked wife of cleon meet with a end proportionable to she desert the inhabitant of tharsus when she cruel attempt upon marina be know rise in a body to revenge the daughter of they benefactor and set fire to the palace of cleon burnt both he and she and they whole household : the god seem well pleased that so foul a murder

danger which a wise fortitude must expect to encounter in its course through this world the fiction contain in it will be find to comprehend some of the most admire invention of grecian mythology the ground-work of the story be as old as the odyssey but the moral and the coloring be comparatively modern by avoid the prolixity which mark the speech and the description in homer i have gain a rapidity to the narration which i hope will make it more attractive and give it more the air of a romance to young reader though i be sensible that by the curtailment i have sacrifice in many place the manners to the passion the subordinate characteristic to the essential interest of the story the attempt be not to be consider as seek a comparison with any of the direct translation of the odyssey either in prose or verse though if i be to state the obligation which i have have to one obsolete version -lrb- 1 -rrb- i should run the hazard of deprive myself of the very slender degree of reputation which i could hope to acquire from a trifle like the present undertaking -lrb- footnote 1 : the translation of homer by chapman in the reign of jame i iii -- 16 -rrb- chapter i _ the cicon

he follower in they return from troy after the destruction of that famous city of asia by the grecian he be inflamed with a desire of see again after a ten year absence he wife and native country ithaca he be king of a barren spot and a poor country in comparison of the fruitful plain of asia which he be leave or the wealthy kingdom which he touch upon in he return yet wherever he come he could never see a soil which appear in he eye half so sweet or desirable as he country earth this make he refuse the offer of the goddess calypso to stay with she and partake of she immortality in the delightful island and this give he strength to break from the enchantment of circe the daughter of the sun from troy ill wind cast ulyss and he fleet upon the coast of the cicon a people hostile to the grecian land he force he lay siege to they chief city ismarus which he take and with it much spoil and slew many people but success prove fatal to he for he soldier elate with the spoil and the good store of provision which they find in that place fall to eat and drink forgetful of they safety till the cicon who inhabit the coast have time to assemble they friend and ally from the interior who muster in prodigious force set upon the grecian while they negligently revel and feast and slew many of they and recover the spoil they dispirit and thin in they number with difficulty make they retreat good to the ship thence they set sail sad at heart yet something cheer that with such fearful odds against they they have not all be utterly destroy a dreadful tempest ensue which for two night and two day toss they about but the third day the weather clear and they have hope of a favourable gale to carry they to ithaca but as they double the cape of malea suddenly a north wind arise drive they back as far as cythera after that for the space of nine day contrary wind continue to drive they in a opposite direction to the point to which they be bind and the tenth day they put in at a shore where a race of man dwell that be sustain by the fruit of the loto tree here ulyss send some of he man to land for fresh water who be meet by certain of the inhabitant that give they some of they country food to eat not with any ill intention towards they though in the event it prove pernicious for have eat of this fruit so pleasant it prove to they appetite that they in a minute quite forget all thought of home or of they countryman or of ever return back to the ship to give a account of what sort of inhabitant dwell there but they would need stay and live there among they and eat of that precious food for ever and when ulyss send other of he man to look for they and to bring they back by force they strive and weep and would not leave they food for heaven itself so much the pleasure of that enchanting fruit have bewitch they but ulyss cause they to be bind hand and foot and cast under the hatch and set sail with all possible speed from that baneful coast lest other after they might taste the loto which have such strange quality to make man forget they native country and the thought of home coast on all that night by unknown and out of the way shore they come by day-break to the land where the cyclops dwell a sort of giant shepherd that neither sow nor plough but the earth unfilled produce for they rich wheat and barley and grape yet they have neither bread nor wine nor know the art of cultivation nor care to know they : for they live each man to himself without law or government or any thing like a state or kingdom but they dwelling be in cave on the steep head of mountain every man 's household govern by he own caprice or not govern at all they wife and child as lawless as themselves none caring for other but each do as he or she think good ship or boat they have none nor artificer to make they no trade or commerce or wish to visit other shore yet they have convenient place for harbor and for shipping here ulyss with a choose party of twelve follower land to explore what sort of man dwell there whether hospitable and friendly to stranger or altogether wild and savage for as yet no dweller appear in sight the first sign of habitation which they come to be a giant 's cave rudely fashion but of a size which betoken the vast proportion of its owner the pillar which support it be the body of huge oak or pine in the natural state of the tree and all about show more mark of strength than skill in whoever build it ulyss enter in admire the savage contrivance and artless structure of the place and long to see the tenant of so outlandish a mansion but well conjecture that gift would have more avail in extract courtesy than strength could succeed in force it from such a one as he expect to find the inhabitant he resolve to flatter he hospitality with a present of greek wine of which he have store in twelve great vessel so strong that no one ever drink it without a infusion of twenty part of water to one of wine yet the fragrance of it even then so delicious that it would have vex a man who smell it to abstain from tasting it but whoever taste it it be able to raise he courage to the height of heroic deed take with they a goat-skin flaggon full of this precious liquor they venture into the recess of the cave here they please themselves a whole day with behold the giant 's kitchen where the flesh of sheep and goat lay strew he dairy where goat-milk stand range in trough and pail he pen where he keep he live animal but those he have drive forth to pasture with he when he go out in the morning while they be feast they eye with a sight of these curiosity they ear be suddenly deafen with a noise like the fall of a house it be the owner of the cave who have be abroad all day feed he flock as he custom be in the mountain and now drive they home in the evening from pasture he throw down a pile of firewood which he have be gather against supper-time before the mouth of the cave which occasion the crash they hear the grecian hide themselves in the remote part of the cave at sight of the uncouth monster it be polyphemus the largest and savagest of the cyclops who boast himself to be the son of neptune he look more like a mountain crag than a man and to he brutal body he have a brutish mind answerable he drive he flock all that give milk to the interior of the cave but leave the ram and the he-goat without then take up a stone so massy that twenty ox could not have draw it he place it at the mouth of the cave to defend the entrance and sit he down to milk he ewe and he goat which do he lastly kindle a fire and throw he great eye round the cave -lrb- for the cyclops have no more than one eye and that place in the midst of they forehead -rrb- by the glimmering light he discern some of ulyss 's man ho guest what be you merchant or wander thief he bellow out in a voice which take from they all power of reply it be so astounding only ulyss summon resolution to answer that they come neither for plunder nor traffick but be grecian who have lose they way return from troy which famous city under the conduct of agamemnon the renowned son of atreus they have sack and lay level with the ground yet now they prostrate themselves humbly before he foot whom they acknowledge to be mightier than they and besought he that he would bestow the rite of hospitality upon they for that jove be the avenger of wrong do to stranger and would fiercely resent any injury which they might suffer fool say the cyclop to come so far to preach to I the fear of the god we cyclop care not for you jove whom you fable to be nurse by a goat nor any of you bless one we be stronger than they and dare bid open battle to jove himself though you and all you fellow of the earth join with he and he bid they tell he where they ship be in which they come and whether they have any companion but ulyss with a wise caution make answer that they have no ship or companion but be unfortunate man whom the sea splitting they ship in piece have dash upon he coast and they alone have escape he reply nothing but gripe two of the nearest of they as if they have be no more than child he dash they brain out against the earth and -lrb- shocking to relate -rrb- tear in piece they limb and devour they yet warm and tremble make a lion 's meal of they lap the blood : for the cyclops be _ man-eater _ and esteem human flesh to be a delicacy far above goat 's or kid 's though by reason of they abhorred custom few man approach they coast except some straggler or now and then a ship-wrecked mariner at a sight so horrid ulyss and he man be like distract people he when he have make a end of he wicked supper drain a draught of goat 's milk down he prodigious throat and lay down and sleep among he goat then ulyss draw he sword and half resolve to thrust it with all he might in at the bosom of the sleep monster but wiser thought restrain he else they have there without help all perish for none but polyphemus himself could have remove that mass of stone which he have place to guard the entrance so they be constrain to abide all that night in fear when day come the cyclop awake and kindle a fire make he breakfast of two other of he unfortunate prisoner then milk he goat as he be accustomed and push aside the vast stone and shut it again when he have do upon the prisoner with as much ease as a man open and shut a quiver 's lid he let out he flock and drive they before he with whistling -lrb- as sharp as wind in storm -rrb- to the mountain then ulyss of whose strength or cunning the cyclop seem to have have as little heed as of a infant 's be leave alone with the remnant of he man which the cyclop have not devour give manifest proof how far manly wisdom excel brutish force he choose a stake from among the wood which the cyclop have pile up for firing in length and thickness like a mast which he sharpen and harden in the fire and select four man and instruct they what they should do with this stake and make they perfect in they part when the evening be come the cyclop drive home he sheep and as fortune direct it either of purpose or that he memory be overrule by the god to he hurt -lrb- as in the issue it prove -rrb- he drive the male of he flock contrary to he custom along with the dam into the pen then shutting-to the stone of the cave he fall to he horrible supper when he have dispatch two more of the grecian ulyss wax bold with the contemplation of he project and take a bowl of greek wine and merrily dare the cyclop to drink cyclop he say take a bowl of wine from the hand of you guest : it may serve to digest the man 's flesh that you have eat and shew what drink we ship hold before it go down all i ask in recompence if you find it good be to be dismiss in a whole skin truly you must look to have few visitor if you observe this new custom of eat you guest the brute take and drink and vehemently enjoy the taste of wine which be new to he and swill again at the flaggon and entreat for more and pray ulyss to tell he he name that he might bestow a gift upon the man who have give he such brave liquor the cyclops -lrb- he say -rrb- have grape but this rich juice -lrb- he swear -rrb- be simply divine again ulyss ply he with the wine and the fool drink it as fast as he pour out and again he ask the name of he benefactor which ulyss cunningly dissemble say my name be noman : my kindred and friend in my own country call I noman then say the cyclop this be the kindness i will show thee noman : i will eat thee last of all thy friend he have scarce express he savage kindness when the fume of the strong wine overcome he and he reel down upon the floor and sink into a dead sleep ulyss watch he time while the monster lay insensible and hearten up he man they place the sharp end of the stake in the fire till it be heat red-hot and some god give they a courage beyond that which they be use to have and the four man with difficulty bore the sharp end of the huge stake which they have heat red-hot right into the eye of the drunken cannibal and ulyss help to thrust it in with all he might still further and further with effort as man bear with a auger till the scald blood gush out and the eye-ball smoked and the string of the eye crack as the burning rafter break in it and the eye hiss as hot iron hiss when it be plunge into water he wake roar with the pain so loud that all the cavern break into clap like thunder they flee and disperse into corner he pluck the burning stake from he eye and hurl the wood madly about the cave then he cry out with a mighty voice for he brethren the cyclops that dwell hard by in cavern upon hill they hear the terrible shout come flock from all part to inquire what ail polyphemus and what cause he have for make such horrid clamor in the night-time to break they sleep if he fright proceed from any mortal if strength or craft have give he he death 's blow he make answer from within that noman have hurt he noman have kill he noman be with he in the cave they reply if no man have hurt thee and no man be with thee then thou art alone and the evil that afflict thee be from the hand of heaven which none can resist or help so they leave he and go they way think that some disease trouble he he blind and ready to split with the anguish of the pain go groan up and down in the dark to find the door-way which when he find he remove the stone and sit in the threshold feeling if he could lay hold on any man go out with the sheep which -lrb- the day now break -rrb- be begin to issue forth to they accustomed pasture but ulyss whose first artifice in give himself that ambiguous name have succeed so well with the cyclop be not of a wit so gross to be catch by that palpable device but cast about in he mind all the way which he could contrive for escape -lrb- no less than all they life depend on the success -rrb- at last he think of this expedient he make knot of the osier twig upon which the cyclop commonly sleep with which he tie the fattest and fleeciest of the ram together three in a rank and under the belly of the middle ram he tie a man and himself last wrap himself fast with both he hand in the rich wool of one the fairest of the flock and now the sheep begin to issue forth very fast the male go first the female unmilked stand by bleat and require the hand of they shepherd in vain to milk they they full bag sore with be unemptied but he much sorer with the loss of sight still as the male pass he feel the back of those fleecy fool never dream that they carry he enemy under they belly : so they pass on till the last ram come load with he wool and ulyss together he stop that ram and feel he and have he hand once in the hair of ulyss yet know it not and he chide the ram for be last and speak to it as if it understand he and ask it whether it do not wish that its master have he eye again which that abominable noman with he execrable rout have put out when they have get he down with wine and he will the ram to tell he whereabouts in the cave he enemy lurk that he might dash he brain and strew they about to ease he heart of that torment revenge which rankle in it after a deal of such foolish talk to the beast he let it go when ulyss find himself free he let go he hold and assist in disengage he friend the ram which have befriend they they carry off with they to the ship where they companion with tear in they eye receive they as man escape from death they ply they oar and set they sail and when they be get as far off from shore as a voice would reach ulyss cry out to the cyclop : cyclop thou should ` st not have so much abused thy monstrous strength as to devour thy guest jove by my hand send thee requital to pay thy savage inhumanity the cyclop hear and come forth enraged and in he anger he pluck a fragment of a rock and throw it with blind fury at the ship it narrowly escape lighting upon the bark in which ulyss sit but with the fall it raise so fierce a ebb as bear back the ship till it almost touch the shore cyclop say ulyss if any ask thee who impose on thee that unsightly blemish in thine eye say it be ulysses son of laerte : the king of ithaca be i call the waster of city then they crowd sail and beat the old sea and forth they go with a forward gale sad for fore-past loss yet glad to have escape at any rate till they come to the isle where æolus reign who be god of the wind here ulyss and he man be courteously receive by the monarch who shew he he twelve child which have rule over the twelve wind a month they staid and feast with he and at the end of the month he dismiss they with many present and give to ulyss at parting a ox 's hide in which be inclose _ all the wind _ : only he leave abroad the western wind to play upon they sail and waft they gently home to ithaca this bag bind in a glitter silver band so close that no breath could escape ulyss hang up at the mast he companion do not know its contents but guess that the monarch have give to he some treasure of gold or silver nine day they sail smoothly favor by the western wind and by the tenth they approach so nigh as to discern light kindle on the shore of they country earth : when by ill fortune ulyss overcome with fatigue of watch the helm fall asleep the mariner seize the opportunity and one of they say to the rest : a fine time have this leader of ours : wherever he go he be sure of present when we come away empty-handed and see what king æolus have give he store no doubt of gold and silver a word be enough to those covetous wretch who quick as think untie the bag and instead of gold out rush with mighty noise _ all the wind _ ulyss with the noise awake and see they mistake but too late for the ship be drive with all the wind back far from ithaca far as to the island of æolus from which they have part in one hour measure back what in nine day they have scarcely track and in sight of home too up he fly amaze and rave doubt whether he should not fling himself into the sea for grief of he bitter disappointment at last he hide himself under the hatch for shame and scarce could he be prevail upon when he be tell he be arrive again in the harbor of king æolus to go himself or send to that monarch for a second succor so much the disgrace of have misuse he royal bounty -lrb- though it be the crime of he follower and not he own -rrb- weigh upon he : and when at last he go and take a herald with he and come where the god sit on he throne feast with he child he would not thrust in among they at they meat but set himself down like one unworthy in the threshold indignation seize æolus to behold he in that manner return and he say ulyss what have bring you back be you so soon tired of you country or do not we present please you we think we have give you a kingly passport ulyss make answer my man have do this ill mischief to I : they do it while i sleep wretch say æolus avaunt and quit we shore : it fit not we to convoy man whom the god hate and will have perish forth they sail but with far different hope than when they leave the same harbor the first time with all the wind confine only the west-wind suffer to play upon they sail to waft they in gentle murmur to ithaca they be now the sport of every gale that blow and despair of ever see home more now those covetous mariner be cure of they surfeit for gold and would not have touch it if it have lie in untold heap before they six day and night they drive along and on the seventh day they put in to lamo a port of the læstrygonians so spacious this harbor be that it hold with ease all they fleet which ride at anchor safe from any storm all but the ship in which ulyss be embark he as if prophetic of the mischance which follow keep still without the harbor make fast he bark to a rock at the land 's point which he climb with purpose to survey the country he see a city with smoke ascend from the roof but neither plough go nor oxen yoke nor any sign of agricultural work make choice of two man he send they to the city to explore what sort of inhabitant dwell there he messenger have not go far before they meet a damsel of stature surpass human who be come to draw water from a spring they ask she who dwell in that land she make no reply but lead they in silence to she father 's palace he be a monarch and name antipha he and all he people be giant when they enter the palace a woman the mother of the damsel but far taller than she rush abroad and call for antipha he come and snatch up one of the two man make as if he would devour he the other flee antipha raise a mighty shout and instantly this way and that multitude of gigantic people issue out at the gate and make for the harbor tear up huge piece of the rock and fling they at the ship which lay there all which they utterly overwhelm and sink and the unfortunate body of man which float and which the sea do not devour these cannibal thrust through with harpoon like fish and bear they off to they dire feast ulyss with he single bark that have never enter the harbor escape that bark which be now the only vessel left of all the gallant navy that have set sail with he from troy he push off from the shore cheer the sad remnant of he man whom horror at the sight of they countryman 's fate have almost turn to marble chapter ii _ the house of circe -- man change into beast -- the voyage to hell -- the banquet of the dead _ on go the single ship till it come to the island of ææa where circe the dreadful daughter of the sun dwelt she be deeply skilled in magic a haughty beauty and have hair like the sun the sun be she parent and beget she and she brother æastes -lrb- such another as herself -rrb- upon perse daughter to oceanus here a dispute arise among ulyss 's man which of they should go ashore and explore the country for there be a necessity that some should go to procure water and provision they stock of both be nigh spend : but they heart fail they when they call to mind the shocking fate of they fellow whom the læstrygonians have eat and those which the foul cyclop polyphemus have crush between he jaw which move they so tenderly in the recollection that they weep but tear never yet supply any man 's want this ulyss know full well and divide he man -lrb- all that be leave -rrb- into two company at the head of one of which be himself and at the head of the other eurylochus a man of try courage he cast lot which of they should go up into the country and the lot fall upon eurylochus and he company two and twenty in number who take they leave with tear of ulyss and he man that staid whose eye wear the same wet badge of weak humanity for they surely think never to see these they companion again but that on every coast where they should come they should find nothing but savage and cannibal eurylochus and he party proceed up the country till in a dale they descry the house of circe build of bright stone by the road 's side before she gate lay many beast as wolf lion leopard which by she art of wild she have render tame these arise when they see stranger and ramp upon they hinder paw and fawn upon eurylochus and he man who dread the effect of such monstrous kindness and stay at the gate they hear the enchantress within sit at she loom singing such strain as suspend all mortal faculty while she weave a web subtle and glorious and of texture inimitable on earth as all the housewifery of the deity be strain so ravishingly sweet provoke even the sagest and prudentest head among the party to knock and call at the gate the shine gate the enchantress open and bad they come in and feast they unwise follow all but eurylochus who staid without the gate suspicious that some train be lay for they be enter she place they in chair of state and set before they meal and honey and smyrna wine but mixed with baneful drug of powerful enchantment when they have eat of these and drunk of she cup she touch they with she charming-rod and straight they be transform into swine have the body of swine the bristle and snout and grunt noise of that animal only they still retain the mind of man which make they the more to lament they brutish transformation have change they she shut they up in she sty with many more whom she wicked sorcery have formerly change and give they swine 's food mast and acorn and chestnut to eat eurylochus who behold nothing of these sad change from where he be station without the gate only instead of he companion that enter -lrb- who he think have all vanish by witchcraft -rrb- behold a herd of swine hurry back to the ship to give a account of what he have see : but so frightened and perplexed that he could give no distinct report of any thing only he remember a palace and a woman singing at she work and gate guard by lion but he companion he say be all vanish then ulyss suspect some foul witchcraft snatch he sword and he bow and command eurylochus instantly to lead he to the place but eurylochus fall down and embrace he knee beseech he by the name of a man whom the god have in they protection not to expose he safety and the safety of they all to certain destruction do thou then stay eurylochus answer ulyss : eat thou and drink in the ship in safety while i go alone upon this adventure : necessity from whose law be no appeal compel I so say he quit the ship and go on shore accompany by none none have the hardihood to offer to partake that perilous adventure with he so much they dread the enchantment of the witch singly he pursue he journey till he come to the shine gate which stand before she mansion : but when he essay to put he foot over she threshold he be suddenly stopt by the apparition of a young man bear a golden rod in he hand who be the god mercury he hold ulyss by the wrist to stay he entrance and whither wouldest thou go he say o thou most err of the son of man knowest thou not that this be the house of great circe where she keep thy friend in a loathsome sty change from the fair form of man into the detestable and ugly shape of swine art thou prepare to share they fate from which nothing can ransom thee but neither he word nor he come from heaven could stop the daring foot of ulyss whom compassion for the misfortune of he friend have render careless of danger : which when the god perceive he have pity to see valor so misplace and give he the flower of the herb _ moly _ which be sovereign against enchantment the moly be a small unsightly root its virtue but little known and in low estimation the dull shepherd tread on it every day with he clouted shoe : but it bear a small white flower which be medicinal against charm blight mildew and damp -- take this in thy hand say mercury and with it boldly enter she gate : when she shall strike thee with she rod think to change thee as she have change thy friend boldly rush in upon she with thy sword and extort from she the dreadful oath of the god that she will use no enchantment against thee : then force she to restore thy abused companion he give ulyss the little white flower and instruct he how to use it vanish when the god be depart ulyss with loud knocking beat at the gate of the palace the shine gate be open as before and great circe with hospitable cheer invite in she guest she place he on a throne with more distinction than she have use to he fellow she mingle wine in a costly bowl and he drink of it mixed with those poisonous drug when he have drunk she strike he with she charming-rod and to you sty she cry out swine mingle with you companion but those powerful word be not proof against the preservative which mercury have give to ulyss he remain unchanged and as the god have direct he boldly charge the witch with he sword as if he mean to take she life : which when she see and perceive that she charm be weak against the antidote which ulyss bear about he she cry out and bent she knee beneath he sword embrace he and say who or what manner of man art thou never drink any man before thee of this cup but he repent it in some brute 's form thy shape remain unaltered as thy mind thou canst be none other than ulyss renown above all the world for wisdom whom the fate have long since decree that i must love this haughty bosom bend to thee o ithacan a goddess woo thee to she bed o circe he reply how canst thou treat of love or marriage with one whose friend thou hast turn into beast and now offerest he thy hand in wedlock only that thou mightest have he in thy power to live the life of a beast with thee naked effeminate subject to thy will perhaps to be advance in time to the honor of a place in thy sty what pleasure canst thou promise which may tempt the soul of a reasonable man thy meat spice with poison or thy wine drug with death thou must swear to I that thou wilt never attempt against I the treason which thou hast practice upon my friend the enchantress win by the terror of he threat or by the violence of that new love which she feel kindling in she vein for he swear by styx the great oath of the god that she meditate no injury to he then ulyss make shew of gentler treatment which give she hope of inspiring he with a passion equal to that which she feel she call she handmaid four that serve she in chief who be daughter to she silver fountain to she sacred river and to she consecrated wood to deck she apartment to spread rich carpet and set out she silver table with dish of the purest gold and meat as precious as that which the god eat to entertain she guest one bring water to wash he foot and one bring wine to chase away with a refreshing sweetness the sorrow that have come of late so thick upon he and hurt he noble mind they strew perfume on he head and after he have bath in a bath of the choicest aromatic they bring he rich and costly apparel to put on then he be conduct to a throne of massy silver and a regale fit for jove when he banquet be place before he but the feast which ulyss desire be to see he friend -lrb- the partner of he voyage -rrb- once more in the shape of man and the food which could give he nourishment must be take in at he eye because he miss this sight he sit melancholy and thoughtful and would taste of none of the rich delicacy place before he which when circe note she easily divine the cause of he sadness and leave the seat in which she sit throned go to she sty and let abroad he man who come in like swine and fill the ample hall where ulyss sit with grunting hardly have he time to let he sad eye run over they altered form and brutal metamorphosis when with a ointment which she smear over they suddenly they bristle fall off and they start up in they own shape man as before they know they leader again and cling about he with joy of they late restoration and some shame for they late change and weep so loud blubber out they joy in broken accent that the palace be fill with a sound of please mourning and the witch herself great circe be not unmoved at the sight to make she atonement complete she send for the remnant of ulyss 's man who staid behind at the ship give up they great commander for lose who when they come and see he again alive circle with they fellow no expression can tell what joy they feel they even cry out with rapture and to have see they frantic expression of mirth a man might have suppose that they be just in sight of they country earth the cliff of rocky ithaca only eurylochus would hardly be persuade to enter that palace of wonder for he remember with a kind of horror how he companion have vanish from he sight then great circe spake and give order that there should be no more sadness among they nor remember of past suffering for as yet they fare like man that be exile from they country and if a gleam of mirth shot among they it be suddenly quench with the thought of they helpless and homeless condition she kind persuasion work upon ulyss and the rest that they spend twelve month in all manner of delight with she in she palace for circe be a powerful magician and could command the moon from she sphere or unroot the solid oak from its place to make it dance for they diversion and by the help of she illusion she could vary the taste of pleasure and contrive delight recreation and jolly pastime to fetch the day about from sun to sun and rock the tedious year as in a delightful dream at length ulyss awake from the trance of the faculty into which she charm have throw he and the thought of home return with tenfold vigor to goad and sting he that home where he have leave he virtuous wife penelope and he young son telemachus one day when circe have be lavish of she caress and be in she kindest humor he move to she subtilly and as it be afar off the question of he home-return to which she answer firmly o ulyss it be not in my power to detain one whom the god have destine to further trial but leave I before you pursue you journey home you must visit the house of ade or death to consult the shade of tiresia the theban prophet to whom alone of all the dead proserpine queen of hell have commit the secret of future event : it be he that must inform you whether you shall ever see again you wife and country o circe he cry that be impossible : who shall steer my course to pluto 's kingdom never ship have strength to make that voyage seek no guide she reply but raise you you mast and hoist you white sail and sit in you ship in peace : the north wind shall waft you through the sea till you shall cross the expanse of the ocean and come to where grow the poplar grove and willow pale of proserpine : where pyriphlegethon and cocytus and acheron mingle they wave cocytus be a arm of styx the forgetful river here dig a pit and make it a cubit broad and a cubit long and pour in milk and honey and wine and the blood of a ram and the blood of a black ewe and turn away thy face while thou pourest in and the dead shall come flock to taste the milk and the blood : but suffer none to approach thy offering till thou hast enquire of tiresia all which thou wishest to know he do as great circe have appoint he raise he mast and hoist he white sail and sit in he ship in peace the north wind waft he through the sea till he cross the ocean and come to the sacred wood of proserpine he stand at the confluence of the three flood and dig a pit as she have give direction and pour in he offer the blood of a ram and the blood of a black ewe milk and honey and wine and the dead come to he banquet : aged man and woman and youth and child who die in infancy but none of they would he suffer to approach and dip they thin lip in the offering till tiresia be serve not though he own mother be among the number whom now for the first time he know to be dead for he have leave she living when he go to troy and she have die since he departure and the tiding never reach he : though it irk he soul to use constraint upon she yet in compliance with the injunction of great circe he force she to retire along with the other ghost then tiresia who bear a golden sceptre come and lap of the offering and immediately he know ulyss and begin to prophesy : _ he denounce woe to ulyss woe woe and many suffering through the anger of neptune for the put out of the eye of the sea-god 's son yet there be safety after suffer if they could abstain from slaughter the ox of the sun after they land in the triangular island for ulyss the god have destine he from a king to become a beggar and to perish by he own guest unless he slew those who know he not _ this prophecy ambiguously deliver be all that tiresia be empower to unfold or else there be no longer place for he for now the soul of the other dead come flock in such number tumultuously demand the blood that freezing horror seize the limb of the living ulyss to see so many and all dead and he the only one alive in that region now he mother come and lap the blood without restraint from she son and now she know he to be she son and enquire of he why he have come alive to they comfortless habitation and she say that affliction for ulyss 's long absence have prey upon she spirit and bring she to the grave ulyss 's soul melt at she move narration and forget the state of the dead and that the airy texture of disembodied spirit do not admit of the embrace of flesh and blood he throw he arm about she to clasp she : the poor ghost melt from he embrace and look mournfully upon he vanish away then see he other female -- tyro who when she live be the paramour of neptune and by he have pelia and neleus antiope who bear two like son to jove amphion and zethus founder of thebe alcmena the mother of hercule with she fair daughter afterwards she daughter-in-law megara there also ulyss saw jocasta the unfortunate mother and wife of oedipus who ignorant of kin wed with she son and when she have discover the unnatural alliance for shame and grief hang herself he continue to drag a wretched life above the earth haunt by the dreadful fury -- there be leda the wife of tyndarus the mother of the beautiful helen and of the two brave brother castor and pollux who obtain this grace from jove that be dead they should enjoy life alternately live in pleasant place under the earth for pollux have pray that he brother castor who be subject to death as the son of tyndarus should partake of he own immortality which he derive from a immortal sire : this the fate deny therefore pollux be permit to divide he immortality with he brother castor die and live alternately -- there be iphimedeium who bear two son to neptune that be giant otus and ephialte : earth in she prodigality never nourish body to such portentous size and beauty as these two child be of except orion at nine year old they have imagination of climb to heaven to see what the god be do they think to make stair of mountain and be for pile os upon olympus and set pelion upon that and have perhaps perform it if they have live till they be stripling but they be cut off by death in the infancy of they ambitious project -- phædra be there and procri and ariadne mournful for theseus 's desertion and mæra and clymene and eryphile who prefer gold before wedlock faith but now come a mournful ghost that late be agamemnon son of atreus the mighty leader of all the host of greece and they confederate king that war against troy he come with the rest to sip a little of the blood at that uncomfortable banquet ulyss be move with compassion to see he among they and ask he what untimely fate have bring he there if storm have overwhelm he come from troy or if he have perish in some mutiny by he own soldier at a division of the prey by none of these he reply do i come to my death but slay at a banquet to which i be invite by ægisthus after my return home he conspire with my adulterous wife they lay a scheme for my destruction training I forth to a banquet as a ox go to the slaughter and there surround I they slew I with all my friend about I clytemnestra my wicked wife forget the vow which she swear to I in wedlock would not lend a hand to close my eye in death but nothing be so heap with impiety as such a woman who would kill she spouse that marry she a maid when i bring she home to my house a bride i hope in my heart that she would be loving to I and to my child now she black treachery have cast a foul aspersion on she whole sex blest husband will have they loving wife in suspicion for she bad deed alas say ulyss there seem to be a fatality in you royal house of atreus and that they be hate of jove for they wife for helen 's sake you brother menelaus 's wife what multitude fall in the war of troy agamemnon reply for this cause be not thou more kind than wise to any woman let not thy word express to she at any time all that be in thy mind keep still some secret to thyself but thou by any bloody contrivance of thy wife never needst fear to fall exceed wise she be and to she wisdom she have a goodness as eminent icarius 's daughter penelope the chaste : we leave she a young bride when we part from we wife to go to the war she first child suckling at she breast the young telemachus whom you shall see grow up to manhood on you return and he shall greet he father with befitting welcome my oreste my dear son i shall never see again he mother have deprive he father of the sight of he and perhaps will slay he as she slew he sire it be now no world to trust a woman in -- but what say fame be my son yet alive life he in orchoman or in pylus or be he resident in sparta in he uncle 's court as yet i see divine oreste be not here with I to this ulyss reply that he have receive no certain tiding where oreste abide only some uncertain rumor which he could not report for truth while they hold this sad conference with kind tear strive to render unkind fortune more palatable the soul of great achille join they what desperate adventure have bring ulyss to these region say achille to see the end of dead man and they foolish shades ulyss answer he that he have come to consult tiresia respect he voyage home but thou o son of theti say he why dost thou disparage the state of the dead see that as alive thou didst surpass all man in glory thou must need retain thy pre-eminence here below : so great achilles triumph over death but achille make reply that he have much rather be a peasant-slave upon the earth than reign over all the dead so much do the inactivity and slothful condition of that state displease he unquenchable and restless spirit only he enquire of ulyss if he father peleus be live and how he son neoptolemus conduct himself of peleus ulyss could tell he nothing but of neoptolemus he thus bear witness : from scyro i convoyed you son by sea to the greek : where i can speak of he for i know he he be chief in council and in the field when any question be propose so quick be he conceit in the forward apprehension of any case that he ever speak first and be hear with more attention than the older head only myself and aged nestor could compare with he in give advice in battle i can not speak he praise unless i could count all that fall by he sword i will only mention one instance of he manhood

bark move of itself without the help of any oar and soon bring he out of the region of death into the cheerful quarter of the living and to the island of ææa whence he have set forth chapter iii _ the song of the siren -- scyllum and charybdi -- the ox of the sun -- the judgment -- the crew kill by lightning _ unhappy man who at thy birth wast appoint twice to die other shall die once but thou besides that death that remain for thee common to all man hast in thy life-time visit the shades of death thee scyllum thee charybdi expect thee the deathful siren lie in wait for that taint the mind of whoever listen to they with they sweet singing whosoever shall but hear the call of any siren he will so despise both wife and child through they sorcery that the stream of he affection never again shall set homeward nor shall he take joy in wife or child thereafter or they in he with these prophetic greeting great circe meet ulyss on he return he beseech she to instruct he in the nature of the siren and by what method they baneful allurement be to be resist they be sister three she reply that sit in a mead -lrb- by which you ship must need pass -rrb- circle with dead man 's bone these be the bone of man whom they have slay after with fawn invitement they have entice they into they fen yet such be the celestial harmony of they voice accompany the persuasive magic of they word that know this you shall not be able to withstand they enticement therefore when you be to sail by they you shall stop the ear of you companion with wax that they may hear no note of that dangerous music but for yourself that you may hear and yet live give they strict command to bind you hand and foot to the mast and in no case to set you free till you be out of the danger of the temptation though you should entreat it and implore it ever so much but to bind you rather the more for you request to be loose so shall you escape that snare ulyss then pray she that she would inform he what scyllum and charybdi be which she have teach he by name to fear she reply : sailing from ææa to trinacria you must pass at a equal distance between two fatal rock incline never so little either to the one side or the other and you ship must meet with certain destruction no vessel ever yet try that pass without be lose but the argo which owe she safety to the sacred freight she bear the fleece of the golden-backed ram which could not perish the biggest of these rock which you shall come to scyllum have in charge there in a deep whirlpool at the foot of the rock the abhorred monster shroud she face who if she be to shew she full form no eye of man or god could endure the sight : thence she stretch out all she six long neck peer and diving to suck up fish dolphin dog-fish and whale whole ship and they man whatever come within she rage gulf the other rock be lesser and of less ominous aspect but there dreadful charybdi sit sup the black deep thrice a day she drink she pit dry and thrice a day again she belch they all up : but when she be drink come not nigh for be once catch the force of neptune can not redeem you from she swallow better trust to scyllum for she will but have for she six neck six man : charybdi in she insatiate draught will ask all then ulyss enquire in case he should escape charybdi whether he might not assail that other monster with he sword : to which she reply that he must not think that he have a enemy subject to death or wound to contend with : for scyllum could never die therefore he best safety be in flight and to invoke none of the god but crati who be scyllum 's mother and might perhaps forbid she daughter to devour they for he conduct after he arrive at trinacrium she refer he to the admonition which have be give he by tiresia ulyss have communicate she instruction as far as related to the siren to he companion who have not be present at that interview but conceal from they the rest as he have do the terrible prediction of tiresia that they might not be deter by fear from pursue they voyage : the time for departure be come they set they sail and take a final leave of great circe who by she art calm the heaven and give they smooth sea and a right fore wind -lrb- the seaman 's friend -rrb- to bear they on they way to ithaca they have not sail past a hundred league before the breeze which circe have lend they suddenly stop it be stricken dead all the sea lay in prostrate slumber not a gasp of air could be feel the ship stand still ulyss guess that the island of the siren be not far off and that they have charm the air so with they devilish singing therefore he make he cake of wax as circe have instruct he and stop the ear of he man with they : then cause himself to be bind hand and foot he command the rower to ply they oar and row as fast as speed could carry they past that fatal shore they soon come within sight of the siren who sing in ulyss ' hearing : come here thou worthy of a world of praise that dost so high the grecian glory raise ulyss stay thy ship and that song hear that none past ever but it bent he ear but leave he ravish would and instruct more by we than any ever hear before for we know all

bond to rush after they and threaten weep sue entreated command cry out with tear and passionate imprecation conjure he man by all the tie of peril past which they have endure in common by fellowship and love and the authority which he retain among they to let he loose but at no rate would they obey he and still the siren sing ulyss make sign motion gesture promising mountain of gold if they would set he free but they oar only move faster and still the siren sing and still the more he adjure they to set he free the faster with cord and rope they bind he till they be quite out of hearing of the siren ' note whose effect great circe have so truly predict and well she might speak of they for often she have join she own enchanting voice to theirs while she have sit in the flowery mead mingle with the siren and the water nymph gather they potent herb and drug of magic quality : they singing altogether have make the god stoop and heaven drowsy with the harmony escape that peril they have not sail yet a hundred league further when they hear a roar afar off which ulyss know to be the bark of scyllum 's dog which surround she waist and bark incessantly come nearer they behold a smoke ascend with a horrid murmur which arise from that other whirlpool to which they make nigher approach than to scyllum through the furious eddy which be in that place the ship stand still as a stone for there be no man to lend he hand to a oar the dismal roar of scyllum 's dog at a distance and the nearer clamor of charybdi where everything make a echo quite take from they the power of exertion ulyss go up and down encourage he man one by one give they good word tell they that they be in greater peril when they be block up in the cyclop 's cave yet heaven assist he counsel he have deliver they out of that extremity that he could not believe but they remember it and wish they to give the same trust to the same care which he have now for they welfare that they must exert all the strength and wit which they have and try if jove would not grant they a escape even out of this peril in particular he cheer up the pilot who sit at the helm and tell he that he must shew more firmness than other man as he have more trust commit to he and have the sole management by he skill of the vessel in which all they safety be embark that a rock lay hide within those boil whirlpool which he see on the outside of which he must steer if he would avoid he own destruction and the destruction of they all they hear he and like man take to the oar but little know what opposite danger in shun that rock they must be throw upon for ulyss have conceal from they the wound never to be heal which scyllum be to open : they terror would else have rob they all of all care to steer or move a oar and have make they hide under the hatch for fear of see she where he and they must have die a idle death but even then he forget the precaution which circe have give he to prevent harm to he person who have will he not to arm or shew himself once to scyllum : but disdain not to venture life for he brave companion he could not contain but arm in all point and take a lance in either hand he go up to the fore deck and look when scyllum would appear she do not shew herself as yet and still the vessel steer closer by she rock as it seek to shun that other more dreaded : for they see how horribly charybdi 's black throat draw into she all the whirling deep which she disgorge again that all about she boil like a kettle and the rock roar with troubled water which when she sup in again all the bottom turn up and disclose far under shore the swart sand naked whose whole stern sight fray the startle blood from they face and make ulyss turn he to view the wonder of whirlpool which when scyllum see from out she black den she dart out she six long neck and swoopt up as many of he friend : whose cry ulyss hear and see they too late with they heel turn up and they hand throw to he for succor who have be they help in all extremity but could not deliver they now and he hear they shriek out as she tear they and to the last they continue to throw they hand out to he for sweet life in all he suffering he never have behold a sight so full of misery escape from scyllum and charybdi but with a diminish crew ulyss and the sad remains of he follower reach the trinacrian shore here land he behold oxen grazing of such surpassing size and beauty that both from they and from the shape of the island -lrb- have three promontory jut into the sea -rrb- he judge rightly that he be come to the triangular island and the ox of the sun of which tiresia have forewarn he so great be he terror lest through he own fault or that of he man any violence or profanation should be offer to the holy ox that even then tire as they be with the peril and fatigue of the day past and unable to stir a oar or use any exertion and though night be fast come on he would have have they re-embark immediately and make the best of they way from that dangerous station but he man with one voice resolutely oppose it and even the too cautious eurylochus himself withstand the proposal so much do the temptation of a little ease and refreshment -lrb- ease tenfold sweet after such labor -rrb- prevail over the sagest counsel and the apprehension of certain evil outweigh the prospect of contingent danger they expostulate that the nerve of ulyss seem to be make of steel and he limb not liable to lassitude like other man 's that wake or sleep seem indifferent to he but that they be man not god and feel the common appetite for food and sleep that in the nighttime all the wind most destructive to ship be generate that black night still require to be serve with meat and sleep and quiet haven and ease that the best sacrifice to the sea be in the morning with such sailor-like saying and mutinous argument which the majority have always ready to justify disobedience to they betters they force ulyss to comply with they requisition and against he will to take up he night-quarter on shore but he first exact from they a oath that they would neither maim nor kill any of the cattle which they see grazing but content themselves with such food as circe have stow they vessel with when they part from ææa this they man by man severally promise imprecate the heaviest curse on whoever should break it and moor they bark within a creek they go to supper content themselves that night with such food as circe have give they not without many sad thought of they friend whom scylla have devour the grief of which keep they great part of the night wake in the morning ulyss urge they again to a religious observance of the oath that they have swear not in any case to attempt the blood of those fair herd which they see grazing but to content themselves with the ship 's food for the god who own those cattle see and hear all they faithfully obey and remain in that good mind for a month during which they be confine to that station by contrary wind till all the wine and the bread be go which they have bring with they when they victuals be go necessity compel they to stray in quest of whatever fish or fowl they could snare which that coast do not yield in any great abundance then ulyss pray to all the god that dwell in bountiful heaven that they would be please to yield they some means to stay they hunger without have recourse to profane and forbid violation : but the ear of heaven seem to be shut or some god incensed plot he ruin for at mid-day when he should chiefly have be vigilant and watchful to prevent mischief a deep sleep fall upon the eye of ulyss during which he lay totally insensible of all that pass in the world and what he friend or what he enemy might do for he welfare or destruction then eurylochus take he advantage he be the man of most authority with they after ulyss he represent to they all the misery of they condition how that every death be hateful and grievous to mortality but that of all death famine be attend with the most painful loathsome and humiliating circumstance that the subsistence which they could hope to draw from fowling or fishing be too precarious to be depend upon that there do not seem to be any chance of the wind change to favor they escape but that they must inevitably stay there and perish if they let a irrational superstition deter they from the means which nature offer to they hand that ulyss might be deceive in he belief that these ox have any sacred quality above other ox and even admit that they be the property of the god of the sun as he say they be the sun do neither eat nor drink and the god be best serve not by a scrupulous conscience but by a thankful heart which take freely what they as freely offer : with these and such like persuasion he prevail on he half-famished and half-mutinous companion to begin the impious violation of they oath by the slaughter of seven of the fairest of these ox which be grazing part they roasted and eat and part they offer in sacrifice to the god particularly to apollo god of the sun vow to build a temple to he godhead when they should arrive in ithaca and deck it with magnificent and numerous gift : vain man and superstition worse than that which they so lately deride to imagine that prospective penitence can excuse a present violation of duty and that the pure nature of the heavenly power will admit of compromise or dispensation for sin but to they feast they fall divide the roasted portion of the flesh savoury and pleasant meat to they but a sad sight to the eye and a savor of death in the nostril of the wake ulyss who just wake in time to witness but not soon enough to prevent they rash and sacrilegious banquet he have scarce time to ask what great mischief be this which they have do unto he when behold a prodigy the ox-hide which they have strip begin to creep as if they have life and the roasted flesh bellow as the ox use to do when he be live the hair of ulyss stand up on end with affright at these omen but he companion like man whom the god have infatuate to they destruction persist in they horrible banquet the sun from he burn chariot see how ulyss 's man have slay he ox and he cry to he father jove revenge I upon these impious man who have slay my ox which it do I good to look upon when i walk my heavenly round in all my daily course i never see such bright and beautiful creature as those my ox be the father promise that ample retribution should be take of those accursed man : which be fulfil shortly after when they take they leaf of the fatal island six day they feast in spite of the sign of heaven and on the seventh the wind change they set they sail and leave the island and they heart be cheerful with the banquet they have hold all but the heart of ulyss which sink within he as with wet eye he behold he friend and give they for lose as man devote to divine vengeance which soon overtake they : for they have not go many league before a dreadful tempest arise which burst they cable down come they mast crush the scull of the pilot in its fall off he fall from the stern into the water and the bark want he management drive along at the wind 's mercy : thunder roar and terrible lightning of jove come down first a bolt strike eurylochus then another and then another till all the crew be kill and they body swim about like sea-mew and the ship be split in piece : only ulyss survive and he have no hope of safety but in tie himself to the mast where he sit ride upon the wave like one that in no extremity would yield to

of they fierce contention and rise from the wave alight on the ship in shape like to the sea-bird which be call a cormorant and in she beak she hold a wonderful girdle make of sea-weed which grow at the bottom of the ocean which she dropt at he foot and the bird spake to ulyss and counsel he not to trust any more to that fatal vessel against which god neptune have level he furious wrath nor to those ill-befriending garment which calypso have give he but to quit both it and they and trust for he safety to swimming and here say the seeming bird take this girdle and tie about you middle which have virtue to protect the wearer at sea and you shall safely reach the shore but when you have land cast it far from you back into the sea he do as the sea-bird instruct he he strip himself naked and fasten the wondrous girdle about he middle cast himself into the sea to swim the bird dive past he sight into the fathomless abyss of the ocean two day and two night he spend in struggle with the wave though sore buffet and almost spend never give up himself for lose such confidence he have in that charm which he wear about he middle and in the word of that divine bird but the third morning the wind grow calm and all the heaven be clear then he see himself nigh land which he know to be the coast of the phæacians a people good to stranger and abound in ship by whose favor he doubt not that he should soon obtain a passage to he own country and such joy he conceive in he heart as good son have that esteem they father 's life dear when long sickness have hold he down to he bed and waste he body and they see at length health return to the old man with restore strength and spirit in reward of they many prayer to the god for he safety : so precious be the prospect of home-return to ulyss that he might restore health to he country -lrb- he better parent -rrb- that have long languish as full of distemper in he absence and then for he own safety 's sake he have joy to see the shore the wood so nigh and within he grasp as they seem and he labor with all the might of hand and foot to reach with swimming that nigh-seeming land but when he approach near a horrid sound of a huge sea beat against rock inform he that here be no place for landing nor any harbor for man 's resort but through the weed and the foam which the sea belch up against the land he could dimly discover the rugged shore all bristle with flint and all that part of the coast one impend rock that seem impossible to climb and the water all about so deep that not a sand be there for any tired foot to rest upon and every moment he fear lest some wave more cruel than the rest should crush he against a cliff render worse than vain all he landing : and should he swim to seek a more commodious haven further on he be fearful lest weak and spend as he be the wind would force he back a long way off into the main where the terrible god neptune for wrath that he have so nearly escape he power have get he again into he domain would send out some great whale -lrb- of which those sea breed a horrid number -rrb- to swallow he up alive with such malignity he still pursue he while these thought distract he with diversity

fall off and could sustain no longer : quite under water he fall and past the help of fate there have the hapless ulyss lose all portion that he have in this life if minerva have not prompt he wisdom in that peril to essay another course and to explore some other shelter cease to attempt that landing-place she guide he wearied and nigh-exhausted limb to the mouth of the fair river callicoe which not far from thence disburse its watery tribute to the ocean here the shore be easy and accessible and the rock which rather adorn than defend its bank so smooth that they seem polish of purpose to invite the landing of we sea-wanderer and to atone for the uncourteous treatment which those less hospitable cliff have afford he and the god of the river as if in pity stay he current and smooth he water to make he landing more easy : for sacred to the ever-living deity of the fresh water be they mountain-stream river or lake be the cry of err mortal that seek they aid by reason that be inland-bred they partake more of the gentle humanities of we nature than those marine deity whom neptune train up in tempest in the unpitying recess of he salt abyss so by the favor of the river 's god ulyss creep to land half-drowned both he knee falter he strong hand fall down through weakness from the excessive toil he have endure he cheek and nostril flow with froth of the sea-brine much of which he have swallow in that conflict voice and breath spend down he sink as in death dead weary he be it seem that the sea have soak through he heart and the pain he feel in all he vein be little less than those which one feel that have endure the torture of the rack but when he spirit come a little to themselves and he recollection by degree begin to return he rise up and unloose from he waist the girdle or charm which that divine bird have give he and remember the charge which he have receive with it he fling it far from he into the river back it swim with the course of the ebbing stream till it reach the sea where the fair hand of ino leucothea receive it to keep it as a pledge of safety to any future shipwrecked mariner that like ulyss should wander in those perilous wave then he kiss the humble earth in token of safety and on he go by the side of that pleasant river till he come where a thicker shade of rush that grow on its bank seem to point out the place where he might rest he sea-wearied limb and here a fresh perplexity divide he mind whether he should pass the night which be come on in that place where though he fear no other enemy the damp and frost of the chill sea-air in that expose situation might be death to he in he weak state or whether he have better climb the next hill and pierce the depth of some shady wood in which he might find a warm and sheltered though insecure repose subject to the approach of any wild beast that roam that way best do this last course appear to he though with some danger as that which be more honorable and savor more of strife and self-exertion than to perish without a struggle the passive victim of cold and the element so he bent he course to the nearest wood where enter in he find a thicket mostly of wild olive and such low tree yet grow so intertwine and knit together that the moist wind have not leave to play through they branch nor the sun 's scorching beam to pierce they recess nor any shower to beat through they grow so thick and as it be fold each in the other : here creep in he make he bed of the leaf which be begin to fall of which be such abundance that two or three man might have spread they ample covering such as might shield they from the winter 's rage though the air breathe steel and blow as it would burst here creep in he heap up store of leaf all about he as a man would billet upon a winter fire and lay down in the midst rich seed of virtue lie hide in poor leaf here minerva soon give he sound sleep and here all he long toil past seem to be conclude and shut up within the little sphere of he refresh and close eyelid chapter vi _ the princess nausicaa -- the wash -- the game with the ball -- the court of phæacia and king alcinous _ meantime minerva design a interview between the king 's daughter of that country and ulyss when he should awake go by night to the palace of king alcinous and stand at the bedside of the princess nausicaa in the shape of one of she

become to toss the ball send it so far from its mark that it fall beyond into one of the cistern of the river : at which the whole company in merry consternation set up a shriek so loud as wake the sleep ulyss who be take he rest after he long toil in the wood not far distant from the place where these young maid have come to wash at the sound of female voice ulyss creep forth from he retirement make himself a cover with bough and leave as well as he could to shroud he nakedness the sudden appearance of he weather-beaten and almost naked form so fright the maiden that they scud away into the wood and all about to hide themselves only minerva -lrb- who have bring about this interview to admirable purpose by seemingly accidental means -rrb- put courage into the breast of nausicaa and she stay where she be and resolve to know what manner of man he be and what be the occasion of he strange come to they he not venture -lrb- for delicacy -rrb- to approach and clasp she knee as suppliant should but stand far off address this speech to the young princess : before i presume rudely to press my petition i should first ask whether i be address a mortal woman or one of the goddess if a goddess you seem to I to be likest to diana the chaste huntress the daughter of jove like hers be you lineament you stature you feature and air divine she make answer that she be no goddess but a

you only to that a stupor past admiration strike I join with fear which keep I back from approach you to embrace you knee nor be it strange for one of freshest and firmest spirit would falter approach near to so bright a object : but i be one whom a cruel habit of calamity have prepare to receive strong impression twenty day the unrelenting sea have toss I up and down come from ogygium and at length cast I ship-wrecked last night upon you coast i have see no man or woman since i land but yourself all that i crave be clothes which you may spare I and to be show the way to some neighbouring town the god who have care of stranger will requite you for these courtesy she admire to hear such complimentary word proceed out of the mouth of one whose outside look so rough and unpromising make answer : stranger i discern neither sloth nor folly in you and yet i see that you be poor and wretched : from which i gather that neither wisdom nor industry can secure felicity only jove bestow it upon whomsoever he please he perhaps have reduce you to this plight however since you wanderings have bring you so near to we city it lie in we duty to supply you want clothes and what else a human hand should give to one so suppliant and so tame with calamity you shall not want we will shew you we city and tell you the name of we people this be the land of the phæacians of which my father alcinous be king then call she attendant who have disperse on the first sight of ulyss she rebuke they for they fear and say : this man be no cyclop nor monster of sea or land that you should fear he but he seem manly staid and discreet and though decay in he outward appearance yet he have the mind 's riches wit and fortitude in abundance show he the cistern where he may wash he from the sea-weed and foam that hang about he and let he have garment that fit he out of those which we have bring with we to the cistern ulyss retire a little out of sight cleanse he in the cistern from the soil and impurity with which the rock and wave have cover all he body and clothing himself with befitting raiment which the princess 's attendant have give he he present himself in more worthy shape to nausicaa she admire to see what a comely personage he be now he be dress in all part she think he some king or hero : and secretly wish that the god would be please to give she such a husband then cause she attendant to yoke she mule and lay up the vestment which the sun 's heat have sufficiently dry in the coach she ascend with she maid and drive off to the palace bidding ulyss as she depart keep a eye upon the coach and to follow it on foot at some distance : which she do because if she have suffer he to have ride in the coach with she it might have subject she to some misconstruction of the common people who be always ready to vilify and censure they betters and to suspect that charity be not always pure charity but that love or some sinister intention lie hide under its disguise so discreet and attentive to appearance in all she action be this admirable princess ulyss as he enter the city wonder to see its magnificence its market building temple its wall and rampire its trade and resort of man its harbor for shipping which be the strength of the phæacian state but when he approach the palace and behold its riches the proportion of its architecture its avenue garden statue fountain he stand rapt in admiration and almost forget he own condition in survey the flourishing estate of other : but recollect himself he pass on boldly into the inner apartment where the king and queen be sit at dinner with they peer nausicaa have prepare they for he approach to they humbly kneel he make it he request that since fortune have cast he naked upon they shore they would take he into they protection and grant he a conveyance by one of the ship of which they great phæacian state have such good store to carry he to he own country have deliver he request to grace it with more humility he go and sit himself down upon the hearth among the ash as the custom be in those day when any would make a petition to the throne he seem a petitioner of so great state and of so superior a deportment that alcinous himself arise to do he honor and cause he to leave that abject station which he have assume place he next to he throne upon a chair of state and thus he speak to he peer : lord and counsellor of phæacia ye see this man who he be we know not that be come to we in the guise of a petitioner : he seem no mean one but whoever he be it be fit since the god have cast he upon we protection that we grant he the rite of hospitality while he stay with we and at he departure a ship well man to convey so worthy a personage as he seem to be in a manner suitable to he rank to he own country this counsel the peer with one consent approve and wine and meat be set before ulyss he eat and drink and give the god thanks who have stir up the royal bounty of alcinous to aid he in that extremity but not as yet do he reveal to the king and queen who he be or whence he have come only in brief term he relate he be cast upon they shore he sleep in the wood and he meeting with the princess nausicaa : whose generosity mingle with discretion fill she parent with delight as ulyss in eloquent phrase adorn and commend she virtue but alcinous humanely consider that the trouble which he guest have undergo require rest as well as refreshment by food dismiss he early in the evening to he chamber where in a magnificent apartment ulyss find a smoother bed but not a sounder repose than he have enjoy the night before sleep upon leaf which he have scrape together in he necessity chapter vii _ the song of demodocus -- the convoy home -- the mariner transform to stone -- the young shepherd _ when it be day-light alcinous cause it to be proclaim by the herald about the town that there be come to the palace a stranger shipwreck on they coast that in mien and person resemble a god : and invite all the chief people of the city to come and do honor to the stranger the palace be quickly fill with guest old and young for whose cheer and to grace ulyss more alcinous make a kingly feast with banqueting and music then ulyss be seat at a table next the king and queen in all man 's view after they have feast alcinous order demodocus the court-singer to be call to sing some song of the deed of hero to charm the ear of he guest demodocus come and reach he harp where it hang between two pillar of silver : and then the blind singer to whom in recompense of he lose sight the muse have give a inward discernment a soul and a voice to excite the heart of man and god to delight begin in grave and solemn strain to sing the glory of man highliest famed he choose a poem whose subject be the stern strife stir up between ulyss and great achille as at a banquet sacred to the god in dreadful language they express they difference while agamemnon sit rejoice in soul to hear those grecian jar : for the oracle in pytho have tell he that the period of they war in troy should then be when the king of greece anxious to arrive at the wish conclusion should fall to strife and contend which must end the war force or stratagem this brave contention he express so to the life in the very word which they both use in the quarrel as bring tear into the eye of ulyss at the remembrance of past passage of he life and he hold he large purple weed before he face to conceal it then craving a cup of wine he pour it out in secret libation to the god who have put into the mind of demodocus unknowingly to do he so much honor but when the move poet begin to tell of other occurrence where ulyss have be present the memory of he brave follower who have be with he in all difficulty now swallow up and lose in the ocean and of those king that have fight with he at troy some of whom be dead some exile like himself force itself so strongly upon he mind that forgetful where he be he sob outright with passion which yet he restrain but not so cunningly but alcinous perceive it and without take notice of it to ulyss privately give sign that demodocus should cease from he singing next follow dancing in the phæacian fashion when they would shew respect to they guest which be succeed by trial of skill game of strength run racing hurl of the quoit mock fight hurl of the javelin shooting with the bow : in some of which ulyss modestly challenge he entertainer perform such feat of strength and prowess as give the admire phæacians fresh reason to imagine that he be either some god or hero of the race of the god these solemn show and pageant in honor of he guest king alcinous continue for the space of many day as if he could never be weary of shew courtesy to so worthy a stranger in all this time he never ask he he name nor seek to know more of he than he of he own accord disclose : till on a day as they be seat feast after the feast be end demodocus be call as be the custom to sing some grave matter sing how ulyss on that night when troy be fire make dreadful proof of he valor maintain singly a combat against the whole household of deiphobus to which the divine expresser give both act and passion and breathe such a fire into ulyss 's deed that it inspire old death with life in the lively expressing of slaughter and render life so sweet and passionate in the hearer that all who hear feel it fleet from they in the narration : which make ulyss even pity he own slaughterous deed and feel touch of remorse to see how song can revive a dead man from the grave yet no way can it defend a living man from death : and in imagination he undergo some part of death 's horror and feel in he living body a taste of those die pang which he have deal to other that with the strong conceit tear -lrb- the true interpreter of unutterable emotion -rrb- stand in he eye which king alcinous note and that this be now the second time that he have perceive he to be move at the mention of event touch the trojan war he take occasion to ask whether he guest have lose any friend or kinsman at troy that demodocus 's singing have bring into he mind then ulyss dry the tear with he cloak and observe that the eye of all the company be upon he desirous to give they satisfaction in what he could and think this a fit time to reveal he true name and destination speak as follow : the courtesy which ye all have shewn I and in particular yourself and princely daughter o king alcinous demand from I that i should no longer keep you in ignorance of what or who i be for to reserve any secret from you who have with such openness of friendship embrace my love would argue either a pusillanimous or a ungrateful mind in I know then that i be that _ ulyss _ of whom i perceive ye have hear something who heretofore have fill the world with the renown of my policy i be he by whose counsel if fame be to be believe at all more than by the unite valor of all the grecian troy fall i be that unhappy man whom the heaven and angry god have conspire to keep a exile on the sea wander to seek my home which still fly from I the land which i be in quest of be ithaca in whose port some ship belong to you navigation-famed phæacian state may haply at some time have find a refuge from tempest if ever you have experience such kindness requite it now by grant to I who be the king of that land a passport to that land admiration seize all the court of alcinous to behold in they presence one of the number of those hero who fight at troy whose divine story have be make know to they by song and poem but of the truth they have little known or rather they have hitherto account those heroic exploit as fiction and exaggeration of poet but have see and make proof of the real ulyss they begin to take those suppose invention to be real verity and the tale of troy to be as true as it be delightful then king alcinous make answer : thrice fortunate ought we to esteem we lot in have see and converse with a man of whom report have speak so loudly but as it seem nothing beyond the truth though we could desire no felicity greater than to have you always among we renowned ulyss yet you desire have be express so often and so deeply to return home we can deny you nothing though to we own loss we kingdom of phæacia as you know be chiefly rich in shipping in all part of the world where there be navigable sea or ship can pass we vessel will be find you can not name a coast to which they do not resort every rock and every quick-sand be know to they that lurk in the vast deep they pass a bird in flight and with such unerring certainty they make to they destination that some have say that they have no need of pilot or rudder but that they move instinctively self-directed and know the mind of they voyager thus much that you may not fear to trust yourself in one of we phæacian ship to-morrow if you please you shall launch forth to-day spend with we in feast who never can do enough when the god send such visitor ulyss acknowledge king alcinous 's bounty and while these two royal personage stand interchange courteous expression the heart of the princess nausicaa be overcome : she have be gaze attentively upon she father 's guest as he deliver he speech but when he come to that part where he declare himself to be ulyss she bless herself and she fortune that in relieve a poor ship-wrecked mariner as he seem no better she have confer a kindness on so divine a hero as he prove : and scarce wait till she father have do speak with a cheerful countenance she address ulyss bid he be cheerful and when he return home as by she father 's means she trust he would shortly sometimes to remember to whom he owe he life and who meet he in the wood by the river callicoe fair flower of phæacia he reply so may all the god bless I with the strife of joy in that desire day whenever i shall see it as i shall always acknowledge to be indebted to you fair hand for the gift of life which i enjoy and all the blessing which shall follow upon my home-return the god give thee nausicaa a princely husband and from you two spring blessing to this state so pray ulyss he heart overflow with admiration and grateful recollection of king alcinous 's daughter then at the king 's request he give they a brief relation of all the adventure that have befall he since he launch forth from troy : during which the princess nausicaa take great delight -lrb- as lady be commonly take with these kind of traveller ' story -rrb- to hear of the monster polyphemus of the man that devour each other in læstrygonia of the enchantress circe of scyllum and the rest to which she listen with a breathless attention let fall a shower of tear from she fair eye every now and then when ulyss tell of some more than usual distressful passage in he travels : and all the rest of he auditor if they have before entertain a high respect for they guest now feel they veneration increase ten-fold when they learn from he own mouth what peril what sufferance what endurance of evil beyond man 's strength to support this much-sustaining almost heavenly man by the greatness of he mind and by he invincible courage have struggle through the night be far spend before ulyss have end he narrative and with wishful glance he cast he eye towards the eastern part which the sun have begin to flecker with he first red : for on the morrow alcinous have promise that a bark should be in readiness to convoy he to ithaca in the morning a vessel well man and appoint be wait for he into which the king and queen heap present of gold and silver massy plate apparel armor and whatsoever thing of cost or rarity they judge would be most acceptable to they guest : and the sail be set ulyss embark with expression of regret take he leave of he royal entertainer of the fair princess -lrb- who have be he first friend -rrb- and of the peer of phæacia who crowd down to the beach to have the last sight of they illustrious visitant behold the gallant ship with all she canvas spread bound and curvett over the wave like a horse proud of he rider or as if she know that in she capacious womb 's rich freightage she bear ulyss he whose life past have be a series of disquiet in sea among rude wave in battle amongst ruder foe now sleep securely forget all he eye-lid bind in such deep sleep as only yield to death : and when they reach the nearest ithacan port by the next morning he be still asleep the mariner not willing to awake he land he softly and lay he in a cave at the foot of a olive tree which make a shady recess in that narrow harbor the haunt of almost none but the sea-nymph which be call naiad few ship before this phæacian vessel have put into that haven by reason of the difficulty and narrowness of the entrance here leave he asleep and dispose in safe place near he the present with which king alcinous have dismiss he they depart for phæacia where these wretched mariner never again set foot but just as they arrive and think to salute they country earth in sight of they city 's turret and in open view of they friend who from the harbor with shout greet they return they vessel and all the mariner which be in she be turn to stone and stand transform and fix in sight of the whole phæacian city where it yet stand by neptune 's vindictive wrath who resent thus highly the contempt which those phæacians have show in convoy home a man whom the god have destine to destruction whence it come to pass that the phæacians at this day will at no price be induce to lend they ship to stranger or to become the carrier for other nation so highly do they still dread the displeasure of the sea-god while they see that terrible monument ever in sight when ulyss awake which be not till some time after the mariner have depart he do not at first know he country again either that long absence have make it strange or that minerva -lrb- which be more likely -rrb- have cast a cloud about he eye that he should have greater pleasure hereafter in discover he mistake : but like a man suddenly awake in some desart isle to which he sea-mate have transport he in he sleep he look around and discerning no known object he cast he hand to heaven for pity and complain on those ruthless man who have beguile he with a promise of convey he home to he country and perfidiously leave he to perish in a unknown land but then the rich present of gold and silver give he by alcinous which he see carefully lay up in secure place near he stagger he : which seem not like the act of wrongful or unjust man such as turn pirate for gain or land helpless passenger in remote coast to possess themselves of they goods while he remain in this suspence there come up to he a young shepherd clothe in the finer sort of apparel such as king ' son wear in those day when prince do not disdain to tend sheep who accost he be salute again by ulyss who ask he what country that be on which he have be just land and whether it be part of a continent or a island the young shepherd make show of wonder to hear any one ask the name of that land as country people be apt to esteem those for mainly ignorant and barbarous who do not know the name of place which be familiar to _ they _ though perhaps they who ask have have no opportunity of know and may have come from far country i have think say he that all people know we land it be rocky and barren to be sure but well enough : it feed a goat or a ox well it be not want neither in wine or in wheat it have good spring of water some fair river and wood enough as you may see : it be call ithaca ulyss be joy enough to find himself in he own country but so prudently he carry he joy that dissemble he true name and quality he pretend to the shepherd that he be only some foreigner who by stress of weather have put into that port and frame on the sudden a story to make it plausible how he have come from crete in a ship of phæacia when the young shepherd laughing and take ulyss 's hand in both he say to he : he must be cunning i find who think to over-reach you what can not you quit you wiles and you subtlety now that you be in a state of security must the first word with which you salute you native earth be a untruth and think you that you be unknown ulyss look again and he see not a shepherd but a beautiful woman whom he immediately know to be the goddess minerva that in the war of troy have frequently vouchsafe she sight to he and have be with he since in peril save he unseen let not my ignorance offend thee great minerva he cry or move thy displeasure that in that shape i know thee not since the skill of discerning of deity be not attainable by wit or study but hard to be hit by the wisest of mortal to know thee truly through all thy change be only give to those whom thou art pleased to grace to all man thou takest all likeness all man in they wit think that they know thee and that they have thee thou art wisdom itself but a semblance of thee which be false wisdom often be take for thee : so thy counterfeit view appear to many but thy true presence to few : those be they which loving thee above all be inspire with light from thee to know thee but this i surely know that all the time the son of greece wage war against troy i be sundry time grace with thy appearance but since i have never be able to set eye upon thee till now : but have wander at my own discretion to myself a blind guide err up and down the world want thee then minerva clear he eye and he know the ground on which he stand to be ithaca and that cave to be the same which the people of ithaca have in former time make sacred to the sea-nymph and where he himself have do sacrifice to they a thousand time and full in he view stand mount nerytus with all he wood : so that now he know for a certainty that he be arrive in he own country and with the delight which he feel he could not forbear stoop down and kiss the soil chapter viii _ the change from a king to a beggar -- eumæus and the herdsman -- telemachus _ not long do minerva suffer he to indulge vain transport but briefly recount to he the event which have take place in ithaca during he absence she shew he that he way to he wife and throne do not lie so open but that before he be reinstate in the secure possession of they he must encounter many difficulty he palace want its king be become the resort of insolent and imperious man the chief nobility of ithaca and of the neighbouring isle who in the confidence of ulyss be dead come as suitor to penelope the queen -lrb- it be true -rrb- continue single but be little better than a state-prisoner in the power of these man who under a pretence of wait she decision occupy the king 's house rather as owner than guest lord and domineering at they pleasure profane the palace and waste the royal substance with they feast and mad riot moreover the goddess tell he how fear the attempt of these lawless man upon the person of he young son telemachus she herself have put it into the heart of the prince to go and seek he father in far country how in the shape of mentor she have bear he company in he long search which though fail as she mean it should fail in its first object have yet have this effect that through hardship he have learn endurance through experience he have gather wisdom and wherever he footstep have be he have leave such memorial of he worth as the fame of ulyss 's son be already blow throughout the world that it be now not many day since telemachus have arrive in the island to the great joy of the queen he mother who have think he dead by reason of he long absence and have begin to mourn for he with a grief equal to that which she endure for ulyss : the goddess herself have so order the course of he adventure that the time of he return should correspond with the return of ulyss that they might together concert measure how to repress the power and insolence of those wicked suitor this the goddess tell he but of the particulars of he son 's adventure of he have be detain in the delightful island which he father have so lately leave of calypso and she nymph and the many strange occurrence which may be read with profit and delight in the history of the prince 's adventure she forbear to tell he as yet as judge that he would hear they with greater pleasure from the lip of he son when he should have he in a hour of stillness and safety when they work should be do and none of they enemy leave alive to trouble they then they sit down the goddess and ulyss at the foot of a wild olive-tree consulting how they might with safety bring about he restoration and when ulyss revolve in he mind how that he enemy be a multitude and he single he begin to despond and he say : i shall die a ill death like agamemnon in the threshold of my own house i shall perish like that unfortunate monarch slay by some one of my wife 's suitor but then again call to mind he ancient courage he secretly wish that minerva would but breathe such a spirit into he bosom as she enflame he with in the hour of troy 's destruction that he might encounter with three hundred of those impudent suitor at once and strew the pavement of he beautiful palace with they blood and brain and minerva know he thought and she say i will be strongly with thee if thou fail not to do thy part and for a sign between we that i will perform my promise and for a token on thy part of obedience i must change thee that thy person may not be know of man then ulyss bow he head to receive the divine impression and minerva by she great power change he person so that it might not be know she change he to appearance into a very old man yet such a one as by he limb and gait seem to have be some considerable person in he time and to retain yet some remains of he once prodigious strength also instead of those rich robe in which king alcinous have clothe he she throw over he limb such old and tattered rag as wander beggar usually wear a staff support he step and a scrip hang to he back such as travel mendicant use to hold the scrap which be give to they at rich man 's door so from a king he become a beggar as wise tiresia have predict to he in the shades to complete he humiliation and to prove he obedience by suffer she next direct he in this beggarly attire to go and present himself to he old herdsman eumæus who have the care of he swine and he cattle and have be a faithful steward to he all the time of he absence then strictly charge ulyss that he should reveal himself to no man but to he own son whom she would send to he when she see occasion the goddess go she way the transform ulyss bent he course to the cottage of the herdsman and enter in at the front court the dog of which eumæus keep many fierce one for the protection of the cattle fly with open mouth upon he as those ignoble animal have oftentimes a antipathy to the sight of any thing like a beggar and would have rent he in piece with they tooth if ulyss have not have the prudence to let fall he staff which have chiefly provoke they fury and sit himself down in a careless fashion upon the ground : but for all that some serious hurt have certainly be do to he so rage the dog be have not the herdsman whom the bark of the dog have fetch out of the house with shout and with throwing of stone repress they he say when he see ulyss old father how near you be to be tear in piece by these rude dog i should never have forgive myself if through neglect of mine any hurt have happen to you but heaven have give I so many care to my portion that i might well be excuse for not attend to every thing : while here i lie grieving and mourning for the absence of that majesty which once rule here and be force to fatten he swine and he cattle for food to evil man who hate he and who wish he death when he perhaps stray up and down the world and have not wherewith to appease hunger if indeed he yet live -lrb- which be a question -rrb- and enjoy the cheerful light of the sun this he say little thinking that he of whom he speak now stand before he and that in that uncouth disguise and beggarly obscurity be present the hidden majesty of ulyss then he have he guest into the house and set meat and drink before he and ulyss say may jove and all the other god requite you for the kind speech and hospitable usage which you have shew I eumæus make answer my poor guest if one in much worse plight than yourself have arrive here it be a shame to such scanty means as i have if i have let he depart without entertaining he to the best of my ability poor man and such as have no house of they own be by jove himself recommend to we care but the cheer which we that be servant to other man have to bestow be but sorry at most yet freely and lovingly i give it you indeed there once rule here a man whose return the god have set they face against who if he have be suffer to reign in peace and grow old among we would have be kind to I and mine but he be go and for he sake would to god that the whole posterity of helen might perish with she since in she quarrel so many worthy have perish but such as you fare be eat it and be welcome such lean beast as be food for poor herdsman the fattest go to feed the voracious stomach of the queen 's suitor shame on they unworthiness there be no day in which two or three of the noblest of the herd be not slay to support they feast and they surfeit ulyss give good ear to he word and as he eat he meat he even tear it and rent it with he tooth for mere vexation that he fat cattle should be slay to glut the appetite of those godless suitor and he say what chief or what ruler be this that thou commendest so highly and sayest that he perish at troy i be but a stranger in these part it may be i have hear of some such in my long travels eumæus answer old father never any one of all the stranger that have come to we coast with news of ulyss be alive could gain credit with the queen or she son yet these traveller to get raiment or a meal will not stick to invent any lie truth be not the commodity they deal in never do the queen get any thing of they but lie she receive all that come graciously hear they story enquire all she can but all end in tear and dissatisfaction but in god 's name old father if you have get a tale make the most o not it may gain you a cloak or a coat from somebody to keep you warm : but for he who be the subject of it dog and vulture long since have tear he limb from limb or some great fish at sea have devour he or he lieth with no better monument upon he bone than the sea-sand but for I past all the race of man be tear create : for i never shall find so kind a royal master more not if my father or my mother could come again and visit I from the tomb would my eye be so bless as they should be with the sight of he again come as from the dead in he last rest my soul shall love he he be not here nor do i name he as a flatterer but because i be thankful for he love and care which he have to I a poor man and if i know surely that he be past all shore that the sun shine upon i would invoke he as a deified thing for this say of eumæus the water stand in ulyss 's eye and he say my friend to say and to affirm positively that he can not be alive be to give too much licence to incredulity for not to speak at random but with as much solemnity as a oath come to i say to you that ulyss shall return and whenever that day shall be then shall you give to I a cloak and a coat but till then i will not receive so much as a thread of a garment but rather go naked for no less than the gate of hell do i hate that man whom poverty can force to tell a untruth be jove then witness to my word that this very year nay ere this month be fully end you eye shall behold ulyss deal vengeance in he own palace upon the wronger of he wife and he son to give the better credence to he word he amuse eumæus with a forge story of he life feigning of himself that he be a cretan bear and one that go with idomeneus to the war of troy also he say that he know ulyss and related various passage which he allege to have happen betwixt ulyss and himself which be either true in the main as have really happen between ulyss and some other person or be so like to truth as corresponding with the known character and action of ulyss that eumæus 's incredulity be not a little shake among other thing he assert that he have lately be entertain in the court of thesprotium where the king 's son of the country have tell he that ulyss have be there but just before he and be go upon a voyage to the oracle of jove in dodona whence he should shortly return and a ship would be ready by the bounty of the thesprotian to convoy he straight to ithaca and in token that what i tell you be true say ulyss if you king come not within the period which i have name you shall have leave to give you servant commandment to take my old carcase and throw it headlong from some steep rock into the sea that poor man take example by I may fear to lie but eumæus make answer that that should be small satisfaction or pleasure to he so while they sit discourse in this manner supper be serve in and the servant of the herdsman who have be out all day in the field come in to supper and take they seat at the fire for the night be bitter and frosty after supper ulyss who have well eat and drunken and be refresh with the herdsman 's good cheer be resolve to try whether he host 's hospitality would extend to the lending he a good warm mantle or rug to cover he in the night-season and frame a artful tale for the purpose in a merry mood fill a cup of greek wine he thus begin : i will tell you a story of you king ulyss and myself if there be ever a time when a man may have leave to tell he own story it be when he have drunken a little too much strong liquor driveth the fool and move even the heart of the wise move and impel he to sing and to dance and break forth in pleasant laughter and perchance to prefer a speech too which be better keep in when the heart be open the tongue will be stir but you shall hear we lead we power to ambush once under the wall of troy the herdsman crowd about he eager to hear any thing which related to they king ulyss and the war of troy and thus he go on : i remember ulyss and menelaus have the direction of that enterprise and they be please to join I with they in the command i be at that time in some repute among man though fortune have play I a trick since as you may perceive but i be somebody in those time and could do something be that as it may a bitter freezing night it be such a night as this the air cut like steel and the sleet gather on we shield like crystal there be some twenty of we that lay close couch down among the reed and bull-rush that grow in the moat that go round the city the rest of we make tolerable shift for every man have be careful to bring with he a good cloak or mantle to wrap over he armor and keep himself warm but i as it chance have leave my cloak behind I as not expect that the night would prove so cool or rather i believe because i have at that time a brave suit of new armor on which be a soldier and have some of the soldier 's vice about I _ vanity _ i be not willing should be hide under a cloak but i pay for my indiscretion with my suffering for with the inclement night and the wet of the ditch in which we lay i be well nigh freeze to death and when i could endure no longer i jog ulyss who be next to I and have a nimble ear and make known my case to he assure he that i must inevitably perish he answer in a low whisper ` hush lest any greek should hear you and take notice of you softness ' not a word more he say but shew as if he have no pity for the plight i be in but he be as considerate as he be brave and even then as he lay with he head repose upon he hand he be meditate how to relieve I without expose my weakness to the soldier at last raise up he head he make as if he have be asleep and say ` friend i have be warn in a dream to send to the fleet to king agamemnon for a supply to recruit we number for we be not sufficient for this enterprize ' and they believe he one thoa be dispatch on that errand who depart for more speed as ulyss have foresee leave he upper garment behind he a good warm mantle to which i succeed and by the help of it get through the night with credit this shift ulyss make for one in need and would to heaven that i have now that strength in my limb which make I in those day to be account fit to be a leader under ulyss i should not then want the loan of a cloak or a mantle to wrap about I and shield my old limb from the night-air the tale please the herdsman and eumæus who more than all the rest be gratify to hear tale of ulyss true or false say that for he story he deserve a mantle and a night 's lodging which he should have and he spread for he a bed of goat and sheep skin by the fire and the seeming beggar who be indeed the true ulyss lay down and sleep under that poor roof in that abject disguise to which the will of minerva have subject he when morning be come ulyss make offer to depart as if he be not willing to burthen he host 's hospitality any longer but say that he would go and try the humanity of the town 's folk if any there would bestow upon he a bit of bread or a cup of drink perhaps the queen 's suitor -lrb- he say -rrb- out of they full feast would bestow a scrap on he : for he could wait at table if need be and play the nimble serving-man he could fetch wood -lrb- he say -rrb- or build a fire prepare roast meat or boil mix the wine with water or do any of those office which recommend poor man like he to service in great man 's house alas poor guest say eumæus you know not what you speak what should so poor and old a man as you do at the suitor ' table they light mind be not give to such grave servitor they must have youth richly trick out in flow vest with curl hair like so many of jove 's cup-bearer to fill out the wine to they as they sit at table and to shift they trencher they gorge insolence would but despise and make a mock at thy age stay here perhaps the queen or telemachus hearing of thy arrival may send to thee of they bounty as he speak these word the step of one cross the front court be hear and a noise of the dog fawn and leap about as for joy by which token eumæus guess that it be the prince who hearing of a traveller be arrive at eumæus 's cottage that bring tiding of he father be come to search the truth and eumæus say : it be the tread of telemachus the son of king ulyss before he could well speak the word the prince be at the door whom ulyss rise to receive telemachus would not suffer that so aged a man as he appear should rise to do respect to he but he courteously and reverently take he by the hand and inclined he head to he as if he have surely know that it be he father indeed : but ulyss cover he eye with he hand that he might not shew the water which stand in they and telemachus say be this the man who can tell we tiding of the king my father he brag himself to be a cretan bear say eumæus and that he have be a soldier and a traveller but whether he speak the truth or not he alone can tell but whatsoever he have be what he be now be apparent such as he appear i give he to you do what you will with he he boast at present be that he be at the very best a supplicant be he what he may say telemachus i accept he at you hand but where i should bestow he i know not see that in the palace he age would not exempt he from the scorn and contempt which my mother 's suitor in they light mind would be sure to fling upon he a mercy if he escape without blow : for they be a company of evil man whose profession be wrong and violence ulyss answer : since it be free for any man to speak in presence of you greatness i must say that my heart put on a wolfish inclination to tear and to devour hear you speech that these suitor should with such injustice rage where you should have the rule solely what should the cause be do you wilfully give way to they ill manners or have you government be such as have procure ill will towards you from you people or do you mistrust you kinsfolk and friend in such sort as without trial to decline they aid a man 's kindred be they that he might trust to when extremity run high telemachus reply : the kindred of ulyss be few i have no brother to assist I in the strife but the suitor be powerful in kindred and friend the house of old arcesius have have this fate from the heaven that from old it still have be supply with single heir to arcesius laerte only be bear from laerte descend only ulyss from ulyss i alone have spring whom he leave so young that from I never comfort arise to he but the end of all rest in the hand of the god then eumæus depart to see to some necessary business of he herd minerva take a woman 's shape and stand in the entry of the door and be see to ulyss but by he son she be not see for the presence of the god be invisible save to those to whom they will to reveal themselves nevertheless the dog which be about the door see the goddess and durst not bark but go crouching and lick of the dust for fear and give sign to ulyss that the time be now come in which he should make himself know to he son by she great power she change back he shape into the same which it be before she transform he and telemachus who see the change but nothing of the manner by which it be effect only he see the appearance of a king in the vigor of he age where but just now he have see a worn and decrepit beggar be strike with fear and say some god have do this house this honor and he turn away he eye and would have worship but he father permit not but say look better at I i be no deity why put you upon I the reputation of godhead i be no more but thy father : i be even he i be that ulyss by reason of whose absence thy youth have be expose to such wrong from injurious man then kiss he he son nor could any longer refrain those tear which he have hold under such mighty restraint before though they would ever be force themselves out in spite of he but now as if they sluice have burst they come out like river pour upon the warm cheek of he son nor yet by all these violent argument could telemachus be persuade to believe that it be he father but he say some deity have take that shape to mock he for he affirm that it be not in the power of any man who be sustain by mortal food to change he shape so in a moment from age to youth : for but now say he you be all wrinkle and be old and now you look as the god be picture he father reply : admire but fear not and know I to be at all part substantially thy father who in the inner power of he mind and the unseen workings of a father 's love to thee answer to he outward shape and pretence there shall no more ulysseses come here i be he that after twenty year absence and suffer a world of ill have recover at last the sight of my country earth it be the will of minerva that i should be change as you see I she put I thus together she put together or take to piece whom she please it be in the law of she free power to do it : sometimes to shew she favorite under a cloud and poor and again to restore to they they ornament the god raise and throw down man with ease then telemachus could hold out no longer but he give way now to a full belief and persuasion of that which for joy at first he could not credit that it be indeed he true and very father that stand before he and they embrace and mingle they tear then say ulyss tell I who these suitor be what be they number and how stand the queen thy mother affect to they she bear they still in expectation say telemachus which she never mean to fulfil that she will accept the hand of some one of they in second nuptials for she fear to displease they by a absolute refusal so from day to day she linger they on with hope which they be content to bear the defer of while they have entertainment at free cost in we palace then say ulyss reckon up they number that we may know they strength and ours if we have none but ourselves may hope to prevail against they o father he reply i have oft-time hear of you fame for wisdom and of the great strength of you arm but the venturous mind which you speech now indicate move I even to amazement : for in no wise can it consist with wisdom or a sound mind that two should try they strength against a host nor five or ten or twice ten strong be these suitor but many more by much : from dulichium come there fifty and two they and they servant twice twelve cross the sea hither from samo from zacynthus twice ten of we native ithacan man of chief note be twelve who aspire to the bed and crown of penelope and all these under one strong roof a fearful odds against two my father there be need of caution lest the cup which you great mind so thirst to taste of vengeance prove bitter to yourself in the drinking and therefore it be well that we should bethink we of some one who might assist we in this undertaking thinkest thou say he father if we have minerva and the king of sky to be we friend would they sufficiency make strong we part or must we look out for some further aid yet they you speak of be above the cloud say telemachus and be sound aid indeed as power that not only exceed human but bear the chiefest sway among the god themselves then ulyss give direction to he son to go and mingle with the suitor and in no wise to impart he secret to any not even to the queen he mother but to hold himself in readiness and to have he weapon and he good armor in preparation and he charge he that when he himself should come to the palace as he mean to follow shortly after and present himself in he beggar 's likeness to the suitor that whatever he should see which might grieve he heart with what foul usage and contumelious language soever the suitor should receive he father come in that shape though they should strike and drag he by the heel along the floor that he should not stir nor make offer to oppose they further than by mild word to expostulate with they until minerva from heaven should give the sign which should be the prelude to they destruction and telemachus promising to obey he instruction depart and the shape of ulyss fall to what it have be before and he become to all outward appearance a beggar in base and beggarly attire chapter ix _ the queen 's suitor -- the battle of the beggar -- the armor take down -- the meeting with penelope _ from the house of eumæus the seeming beggar take he way lean on he staff till he reach the palace enter in at the hall where the suitor sit at meat they in the pride of they feast begin to break they jest in mirthful manner when they see one look so poor and so aged approach he who expect no better entertainment be nothing move at they behavior but as become the character which he have assume in a suppliant posture creep by turn to every suitor and hold out he hand for some charity with such a natural and beggar-resembling grace that he might seem to have practice beg all he life yet there be a sort of dignity in he most abject stooping that whoever have see he would have say if it have pleased heaven that this poor man have be bear a king he would gracefully have fill a throne and some pity he and some give he alm as they present humor incline they but the greater part revile he and bid he begone as one that spoil they feast for the presence of misery have this power with it that while it stay it can dash and overturn the mirth even of those who feel no pity or wish to relieve it nature bearing this witness of herself in the heart of the most obdurate now telemachus sit at meat with the suitor and know that it be the king he father who in that shape beg a alms and when he father come and present himself before he in turn as he have do to the suitor one by one he give he of he own meat which he have in he dish and of he own cup to drink and the suitor be past measure offend to see a pitiful beggar as they esteem he to be so choicely regard by the prince then antinous who be a great lord and of chief note among the suitor say prince telemachus do ill to encourage these wander beggar who go from place to place affirm that they have be some considerable person in they time fill the ear of such as hearken to they with lie and press with they bold foot into king ' palace this be some saucy vagabond some travel egyptian i see say ulyss that a poor man should get but little at you board scarce should he get salt from you hand if he bring he own meat lord antinous indignant to be answer with such sharpness by a suppose beggar snatch up a stool with which he smite ulyss where the neck and shoulder join this usage move not ulyss but in he great heart he meditate deep evil to come upon they all which for a time must be keep close and he go and sit himself down in the door-way to eat of that which be give he and he say for life or possession a man will fight but for he belly this man smite if a poor man have any god to take he part my lord antinous shall not live to be the queen 's husband then antinous rage highly and threaten to drag he by the heel and to rend he rag about he ear if he speak another word but the other suitor do in no wise approve of the harsh language nor of the blow which antinous have deal and some of they say who know but one of the deity go about hide under that poor disguise for in the likeness of poor pilgrim the god have many time descend to try the disposition of man whether they be humane or impious while these thing pass telemachus sit and observe all but hold he peace remember the instruction of he father but secretly he wait for the sign which minerva be to send from heaven that day there follow ulyss to the court one of the common sort of beggar irus by name one that have receive alms beforetime of the suitor and be they ordinary sport when they be inclined -lrb- as that day -rrb- to give way to mirth to see he eat and drink for he have the appetite of six man and be of huge stature and proportion of body yet have in he no spirit nor courage of a man this man think to curry favor with the suitor and recommend himself especially to such a great lord as antinous be begin to revile and scorn ulyss put foul language upon he and fairly challenging he to fight with the fist but ulyss deem he railing to be nothing more than jealousy and that envious disposition which beggar commonly manifest to brother in they trade mildly besought he not to trouble he but to enjoy that portion which the liberality of they entertainer give he as he do quietly see that of they bounty there be sufficient for all but irus thinking that this forbearance in ulyss be nothing more than a sign of fear so much the more highly storm and bellow and provoke he to fight and by this time the quarrel have attract the notice of the suitor who with loud laughter and shout egg on the dispute and lord antinous swear by all the god it should be a battle and that in that hall the strife should be determine to this the rest of the suitor with violent clamor accede and a circle be make for the combatant and a fat goat be propose as the victor 's prize as at the olympic or the pythian game then ulyss see no remedy or be not unwilling that the suitor should behold some proof of that strength which ere long in they own person they be to taste of strip himself and prepare for the combat but first he demand that he should have fair play shew he that none in that assembly should aid he opponent or take part against he for be a old man they might easily crush he with they strength and telemachus pass he word that no foul play should be shewn he but that each party should be leave to they own unassisted strength and to this he make antinous and the rest of the suitor swear but when ulyss have lay aside he garment and be bare to the waist all the beholder admire at the goodly sight of he large shoulder be of such exquisite shape and whiteness and at he great and brawny bosom and the youthful strength which seem to remain in a man think so old and they say what limb and what sinew he have and coward fear seize on the mind of that great vast beggar and he drop he threat and he big word and would have flee but lord antinous staid he and threaten he that if he decline the combat he would put he in a ship and land he on the shore where king echetus reign the roughest tyrant which at that time the world contain and who have that antipathy to rascal beggar such as he that when any land on he coast he would crop they ear and nose and give they to the dog to tear so irus in whom fear of king echetus prevail above the fear of ulyss address himself to fight but ulyss provoke to be engage in so odious a strife with a fellow of he base condition and loathing longer to be make a spectacle to entertain the eye of he foe with one blow which he strike he beneath the ear so shatter the tooth and jaw bone of this soon baffled coward that he lay he sprawl in the dust with small stomach or ability to renew the contest then raise he on he foot he lead he bleed and sputter to the door and put he staff into he hand and bid he go use he command upon dog and swine but not presume himself to be lord of the guest another time nor of the beggary the suitor applaud in they vain mind the issue of the contest and riot in mirth at the expense of poor irus who they vow should be forthwith embark and send to king echetus and they bestow thanks on ulyss for rid the court of that unsavory morsel as they call he but in they inward soul they would not have care if irus have be victor and ulyss have take the foil but it be mirth to they to see the beggar fight in such pastime and light entertainment the day wear away when evening be come the suitor betake themselves to music and dancing and ulyss lean he back against a pillar from which certain lamp hang which give light to the dancer and he make show of watch the dancer but very different thought be in he head and as he stand near the lamp the light fall upon he head which be thin of hair and bald as a old man 's and eurymachus a suitor take occasion from some word which be speak before scoff and say now i know for a certainty that some god lurk under the poor and beggarly appearance of this man for as he stand by the lamp he sleek head throw beam around it like as it be a glory and another say he pass he time too not much unlike the god lazily live exempt from labor take offering of man i warrant say eurymachus again he could not raise a fence or dig a ditch for he livelihood if a man would hire he to work in a garden i wish say ulyss that you who speak this and myself be to be try at any task-work that i have a good crooked scythe put in my hand that be sharp and strong and you such another where the grass grow longest to be up by day-break mow the meadow till the sun go down not tasting of food till we have finish or that we be set to plough four acre in one day of good glebe land to see whose furrow be evenest and cleanest or that we might have one wrestling-bout together or that in we right hand a good steel-headed lance be place to try whose blow fall heaviest and thickest upon the adversary 's head-piece i would cause you such work as you should have small reason to reproach I with be slack at work but you would do well to spare I this reproach and to save you strength till the owner of this house shall return till the day when ulyss shall return when return he shall enter upon he birth-right this be a galling speech to those suitor to whom ulyss 's return be indeed the thing which they most dreaded and a sudden fear fall upon they soul as if they be sensible of the real presence of that man who do indeed stand amongst they but not in that form as they might know he and eurymachus incensed snatch a massy cup which stand on a table near and hurl it at the head of the suppose beggar and but narrowly miss the hit of he and all the suitor rise as at once to thrust he out of the hall which they say he beggarly presence and he rude speech have profane but telemachus cry to they to forbear and not to presume to lay hand upon a wretched man to whom he have promise protection he ask if they be mad to mix such abhorred uproar with he feast he bid they take they food and they wine to sit up or to go to bed at they free pleasure so long as he should give licence to that freedom but why should they abuse he banquet or let the word which a poor beggar spake have power to move they spleen so fiercely they bite they lip and frown for anger to be check so by a youth nevertheless for that time they have the grace to abstain either for shame or that minerva have infuse into they a terror of ulyss 's son so that day 's feast be conclude without bloodshed and the suitor tire with they sport depart severally each man to he apartment only ulyss and telemachus remain and now telemachus by he father 's direction go and bring down into the hall armor and lance from the armoury : for ulyss say on the morrow we shall have need of they and moreover he say if any one shall ask why you have take they down say it be to clean they and scour they from the rust which they have gather since the owner of this house go for troy and as telemachus stand by the armor the light be all go out and it be pitch-dark and the armor give out glisten beam as of fire and he say to he father the pillar of the house be on fire and he father say it be the god who sit above the star and have power to make the night as light as the day and he take it for a good omen and telemachus fall to cleaning and sharpen of the lance now ulyss have not see he wife penelope in all the time since he return for the queen do not care to mingle with the suitor at they banquet but as become one that have be ulyss 's wife keep much in private spinning and do she excellent housewivery among she maid in the remote apartment of the palace only upon solemn day she would come down and shew herself to the suitor and ulyss be fill with a longing desire to see he wife again whom for twenty year he have not behold and he softly steal through the known passage of he beautiful house till he come where the maid be light the queen through a stately gallery that lead to the chamber where she sleep and when the maid see ulyss they say it be the beggar who come to the court to-day about whom all that uproar be stir up in the hall : what do he here but penelope give commandment that he should be bring before she for she say it may be that he have travel and have hear something concern ulyss then be ulysses right glad to hear himself name by he queen to find himself in no wise forget nor she great love towards he decay in all that time that he have be away and he stand before he queen and she know he not to be ulyss but suppose that he have be some poor traveller and she ask he of what country he be he tell she -lrb- as he have before tell to eumæus -rrb- that he be a cretan bear and however poor and cast down he now seem no less a man than brother to idomeneus who be grandson to king mino and though he now want bread he have once have it in he power to feast ulyss then he feign how ulyss sail for troy be force by stress of weather to put he fleet in at a port of crete where for twelve day he be he guest and entertain by he with all befitting guest-rite and he describe the very garment which ulyss have on by which penelope know that he have see she lord in this manner ulyss tell he wife many tale of himself at most but painting but painting so near to the life that the feeling of that which she take at she ear become so strong that the kindly tear run down she fair cheek while she think upon she lord dead as she think he and heavily mourn the loss of he whom she miss whom she could not find though in very deed he stand so near she ulyss be move to see she weep but he keep he own eye as dry as iron or horn in they lid put a bridle upon he strong passion that it should not issue to sight then tell he how he have lately be at the court of thesprotium and what he have learn concern ulyss there in order as he have deliver to eumæus : and penelope be win to believe that there might be a possibility of ulyss be alive and she say i dream a dream this morning methought i have twenty household fowl which do eat wheat steep in water from my hand and there come suddenly from the cloud a crook-beaked hawk who souse on they and kill they all truss they neck then take he flight back up to the cloud and in my dream methought that i weep and make great moan for my fowl and for the destruction which the hawk have make and my maid come about I to comfort I and in the height of my grief the hawk come back and light upon the beam of my chamber he say to I in a man 's voice which sound strangely even in my dream to hear a hawk to speak : be of good cheer he say o daughter of icarius for this be no dream which thou hast see but that which shall happen to thee indeed those household fowl which thou lamentest so without reason be the suitor who devour thy substance even as thou sawest the fowl eat from thy hand and the hawk be thy husband who be come to give death to the suitor -- and i awake and go to see to my fowl if they be alive whom i find eat wheat from they trough all well and safe as before my dream then say ulyss this dream can endure no other interpretation than that which the hawk give to it who be you lord and who be come quickly to effect all that he word tell you you word she say my old guest be so sweet that would you sit and please I with you speech my ear would never let my eye close they sphere for very joy of you discourse but none that be merely mortal can live without the death of sleep so the god who be without death themselves have ordain it to keep the memory of we mortality in we mind while we experience that as much as we live we die every day : in which consideration i will ascend my bed which i have nightly water with my tear since he that be the joy of it depart for that bad city : she so speak because she could not bring she lip to name the name of troy so much hate so for that night they part penelope to she bed and ulyss to he son and to the armor and the lance in the hall where they sit up all night cleaning and watch by the armor chapter x _ the madness from above -- the bow of ulyss -- the slaughter -- the conclusion _ when daylight appear a tumultuous concourse of the suitor again fill the hall and some wonder and some inquire what mean that glitter store of armor and lance which lay on heap by the entry of the door and -lrb- to -rrb- all that ask telemachus make reply that he have cause they to be take down to cleanse they of the rust and of the stain which they have contract by lie so long unused even ever since he father go for troy and with that answer they mind be easily satisfy so to they feast and vain rioting again they fall ulyss by telemachus 's order have a seat and a mess assign he in the door-way and he have he eye ever on the lance and it move gall in some of the great one there present to have they feast still dull with the society of that wretched beggar as they deem he and they revile and spurn at he with they foot only there be one philætius who have something a better nature than the rest that speak kindly to he and have he age in respect he come up to ulyss take he by the hand with a kind of fear as if touch exceedingly with imagination of he great worth and say thus to he hail father stranger my brow have sweat to see the injury which you have receive and my eye have break forth in tear when i have only think that such be oftentimes the lot of worthiest man to this plight ulyss may be reduce and that he now may wander from place to place as you do for such who be compel by need to range here and there and have no firm home to fix they foot upon god keep they in this earth as under water so be they keep down and depressed and a dark thread be sometimes spin in the fate of king at this bare liken of the beggar to ulyss minerva from heaven make the suitor for foolish joy to go mad and rouse they to such a laughter as would never stop they laugh without power of cease they eye stand full of tear for violent joy but fear and horrible misgiving succeed : and one among they stand up and prophesy : ah wretch he say what madness from heaven have seize you that you can laugh see you not that you meat drop blood a night like the night of death wrap you about you shriek without know it you eye thrust forth tear the fixed wall and the beam that bear the whole house up fall blood ghost choak up the entry full be the hall with apparition of murder man under you foot be hell the sun fall from heaven and it be midnight at noon but like man whom the god have infatuate to they destruction they mock at he fear and eurymachus say this man be surely mad conduct he forth into the market-place set he in the light for he dream that ` tis night within the house but theoclymenus -lrb- for that be the prophet 's name -rrb- whom minerva have grace with a prophetic spirit that he foresee might avoid the destruction which await they answer and say : eurymachus i will not require a guide of thee for i have eye and ear the use of both my foot and a sane mind within I and with these i will go forth of the door because i know the imminent evil which await all you that stay by reason of this poor guest who be a favorite with all the god so say he turn he back upon those inhospitable man and go away home and never return to the palace these word which he speak be not unheard by telemachus who keep still he eye upon he father expect fervently when he would give the sign which be to precede the slaughter of the suitor they dream of no such thing fall sweetly to they dinner as joying in the great store of banquet which be heap in full table about they but there reign not a bitterer banquet planet in all heaven than that which hang over they this day by secret destination of minerva there be a bow which ulyss leave when he go for troy it have lie by since that time out of use and unstrung for no man have strength to draw that bow save ulyss so it have remain as a monument of the great strength of its master this bow with the quiver of arrow belong thereto telemachus have bring down from the armoury on the last night along with the lance and now minerva intend to do ulyss a honor put it into the mind of telemachus to propose to the suitor to try who be strongest to draw that bow and he promise that to the man who should be able to draw that bow he mother should be give in marriage ulyss 's wife the prize to he who should bend the bow of ulyss there be great strife and emulation stir up among the suitor at those word of the prince telemachus and to grace she son 's word and to confirm the promise which he have make penelope come and shew herself that day to the suitor and minerva make she that she appear never so comely in they sight as that day and they be inflamed with the beholding of so much beauty propose as the price of so great manhood and they cry out that if all those hero who sail to colcho for the rich purchase of the golden-fleeced ram have see earth 's richer prize penelope they would not have make they voyage but would have vow they valor and they life to she for she be at all part faultless and she say the god have take my beauty from I since my lord go for troy but telemachus will he mother to depart and not be present at that contest for he say it may be some rougher strife shall chance of this than may be expedient for a woman to witness and she retire she and she maid and leave the hall then the bow be bring into the midst and a mark be set up by prince telemachus : and lord antinous as the chief among the suitor have the first offer and he take the bow and fitting a arrow to the string he strive to bend it but not with all he might and main could he once draw together the end of that tough bow and when he find how vain a thing it be to endeavor to draw ulyss 's bow he desist blush for shame and for mere anger then eurymachus adventured but with no better success but as it have tear the hand of antinous so do the bow tear and strain he hand and mar he delicate finger yet could he not once stir the string then call he to the attendant to bring fat and unctuous matter which melting at the fire he dip the bow therein think to supple it and make it more pliable but not with all the help of art could he succeed in make it to move after he liode and amphinomus and polybus and eurynomus and polyctoride assay they strength but not any one of they or of the rest of those aspire suitor have any better luck : yet not the meanest of they there but think himself well worthy of ulyss 's wife though to shoot with ulyss 's bow the completest champion among they be by proof find too feeble then ulyss pray they that he might have leave to try and immediately a clamor be raise among the suitor because of he petition and they scorn and swell with rage at he presumption and that a beggar should seek to contend in a game of such noble mastery but telemachus order that the bow should be give he and that he should have leave to try since they have fail for he say the bow be mine to give or to withhold : and none durst gainsay the prince then ulyss give a sign to he son and he command the door of the hall to be make fast and all wonder at he word but none could divine the cause and ulyss take the bow into he hand and before he essay to bend it he survey it at all part to see whether by long lie by it have contract any stiffness which hinder the drawing and as he be busy in the curious surveying of he bow some of the suitor mock he and say past doubt this man be a right cunning archer and know he craft well see how he turn it over and over and look into it as if he could see through the wood and other say we wish some one would tell out gold into we lap but for so long a time as he shall be in drawing of that string but when he have spend some little time in make proof of the bow and have find it to be in good plight like as a harper in tuning of he harp draw out a string with such ease or much more do ulyss draw to the head the string of he own tough bow and in let of it go it twang with such a shrill noise as a swallow make when it sing through the air : which so much amaze the suitor that they color come and go and the sky give out a noise of thunder which at heart cheer ulyss for he know that now he long labor by the disposal of the fate draw to a end then fit he a arrow to the bow and draw it to the head he send it right to the mark which the prince have set up which do he say to telemachus you have get no disgrace yet by you guest for i have strike the mark i shoot at and give myself no such trouble in teaze the bow with fat and fire as these man do but have make proof that my strength be not impaired nor my age so weak and contemptible as these be please to think it but come the day go down call we to supper after which succeed poem and harp and all delight which use to crown princely banqueting so say he beckon to he son who straight gird he sword to he side and take one of the lance -lrb- of which there lay great store from the armoury -rrb- in he hand and arm at all point advance towards he father the upper rag which ulyss wear fall from he shoulder and he own kingly likeness return when he rush to the great hall door with bow and quiver full of shaft which down at he foot he pour and in bitter word presignify he deadly intent to the suitor thus far he say this contest have be decide harmless : now for we there rest another mark harder to hit but which my hand shall essay notwithstanding if phoebus god of archer be please to give I the mastery with that he let fly a deadly arrow at antinous which pierce he in the throat as he be in the act of lift a cup of wine to he mouth amazement seize the suitor as they great champion fall dead and they rage highly against ulyss and say that it should prove the dearest shaft which he ever let fly for he have slay a man whose like breathe not in any part of the kingdom : and they fly to they arm and would have seize the lance but minerva strike they with dimness of sight that they go err up and down the hall not know where to find they yet so infatuated be they by the displeasure of heaven that they do not see the imminent peril which impend over they but every man believe that this accident have happen beside the intention of the doer fool to think by shut they eye to evade destiny or that any other cup remain for they but that which they great antinous have taste then ulyss reveal himself to all in that presence and that he be the man whom they hold to be dead at troy whose palace they have usurp whose wife in he life-time they have seek in impious marriage and that for this reason destruction be come upon they and he deal he deadly arrow among they and there be no avoid he nor escape from he horrid person and telemachus by he side ply they thick with those murderous lance from which there be no retreat till fear itself make they valiant and danger give they eye to understand the peril then they which have sword draw they and some with shield that could find they and some with table and bench snatch up in haste rise in a mass to overwhelm and crush those two yet they singly bestir themselves like man and defend themselves against that great host and through table shield and all right through the arrow of ulyss cleave and the irresistible lance of telemachus and many lay dead and all have wound and minerva in the likeness of a bird sate upon the beam which go across the hall clap she wing with a fearful noise and sometimes the great bird would fly among they cuff at the sword and at the lance and up and down the hall would go beat she wing and troubling every thing that it be frightful to behold and it fray the blood from the cheek of those heaven-hated suitor : but to ulyss and he son she appear in she own divine similitude with she snake-fringed shield a goddess armed fight they battle nor do that dreadful pair desist till they have lay all they foe at they foot at they foot they lay in shoal like fish when the fisherman break up they net so they lay gasp and sprawl at the foot of ulyss and he son and ulyss remember the prediction of tiresia which say that he be to perish by he own guest unless he slew those who know he not then certain of the queen 's household go up and tell penelope what have happen and how she lord ulyss be come home and have slay the suitor but she give no heed to they word but think that some frenzy possess they or that they mock she : for it be the property of such extreme of sorrow as she have feel not to believe when any great joy cometh and she rate and chide they exceedingly for trouble she but they the more persist in they asseveration of the truth of what they have affirm and some of they have see the slaughter body of the suitor drag forth of the hall and they say that poor guest whom you talk with last night be ulyss then she be yet more fully persuade that they mock she and she weep but they say this thing be true which we have tell we sit within in a inner room in the palace and the door of the hall be shut on we but we hear the cry and the groan of the man that be kill but see nothing till at length you son call to we to come in and enter we see ulyss stand in the midst of the slaughter but she persist in she unbelief say that it be some god which have deceive they to think it be the person of ulyss by this time telemachus and he father have cleanse they hand from the slaughter and be come to where the queen be talk with those of she household and when she see ulyss she stand motionless and have no power to speak sudden surprise and joy and fear and many passion strive within she sometimes she be clear that it be she husband that she see and sometimes the alteration which twenty year have make in he person -lrb- yet that be not much -rrb- perplex she that she know not what to think and for joy she could not believe and yet for joy she would not but believe and above all that sudden change from a beggar to a king trouble she and work uneasy scruple in she mind but telemachus see she strangeness blame she and call she a ungentle and tyrannous mother and say that she shew a too great curiousness of modesty to abstain from embrace he father and to have doubt of he person when to all present it be evident that he be the very real and true ulyss then she mistrust no longer but run and fall upon ulyss 's neck and say let not my husband be angry that i hold off so long with strange delay it be the god who sever we for so long time have cause this unseemly distance in I if menelaus 's wife have use half my caution she would never have take so freely to a stranger 's bed and she might have spare we all these plague which have come upon we through she shameless deed these word with which penelope excuse herself work more affection in ulyss than if upon a first sight she have give up herself implicitly to he embrace and he weep for joy to possess a wife so discreet so answer to he own staid mind that have a depth of wit proportion to he own and one that hold chaste virtue at so high a price and he think the possession of such a one cheaply purchase with the loss of all circe 's delight and calypso 's immortality of joy and he long labor and he severe suffering past seem as nothing now they be crown with the enjoyment of he virtuous and true wife penelope and as sad man at sea whose ship have go to piece nigh shore swimming for they life all drench in foam and brine crawl up to some poor patch of land which they take possession of with as great a joy as if they have the world give they in fee with such delight do this chaste wife cling to she lord restore till the dark night fast come on remind she of that more intimate and happy union when in she long-widowed bed she should once again clasp a living ulyss so from that time the land have rest from the suitor and the happy ithacan with song and solemn sacrifice of praise to the god celebrate the return of ulyss : for he that have be so long absent be return to wreak the evil upon the head of the doer in the place where they have do the evil there wreak he he vengeance upon they mr leicester 's school : or the history of several young lady relate by themselves -lrb- _ write 1808 1st edition 1809 text of 2nd edition 1809 _ -rrb- dedication to the young lady at amwell school my dear young friend though release from the business of the school the absence of you governess confines I to amwell during the vacation i can not better employ my leisure hour than in contribute to the amusement of you my kind pupil who by you affectionate attention to my instruction have render a life of labor pleasant to I on you return to school i hope to have a fair copy ready to present to each of you of you own biographical conversation last winter accept my thanks for the approbation you be please to express when i offer to become you _ amanuensis _ i hope you will find i have execute the office with a tolerably faithful pen as you know i take note each day during those conversation and arrange my material after you be retire to rest i begin from the day we school commence it be open by you governess for the first time on the -- day of February i pass over you several arrival on the morning of that day you governess receive you from you friend in she own parlor every carriage that drive from the door i know have leave a sad heart behind -- you eye be red with weep when you governess introduce I to you as the teacher she have engage to instruct you she next desire I to show you into the room which we now call the play-room the lady say she may play and amuse themselves and be as happy as they please this evening that they may be well acquaint with each other before they enter the school-room to-morrow morning the trace of tear be on every cheek and i also be sad for i like you have part from my friend and the duty of my profession be new to I yet i feel that it be improper to give way to my own melancholy thought i know that it be my first duty to divert the solitary young stranger : for i consider that this be very unlike the entrance to a old established school where there be always some good-natured girl who will shew attention to a new scholar and take pleasure in initiate she into the custom and amusement of the place these think i have they own amusement to invent they own custom to establish how unlike too be this forlorn meeting to old school-fellow return after the holiday when mutual greeting soon lighten the memory of parting sorrow i invite you to draw near a bright fire which blaze in the chimney and look the only cheerful thing in the room during we first solemn silence which you may remember be only break by my repeat request that you would make a smaller and still smaller circle till i see the fire-place fairly inclosed round the idea come into my mind which have since be a source of amusement to you in the recollection and to myself in particular have be of essential benefit as it enable I to form a just estimate of the disposition of you my young pupil and assist I to adapt my plan of future instruction to each individual temper a introduction to a point we wish to carry we always feel to be a aukward affair and generally execute it in a aukward manner so i believe i do then : for when i impart this idea to you i think i preface it rather too formally for such young auditor for i begin with tell you that i have read in old author that it be not unfrequent in former time when stranger be assemble together as we might be for they to amuse themselves with tell story either of they own life or the adventure of other will you allow I lady i continue to persuade you to amuse yourselve in this way you will not then look so unsociably upon each other : for we find that these stranger of whom we read be as well acquaint before the conclusion of the first story as if they have know each other many year let I prevail upon you to relate some little anecdote of you own life fictitious tale we can read in book and -lrb- they -rrb- be therefore better adapt to conversation in those time when book of amusement be more scarce than they be at present after many objection of not know what to say or how to begin which i overcome by assure you how easy it would be for that every person be naturally eloquent when they be the hero or heroine of they own tale the _ who should begin _ be next in question i propose to draw lot which form a little amusement of itself miss manners who till then have be the saddest of the sad begin to brighten up and say it be just like draw king and queen and begin to tell we where she pass last twelfth day but as she narration must have interfere with the more important business of the lottery i advise she to postpone it till it come to she turn to favor we with the history of she life when it would appear in its proper order the first number fall to the share of miss villier whose joy at draw what we call the _ first prize _ be temper with shame at appear as the first historian in the company she wish she have not be the very first : -- she have pass all she life in a retired village and have nothing to relate of herself that could give the least entertainment : -- she have not the least idea in the world where to begin begin say i with you name for that at present be unknown to we tell we the first thing you can remember relate whatever happen to make a great impression on you when you be very young and if you find you can connect you story till you arrival here to-day i be sure we shall listen to you with pleasure and if you like to break off and only treat we with a part of you history we will excuse you with many thanks for the amusement which you have afford we and the lady who have draw the second number will i hope take she turn with the same indulgence to relate either all or any part of the event of she life as best please she own fancy or as she find she can manage it with the most ease to herself -- encourage by this offer of indulgence miss villier begin if in my report of she story or in any which follow i shall appear to make she or you speak a older language than it seem probable that you should use speak in you own word it must be remember that what be very proper and become when speak require to be arrange with some little difference before it can be set down in write little inaccuracy must be pare away and the whole must assume a more formal and correct appearance my own way of think i be sensible will too often intrude itself but i have endeavor to preserve as exactly as i could you own word and you own peculiarity of style and manner and to approve myself you faithful historiographer as well as true friend mb i elizabeth villier -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- my father be the curate of a village church about five mile from amwell i be bear in the parsonage-house which join the church-yard the first thing i can remember be my father teaching I the alphabet from the letter on a tombstone that stand at the head of my mother 's grave i use to tap at my father 's study-door i think i now hear he say who be there -- what do you want little girl go and see mamma go and learn pretty letter many time in the day would my father lay aside he book and he papers to lead I to this spot and make I point to the letter and then set I to spell syllable and word : in this manner the epitaph on my mother 's tomb be my primmer and my spelling-book i learn to read i be one day sit on a step place across the church-yard stile when a gentleman passing by hear I distinctly repeat the letter which form my mother 's name and then say _ elizabeth villier _ with a firm tone as if i have perform some great matter this gentleman be my uncle jame my mother 's brother : he be a lieutenant in the navy and have leave england a few week after the marriage of my father and mother and now return home from a long sea-voyage he be come to visit my mother no tiding of she decease have reach he though she have be dead more than a twelvemonth when my uncle see I sit on the stile and hear I pronounce my mother 's name he look earnestly in my face and begin to fancy a resemblance to he sister and to think i might be she child i be too intent on my employment to observe he and go spelling on who have teach you to spell so prettily my little maid say my uncle mamma i reply for i have a idea that the word on the tombstone be somehow a part of mamma and that she have teach I and who be mamma ask my uncle elizabeth villier i reply and then my uncle call I he dear little niece and say he would go with I to mamma : he take hold of my hand intend to lead I home delighted that he have find out who i be because he imagine it would be such a pleasant surprise to he sister to see she little daughter bring home she long lose sailor uncle i agree to take he to mamma but we have a dispute about the way thither my uncle be for go along the road which lead directly up to we house i point to the church-yard and say that be the way to mamma though impatient of any delay he be not willing to contest the point with he new relation therefore he lift I over the stile and be then go to take I along the path to a gate he know be at the end of we garden but no i would not go that way neither : let go he hand i say you do not know the way -- i will shew you : and make what haste i could among the long grass and thistle and jump over the low grave he say as he follow what he call my _ wayward step _ what a positive soul this little niece of mine be i know the way to you mother 's house before you be bear child at last i stop at my mother 's grave and point to the tombstone say here be mamma in a voice of exultation as if i have now convinced he that i know the way best : i look up in he face to see he acknowledge he mistake but oh what a face of sorrow do i see i be so frightened that i have but a imperfect recollection of what follow i remember i pull he coat and cry sir sir and try to move he i know not what to do my mind be in a strange confusion i think i have do something wrong in bring the gentleman to mamma to make he cry so sadly but what it be i could not tell this grave have always be a scene of delight to I in the house my father would often be weary of my prattle and send I from he but here he be all my own i might say anything and be as frolicsome as i please here all be chearfulness and good humor in we visit to mamma as we call it my father would tell I how quietly mamma sleep there and that he and he little betsy would one day sleep beside mamma in that grave and when i go to bed as i lay my little head on the pillow i use to wish i be sleep in the grave with my papa and mamma and in my childish dream i use to fancy myself there and it be a place within the ground all smooth and soft and green i never make out any figure of mamma but still it be the tombstone and papa and the smooth green grass and my head rest upon the elbow of my father how long my uncle remain in this agony of grief i know not to I it seem a very long time : at last he take I in he arm and hold I so tight that i begin to cry and run home to my father and tell he that a gentleman be cry about mamma 's pretty letter no doubt it be a very affect meeting between my father and my uncle i remember that it be the first day i ever see my father weep : that i be in sad trouble and go into the kitchen and tell susan we servant that papa be cry and she want to keep I with she that i might not disturb the conversation but i would go back to the parlor to _ poor papa _ and i go in softly and creep between my father 's knee my uncle offer to take I in he arm but i turn sullenly from he and clung closer to my father have conceive a dislike to my uncle because he have make my father cry now i first learn that my mother 's death be a heavy affliction for i hear my father tell a melancholy story of she long illness she death and what he have suffer from she loss my uncle say what a sad thing it be for my father to be leave with such a young child but my father reply he little betsy be all he comfort and that but for I he should have die with grief how i could be any comfort to my father strike I with wonder i know i be please when he play and talk with I but i think that be all goodness and favor do to I and i have no notion how i could make any part of he happiness the sorrow i now hear he have suffer be as new and strange to I i have no idea that he have ever be unhappy he voice be always kind and cheerful i have never before see he weep or shew any such sign of grief as those in which i use to express my little trouble my thought on these subject be confuse and childish but from that time i never cease ponder on the sad story of my dead mamma the next day i go by mere habit to the study door to call papa to the beloved grave my mind misgave I and i could not tap at the door i go backwards and forwards between the kitchen and the study and what to do with myself i do not know my uncle meet I in the passage and say betsy will you come and walk with I in the garden this i refuse for this be not what i want but the old amusement of sit on the grave and talk to papa my uncle try to persuade I but still i say no no and run cry into the kitchen as he follow I in there susan say this child be so fretful to-day i do not know what to do with she aye say my uncle i suppose my poor brother spoil she have but one this reflection on my papa make I quite in a little passion of anger for i have not forget that with this new uncle sorrow have first come into we dwelling : i scream loudly till my father come out to know what it be all about he send my uncle into the parlor and say he would manage the little wrangler by himself when my uncle be go i cease cry my father forget to lecture I for my ill humor or to enquire into the cause and we be soon seat by the side of the tombstone no lesson go on that day no talking of pretty mamma sleeping in the green grave no jump from the tombstone to the ground no merry joke or pleasant story i sate upon my father 's knee look up in he face and think _ how sorry papa look _ till have be fatigue with cry and now oppress with thought i fall fast asleep my uncle soon learn from susan that this place be we constant haunt she tell he she do verily believe she master would never get the better of the death of she mistress while he continue to teach the child to read at the tombstone for though it might sooth he grief it keep it for ever fresh in he memory the sight of he sister 's grave have be such a shock to my uncle that he readily enter into susan 's apprehension and conclude that if i be set to study by some other means there would no longer be a pretence for these visit to the grave away my kind uncle hasten to the nearest market-town to buy I some book i hear the conference between my uncle and susan and i do not approve of he interfere in we pleasure i see he take he hat and walk out and i secretly hope he be go _ beyond sea _ again from whence susan have tell I he have come where _ beyond sea _ be i could not tell but i conclude it be somewhere a great way off i take my seat on the church-yard stile and keep look down the road and say i hope i shall not see my uncle again i hope my uncle will not come from _ beyond sea _ any more but i say this very softly and have a kind of notion that i be in a perverse ill-humoured fit here i sate till my uncle return from the market-town with he new purchase i see he come walk very fast with a parcel under he arm i be very sorry to see he and i frown and try to look very cross he untie he parcel and say betsy i have bring you a pretty book i turn my head away and say i do not want a book but i could not help peep again to look at it in the hurry of open the parcel he have scatter all the book upon the ground and there i see fine gilt cover and gay picture all flutter about what a fine sight -- all my resentment vanish and i hold up my face to kiss he that be my way of thank my father for any extraordinary favor my uncle have bring himself into rather a troublesome office he have hear I spell so well that he think there be nothing to do but to put book into my hand and i should read yet notwithstanding i spelt tolerably well the letter in my new library be so much smaller than i have be accustom to they be like greek character to I i could make nothing at all of they the honest sailor be not to be discourage by this difficulty though unused to play the schoolmaster he teach I to read the small print with unwearied diligence and patience and whenever he see my father and I look as if we want to resume we visit to the grave he would propose some pleasant walk and if my father say it be too far for the child to walk he would set I on he shoulder and say then betsy shall ride and in this manner have he carry I many many mile in these pleasant excursion my uncle seldom forget to make susan furnish he with a luncheon which though it generally happen every day make a constant surprise to my papa and I when seat under some shady tree he pull it out of he pocket and begin to distribute he little store and then i use to peep into the other pocket to see if there be not some currant wine there and the little bottle of water for I if perchance the water be forget then it make another joke -- that poor betsy must be force to drink a little drop of wine these be childish thing to tell of and instead of my own silly history i wish i could remember the entertaining story my uncle use to relate of he voyage and travels while we sate under the shady tree eat we noon-tide meal the long visit my uncle make we be such a important event in my life that i fear i shall tire you patience with talking of he but when he be go the remainder of my story will be but short the summer month pass away but not swiftly -- the pleasant walk and the charming story of my uncle 's adventure make they seem like year to I i remember the approach of winter by the warm great coat he buy for I and how proud i be when i first put it on and that he call I little red ride hood and bid I beware of wolf and that i laugh and say there be no such thing now then he tell I how many wolf and bear and tyger and lion he have meet with in uninhabited land that be like robinson crusoe 's island o these be happy day in the winter we walk be shorter and less frequent my book be now my chief amusement though my study be often interrupt by a game of romp with my uncle which too often end in a quarrel because he play so roughly yet long before this i dearly love my uncle and the improvement i make while he be with we be very great indeed i could now read very well and the continual habit of listen to the conversation of my father and my uncle make I a little woman in understand so that my father say to he jame you have make my child quite a companionable little be my father often leave I alone with my uncle sometimes to write he sermon sometimes to visit the sick or give counsel to he poor neighbor : then my uncle use to hold long conversation with I tell I how i should strive to make my father happy and endeavor to improve myself when he be go : -- now i begin justly to understand why he have take such pain to keep my father from visit my mother 's grave that grave which i often steal privately to look at but now never without awe and reverence for my uncle use to tell I what a excellent lady my mother be and i now think of she as have be a real mamma which before seem a ideal something no way connect with life and he tell I that the lady from the manor-house who sate in the best pew in the church be not so graceful and the best woman in the village be not so good as be my sweet mamma and that if she have live i should not have be force to pick up a little knowledge from he a rough sailor or to learn to knit and sew of susan but that she would have teach I all lady-like fine work and delicate behavior and perfect manners and would have select for I proper book such as be most fit to instruct my mind and of which he nothing know if ever in my life i shall have any proper sense of what be excellent or become in the womanly character i owe it to these lesson of my rough unpolished uncle for in tell I what my mother would have make I he teach I what to wish to be and when soon after my uncle leave we i be introduce to the lady at the manor-house instead of hang down my head with shame as i should have do before my uncle come like a little village rustic i try to speak distinctly with ease and a modest gentleness as my uncle have say my mother use to do instead of hang down my head abashed i look upon they and think what a pretty sight a fine lady be and think how well my mother must have appear since she be so much more graceful than these lady be and when i hear they compliment my father on the admirable behavior of he child and say how well he have bring I up i think to myself papa do not much mind my manners if i be but a good girl but it be my uncle that teach I to behave like mamma -- i can not now think my uncle be so rough and unpolished as he say he be for he lesson be so good and so impressive that i shall never forget they and i hope they will be of use to I as long as i live : he would explain to I the meaning of all the word he use such as grace and elegance modest diffidence and affectation point out instance of what he mean by those word in the manners of the lady and they young daughter who come to we church for besides the lady of the manor-house many of the neighbouring family come to we church because my father preach so well it must have be early in the spring when my uncle go away for the crocus be just blow in the garden and the primrose have begin to peep from under the young bud hedge-row -- i cry as if my heart would break when i have the last sight of he through a little opening among the tree as he go down the road my father accompany he to the market-town from whence he be to proceed in the stage-coach to london how tedious i think all susan 's endeavor to comfort I be the stile where i first saw my uncle come into my mind and i think i would go and sit there and think about that day but i be no sooner seat there than i remember how i have frighten he by take he so foolishly to my mother 's grave and then again how naughty i have be when i sate mutter to myself at this same stile wish that he who have go so far to buy I book might never come back any more : all my little quarrel with my uncle come into my mind now that i could never play with he again and it almost break my heart i be force to run into the house to susan for that consolation i have just before despise some day after this as i be sit by the fire with my father after it be dark and before the candle be light i give he a account of my troubled conscience at the church-stile when i remember how unkind i have be to my uncle when he first come and how sorry i still be whenever i thought of the many quarrel i have have with he my father smile and take hold of my hand say i will tell you all about this my little penitent this be the sort of way in which we all feel when those we love be take from we -- when we dear friend be with we we go on enjoy they society without much thought or consideration of the blessing we be possess of nor do we too nicely weigh the measure of we daily action -- we let they freely share we kind or we discontented mood and if any little bickering disturb we friendship it do but the more endear we to each other when we be in a happier temper but these thing come over we like grievous fault when the object of we affection be go for ever you dear mamma and i have no quarrel yet in the first day of my lonely sorrow how many thing come into my mind that i might have do to have make she happier it be so with you my child you do all a child could do to please you uncle and dearly do he love you and these little thing which now disturb you tender mind be remember with delight by you uncle he be tell I in we last walk just perhaps as you be think about it with sorrow of the difficulty he have in get into you good grace when he first come he will think of these thing with pleasure when he be far away put away from you this unfounded grief only let it be a lesson to you to be as kind as possible to those you love and remember when they be go from you you will never think you have be kind enough such feeling as you have now describe be the lot of humanity so you will feel when i be no more and so will you child feel when you be dead but you uncle will come back again betsy and we will now think of where we be to get the cage to keep the talk parrot in he be to bring home and go and tell susan to bring the candle and ask she if the nice cake be almost baked that she promise to give we for we tea at this point my dear miss villier you think fit to break off you story and the wet eye of you young auditor seem to confess that you have succeed in move they feeling with you pretty narrative it now fall by lot to the turn of miss manners to relate she story and we be all sufficiently curious to know what so very young a historian have to tell of herself -- i shall continue the narrative for the future in the order in which they follow without mention any of the interruption which occur from the asking of question or from any other cause unless materially connect with the story i shall also leave out the apology with which you severally think fit to preface you story of yourselve though they be very seasonable in they place and proceed from a proper diffidence because i must not swell my work to too large a size ii louisa manners -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- my name be louisa manners i be seven year of age last birthday which be on the first of may i remember only four birthday the day i be four year old be the first that i recollect on the morning of that day as soon as i awake i creep into mamma 's bed and say open you eye mamma for it be my birthday open you eye and look at I then mamma tell I i should ride in a post chaise and see my grandmamma and my sister sarah grandmamma live at a farm-house in the country and i have never in all my life be out of london no nor have i ever see a bit of green grass except in the draper ' garden which be near my papa 's house in broad-street nor have i ever ride in a carriage before that happy birthday i run about the house talking of where i be go and rejoice so that it be my birthday that when i get into the chaise i be tired and fall asleep when i awake i see the green field on both side of the chaise and the field be full quite full of bright shine yellow flower and sheep and young lamb be feed in they i jump and clap my hand together for joy and i cry out this be abroad in the meadow to see the young lamb for i know many of watt 's hymn by heart the tree and hedge seem to fly swiftly by we and one field and the sheep and the young lamb pass away and then another field come and that be full of cow and then another field and all the pretty sheep return and there be no end of these charming sight till we come quite to grandmamma 's house which stand all alone by itself no house to be see at all near it grandmamma be very glad to see I and she be very sorry that i do not remember she though i have be so fond of she when she be in town but a few month before i be quite ashamed of my bad memory my sister sarah shew I all the beautiful place about grandmamma 's house she first take I into the farm-yard and i peep into the barn there i see a man thrashing and as he beat the corn with he flail he make such a dreadful noise that i be frightened and run away : my sister persuade I to return she say will tasker be very good-natured : then i go back and peep at he again but as i could not reconcile myself to the sound of he flail or the sight of he black beard we proceed to see the rest of the farm-yard there be no end to the curiosity that sarah have to shew I there be the pond where the duck be swim and the little wooden house where the hen sleep at night the hen be feed all over the yard and the prettiest little chicken they be feed too and little yellow duckling that have a hen for they mamma she be so frightened if they go near the water grandmamma say a hen be not esteem a very wise bird we go out of the farm-yard into the orchard o what a sweet place grandmamma 's orchard be there be pear-tree and apple-tree and cherry-tree all in blossom these blossom be the prettiest flower that ever be see and among the grass under the tree there grow butter-cup and cowslip and daffodil and blue-bell sarah tell I all they name and she say i might pick as many of they as ever i pleased i fill my lap with flower i fill my bosom with flower and i carry as many flower as i could in both my hand but as i be go into the parlor to shew they to my mamma i stumble over a threshold which be place across the parlor and down i fall with all my treasure nothing could have so well pacify I for the misfortune of my fall flower as the sight of a delicious syllabub which happen at that moment to be bring in grandmamma say it be a present from the red cow to I because it be my birthday and then because it be the first of may she order the syllabub to be place under the may-bush that grow before the parlor door and when we be seat on the grass round it she help I the very first to a large glass full of the syllabub and wish I many happy return of that day and then she say i be myself the sweetest little may-blossom in the orchard after the syllabub there be the garden to see and a most beautiful garden it be -- long and narrow a straight gravel walk down the middle of it at the end of the gravel walk there be a green arbor with a bench under it there be row of cabbage and radish and pea and bean i be delighted to see they for i never see so much as a cabbage grow out of the ground before on one side of this charming garden there be a great many bee-hive and the bee sing so prettily mamma say have you nothing to say to these pretty bee louisa then i say to they how doth the little busy bee improve each shine hour and gather honey all the day from every opening flower they have a most beautiful flower-bed to gather it from quite close under the hive i be go to catch one bee till sarah tell I about they sting which make I afraid for a long time to go too near they hive but i go a little nearer and a little nearer every day and before i come away from grandmamma 's i grow so bold i let will tasker hold I over the glass window at the top of the hive to see they make honey in they own home after see the garden i see the cow milk and that be the last sight i see that day for while i be tell mamma about the cow i fall fast asleep and i suppose i be then put to bed the next morning my papa and mamma be go i cry sadly but be a little comfort at hear they would return in a month or two and fetch I home i be a foolish little thing then and do not know how long a month be grandmamma give I a little basket to gather my flower in i go into the orchard and before i have half fill my basket i forget all my trouble the time i pass at my grandmamma 's be always in my mind sometimes i think of the good-natured pied cow that would let I stroke she while the dairy-maid be milk she then i fancy myself run after the dairy-maid into the nice clean dairy and see the pan full of milk and cream then i remember the wood-house it have once be a large barn but be grow old the wood be keep there my sister and i use to peep about among the faggot to find the egg the hen sometimes leave there bird ' nest we might not look for grandmamma be very angry once when will tasker bring home a bird 's nest full of pretty speckled egg for I she send he back to the hedge with it again she say the little bird would not sing any more if they egg be take away from they a hen she say be a hospitable bird and always lay more egg than she want on purpose to give she mistress to make pudding and custard with i do not know which pleased grandmamma best when we carry she home a lap-full of egg or a few violet for she be particularly fond of violet violet be very scarce we use to search very carefully for they every morning round by the orchard hedge and sarah use to carry a stick in she hand to beat away the nettle for very frequently the hen leave they egg among the nettle if we could find egg and violet too what happy child we be every day i use to fill my basket with flower and for a long time i like one pretty flower as well as another pretty flower but sarah be much wiser than I and she teach I which to prefer grandmamma 's violet be certainly best of all but they never go in the basket be carry home almost flower by flower as soon as they be find therefore blue-bell might be say to be the best for the cowslip be all withered and go before i learn the true value of flower the best blue-bell be those tinge with red some be so very red that we call they red blue-bell and these sarah prize very highly indeed daffodil be so very plentiful they be not think worth gather unless they be double one and butter-cup i find be very poor flower indeed yet i would pick one now and then because i know they be the very same flower that have delight I so in the journey for my papa have tell I they be i be very careful to love best the flower which sarah praise most yet sometimes i confess i have even pick a daisy though i know it be the very worst flower of all because it remind I of london and the draper ' garden for happy as i be at grandmamma 's i could not help sometimes think of my papa and mamma and then i use to tell my sister all about london how the house stand all close to each other what a pretty noise the coach make and what a many people there be in the street after we have be talk on these subject we generally use to go into the old wood-house and play at be in london we use to set up bit of wood for house we two doll we call papa and mamma in one corner we make a little garden with grass and daisy and that be to be the draper ' garden i would not have any other flower here than daisy because no other grow among the grass in the real draper ' garden before the time of hay-making come it be very much talk of sarah tell I what a merry time it would be for she remember every thing which have happen for a year or more she tell I how nicely we should throw the hay about i be very desirous indeed to see the hay make to be sure nothing could be more pleasant than the day the orchard be mow : the hay smell so sweet and we might toss it about as much as ever we pleased but dear I we often wish for thing that do not prove so happy as we expect the hay which be at first so green and smell so sweet become yellow and dry and be carry away in a cart to feed the horse and then when it be all go and there be no more to play with i look upon the naked ground and perceive what we have lose in these few merry day lady would you believe it every flower blue-bell daffodil butter-cup daisy all be cut off by the cruel scythe of the mower no flower be to be see at all except here and there a short solitary daisy that a week before one would not have look at it be a grief indeed to I to lose all my pretty flower yet when we be in great distress there be always i think something which happen to comfort we and so it happen now that gooseberry and currant be almost ripe which be certainly a very pleasant prospect some of they begin to turn red and as we never disobey grandmamma we use often to consult together if it be likely she would permit we to eat they yet then we would pick a few that look the ripest and run to ask she if she think they be ripe enough to eat and the uncertainty what she opinion would be make they doubly sweet if she give we leave to eat they when the currant and gooseberry be quite ripe grandmamma have a sheep-shearing all the sheep stand under the tree to be shear they be bring out of the field by old spot the shepherd i stand at the orchard-gate and see he drive they all in when they have crop off all they wool they look very clean and white and pretty but poor thing they run shiver about with cold so that it be a pity to see they great preparation be make all day for the sheep-shearing supper sarah say a sheep-shearing be not to be compare to a harvest-home _ that _ be so much better for that then the oven be quite full of plum-pudding and the kitchen be very hot indeed with roast beef yet i can assure you there be no want at all of either roast beef or plum-pudding at the sheep-shearing my sister and i be permit to sit up till it be almost dark to see the company at supper they sate at a long oak table which be finely carve and as bright as a looking-glass i obtain a great deal of praise that day because i reply so prettily when i be speak to my sister be more shy than I never have live in london be the reason of that after the happiest day bedtime will come we sate up late but at last grandmamma send we to bed : yet though we go to bed we hear many charming song sing : to be sure we could not distinguish the word which be a pity but the sound of they voice be very loud and very fine indeed the common supper that we have every night be very cheerful just before the man come out of the field a large faggot be fling on the fire the wood use to crackle and blaze and smell delightfully : and then the cricket for they love the fire they use to sing and old spot the shepherd who love the fire as well as the cricket do he use to take he place in the chimney corner after the hottest day in summer there old spot use to sit it be a seat within the fire-place quite under the chimney and over he head the bacon hang when old spot be seat the milk be hang in a skillet over the fire and then the man use to come and sit down at the long white table \* \* \* \* \* _ pardon I my dear louisa that i interrupted you here you be a little woman now to what you be then and i may say to you that though i love to hear you prattle of you early recollection i think i perceive some lady present be rather weary of hear so much of the visit to grandmamma you may remember i ask you some question concern you papa and you mamma which lead you to speak of you journey home : but you little town-bred head be so full of the pleasure of a country life that you first make many apology that you be unable to tell what happen during the harvest as unfortunately you be fetch home the very day before it begin _ iii ann withers -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- my name you know be withers but as i once think i be the daughter of sir edward and lady harriot lesley i shall speak of myself as miss lesley and call sir edward and lady harriot my father and mother during the period i suppose they entitle to those beloved name when i be a little girl it be the perpetual subject of my contemplation that i be a heiress and the daughter of a baronet that my mother be the honorable lady harriot that we have a nobler mansion infinitely finer pleasure-grounds and equipage more splendid than any of the neighbouring family indeed my good friend have observe nothing of this error of mine in either of the life which have hitherto be related i be ashamed to confess what a proud child i once be how it happen i can not tell for my father be esteem the best breed man in the county and the condescension and affability of my mother be universally speak of oh my dear friend say miss -- it be very natural indeed if you suppose you possess these advantage we make no comparative figure in the county and my father be originally a man of no consideration at all and yet i can assure you both he and mamma have a prodigious deal of trouble to break I of this infirmity when i be very young and do reflect for a moment say miss villier from whence could proceed any pride in I -- a poor curate 's daughter -- at least any pride worth speaking of for the difficulty my father have to make I feel myself on a equality with a miller 's little daughter who visit I do not seem a anecdote worth relate my father from he profession be accustom to look into these thing and whenever he have observe any tendency to this fault in I and have make I sensible of my error i who be rather a weak-spirited girl have be so much distressed at he reproof that to restore I to my own good opinion he would make I sensible that pride be a defect inseparable from human nature shew I in we visit to the poorest labourer how pride would as he express it prettily peep out from under they ragged garb -- my father dearly love the poor in person of a rank superior to we own humble one i want not much assistance from my father 's nice discernment to know that it exist there and for these latter he would always claim that toleration from I which he say he observe i be less willing to allow than to the former instance we be tell in holy writ he would say that it be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven surely this be not mean alone to warn the affluent : it must also be understand as a expressive illustration to instruct the lowly-fortuned man that he should bear with those imperfection inseparable from that dangerous prosperity from which he be happily exempt -- but we sadly interrupt you story -- you be very kind lady to speak with so much indulgence of my foible say miss withers and be go to proceed when little louisa manners ask pray be not equipage carriage yes miss manners a equipage be a carriage then i be sure if my papa have but one equipage i should be very proud for once when my papa talk of keep a one-horse chaise i never be so proud of any thing in my life : i use to dream of ride in it and imagine i see my playfellow walk past I in the street oh my dear miss manners reply miss withers you young head might well run on a thing so new to you but you have preach a useful lesson to I in you own pretty rambling story which i shall not easily forget when you be speak with such delight of the pleasure the sight of a farm-yard a orchard and a narrow slip of kitchen-garden give you and could for year preserve so lively the memory of one short ride and that probably through a flat uninteresting country i remember how early i learn to disregard the face of nature unless she be deck in picturesque scenery how wearisome we park and grounds become to I unless some improvement be go forward which i think would attract notice : but those day be go -- i will now proceed in my story and bring you acquaint with my real parent alas i be a changele substitute by my mother for the heiress of the lesley family : it be for my sake she do this naughty deed yet since the truth have be know it seem to I as if i have be the only sufferer by it remember no time when i be not harriot lesley it seem as if the change have take from I my birthright lady harriot have intend to nurse she child herself but be seize with a violent fever soon after its birth she be not only unable to nurse it but even to see it for several week at this time i be not quite a month old when my mother be hire to be miss lesley 's nurse -- she have once be a servant in the family -- she husband be then at sea she have be nurse miss lesley a few day when a girl who have the care of I bring I into the nursery to see my mother it happen that she want something from she own home which she dispatch the girl to fetch and desire she to leave I till she return in she absence she change we clothes : then keep I to personate the child she be nurse she send away the daughter of sir edward to be bring up in she own poor cottage when my mother send away the girl she affirm she have not the least intention of commit this bad action but after she be leave alone with we she look on I and then on the little lady-babe and she weep over I to think she be oblige to leave I to the charge of a careless girl debar from my own natural food while she be nurse another person 's child the lace cap and the fine cambric robe of the little harriot be lie on the table ready to be put on : in these she dress I only just to see how pretty she own dear baby would look in missy 's fine clothes when she see I thus adorn she say to I o my dear ann you look as like missy as any thing can be i be sure my lady herself if she be well enough to see you would not know the difference she say these word aloud and while she be speak a wicked thought come into she head -- how easy it would be to change these child on which she hastily dress harriot in my coarse raiment she have no sooner finish the transformation of miss lesley into the poor ann withers than the girl return and carry she away without the least suspicion that it be not the same infant that she have bring thither it be wonderful that no one discover that i be not the same child every fresh face that come into the room fill the nurse with terror the servant still continue to pay they compliment to the baby in the same form as usual say how like it be to its papa nor do sir edward himself perceive the difference he lady 's illness probably engross all he attention at the time though indeed gentleman seldom take much notice of very young child when lady harriot begin to recover and the nurse see I in she arm caress as she own child all fear of detection be over but the pang of remorse then seize she : as the dear sick lady hang with tear of fondness over I she think she should have die with sorrow for have so cruelly deceive she when i be a year old mr withers be discharge and because she have be observe to nurse I with uncommon care and affection and be see to shed many tear at parting from I to reward she fidelity sir edward settle a small pension on she and she be allow to come every Sunday to dine in the housekeeper 's room and see she little lady when she go home it might have be expect she would have neglect the child she have so wickedly steal instead of which she nurse it with the greatest tenderness be very sorry for what she have do : all the ease she could ever find for she troubled conscience be in she extreme care of this injured child and in the weekly visit to its father 's house she constantly bring it with she at the time i have the earliest recollection of she she be become a widow and with the pension sir edward allow she and some plain work she do for we family she maintain herself and she suppose daughter the doting fondness she shew for she child be much talk of it be say she wait upon it more like a servant than a mother and it be observe its clothes be always make as far as she slender means would permit in the same fashion and she hair cut and curl in the same form as mine to this person as have be my faithful nurse and to she child i be always teach to shew particular civility and the little girl be always bring into the nursery to play with I ann be a little delicate thing and remarkably well-behaved for though so much indulge in every other respect my mother be very attentive to she manners as the child grow older my mother become very uneasy about she education she be so very desirous of have she well-behaved that she fear to send she to school lest she should learn ill manners among the village child with whom she never suffer she to play and she be such a poor scholar herself that she could teach she little or nothing i hear she relate this she distress to my own maid with tear in she eye and i form a resolution to beg of my parent that i might have ann for a companion and that she might be allow to take lesson with I of my governess my birth-day be then approach and on that day i be always indulge in the privilege of ask some peculiar favor and what boon have my annual petitioner to beg to-day say my father as he enter the breakfast-room on the morning of my birth-day then i tell he of the great anxiety express by nurse withers concern she daughter how much she wish it be in she power to give she a education that would enable she to get she living without hard labor i set the good quality of ann withers in the best light i could and in conclusion i begged she might be permit to partake with I in education and become my companion this be a very serious request indeed harriot say sir edward you mother and i must consult together on the subject the result of this consultation be favourable to my wish : in a few week my foster-sister be take into the house and place under the tuition of my governess to I who have hitherto live without any companion of my own age except occasional visitor the idea of a playfellow constantly to associate with be very pleasant and after the first shyness of feel she altered situation be over ann seem as much at she ease as if she have always be bring up in we house i become very fond of she and take pleasure in shew she all manner of attention which so far win on she affection that she tell I she have a secret intrusted to she by she mother which she have promise never to reveal as long as she mother live but that she almost wish to confide it to I because i be such a kind friend to she yet have promise never to tell it till the death of she mother she be afraid to tell it to I at first i assure she that i would never press she to the disclosure for that promise of secrecy be to be hold sacred but whenever we fall into any confidential kind of conversation this secret seem always ready to come out whether she or i be most to blame i know not though i own i could not help give frequent hint how well i could keep a secret at length she tell I what i have before related namely that she be in truth the daughter of sir edward and lady lesley and i the child of she suppose mother when i be first in possession of this wonderful secret my heart burn to reveal it i think how praiseworthy it would be in I to restore to my friend the rights of she birth yet i think only of become she patroness and raise she to she proper rank it never occur to I that my own degradation must necessarily follow i endeavor to persuade she to let I tell this important affair to my parent : this she positively refuse i express wonder that she should so faithfully keep this secret for a unworthy woman who in she infancy have do she such a injury oh say she you do not know how much she love I or you would not wonder that i never resent that i have see she grieve and be so very sorry on my account that i would not bring she into more trouble for any good that could happen to myself she have often tell I that since the day she change we she have never know what it be to have a happy moment and when she return home from nursing you find I very thin and sickly how she heart smite she for what she have do and then she nurse and feed I with such anxious care that she grow much fonder of I than if i have be she own and that on the sunday when she use to bring I here it be more pleasure to she to see I in my own father 's house than it be to she to see you she real child the shyness you shew towards she while you be very young and the forced civility you seem to affect as you grow older always appear like ingratitude towards she who have do so much for you my mother have desire I to disclose this after she death but i do not believe i shall ever mention it then for i should be sorry to bring any reproach even on she memory in a few day after this important discovery ann be send home to pass a few week with she mother on the occasion of the expect arrival of some visitor to we house they be to bring child with they and these i be to consider as my own guest in the expect arrival of my young visitant and in make preparation to entertain they i have little leisure to deliberate on what conduct i should pursue with regard to my friend 's secret something must be do i think to make she amends for the injury she have sustain and i resolve to consider the matter attentively on she return still my mind run on confer favor i never consider myself as transform into the dependant person indeed sir edward at this time set I about a task which occupy the whole of my attention he propose that i should write a little interlude after the manner of the french petite piece and to try my ingenuity no one be to see it before the representation except the performer myself and my little friend who as they be all younger than I could not be expect to lend I much assistance i have already tell you what a proud girl i be during the writing of this piece the receiving of my young friend and the instruct they in they several part i never feel myself of more importance with ann my pride have somewhat slumber the difference of we rank leave no room for competition all be complacency and good humor on my part and affectionate gratitude temper with respect on hers but here i have full room to shew courtesy to affect those grace -- to imitate that elegance of manners practice by lady harriot to they mother i be to be they instructress in action and in attitude and to receive they praise and they admiration of my theatrical genius it be a new scene of triumph for I and i might then be say to be in the very height of my glory if the plot of my piece for the invention of which they so highly praise I have be indeed my own all would have be well but unhappily i borrow from a source which make my drama end far differently from what i intend it should in the catastrophe i lose not only the name i personated in the piece but with it my own name also and all my rank and consequence in the world flee from I for ever -- my father present I with a beautiful writing-desk for the use of my new authorship my silver standish be place upon it a quire of gilt paper be before I i take out a parcel of my best crow quill and down i sate in the greatest form imaginable i conjecture i have no talent for invention certain it be that when i sate down to compose my piece no story would come into my head but the story which ann have so lately related to I many sheet be scrawl over in vain i could think of nothing else still the baby and the nurse be before I in all the minutiæ of description ann have give they the costly attire of the lady-babe -- the homely garb of the cottage-infant -- the affect address of the fond mother to she own offspring -- then the charming équivoque in the change of the child : it all look so dramatic : -- it be a play ready make to my hand the invalid mother would form the pathetic the silly exclamation of the servant the ludicrous and the nurse be nature itself it be true i have a few scruple that it might should it come to the knowledge of ann be construe into something very like a breach of confidence but she be at home and might never happen to hear of the subject of my piece and if she do why it be only make some handsome apology -- to a dependant companion to whom i have be so very great a friend it be not necessary to be so very particular about such a trifle thus i reason as i write my drama begin with the title which i call the changeling and end with these word _ the curtain drop while the lady clasp the baby in she arm and the nurse sigh audibly _ i invent no new incident i simply write the story as ann have tell it to I in the best blank verse i be able to compose by the time it be finish the company have arrive the cast the different part be my next care the honorable augustus m -- a young gentleman of five year of age undertake to play the father he be only to come in and say _ how do my little darling do to-day _ the three miss -- 's be to be the servant they too have only single line to speak as these four be all very young performer we make they rehearse many time over that they might walk in and out with proper decorum but the performance be stop before they entrance and they exit arrive i complimented lady elizabeth the sister of augustus who be the eldest of the young lady with the choice of the lady mother or the nurse she fix on the former she be to recline on a sofa and affect ill health speak some eight or ten line which begin with _ o that i could my precious baby see _ to she cousin miss emily -- be give the girl who have the care of the nurse 's child two doll be to personate the two child and the principal character of the nurse i have the pleasure to perform myself it consist of several speech and a very long soliloquy during the change of the child 's clothes the elder brother of augustus a gentleman of fifteen year of age who refuse to mix in we childish drama yet condescend to paint the scene and we dress be get up by my own maid when we think ourselves quite perfect in we several part we announce it for representation sir edward and lady harriot with they visitor the parent of my young troop of comedian honor we with they presence the servant be also permit to go into a music gallery which be at the end of a ball-room we have choose for we theater as author and principal performer standing before a noble audience my mind be too much engage with the arduous task i have undertake to glance my eye towards the music gallery or i might have see two more spectator there than i expect nurse withers and she daughter ann be there they have be invite by the housekeeper to be present at the representation of miss lesley 's first piece in the midst of the performance as i in the character of the nurse be deliver the wrong child to the girl there be a exclamation from the music gallery of oh it be all true it be all true this be follow by a bustle among the servant and scream as of a person in a hysteric fit sir edward come forward to enquire what be the matter he see it be mrs withers who have fall into a fit ann be weep over she and cry out o miss lesley you have tell all in the play mr withers be bring out into the ball-room there with tear and in broken accent with every sign of terror and remorse she soon make a full confession of she so long conceal guilt the stranger assemble to see we childish mimicry of passion be witness to a highly work dramatic scene in real life i have intend they should see the curtain drop without any discovery of the deceit unable to invent any new incident i leave the conclusion imperfect as i find it : but they see a more strict poetical justice do they see the rightful child restore to its parent and the nurse overwhelm with shame and threaten with the severest punishment take this woman say sir edward and lock she up till she be deliver into the hand of justice ann on she knee implore mercy for she mother -- address the child who be gather round she dear lady say she help I on you knee help I to beg forgiveness for my mother down the young one all drop -- even lady elizabeth bent she knee sir edward pity she distress sir edward pardon she all join in the petition except one whose voice ought to have be loudest in the appeal no word no accent come from I i hang over lady harriot 's chair weep as if my heart would break but i weep for my own fall fortune not for my mother 's sorrow i think within myself if in the integrity of my heart refuse to participate in this unjust secret i have boldly venture to publish the truth i might have have some consolation in the praise which so generous a action would have merit : but it be through the vanity of be suppose to have write a pretty story that i have meanly break my faith with my friend and unintentionally proclaim the disgrace of my mother and myself while thought like these be pass through my mind ann have obtain my mother 's pardon instead of be send away to confinement and the horror of a prison she be give by sir edward into the care of the housekeeper who have order from lady harriot to see she put to bed and properly attend to for again this wretched woman have fall into a fit ann would have follow my mother but sir edward bring she back tell she that she should see she when she be better he then lead ann towards lady harriot desire she to embrace she child she do so and i see she as i have phrase it in the play _ clasp in she mother 's arm _ this scene have greatly affect the spirit of lady harriot through the whole of it it be with difficulty she have be keep from faint and she be now lead into the drawing-room by the lady the gentleman follow talk with sir edward of the astonishing instance of filial affection they have just see in the earnest pleading of the child for she suppose mother ann too go with they and be conduct by she whom i have always consider as my own particular friend lady elizabeth take hold of she hand and say miss lesley will you permit I to conduct you to the drawing-room i be leave weep behind the chair where lady harriot have sate and as i think quite alone a something have before twitch my frock two or three time so slightly i have scarcely notice it a little head now peep round and look up in my face say she be not miss lesley : it be the young augustus he have be sit at my foot but i have not observe he he then start up and take hold of my hand with one of he with the other hold fast by my clothes he lead or rather drag I into the midst of the company assemble in the drawing-room the vehemence of he manner he little face as red as fire catch every eye the lady smile and one gentleman laugh in a most unfeeling manner he elder brother pat he on the head and say you be a humane little fellow elizabeth we might have think of this very kind word be now speak to I by sir edward and he call I harriot precious name now grow to I lady harriot kiss I and say she would never forget how long she have love I as she child these be comfortable word but i hear echo round the room poor thing she can not help it -- i be sure she be to be pity -- dear lady harriot how kind how considerate you be ah what a deep sense of my altered condition do i then feel let the young lady divert themselves in another room say sir edward and harriot take you new sister with you and help she to entertain you friend yes he call I harriot again and afterwards invent new name for he daughter and I and always call we by they apparently in jest yet i know it be only because he would not hurt I with hear we name reverse when sir edward desire we to shew the child into another room ann and i walk towards the door a new sense of humiliation arise -- how could i go out at the door before miss lesley -- i stand irresolute she draw back the elder brother of my friend augustus assist I in this perplexity push we all forward as if in a playful mood he drive we indiscriminately before he say i will make one among you to-day he have never join in we sport before my luckless play that sad instance of my duplicity be never once mention to I afterwards not even by any one of the child who have act in it and i must also tell you how considerate a old lady be at the time about we dress as soon as she perceive thing grow very serious she hastily strip off the upper garment we wear to represent we different character i think i should have die with shame if the child have lead I into the drawing-room in the mummery i have worn to represent a nurse this good lady be of another essential service to I for perceive a irresolution in every one how they should behave to we which distressed I very much she contrived to place miss lesley above I at table and call she miss lesley and I miss withers say at the same time in a low voice but as if she mean i should hear she it be better these thing should be do at once then they be over my heart thank she for i feel the truth of what she say my poor mother continue very ill for many week : no medicine would remove the extreme dejection of spirit she labor under sir edward send for the clergyman of the parish to give she religious consolation every day he come to visit she and he would always take miss lesley and I into the room with he i think miss villier you father must be just such another man as dr wheelding we worthy rector just so i think he would have soothe the troubled conscience of my repentant mother how feelingly how kindly he use to talk of mercy and forgiveness my heart be soften by my own misfortune and the sight of my penitent suffering mother i feel that she be now my only parent i strove earnestly strive to love she yet ever when i look in she face she would seem to I to be the very identical person whom i should have once think sufficiently honor by a slight inclination of the head and a civil how do you do mr withers one day as miss lesley be hang over she with she accustomed fondness dr wheelding reading in a prayer-book and as i think not at that moment regard we i throw myself on my knee and silently pray that i too might be able to love my mother dr wheelding have be observe I : he take I into the garden and draw from I the subject of my petition you prayer my good young lady say he i hope be hear sure i be they have cause I to adopt a resolution which as it will enable you to see you mother frequently will i hope greatly assist you pious wish i will take you mother home with I to superintend my family under my roof doubtless sir edward will often permit you to see she perform you duty towards she as well as you possibly can -- affection be the growth of time with such good wish in you young heart do not despair that in due time it will assuredly spring up with the approbation of sir edward and lady harriot my mother be remove in a few day to dr wheelding 's house : there she soon recover -- there she at present reside she tell I she love I almost as well as she do when i be a baby and we both weep at parting when i come to school here perhaps i ought to conclude my story which i fear have be a tedious one : permit I however to say a few word concern the time which elapse since the discovery of my birth until my arrival here it be on the fifth day of -- that i be know to be ann withers and the daughter of my suppose nurse the company who be witness to my disgrace depart in a few day and i feel relieve from some part of the mortification i hourly experienced for every fresh instance even of kindness or attention i experienced go to my heart that i should be force to feel thankful for it circumstance as i be surely i have nothing justly to complain of the conduct of sir edward and lady harriot be kind in the extreme still preserve every appearance of a parental tenderness for I but ah i might no longer call they by the dear name of father and mother -- formerly when speaking of they i use proud of they title to delight to say sir edward or lady harriot do this or this now i would give world to say my father or my mother i should be perfectly unkind if i be to complain of miss lesley -- indeed i have not the least cause of complaint against she as my companion she affection and she gratitude have be unbounded and now that it be my turn to be the humble friend she try by every means in she power to make I think she feel the same respectful gratitude which in she dependant station she have so naturally display only in a few rarely constitute mind do that true attentive kindness spring up that delicacy of feeling which enter into every trivial thing be ever awake and keep watch lest it should offend myself though educate with the extremest care possess but little of this virtue virtue i call it though among man it be term politeness for since the day of my humiliating reverse of fortune i have learn its value i feel quite ashamed to give instance of any deficiency i observe or think i have observe in miss lesley now i be away from she and dispassionately speaking of it it seem as if my own soreness of temper have make I fancy thing i really believe now that i be mistaken but miss lesley have be so highly praise for she filial tenderness i think at last she seem to make a parade about it and use to run up to my mother and affect to be more glad to see she than she really be after a time and i think dr wheelding think so by a little hint he once drop but he too might be mistake for he be very partial to I i be under the greatest obligation in the world to this good dr wheelding he have make my mother quite a respectable woman and i be sure it be owe a great deal to he that she love I as well as she do and here though it may seem a little out of place let I stop to assure you that if i ever could have have any doubt of the sincerity of miss lesley 's affection towards I she behavior on the occasion of my come here ought completely to efface it she entreat with many tear and almost the same energy with which she plead for forgiveness for my mother that i might not be send away -- but she be not alike successful in she supplication miss lesley have make some progress in reading and write during the time she be my companion only it be highly necessary that every exertion should be now make -- the whole house be as i may say in requisition for she instruction sir edward and lady harriot devoted great part of the day to this purpose a well educate young person be take under we governess to assist she in she labor and to teach miss lesley music a drawing-master be engage to reside in the house at this time i be not remarkably forward in my education my governess be a native of france i speak french very correctly and i have make some progress in italian i have only have the instruction of master during the few month in the year we usually pass in london music i never have the least ear for i could scarcely be teach my note this defect in I be always particularly regret by my mother she be a excellent performer herself both on the piano and on the harp i think i have some taste for draw but as lady harriot do not particularly excel in this i lose so much time in the summer month practise only under my governess that i make no great proficiency even in this my favorite art but miss lesley with all these advantage which i have name every body so eager to instruct she she so willing to learn -- every thing so new and delightful to she how could it happen otherwise she in a short time become a little prodigy what best pleased lady harriot be after she have conquer the first difficulty she discover a wonderful talent for music here she be she mother 's own girl indeed -- she have the same sweet-toned voice -- the same delicate finger -- she musical governess have little now to do for as soon as lady harriot perceive this excellence in she she give up all company and devoted she whole time to instruct she daughter in this science nothing make the heart ache with such a hopeless heavy pain as envy i have feel deeply before but till now i could not be say to envy miss lesley -- all day long the note of the harp or the piano speak sad sound to I of the loss of a loved mother 's heart to have in a manner two mother and miss lesley to engross they both be too much indeed it be at this time that one day i have be weary with hearing lady harriot play one long piece of haydn 's music after another to she enraptured daughter we be to walk with we governess to dr wheelding 's that morning and after lady harriot have leave the room and we be quite ready for we walk miss lesley would not leave the instrument for i know not how long it be on that day that i think she be not quite honest in she expression of joy at the sight of my poor mother who have be wait at the garden-gate near two hour to see she arrive yet she might be for the music have put she in remarkably good spirit that morning o the music quite quite win lady harriot 's heart till miss lesley begin to play so well she often lament the time it would take before she daughter would have the air of a person of fashion 's child it be my part of the general instruction to give she lesson on this head we use to make a kind of play of it which we call lecture on fashionable manners : it be a pleasant amusement to I a sort of keep up the memory of past time but now the music be always in the way the last time it be talk of lady harriot say she daughter 's time be too precious to be take up with such trifling i must own that the music have that effect on miss lesley as to render these lecture less necessary which i will explain to you but first let I assure you that lady harriot be by no means in the habit of say these kind of thing it be almost a solitary instance i could give you a thousand instance the very reverse of this in she as well as in sir edward how kindly how frequently would they remind I that to I alone it be owe that they ever know they child call the day on which i be a petitioner for the admittance of ann into the house the bless birthday of they generous girl neither dancing nor any foolish lecture could do much for miss lesley she remain want in gracefulness of carriage but all that be usually attribute to dance music effect when she be sit before the instrument a resemblance to she mother become apparent to every eye she attitude and the expression of she countenance be the very same this soon follow she into every thing all be ease and natural grace for the music and with it the idea of lady harriot be always in she thought it be a pretty sight to see the daily improvement in she person even to I poor envious girl that i be soon after lady harriot have hurt I by call my little effort to improve she daughter trifling she make I large amends in a very kind and most unreserved conversation that she hold with I she tell I all the struggle she have have at first to feel a maternal tenderness for she daughter and she frankly confess that she have now gain so much on she affection that she fear she have too much neglect the solemn promise she have make I _ never to forget how long she have love I as she child _ encourage by she return kindness i own how much i have suffer and venture to express my fear that i have hardly courage enough to bear the sight of my former friend under a new designation as i must now appear to they on we removal to london which be expect to take place in a short time a few day after this she tell I in the gentlest manner possible that sir edward and herself be of opinion it would conduce to my happiness to pass a year or two at school i know that this proposal be kindly intend to spare I the mortification i so much dreaded therefore i endeavor to submit to my hard fate with cheerfulness and prepared myself not without reluctance to quit a mansion which have be the scene of so many enjoyment and latterly of such very different feeling iv elinor forester -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- when i be very young i have the misfortune to lose my mother my father very soon marry again in the morning of the day in which that event take place my father set I on he knee and as he often use to do after the death of my mother

just hear that that dear lady miss saville be go to be marry to papa and that she be to live with we and be my mamma the housekeeper shake she head and say poor thing how soon child forget every thing

several place anne say this be just the way we glove serve we at my mistress 's funeral the other check she and say hush i be then think of some instance in which my mamma have praise my memory and this reference to she funeral fix she idea in my mind from the time of she death no one have ever speak to I of my mamma and i have apparently forget she yet i have a habit which perhaps have not be observe of take my little stool which have be my mamma 's footstool and a doll which my mamma have drest for I while she be sit in she elbow-chair she head support with pillow with these in my hand i use to go to the door of the room in which i have see she in she last illness and after try to open it and peep through the keyhole from whence i could just see a glimpse of the crimson curtain i use to sit down on the stool before the door and play with my doll and sometimes sing to it mamma 's pretty song of balow my babe imitate as well as i could the weak voice in which she use to sing it to I my mamma have a very sweet voice i remember now the gentle tone in which she use to say my prattle do not disturb she when i be drest in my new frock i wish poor mamma be alive to see how fine i be on papa 's wedding-day and i run to my favorite station at she bed-room door there i sit thinking of my mamma and try to remember exactly how she use to look because i foolishly imagine that miss saville

stair to look for I and my new mamma follow he they find I at my mother 's door earnestly look through the keyhole i be think so intently on my mother that when my father say here be you new mamma my

instead of the wrap gown and close cap in which i remember my mamma she be drest in all she bridal decoration i say miss saville shall not be my mamma and i cry till i be send away in disgrace every time i see she for several day the same notion come into my head that she be not a bit more like mamma than when she be miss saville my father be very angry when he see how shy i continue to look at she but she always say never mind elinor and i shall soon be better friend one day when i be very naughty indeed for i would not speak one word to either of they my papa take he hat and walk out quite in a passion when he be go i look up at my new mamma expect to see she very angry too but she be smile and look very good-naturedly upon I and she say now we be alone together my pretty little daughter let we forget papa be angry with we and tell I why you be peep through that door the day you papa bring I home and you cry so at the sight of I because mamma use to be there i reply when she hear I say this she fall a-crying very sadly indeed and i be so very sorry to hear she cry so that i forget i do not love she and i go up to she and say do not cry i will not be naughty any more i will not peep through the door any more then she say i have a little kind heart and i should not have any occasion for she would take I into the room herself and she ring the bell and order the key of that room to be bring to she and the housekeeper bring it and try to persuade she not to go but she say i must have my own way in this and she carry I in she arm into my mother 's room o i be so pleased to be take into mamma 's room i point out to she all the thing that i remember to have belong to mamma and she encourage I to tell she all the little incident which have dwell on my memory concern she she tell I that she go to school with mamma when she be a little girl and that i should come into this room with she every day when papa be go out and she would tell I story of mamma when she be a little girl no bigger than I when my father come home we be walk in a garden at the back of we house and i be shew she mamma 's geranium and tell she what pretty flower they have when mamma

she say too that she will call I ` mamma ' yes i will mamma mamma mamma i reply and hang about she with the greatest fondness after this she use to pass great part of the morning with I in my mother 's room which be now make the repository of all my plaything and also my school-room here my new mamma teach I to read i be a sad little dunce and scarcely know my letter my own mamma have often say when she get better she would hear I read every day but as she never get better it be not she fault i now begin to learn very fast for when i say my lesson well i be always reward with some pretty story of my mother 's childhood and these story generally contain some little hint that be instructive to I and which i greatly stand in want of for between improper indulgence and neglect i have many faulty way in this kind manner my mother-in-law have instruct and improve I and i love she because she be my mother 's friend when they be young she have be my only instructress for i never go to school till i come here she would have continue to teach I but she have not time for she have a little baby of she own now and that be the reason i come to school v margaret green -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- my father have be dead near three year soon after he death my mother be leave in reduce circumstance she be induce to accept the offer of mr beresford a elderly lady of large fortune to live in she house as she companion and the superintendent of she family this lady be my godmother and as i be my mother 's only child she very kindly permit she to have I with she mr beresford live in a large old family mansion she keep no company and never move except from the breakfast-parlour to the eating-room and from thence to the drawing-room to tea every morning when she first see I she use to nod she head very kindly and say how do you do little margaret but i do not recollect she ever speak to I during the remainder of the day except indeed after i have read the psalm and the chapter which be my daily task then she use constantly to observe that i improve in my reading and frequently add i never hear a child read so distinctly she have be remarkably fond of needle-work and she conversation with my mother be generally the history of some piece of work she have formerly do the date when they be begin and when finish what have retard they progress and what have hasten they completion if occasionally any other event be speak of she have no other chronology to reckon by than in the recollection of what carpet what sofa-cover what set of chair be in the frame at that time i believe my mother be not particularly fond of needle-work for in my father 's lifetime i never see she amuse herself in this way yet to oblige she kind patroness she undertake to finish a large carpet which the old lady have just begin when she eye-sight fail she all day long my mother use to sit at the frame talking of the shades of the worst and the beauty of the color -- mr beresford seat in a chair near she and though she eye be so dim she could hardly distinguish one color from another watch through she spectacles the progress of the work when my daily portion of reading be over i have a task of needle-work which generally last half a hour i be not allow to pass more time in reading or work because my eye be very weak for which reason i be always set to read in the large-print family bible i be very fond of reading and when i could unobserved steal a few minute as they be intent on they work i use to delight to read in the historical part of the bible but this because of my eye be a forbid pleasure and the bible never be remove out of the room it be only for a short time together that i dare softly to lift up the leaf and peep into it as i be permit to walk in the garden or wander about the house whenever i pleased i use to leave the parlor for hour together and make out my own solitary amusement as well as i could my first visit be always to a very large hall which from be pave with marble be call the marble hall in this hall while mr beresford 's husband be live the tenant use to be feast at christmas the head of the twelve cæsars be hung round the hall every day i mount on the chair to look at they and to read the inscription underneath till i become perfectly familiar with they name and feature hogarth 's print be below the cæsars : i be very fond of look at they and endeavor to make out they mean a old broken battledore and some shuttlecock with most of the feather miss be on a marble slab in one corner of the hall which constantly remind I that there have once be younger inhabitant here than the old lady and she gray-headed servant in another corner stand a marble figure of a satyr : every day i lay my hand on he shoulder to feel how cold he be this hall open into a room full of family portrait they be all in the dress of former time : some be old man and woman and some be child i use to long to have a fairy 's power to call the child down from they frame to play with I one little girl in particular who hang by the side of a glass door which open into the garden i often invite to walk there with I but she still keep she station -- one arm round a little lamb 's neck and in she hand a large bunch of rose from this room i usually proceed to the garden when i be weary of the garden i wander over the rest of the house the best suite of room i never see by any other light than what glimmer through the top of the window-shutter which however serve to shew the carve chimney-piece and the curious old ornament about the room but the work furniture and carpet of which i hear such constant praise i could have but a imperfect sight of peep under the cover which be keep over they by the dim light for i constantly lift up a corner of the envious cloth that hide these highly-praised rarity from my view the bed-room be also regularly explore by I as well to admire the antique furniture as for the sake of contemplate the tapestry hanging which be full of bible history the subject of the one which chiefly attract my attention be hagar and she son ishmael every day i admire the beauty of the youth and pity the forlorn state of he and he mother in the wilderness at the end of the gallery into which these tapestry room open be one door which have often in vain attempt to open i conclude to be lock and find myself shut out i be very desirous of see what it contain and though still foiled in the attempt i every day endeavor to turn the lock which whether by constantly try i loosen be probably a very old one or that the door be not lock but fasten tight by time i know not -- to my great joy as i be one day try the lock as usual it give way and i find myself in this so long desire room it prove to be a very large library this be indeed a precious discovery i look round on the book with the greatest delight i think i would read they every one i now forsake all my favorite haunt and pass all my time here i take down first one book then another if you never spend whole morning alone in a large library you can not conceive the pleasure of take down book in the constant hope of find a entertaining book among they yet after many day meet with nothing but disappointment it become less pleasant all the book within my reach be folio of the gravest cast i could understand very little that i read in they and the old dark print and the length of the line make my eye ache when i have almost resolve to give up the search as fruitless i perceive a volume lie in a obscure corner of the room i open it it be a charming print the letter be almost as large as the type of the family bible in the first page i look into i see the name of my favorite ishmael whose face i know so well from the tapestry and whose history i have often read in the bible i sate myself down to read this book with the greatest eagerness the title of it be mahometism explain it be a very improper book for it contain a false history of abraham and he descendant i shall be quite ashamed to tell you the strange effect it have on I i know it be very wrong to read any book without permission to do so if my time be to come over again i would go and tell my mamma that there be a library in the house and ask she to permit I to read a little while every day in some book that she might think proper to select for I but unfortunately i do not then recollect that i ought to do this : the reason of my strange forgetfulness might be that my mother follow the example of she patroness have almost wholly discontinue talk to I i scarcely ever hear a word address to I from morning to night if it be not for the old servant say good morning to you miss margaret as they pass I in the long passage i should have be the greatest part of the day in as perfect a solitude as robinson crusoe it must have be because i be never speak to at all that i forget what be right and what be wrong for i do not believe that i ever remembered i be do wrong all the time i be read in the library a great many of the leaf in mahometism explain be tear out but enough remain to make I imagine that ishmael be the true son of abraham : i read here that the true descendant of abraham be know by a light which stream from the middle of they forehead it say that ishmael 's father and mother first see this light streaming from he forehead as he be lie asleep in the cradle i be very sorry so many of the leaf be tear out for it be as entertaining as a fairy tale i use to read the history of ishmael and then go and look at he in the tapestry and then read he history again when i have almost learn the history of ishmael by heart i read the rest of the book and then i come to the history of mahomet who be there say to be the last descendant of abraham if ishmael have engage so much of my thought how much more so must mahomet he history be full of nothing but wonder from the begin to the end the book say that those who believe all the wonderful story which be related of mahomet be call mahometan and true believer : -- i conclude that i must be a mahometan for i believe every word i read at length i meet with something which i also believe though i tremble as i read it : -- this be that after we be dead we be to pass over a narrow bridge which cross a bottomless gulf the bridge be describe to be no wider than a silken thread and it say that all who be not mahometan would slip on one side of this bridge and drop into the tremendous gulf that have no bottom i consider myself as a mahometan yet i be perfectly giddy whenever i thought of pass over this bridge one day see the old lady totter across the room a sudden terror seize I for i think how would she ever be able to get over the bridge then too it be that i first recollect that my mother would also be in imminent danger for i imagine she have never hear the name of mahomet because i foolishly conjecture this book have be lock up for age in the library and be utterly unknown to the rest of the world all my desire be now to tell they the discovery i have make for i think when they know of the existence of mahometism explain they would read it and become mahometan to ensure themselves a safe passage over the silken bridge but it want more courage than i possess to break the matter to my intended convert i must acknowledge that i have be read without leave and the habit of never speak or be speak to considerably increase the difficulty my anxiety on this subject throw I into a fever i be so ill that my mother think it necessary to sleep in the same room with I in the middle of the night i could not resist the strong desire i feel to tell she what prey so much on my mind i awake she out of a sound sleep and beg she would be so kind as to be a mahometan she be very much alarm for she think i be delirious which i believe i be for i try to explain the reason of my request but it be in such a incoherent manner that she could not at all comprehend what i be talk about the next day a physician be send for and he discover by several question that he put to I that i have read myself into a fever he give I medicine and order I to be keep very quiet and say he hope in a few day i should be very well but as it be a new case to he he never have attend a little mahometan before if any lowness continue after he have remove the fever he would with my mother 's permission take I home with he to study this extraordinary case at he leisure and add that he could then hold a consultation with he wife who be often very useful to he in

lady to undergo a severe course of medicine especially as i hear he very formally ask she advice what be good for a mahometan fever the moment after he have hand I into the carriage she study a little while and then she say a ride to harlow fair would not be amiss he say he be entirely of she opinion because it suit he to go there to buy a horse during the ride they enter into conversation with I and in answer to they question i be relate to they the solitary manner in which i have pass my time how i find out the library and what i have read in the fatal book which have so heated my imagination -- when we arrive at the fair and ishmael mahomet and the narrow bridge vanish out of my head in a instant o what a cheerful sight it be to I to see so many happy face assemble together walk up and down between the row of booth that be full of showy thing ribband lace toy cake and sweetmeat while the doctor be go to buy he horse he kind lady let I stand as long as i pleased at the booth and give I many thing which she see i particularly admire my needle-case my pin-cushion indeed my work-basket and all its contents be present which she purchase for I at this fair after we return home she play with I all the evening at a geographical game which she also buy for I at this cheerful fair the next day she invite some young lady of my own age to spend the day with I she have

and he lady i be carry home at the end of a month perfectly cure of the error into which i have fall and very much ashamed of have believe so many absurdity vi emily barton -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- when i be a very young child i remember reside with a uncle and aunt who live in -- shire i think i remain there near a twelvemonth i be ignorant of the cause of my be so long left there by my parent who though they be remarkably fond of I never come to see I during all that time as i do not know i should ever have occasion to relate the occurrence of my life i never think of enquire the reason i be just able to recollect that when i first go there i think it be a fine thing to live in the country and play with my little cousin in the garden all day long and i also recollect that i soon find that it be a very dull thing to live in the country with little cousin who have a papa and mamma in the house while my own dear papa and mamma be in london many mile away i have hear my papa observe girl who be not well manage be a most quarrelsome race of little people my cousin very often quarrel with I and then they always say i will go and tell my mamma cousin emily and then i use to be very disconsolate because i have no mamma to complain to of my grievance my aunt always take sophium 's part because she be so young and she never suffer I to oppose mary or elizabeth because they be older than I the plaything be all the property of one or other of my cousin the large doll belong to mary and elizabeth and the pretty little wax doll be dress on purpose for sophium who always begin to cry the instant i touch they i have nothing that i could call my own but one pretty book of story and one day as sophium be endeavor to take it from I and i be try to keep it it be all tear to piece and my aunt would not be angry with she she only say sophium be a little baby and do not know any better my uncle promise to buy I another book but he never remember it very often when he come home in the evening he use to say i wonder what i have get in my pocket and then they all crowd round he and i use to creep towards he and think may be it be my book that my uncle have get in he pocket but no nothing ever come out for I yet the first sight of a plaything even if it be not one 's own be always a cheerful thing and a new toy would put they in a good humor for a while and they would say here emily look what i have get you may take it in you own hand and look at it but the pleasure of examine it be sure to be stop in a short time by the old story of give that to I again you know that be mine nobody could help i think be a little out of humor if they be always serve so : but if i shewed any sign of discontent my aunt always tell my uncle i be a little peevish fretful thing and give she more trouble than all she own child put together my aunt would often say what a happy thing it be to have such affectionate child as hers be she be always praise my cousin because they be affectionate that be sure to be she word she say i have not one atom of affection in my disposition for that no kindness ever make the least impression on I and she would say all this with sophium seat on she lap and the two eldest perhaps hang round they papa while i be so dull to see they take so much notice of and so sorry that i be not affectionate that i do not know what to do with myself then there be another complaint against I that i be so shy before stranger whenever any stranger speak to I before i have time to think what answer i should give mary or elizabeth would say emily be so shy she will never speak then i think i be very shy would creep into a corner of the room and be ashamed to look up while the company staid though i often think of my papa and mamma by degree the remembrance of they person fade out of my mind when i try to think how they use to look the face of my cousin ' papa and mamma only come into my mind one morning my uncle and aunt go abroad before breakfast and take my cousin with they they very often go out for whole day together and leave I at home sometimes they say it be because they could not take so many child and sometimes they say it be because i be so shy it be no amusement to I to go abroad that morning i be very solitary indeed for they have even take the dog sancho with they and i be very fond of he i go all about the house and garden to look for he nobody could tell I where sancho be and then i go into the front court and call sancho sancho a old man that work in the garden be there and he say sancho be go with he master o how sorry i be i begin to cry for sancho and i use to amuse ourselves for hour together when every body be go out i cry till i hear the mail coachman 's horn and then i run to the gate to see the mail-coach go past it stop before we gate and a gentleman get out and the moment he see I he take I in he arm and kiss I and say i be emily barton and ask I why the tear be on my little pale cheek and i tell he the cause of my distress the old man ask he to walk into the house and be go to call one of the servant but the gentleman would not let he and he say go on with you work i want to talk to this little girl before i go into the house then he sate down on a bench which be in the court and ask I many question and i tell he all my little trouble for he be such a good-natured-looking gentleman that i prattle very freely to he i tell he all i have tell you and more for the unkind treatment i meet with be more fresh in my mind than it be now then he call to the old man and desire he to fetch a post-chaise and give he money that he should make haste and i never see the old man walk so fast before when he have be go a little while the gentleman say will you walk with I down the road to meet the chaise and you shall ride in it a little way along with I i have nothing on not even my old straw bonnet that i use to wear in the garden but i do not mind that and i run by he side a good way till we meet the chaise and the old man ride with the driver the gentleman say get down and open the door and then he lift I in the old man look in a sad fright and say o sir i hope you be not go to take the child away the gentleman throw out a small card and bid he give that to he master and call to the post-boy to drive on we lose sight of the old man in a minute the gentleman laugh very much and say we have frighten the old man he think i be go to run away with you and i laugh and think it a very good joke and he say so you tell I you be very shy and i reply yes sir i be before stranger : he say so i perceive you be and then he laugh again and i laugh though i do not know why we have such a merry ride laugh all the way at one thing or another till we come to a town where the chaise stop and he order some breakfast when i get out i begin to shiver a little for it be the latter end of autumn the leaf be fall off the tree and the air blow very cold then he desire the waiter to go and order a straw-hat and a little warm coat for I and when the milliner come he tell she he have steal a little heiress and we be go to gretna green in such a hurry that the young lady have no time to put on she bonnet before she come out the milliner say i be a pretty little heiress and she wish we a pleasant journey when we have breakfast and i be equip in my new coat and bonnet i jump into the chaise again as warm and as lively as a little bird when it grow dark we enter a large city the chaise begin to roll over the stone and i see the lamp range along london street though we have breakfast and dine upon the road and i have get out of one chaise into another many time and be now ride on in the dark i never once consider where i be or where i be go to i put my head out of the chaise window and admire those beautiful light i be sorry when the chaise stop and i could no longer look at the brilliant row of light lamp take away by a stranger under a pretence of a short ride and bring quite to london do you not expect some perilous end of this adventure ah it be my papa himself though i do not know who he be till after he have put I into my mamma 's arm and tell she how he have run away with he own little daughter it be you papa my dear that have bring you to you own home this be you mamma my love they both exclaim at once mamma cry for joy to see I and she weep again when she hear my papa tell what a neglect child i have be at my uncle 's this he have find out he say by my own innocent prattle and that he be so offend with he brother my uncle that he would not enter he house and then he say what a little happy good child i have be all the way and that when he find i do not know he he would not tell I who he be for the sake of the pleasant surprise it would be to I it be a surprise and a happiness indeed after live with unkind relation all at once to know i be at home with my own dear papa and mamma my mamma order tea whenever i happen to like my tea very much i always think of the delicious cup of tea mamma give we after we journey i think i see the urn smoking before I now and papa wheeling the sopha round that i might sit between they at the table mamma call I little run-away and say it be very well it be only papa i tell she how we frighten the old gardener and open my eye to shew she how he stare and how my papa make the milliner believe we be go to gretna green mamma look grave and say she be almost frighten to find i have be so fearless but i promise she another time i would not go into a post-chaise with a gentleman without ask he who he be and then she laugh and seem very well satisfied mamma to my fancy look very handsome she be very nicely dress quite like a fine lady i hold up my head and feel very proud that i have such a papa and mamma i think to myself o dear my cousin ' papa and mamma be not to be compare to mine papa say what make you bridle and simper so emily then i tell he all that be in my mind papa ask if i do not think he as pretty as i do mamma i could not say much for he beauty but i tell he he be a much finer gentleman than my uncle and that i like he the first moment i see he because he look so good-natured he say well then he must be content with that half-praise but he have always think himself very handsome o dear say i and fall a-laughing till i spilt my tea and mamma call I little aukward girl the next morning my papa be go to the bank to receive some money and he take mamma and I with he that i might have a ride through london street everyone that have be in london must have see the bank and therefore you may imagine what a effect the fine large room and the bustle and confusion of people have on I who be grow such a little wonder rustic that the crowded street and the fine shop alone keep I in continual admiration as we be return home down cheapside papa say emily shall take home some little book -- shall we order the coachman to the corner of st paul 's church-yard or shall we go to the juvenile library in skinner-street mamma say she would go to skinner-street for she want to look at the new building there papa buy I seven new book and the lady in the shop persuade he to take more but mamma say that be quite enough at present we go home by ludgate-hill because mamma want to buy something there and while she go into a shop papa hear I read in one of my new book and he say he be glad to find i could read so well for i have forget to tell he my aunt use to hear I read every day my papa stop the coach opposite to st dunstan 's church that i might see the great iron figure strike upon the bell to give notice that it be a quarter of a hour past two we wait some time that i might see this sight but just at the moment they be striking i happen to be look at a toy-shop that be on the other side of the way and unluckily miss it papa say never mind : we will go into the toyshop and i dare say we shall find something that will console you for you disappointment do say mamma for i know miss pearson that keep this shop at weymouth when i be a little girl not much older than emily take notice of she -- she be a very intelligent old lady mamma make herself know to miss pearson and shew I to she but i do not much mind what they say no more do papa -- for we be busy among the toy a large wax doll a baby-house completely furnish and several other beautiful toy be buy for I i sit and look at they with a amazing deal of pleasure as we ride home -- they quite fill up one side of the coach the joy i discover at possess thing i could call my own and the frequent repetition of the word _ my own my own _ give my mamma some uneasiness she justly fear that the cold treatment i have experience at my uncle 's have make I selfish and therefore she invite a little girl to spend a few day with I to see as she have since tell I if i should not be liable to fall into the same error from which i have suffer so much at my uncle 's as my mamma have fear so the event prove for i quickly adopt my cousin ' selfish idea and give the young lady notice that they be my own plaything 's and she must not amuse herself with they any longer than i permit she then presently i take occasion to begin a little quarrel with she and say i have get a mamma now miss frederica as well as you and i will go and tell she and she will not let you play with my doll any longer than i please because it be my own doll and i very well remember i imitate as nearly as i could the haughty tone in which my cousin use to speak to I oh fie emily say my mamma can you be the little girl who use to be so distressed because you cousin would not let you play with they doll do you not see you be do the very same unkind thing to you play-fellow that they do to you then i see as plain as could be what a naughty girl i be and i promise not to do so any more a lady be sit with mamma and mamma say i believe i must pardon you this once but i hope never to see such a thing again this lady be miss frederica 's mamma and i be quite ashamed that she should be witness to you inhospitality to she daughter particularly as she be so kind to come on purpose to invite you to a share in she _ own _ private box at the theater this evening she carriage be wait at the door to take we but how can we accept of the invitation after what have happen the lady beg it might all be forget and mamma consent that i should go and she say but i hope my dear emily when you be sit in the play-house you will remember that pleasure be far more delightful when they be share among number if the whole theater be you own and you be sit by yourself to see the performance how dull it would seem to what you will find it with so many happy face around we all amuse with the same thing i hardly know what my mamma mean for i have never see a play but when i get there after the curtain draw up i look up towards the gallery and down into the pit and into all the box and then i know what a pretty sight it be to see a number of happy face i be very well convince that it would not have be half so cheerful if the theater have be my own to have sit there by myself from that time whenever i feel inclined to be selfish i use to remember the theater where the mamma of the young lady i have be so rude to give I a seat in she own box there be nothing in the world so charming as go to a play all the way there i be as dull and as silent as i use to be in -- shire because i be so sorry mamma have be displeased with I just as the coach stop miss frederica say will you be friend with I emily and i reply yes if you please frederica and we go hand in hand together into the house i do not speak any more till we enter the box but after that i be as lively as if nothing at all have happen i shall never forget how delighted i be at the first sight of the house my little friend and i be place together in the front while we mamma retire to the back part of the box to chat by themselves for they have be so kind as to come very early that i might look about I before the performance begin frederica have be very often at a play she be very useful in tell I what every thing be she make I observe how the common people be come bustling down the bench in the gallery as if they be afraid they should lose they place she tell I what a crowd these poor people have to go through before they get into the house then she shew I how leisurely they all come into the pit and look about they before they take they seat she give I a charming description of the king and queen at the play and shew I where they sate and tell I how the princess be drest it be a pretty sight to see the remainder of the candle light and so it be to see the musician come up from under the stage i admire the music very much and i ask if that be the play frederica laugh at my ignorance and then she tell I when the play begin the green curtain would draw up to the sound of soft music and i should hear a lady dress in black say music have charm to soothe a savage breast : and those be the very first word the actress whose name be almeria speak when the curtain begin to draw up and i see the bottom of she black petticoat and hear the soft music what a agitation i be in but before that we have long to wait frederica tell I we should wait till all the dress box be full and then the light would pop up under the orchestra the second music would play and then the play would begin this play be the mourning bride it be a very move tragedy and after that when the curtain dropt and i think it be all over i see the most divert pantomime that ever be see i make a strange blunder the next day for i tell papa that almerium be marry to harlequin at last but i assure you i mean to say columbine for i know very well that almerium be marry to alphonso for she say she be in the first scene she think he be dead but she find he again just as i do my papa and mamma when she least expect it vii maria howe -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- i be bring up in the country from my infancy i be always a weak and tender-spirited girl subject to fear and depression my parent and particularly my mother be of a very different disposition they be what be usually call gay : they love pleasure and party and visit but as they find the turn of my mind to be quite opposite they give themselves little trouble about I but upon such occasion generally leave I to my choice which be much oftener to stay at home and indulge myself in my solitude than to join in they rambling visit i be always fond of be alone yet always in a manner afraid there be a book-closet which lead into my mother 's dressing-room here i be eternally fond of be shut up by myself to take down whatever volume i pleased and pore upon they no matter whether they be fit for my year or no or whether i understand they here when the weather would not permit my go into the dark walk _ my walk _ as it be call in the garden here when my parent have be from home i have stay for hour together till the loneliness which please I so at first have at length become quite frightful and i have rush out of the closet into the inhabit part of the house and seek refuge in the lap of some one of the female servant or of my aunt who would say see I look pale that hannah -lrb- marium -rrb- have be frightening herself with some of those _ nasty book _ : so she use to call my favorite volume which i would not have part with no not with one of the least of they if i have have the choice to be make a fine princess and to govern the world but my aunt be no reader she use to excuse herself and say that reading hurt she eye i have be naughty enough to think that this be only a excuse for i find that my aunt 's weak eye do not prevent she from pore ten hour a day upon she prayer-book or she favorite thoma à kempi but this be always she excuse for not read any of the book i recommend my aunt be my father 's sister she have never be marry my father be a good deal older than my mother and my aunt be ten year older than my father as i be often leave at home with she and as my serious disposition so well agree with hers a intimacy grow up between the old lady and I and she would often say that she only love one person in the world and that be I not that she and my parent be on very bad term but the old lady do not feel herself respect enough the attention and fondness which she shew to I conscious as i be that i be almost the only be she feel any thing like fondness to make I love she as it be natural indeed i be ashamed to say that i fear i almost love she better than both my parent put together but there be a oddness a silence about my aunt which be never interrupted but by she occasional expression of love to I that make I stand in fear of she a odd look from under she spectacles would sometimes scare I away when i have be peer up in she face to make she kiss I then she have a way of mutter to herself which though it be good word and religious word that she be mumble somehow i do not like my weak spirit and the fear i be subject to always make I afraid of any personal singularity or oddness in any one i be ashamed lady to lay open so many particulars of we family but indeed it be necessary to the understanding of what i be go to tell you of a very great weakness if not wickedness which i be guilty of towards my aunt but i must return to my study and tell you what book i find in the closet and what reading i chiefly admire there be a great book of martyr in which i use to read or rather i use to spell out meaning for i be too ignorant to make out many word but there it be write all about those good man who choose to be burnt alive rather than forsake they religion and become naughty papist some word i could make out some i could not but i make out enough to fill my little head with vanity and i use to think i be so courageous i could be burnt too and i would put my hand upon the flame which be picture in the pretty picture which the book have and feel they but you know lady there be a great difference between the flame in a picture and real fire and i be now ashamed of the conceit which i have of my own courage and think how poor a martyr i should have make in those day then there be a book not so big but it have picture in it be call culpepper 's herbal it be full of picture of plant and herb but i do not much care for that then there be salmon 's modern history out of which i pick a good deal it have picture of chinese god and the great hooded serpent which run strangely in my fancy there be some law book too but the old english fright I from read they but above all what i relish be stackhouse 's history of the bible where there be the picture of the ark and all the beast get into it this delighted I because it puzzle I and many a ache head have i get with pore into it and contrive how it might be build with such and such room to hold all the world if there should be another flood and sometimes settle what pretty beast should be save and what should not for i would have no ugly or deform beast in my pretty ark but this be only a piece of folly and vanity that a little reflection might cure I of foolish girl that i be to suppose that any creature be really ugly that have all its limb contrived with heavenly wisdom and be doubtless form to some beautiful end though a child can not comprehend it -- doubtless a frog or a toad be not uglier in itself than a squirrel or a pretty green lizard but we want understand to see it -lrb- _ here i must remind you my dear miss howe that one of the young lady smile and two or three be see to titter at this part of you narration and you seem i think a little too angry for a girl of you sense and reading but you will remember my dear that young head be not always able to bear strange and unusual assertion and if some elder person possibly or some book which you have find have not put it into you head you would hardly have discover by you own reflection that a frog or a toad be equal in real loveliness to a frisk squirrel or a pretty green lizard as you call it not remember that at this very time you give the lizard the name of pretty and leave it out to the frog -- so liable we all be to prejudice but you go on with you story _ -rrb- these fancy lady be not so very foolish or naughty perhaps but they may be forgive in a child of six year old but what i be go to tell i shall be ashamed of and repent i hope as long as i live it will teach I not to form rash judgement besides the picture of the ark and many other which i have forget stackhouse contain one picture which make more impression upon my childish understanding than all the rest it be the picture of the raise up of samuel which i use to call the witch of endor picture i be always very fond of pick up story about witch there be a book call glanvil on witch which use to lie about in this closet it be thumb about and shew it have be much read in former time this be my treasure here i use to pick out the strangest story my not be able to read they very well probably make they appear more strange and out of the way to I but i could collect enough to understand that witch be old woman who give themselves up to do mischief -- how by the help of spirit as bad as themselves they lame cattle and make the corn not grow and how they make image of wax to stand for people that have do they any injury or they think have do they injury and how they burn the image before a slow fire and stick pin in they and the person which these waxen image represent however far distant feel all the pain and torment in good earnest which be inflict in show upon these image : and such a horror i have of these wicked witch that though i be now better instruct and look upon all these story as mere idle tale and invent to fill people 's head with nonsense yet i can not recall to mind the horror which i then feel without shudder and feel something of the old fit return -lrb- _ here my dear miss howe you may remember that miss m -- the youngest of we party shew some more curiosity than usual i winked upon you to hasten to you story lest the terror which you be describe should make too much impression upon a young head and you kindly understand my sign and say less upon the subject of you fear than i fancy you first intend _ -rrb- this foolish book of witch story have no picture in it but i make up for they out of my own fancy and out of the great picture of the raise up of samuel in stackhouse i be not old enough to understand the difference there be between these silly improbable tale which imputed such power to poor old woman who be the most helpless thing in the creation and the narrative in the bible which do not say that the witch or pretend witch raise up the dead body of samuel by she own power but as it clearly appear he be permit by the divine will to appear to confound the presumption of saul and that the witch herself be really as much frightened and confound at the miracle as saul himself not expect a real appearance but probably have prepare some juggle slight-of-hand trick and sham appearance to deceive the eye of saul : whereas she nor any one living have ever the power to raise the dead to life but only he who make they from the first these reason i might have read in stackhouse itself if i have be old enough and have read they in that very book since i be older but at that time i look at little beyond the picture these story of witch so terrify I that my sleep be break and in my dream i always have a fancy of a witch be in the room with I i know now that it be only nervousness but though i can laugh at it now as well as you lady if you know what i suffer you would be thankful that you have have sensible people about you to instruct you and teach you better i be let grow up wild like a ill weed and thrive accordingly one night that i have be terrify in my sleep with my imagination i get out of bed and creep softly to the adjoining room my room be next to where my aunt usually sit when she be alone into she room i creep for relief from my fear the old lady be not yet retire to rest but be sit with she eye half open half close she spectacles totter upon she nose she head nod over she prayer-book she lip mumble the word as she read they or half read they in she dozing posture she grotesque appearance she old-fashioned dress resemble what i have see in that fatal picture in stackhouse all this with the dead time of night as it seem to I -lrb- for i have go through my first sleep -rrb- all join to produce a wicked fancy in I that the form which i have behold be not my aunt but some witch she mumbling of she prayer confirm I in this shocking idea i have read in glanvil of those wicked creature read they prayer _ backwards _ and i think that this be the operation which she lip be at this time employ about instead of fly to she friendly lap for that protection which i have so often experience when i have be weak and timid i shrink back terrify and bewilder to my bed where i lay in broken sleep and miserable fancy till the morning which i have so much reason to wish for come my fancy a little wear away with the light but a impression be fix which could not for a long time be do away in the day-time when my father and mother be about the house when i see they familiarly speak to my aunt my fear all vanish and when the good creature have take I upon she knee and shew I any kindness more than ordinary at such time i have melt into tear and long to tell she what naughty foolish fancy i have have of she but when night return that figure which i have see recur -- the posture the half-closed eye the mumbling and mutter which i have hear a confusion be in my head _ who _ it be i have see that night : -- it be my aunt and it be not my aunt : -- it be that good creature who love I above all the world engage at she good task of devotions -- perhaps pray for some good to I again it be a witch -- a creature hateful to god and man reading backwards the good prayer who would perhaps destroy I in these conflict of mind i pass several week till by a revolution in my fate i be remove to the house of a female relation of my mother 's in a distant part of the county who have come on a visit to we house and observe my lonely way and apprehensive of the ill effect of my mode of live upon my health beg leave to take I home to she house to reside for a short time i go with some reluctance at leave my closet my dark walk and even my aunt who have be such a source of both love and terror to I but i go and soon find the good effect of a change of scene instead of melancholy closet and lonely avenue of tree i see lightsome room and cheerful face i have companion of my own age no book be allow I but what be rational or sprightly that give I mirth or give I instruction i soon learn to laugh at witch story and when i return after three or four month absence to we own house my good aunt appear to I in the same light in which i have view she from my infancy before that foolish fancy possess I or rather i should say more kind more fond more loving than before it be impossible to say how much good that lady the kind relation of my mother 's that i speak of do to I by change the scene quite a new turn of idea be give to I i become sociable and companionable : my parent soon discover a change in I and i have find a similar alteration in they they have be plainly more fond of I since that change as from that time i learn to conform myself more to they way of live i have never since have that aversion to company and go out with they which use to make they regard I with less fondness than they would have wish to shew i impute almost all that i have to complain of in they neglect to my have be a little unsociable uncompanionable mortal i live in this manner for a year or two pass my time between we house and the lady 's who so kindly take I in hand till by she advice i be send to this school where i have tell to you lady what for fear of ridicule i never venture to tell any person besides the story of my foolish and naughty fancy viii charlotte wilmot -lrb- _ by mary lamb _ -rrb- until i be eleven year of age my life be one continue series of indulgence and delight my father be a merchant and suppose to be in very opulent circumstance at least i think so for at a very early age i perceive that we live in a more expensive way than any of my father 's friend do it be not the pride of birth of which miss withers you once imagine you might justly boast but the mere display of wealth that i be early teach to set a undue value on my parent spare no cost for master to instruct I i have

entertainment as often as i pleased i look down on all my young companion as my inferior but i chiefly assume air of superiority over marium hartley whose father be a clerk in my father 's counting-house and therefore i conclude she would regard the fine show i make with more envy and admiration than any other of my companion in the day of my humiliation which i too soon experienced i be throw on the bounty of she father for support to be a dependent on the charity of she family seem the heaviest evil that could have befall I for i remember how often i have display my finery and my expensive ornament on purpose to enjoy the triumph of my superior advantage and with shame i now speak it i have often glance at she plain linen frock when i shewed she my beautiful ball-dress nay i once give she a hint which she so well understand that she burst into tear that i could not invite she to some of my party because she mamma once send she on my birthday in a color frock i can not now think of my want of feeling without excessive pain but one day i see she highly amuse with some curious toy and on she express the pleasure the sight of they give she i say yes they be very well for those who be not accustom to these thing but for my part i have so many i be tire of they and i be quite delighted to pass a hour in the empty closet you mamma allow you to receive you visitor in because there be nothing there to interrupt the conversation once as i have say marium be betray into tear : now that i insulted she by call she own small apartment a empty closet she turn quick upon I but not in anger say o my dear miss wilmot how very sorry i be -- here she stop and though i know not the meaning of she word i feel it as a reproof i hang down my head abashed yet perceive that she be all that day more kind and obliging than ever and be conscious of not have merit this kindness i think she be mean-spirited and therefore i console myself with have discover this fault in she for i think my arrogance be full as excusable as she meanness in a few day i know my error i learn why marium have be so kind and why she have say she be sorry it be for I proud disdainful girl that i be that she be sorry she know though i do not that my father be on the brink of ruin and it come to pass as she have fear it would that in a few day my play-room be as empty as marium 's closet and all my grandeur be at a end my father have what be call a execution in the house every thing be seize that we possess we splendid furniture and even we wear apparel all my beautiful ball-dress my trinket and my toy be take away by my father 's merciless creditor the week in which this happen be such a scene of hurry confusion and misery that i will not attempt to describe it at the end of a week i find that my father and mother have go out very early in the morning mr hartley take I home to he own house and i expect to find they there but oh what anguish do i feel when i hear he tell mr hartley they have quit england and that he have bring I home to live with they in tear and sullen silence i pass the first day of my entrance into this despise house marium be from home all the day i sate in a corner of the room grieve for the departure of my parent and if for a moment i forget that sorrow i tormented myself with imagine the many way which marium might invent to make I feel in return the slight and air of superiority which i have give myself over she she mother begin the prelude to what i expect for i hear she freely censure the imprudence of my parent she speak in whisper yet though i could not hear every word i make out the tenor of she discourse she be very anxious lest she husband should be involve in the ruin of we house he be the chief clerk in my father 's counting-house towards evening he come in and quiet she fear by the welcome news that he have obtain a more lucrative situation than the one he have lose at eight in the evening mr hartley say to I miss wilmot it be time for you to be in bed my dear and order the servant to shew I up stair add that she suppose she must assist I to undress but that when marium come home she must teach I to wait on myself the apartment in which i be to sleep be at the top of the house the wall be white-washed and the roof be slope there be only one window in the room a small casement through which the bright moon shone and it seem to I the most melancholy sight i have ever behold in broken and disturbed slumber i pass the night when i awake in the morning she whom i most dreaded to see marium who i suppose have envy my former state and who i now feel certain would exult over my present mortifying reverse of fortune stand by my bedside she awaken I from a dream in which i think she be order I to fetch she something and on my refusal she say i must obey she for i be now she servant far differently from what my dream have picture do marium address I she say in the gentlest tone imaginable my dear miss wilmot my mother beg you will come down to breakfast will you give I leave to dress you my proud heart would not suffer I to speak and i begin to attempt to put on my clothes but never have be use to do any thing for myself i be unable to perform it and be oblige to accept of the assistance of marium she dress I washed my face and comb my hair and as she do these service for I she say in the most respectful manner be this the way you like to wear this miss wilmot or be this the way you like this do and curtsy as she give I every fresh article to put on the slight i expect to receive from marium would not have distressed I more than the delicacy of she behavior do i hang down my head with shame and anguish in a few day mr hartley order she daughter to instruct I in such useful work and employment as marium know of every thing which she call useful i be most ignorant my accomplishment i find be hold in small estimation here by all indeed except marium she teach I nothing without the kindest apology for be oblige to teach I who she say be so excellent in all elegant art and be for ever thank I for the pleasure she have formerly receive from my skill in music and pretty fancy work the distress i be in make these complimentary speech not flattery but sweet drop of comfort to my degraded heart almost break with misfortune and remorse i remain at mr hartley 's but two month for at the end of that time my father inherit a considerable property by the death of a distant relation which have enable he to settle he affair he establish himself again as a merchant but as he wish to retrench he expence and begin the world again on a plan of strict economy he send I to this school to finish my education ix susan yate -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- i be bear and bring up in a house in which my parent have all they life reside which stand in the midst of that lonely tract of land call the lincolnshire fen few family besides we own live near the spot both because it be reckon a unwholesome air and because its distance from any town or market make it a inconvenient situation my father be in no very affluent circumstance and it be a sad necessity which he be put to of have to go many mile to fetch any thing he want from the nearest village which be full seven mile distant through a sad miry way that at all time make it heavy walking and after rain be almost impassable but he have no horse or carriage of he own the church which belong to the parish in which we house be situate stand in this village and its distance be as i say before seven mile from we house make it quite a impossible thing for my mother or I to think of go to it sometimes indeed on a fine dry Sunday my father would rise early and take a walk to the village just to see how _ goodness thrive _ as he use to say but he would generally return tired and the worse for he walk it be scarcely possible to explain to any one who have not live in the fen what difficult and dangerous walk it be a mile be as good as four i have hear my father say in those part my mother who in the early part of she life have live in a more civilised spot and have be use to constant churchgo would often lament she situation it be from she i early imbibe a great curiosity and anxiety to see that thing which i have hear she call a church and so often lament that she could never go to i have see house of various structure and have see in picture the shape of ship and boat and palace and temple but never rightly any thing that could be call a church or that could satisfy I about its form sometimes i think it must be like we house and sometimes i fancy it must be more like the house of we neighbor mr sutton which be bigger and handsomer than ours sometimes i think it be a great hollow cave such as i have hear my father say the first inhabitant of the earth dwelt in then i think it be like a waggon or a cart and that it must be something moveable the shape of it run in my mind strangely and one day i venture to ask my mother what be that foolish thing that she be always longing to go to and which she call a church be it any thing to eat or drink or be it only like a great huge play-thing to be see and stare at -- i be not quite five year of age when i make this inquiry this question so oddly put make my mother smile but in a little time she put on a more grave look and inform I that a church be nothing that i have suppose it but it be a great building far greater than any house which i have see where man and woman and child come together twice a day on sunday to hear the bible read and make good resolution for the week to come she tell I that the fine music which we sometimes hear in the air come from the bell of st mary 's church and that we never hear it but when the wind be in a particular point this raise my wonder more than all the rest for i have somehow conceive that the noise which i hear be occasion by bird up in the air or that it be make by the angel whom -lrb- so ignorant i be till that time -rrb- i have always consider to be a sort of bird : for before this time i be totally ignorant of any thing like religion it be a principle of my father that young head should not be tell too many thing at once for fear they should get confused idea and no clear notion of any thing we have always indeed so far observe sunday that no work be do upon that day and upon that day i wear my best muslin frock and be not allow to sing or to be noisy but i never understand why that day should differ from any other we have no public meeting : -- indeed the few straggle house which be near we would have furnish but a slender congregation and the loneliness of the place we live in instead of make we more sociable and draw we closer together as my mother use to say it ought to have do seem to have the effect of make we more distant and averse to society than other people one or two good neighbor indeed we have but not in number to give I a idea of church attendance but now my mother think it high time to give I some clearer instruction in the main point of religion and my father come readily into she plan i be now permit to sit up half a hour later on a Sunday evening that i might hear a portion of scripture read which have always be they custom though by reason of my tender age and my father 's opinion on the impropriety of child be teach too young i have never till now be a auditor i be teach my prayer and those thing which you lady i doubt not have the benefit of be instruct in at a much earlier age the clearer my notion on these point become they only make I more passionately long for the privilege of join in that social service from which it seem that we alone of all the inhabitant of the land be debar and when the wind be in that point which favor the sound of the distant bell of st mary 's to be hear over the great moor which skirt we house i have stand out in the air to catch the sound which i almost devour and the tear have come in my eye when sometimes they seem to speak to I almost in articulate sound to _ come to church _ and because of the great moor which be between I and they i could not come and the too tender apprehension of these thing have fill I with a religious melancholy with thought like these i enter into my seventh year and now the time be come when the great moor be no longer to separate I from the object of my wish and of my curiosity my father have some money leave he by the will of a deceased relation we venture to set up a sort of a carriage -- no very superb one i assure you lady but in that part of the world it be look upon with some envy by we poorer neighbor the first party of pleasure which my father propose to take in it be to the village where i have so often wish to go and my mother and i be to accompany he for it be very fit my father observe that little susan should go to church and learn how to behave herself for we might some time or other have occasion to live in london and not always be confine to that out of the way spot it be on a Sunday morning that we set out my little heart beat with almost breathless expectation the day be fine and the road as good as they ever be in those part i be so happy and so proud i be lose in dream of what i be go to see at length the tall steeple of st mary 's church come in view it be point out to I by my father as the place from which that music have come which i have hear over the moor and have fancy to be angel sing i be wind up to the highest pitch of delight at have visibly present to I the spot from which have proceed that unknown friendly music and when it begin to peal just as we approach the village it seem to speak _ susan be come _ as plainly as it use to invite I _ to come _ when i hear it over the moor i pass over we alight at the house of a relation and all that pass till i go with my father and mother to church st mary 's church be a great church for such a small village as it stand in my father say it be a cathedral and that it have once belong to a monastery but the monk be all go over the door there be stone work represent saint and bishop and here and there along the side of the church there be figure of man 's head make in a strange grotesque way : i have since see the same sort of figure in the round tower of the temple church in london my father say they be very improper ornament for such a place and so i now think they but it seem the people who build these great church in old time give themselves more liberty than they do now and i remember that when i first see they and before my father have make this observation though they be so ugly and out of shape and some of they seem to be grin and distort they feature with pain or with laughter yet be place upon a church to which i have come with such serious thought i could not help think they have some serious meaning and i look at they with wonder but without any temptation to laugh i somehow fancy they be the representation of wicked people set up as a warning when we get into the church the service be not begin and my father kindly take I round to shew I the monument and every thing else remarkable i remember see one of a venerable figure which my father say have be a judge the figure be kneel as if it be alive before a sort of desk with a book i suppose the bible lie on it i somehow fancy the figure have a sort of life in it it seem so natural or that the dead judge that it be do for say he prayer at it still this be a silly notion but i be very young and have pass my little life in a remote place where i have never see any thing nor know any thing and the awe which i feel at first be in a church take from I all power but that of wonder i do not reason about any thing i be too young now i understand why monument be put up for the dead and why the figure which be upon they be describe as do the action which they do in they life-time and that they be a sort of picture set up for we instruction but all be new and surprising to I on that day the long window with little pane the pillar the pew make of oak the little hassock for the people to kneel on the form of the pulpit with the sounding-board over it gracefully carve in flower work to you who have live all you life in populous place and have be take to church from the earliest time you can remember my admiration of these thing must appear strangely ignorant but i be a lonely young creature that have be bring up in remote place where there be neither church nor churchgoing inhabitant i have since live in great town and see the way of church and of worship and i be old enough now to distinguish between what be essential in religion and what be merely formal or ornamental when my father have do point out to I the thing most worthy of notice about the church the service be almost ready to begin the parishioner have most of they enter and take they seat and we be shewn into a pew where my mother be already seat soon after the clergyman enter and the organ begin to play what be call the voluntary i have never see so many people assemble before at first i think that all eye be upon I and that because i be a stranger i be terribly ashamed and confuse at first but my mother help I to find out the place in the prayer-book and be busy about that take off some of my painful apprehension i be no stranger to the order of the service have often read in a prayer-book at home but my thought be confuse it puzzle I a little to find out the response and other thing which i think i know so well but i go through it tolerably well one thing which have often troubled I since be that i be afraid i be too full of myself and of think how happy i be and what a privilege it be for one that be so young to join in the service with so many grown people so that i do not attend enough to the instruction which i might have receive i remember i foolishly apply every thing that be say to myself so as it could mean nobody but myself i be so full of my own thought all that assembly of people seem to I as if they be come together only to shew I the way of a church not but i receive some very affect impression from some thing which i hear that day but the stand up and the sit down of the people the organ the singing -- the way of all these thing take up more of my attention than be proper or i think it do i believe i behave better and be more serious when i go a second time and a third time for now we go as a regular thing every Sunday and continue to do so till by a still further change for the better in my father 's circumstance we remove to london oh it be a happy day for I my first go to st mary 's church : before that day i use to feel like a little outcast in the wilderness like one that do not belong to the world of christian people i have never feel like a little outcast since but i never can hear the sweet noise of bell that i do not think of the angel singing and what poor but pretty thought i have of angel in my uninstructed solitude x arabellum hardy -lrb- _ by charle lamb _ -rrb- i be bear in the east indy i lose my father and mother young at the age of five my relation think it proper that i should be send to england for my education i be to be entrust to the care of a young woman who have a character for great humanity and discretion but just as i have take leave of my friend and we be about to take we passage the young woman be take suddenly ill and could not go on board in this unpleasant emergency no one know how to act the ship be at the very point of sailing and it be the last ship which be to sail that season at last the captain who be know to my friend prevail upon my relation who have come with we to see we embark to leave the young woman on shore and to let I embark separately there be no possibility of get any other female attendant for I in the short time allot for we preparation and the opportunity of go by that ship be think too valuable to be lose no other lady happen to be go so i be consign to the care of the captain and he crew -- rough and unaccustomed attendant for a young creature delicately bring up as i have be but indeed they do they best to make I not feel the difference the unpolished sailor be my nursery-maid and my waiting-women every thing be do by the captain and the man to accommodate I and make I easy i have a little room make out of the cabin which be to be consider as my room and nobody might enter into it the first mate have a great character for bravery and all sailor-like accomplishment but with all this he have a gentleness of manners and a pale feminine cast of face from ill health and a weakly constitution which subject he to some little ridicule from the officer and cause he to be name betsy he do not much like the appellation but he submit to it the better as he know that those who give he a woman 's name well know that he have a man 's heart and that in the face of danger he would go as far as any man to this young man whose real name be charles atkinson by a lucky thought of the captain the care of I be especially entrust betsy be proud of he charge and to do he justice acquit himself with great diligence and adroitness through the whole of the voyage from the beginning i have somehow look upon betsy as a woman hear he so speak of and this reconcile I in some measure to the want of a maid which i have be use to but i be a manageable girl at all time and give nobody much trouble i have not knowledge enough to give a account of my voyage or to remember the name of the sea we pass through or the land which we touch upon in we course the chief thing i can remember for i do not remember the event of the voyage in any order be atkinson take I up on deck to see the great whale play about in the sea there be one great whale come bound up out of the sea and then he would dive into it again and then would come up at a distance where nobody expect he and another whale be follow after he atkinson say they be at play and that that lesser whale love that bigger whale and keep it company all through the wide sea : but i think it strange play and a frightful kind of love for i every minute expect they would come up to we ship and toss it but atkinson say a whale be a gentle creature and it be a sort of sea-elephant and that the most powerful creature in nature be always the least hurtful and he tell I how man go out to take these whale and stick long pointed dart into they and how the sea be discolor with the blood of these poor whale for many mile distance : and i admire at the courage of the man but i be sorry for the inoffensive whale many other pretty sight he use to shew I when he be not on watch or do some duty for the ship no one be more attentive to he duty than he but at such time as he have leisure he would shew I all pretty sea sight : -- the dolphin and porpoise that come before a storm and all the color which the sea change to how sometimes it be a deep blue and then a deep green and sometimes it would seem all on fire : all these various appearance he would shew I and attempt to explain the reason of they to I as well as my young capacity would admit of there be a lion and a tiger on board go to england as a present to the king and it be a great diversion to atkinson and I after i have get rid of my first terror to see the way of these beast in they den and how venturous the sailor be in put they hand through the grate and pat they rough coat some of the man have monkey which run loose about and the sport be for the man to lose they and find they again the monkey would run up the shroud and pass from rope to rope with ten time greater alacrity than the most experienced sailor could follow they and sometimes they would hide themselves in the most unthought-of place and when they be find they would grin and make mouth as if they have sense atkinson describe to I the way of these little animal in they native wood for he have see they oh how many way he think of to amuse I in that long voyage sometimes he would describe to I the odd shape and variety of fish that be in the sea and tell I tale of the sea-monster that lay hide at the bottom and be seldom see by man and what a glorious sight it would be if we eye could be sharpen to behold all the inhabitant of the sea at once swim in the great deep as plain as we see the gold and silver fish in a bowl of glass with such notion he enlarged my infant capacity to take in many thing when in foul weather i have be terrify at the motion of the vessel as it rock backwards and forwards he would still my fear and tell I that i use to be rock so once in a cradle and that the sea be god 's bed and the ship we cradle and we be as safe in that greater motion as when we feel that lesser one in we little wooden sleeping-place when the wind be up and sing through the sail and disturb I with its violent clamor he would call it music and bid I hark to the sea-organ and with that name he quiet my tender apprehension when i have look around with a mournful face at see all _ man _ about I he would enter into my thought and tell I pretty story of he mother and he sister and a female cousin that he love better than he sister whom he call jenny and say that when we get to england i should go and see they and how fond jenny would be of he little daughter as he call I and with these image of woman and female which he raise in my fancy he quiet I for a time one time and never but once he tell I that jenny have promise to be he wife if ever he come to england but that he have he doubt whether he should live to get home for he be very sickly this make I cry bitterly that i dwell so long upon the attention of this atkinson be only because he death which happen just before we get to england affected I so much that he alone of all the ship 's crew have engross my mind ever since though indeed the captain and all be singularly kind to I and strive to make up for my uneasy and unnatural situation the boatswain would pipe for my diversion and the sailor-boy would climb the dangerous mast for my sport the rough foremastman would never willingly appear before I till he have comb he long black hair smooth and sleek not to terrify I the officer get up a sort of play for my amusement and atkinson or as they call he betsy act the heroine of the piece all way that could be contrived be think upon to reconcile I to my lot i be the universal favorite -- i do not know how deservedly but i suppose it be because i be alone and there be no female in the ship besides I have i come over with female relation or attendant i should have excite no particular curiosity i should have require no uncommon attention i be one little woman among a crew of man and i believe the homage which i have read that man universally pay to woman be in this case direct to I in the absence of all other woman-kind i do not know how that might be but i be a little princess among they and i be not six year old i remember the first draw-back which happen to my comfort be atkinson 's not appear during the whole of one day the captain try to reconcile I to it by say that mr atkinson be confine to he cabin -- that he be not quite well but a day or two would restore he i begged to be take in to see he but this be not grant a day and then another come and another and no atkinson be visible and i see apparent solicitude in the face of all the officer who nevertheless strive to put on they best countenance before I and to be more than usually kind to I at length by the desire of atkinson himself as i have since learn i be permit to go into he cabin and see he he be sit up apparently in a state of great exhaustion but he face light up when he see I and he kiss I and tell I that he be go a great voyage far longer than that which we have pass together and he should never come back and though i be so young i understand well enough that he mean this of he death and i cry sadly but he comfort I and tell I that i must be he little executrix and perform he last will and bear he last word to he mother and he sister and to he cousin jenny whom i should see in a short time and he give I he blessing as a father would bless he child and he send a last kiss by I to all he female relation and he make I promise that i would go and see they when i get to england and soon after this he die but i be in another part of the ship when he die and i be not tell it till we get to shore which be a few day after but they keep tell I that he be better and better and that i should soon see he but that it disturb he to talk with any one oh what a grief it be when i learn that i have lose my old ship-mate that have make a irksome situation so bearable by he kind assiduity and to think that he be go and i could never repay he for he kindness when i have be a year and a half in england the captain who have make another voyage to indium and back think that time have alleviate a little the sorrow of atkinson 's relation prevail upon my friend who have the care of I in england to let he introduce I to atkinson 's mother and sister jenny be no more she have die in the interval and i never see she grief for he death have bring on a consumption of which she linger about a twelvemonth and then expire but in the mother and the sister of this excellent young man i have find the most valuable friend which i possess on this side the great ocean they receive I from the captain as the little _ protégée _ of atkinson and from they i have learn passage of he former life and this in particular that the illness of which he die be bring on by a wound of which he never quite recover which he get in the desperate attempt when he be quite a boy to defend he captain against a superior force of the enemy which have board he and which by he premature valor inspirit the man they finally succeed in repulse this be that atkinson who from he pale and feminine appearance be call betsy this be he whose womanly care of I get he the name of a woman who with more than female attention condescend to play the hand-maid to a little unaccompanied orphan that fortune have cast upon the care of a rough sea captain and he rougher crew the king and queen of heart -lrb- illustration -rrb- show how notably the queen make she tart and how scurvily the knave

crown the future life of dorus and of claribel he wife note charle lamb and book for child charle lamb 's activity as a writer for child seem to have begin and end in the service of godwin the earliest effort in this direction of which we have any knowledge be _ the king and queen of heart _ 1805 and the latest _ prince dorus _ 1810 or 1811 unless we count _ beauty and the beast _ possibly 1811 which in my opinion he do not write lamb first meet william godwin -lrb- 1756-1836 -rrb- the philosopher probably through the instrumentality of they mutual friend thoma holcroft not long after gillray have satirise lamb and lloyd in he plate in the first number of _ the anti-jacobin review and magazine _ August 1798 as a frog and a toad seat in the vicinity of coleridge and southey and reading together a volume label blank verse by toad and frog pray mr lamb say godwin when he first make lamb 's acquaintance be you toad or frog it be fear that trouble might ensue but lamb and godwin be find the next morning at breakfast together and they become good though never very intimate friend godwin who have be for a while a minister at ware in hertfordshire come to london in 1779 and take up literature as a profession seriously in 1783 he _ political justice _ be publish in 1793 _ caleb william _ in 1794 and _ st leon _ in 1799 after love at a distance mr opie and mr inchbald godwin marry mary wollstonecraft in 1797 they daughter afterwards become mr shelley the wife of the poet mary wollstonecraft godwin die in the year of she marriage and in 1801 godwin marry again a mr clairmont a widow lamb detest she none the less it be she who take to publishing and who incite he and he sister to write the charming child 's book in this volume lamb help godwin with other literary venture before the publishing business be start in 1800 he write a epilogue to he tragedy of antonio -lrb- see the essay in vol ii the old actor for a description of the luckless first night -rrb- and he advise he in the composition of faulkener another tragedy which fail in 1807 and which also have a prologue by lamb and a letter be extant show lamb toiling at a review of godwin 's _ chaucer _ in 1803 but the review itself be not forthcoming the publishing business be start in 1805 on mr godwin 's initiative at first owe to the undesirability of connect the name of a political and moral firebrand like godwin with book for child it be arrange that the business which be in hanway street oxford street should bear the name of the manager thoma hodgkin while the book contribute by godwin be to be sign edward baldwin in 1806 however mr godwin open a shop at 41 skinner street snow hill -lrb- now demolish -rrb- and publish in she own name as mj godwin & co at the child 's library for she

greece england and rome and hazlitt write a english grammar the principal illustrator to the firm be william mulready although lamb have the most cordial dislike for mr godwin he always stand by he old friend she husband between 1811 and 1821 the two man seem to have have little to do with each other but in 1822 lamb come to godwin 's assistance to much purpose the title to godwin 's house in skinner street be successfully contest in that year and godwin become a bankrupt a fund be therefore set on foot for he by lamb and other lamb 's own contribution be # 50 godwin however never rightly rally and thenceforward live very quietly write the _ history of the commonwealth _ and _ life of the necromancer _ and die in 1836 mr godwin survive he until 1841 know what we do -- from dowden 's _ shelley _ and other source -- it be not possible greatly to admire godwin 's character nor be the second mr godwin a subject for enthusiasm but the part play by they in the lamb ' literary life be extremely valuable charle lamb have it be true other stimulus and without he work for child sweet though it be he name would still be a household word but mary lamb might but for the godwin have go almost silent to the grave she writings with they sweet gravity and tender simplicity be call forth wholly by the bad baby as lamb call mr godwin lamb 's view on the literature of the nursery have crystallise long before he begin to write child 's book himself in a letter to coleridge October 231802 he have say : -- ` goody two shoe ' be almost out of print mr barbauld 's stuff have banish all the old classic of the nursery and the shopman at newberry 's hardly deign to reach they off a old explode corner of a shelf when mary ask for they mr b 's and mr trimmer 's nonsense lay in pile about knowledge insignificant and vapid as mr barbauld 's book convey it seem must come to a child in the _ shape of knowledge _ and he empty noddle must be turn with conceit of he own power when he have learn that a horse be a animal and billy be better than a horse and such like instead of that beautiful interest in wild tale which make the child a man while all the while he suspect himself to be no bigger than a child science have succeed to poetry no less in the little walk of child than with man be there no possibility of avert this sore evil think what you would have be now if instead of be feed with tale and old wife ' fable in childhood you have be cram with geography and natural history hence when the time come lamb be all ready with a nursery method of he own \* \* \* \* \* page 1 tale from shakespear mary lamb be ask to write the _ tale from shakespear _ with help from she brother in the spring of 1806 or the winter of 1805 i have see the statement that this be at the instigation of hazlitt but lamb do not say so the first mention of the work be in lamb 's letter to manning may 10 1806 : -- she -lrb- mary -rrb- say you see she writings about the other day and she wish you should know what they be she be do for godwin 's bookseller twenty of shakspeare 's play to be make into child 's tale six be already do by she to wit ` the tempest ' ` winter 's tale ' ` midsummer night ' ` much ado ' ` two gentleman of verona ' and ` cymbeline ' and the ` merchant of venice ' be in forwardness i have do ` othello ' and ` macbeth ' and mean to do all the tragedy i think it will be popular among the little people besides money it be to bring in sixty guinea mary have do they capitally i think you would think these be the humble amusement we propose while you be go to plant the cross of christ among barbarous pagan anthropophagus quam homo homini præstat but then perhaps you 'll get murder and we shall die in we bed with a fair literary reputation mary lamb 's letter to sarah stoddart -lrb- afterwards sarah hazlitt -rrb- continue the story this be on June 2 1806 : -- my _ tale _ be to be publish in separate story-book i mean in single story like the child 's little shilling book i can not send you they in manuscript because they be all in the godwin ' hand but one will be publish very soon and then you shall have it _ all in print _ i go on very well and have no doubt but i shall always be able to hit upon some such kind of job to keep go on i think i shall get fifty pound a year at the lowest calculation but as i have not yet see any _ money _ of my own earning for we do not expect to be pay till christmas i do not feel the good fortune that have so unexpectedly befall I half so much as i ought to do but another year no doubt i shall perceive it when i write again you will hear tiding of the farce for charle be to go in a few day to the manager to inquire about it but that must now be a next-year 's business too even if it do succeed so it be all look forward and no prospect of present gain but that be better than no hope at all either for present or future time charle have write macbeth othello king lear and have begin hamlet you would like to see we as we often sit write on one table -lrb- but not on one cushion sit -rrb- like hermium and helena in the midsummer night 's dream or rather like a old literary darby and joan : i take snuff and he groan all the while and say he can make nothing of it which he always say till he have finish and then he find out he have make something of it martin -lrb- burney -rrb- have just be here my tale -lrb- _ again _ -rrb- and charle 's farce have make the boy mad to turn author and he have write a farce and he have make the winter 's tale into a story but what charle say of himself be really true of martin for _ he can make nothing at all of it _ and i have be talk very eloquently this morning to convince he that nobody can write farce & c under thirty year of age and so i suppose he will go home and new model he farce a little later June 26 lamb write to wordsworth : -- mary be just stick fast in all be well that end well she complain of have to set forth so many female character in boy 's clothes she begin to think shakspear must have want imagination i to encourage she for she often faint in the prosecution of she great work flatter she with tell how well such and such a play be do but she be stick fast and i have be oblige to promise to assist she then we have mary lamb to sarah stoddart again -lrb- early in July 1806 -rrb- : i be in good spirit just at this present time for charle have be read over the _ tale _ i tell you plague I so much and he think it one of the very best : it be ` all 's well that end well ' the work be finish in the autumn of 1806 and publish at the end of the year date 1807 lamb send wordsworth a copy on January 29 1807 with the follow letter : -- we have book would off from swan and two neck lad lane this day -lrb- per coach -rrb- the tale from shakespear you will forgive the plate when i tell you they be leave to the direction of godwin who leave the choice of subject to the bad baby who from mischief -lrb- i suppose -rrb- have choose one from damn would beastly vulgarity -lrb- vide ` merch venice ' -rrb- where no atom of authority be in the tale to justify it -- to another have give a name which exist not in the tale nic bottom and which she think would be funny though in this i suspect _ he _ hand for i guess she reading do not reach far enough to know bottom 's christian name -- and one of hamlet and grave digging a scene which be not hint at in the story and you might as well have put king canute the great reprove he courtier -- the rest be giant and giantess suffice it to save we taste and damn we folly that we leave it all to a friend wg who in the first place cheat I into put a name to they which i do not mean but do not repent and then write a puff about they _ simplicity _ & c to go with the advertisement as in my name enough of this egregious dupery i will try to abstract the load of teaze circumstance from the story and tell you that i be answerable for lear macbeth timon romeo hamlet othello for occasionally a tail piece or correction of grammar for none of the cut and all of the spell the rest be my sister 's -- we think pericle of hers the best and othello of mine -- but i hope all have some good as you like it we like least so much only beg you to tear out the cut and give they to johnny as ` mr godwin 's fancy ' cl _ we love to all _ i have almost forget my part of the preface begin in the middle of a sentence in last but one page after a colon thus : -- : -- _ which if they be happily so do _ & c -lrb- see page 2 line 7 from foot -rrb- the former part have a more feminine turn and do hold I up something as a instructor to young lady : but upon my modesty 's honor i write it not godwin tell my sister that the baby choose the subject : a fact in taste this letter not only tell we how the preface be write -- the first part i take it by william godwin -- but what lamb himself think of the picture which i reproduce in the large edition it be customary to attribute the design to mulready and the engrave to william blake i have set up the _ tale _ from the second edition 1809 because it embody certain correction and be probably the last edition in which the lamb take any interest the change of word be few i note the more important page 5 line 1 recollection be remembrance in the first edition page 10 line 27 voracious be ugly in the first edition page 15 line 21 vessel be churn page 42 line 30 continue be in the first edition remain page 108 foot but she be a woman have run in the first edition but she be a bad ambitious woman i leave other minute difference to the bibliographer the second edition be issue in two form : one similar to the first edition and one with only frontispiece a portrait of shakespear and the follow foreword from the pen i imagine of mr godwin : -- advertisement to the second edition the proprietor of this work willingly pay obedience to the voice of the public it have be the general sentiment that the style in which these tale be write be not so precisely adapt for the amusement of mere child as for a acceptable and improve present to young lady advance to the state of womanhood they therefore now offer to the public a edition prepare with suitable elegance in the former impression they give twenty print illustrative of the twenty tale which compose these volume for they know that it be a grievous thing and a disappointment to a child to find some tale without the recommendation of a print which the other possess the print be therefore make from spirited design but do not pretend to high finish in the execution to this edition they have annex merely a beautiful head of we immortal dramatist from a much admire painting by zoust -- they be satisfied that every reader of taste will thank they for not suppress the former preface though not exactly applicable on the present occasion nb -- a few copy have be work off on the plan of the former impression for the use of those who rather coincide in the original conception of the writer than in the opinion above state lamb we may be sure have no hand in this manifesto but whatever protest he may have make be unsuccessful it reappear in the third edition while the preface there have the general alteration of the first person singular to the first person plural : we young reader for my young reader and so forth but this be probably godwinian work the godwin also issue some or all of the _ tale _ separately at sixpence each -lrb- the two ordinary volume cost eight shilling -rrb- with three plate to each of a different design from those in the two-volume edition these little book be exceedingly rare but copy have be discover both plain and color the plate be attribute to blake the lamb ' _ tale from shakespear _ be not mr bertram dobell have point out the first experiment of the kind in 1783 be publish in paris _ conte moraux amusan et instructifs à l'usage de la jeunesse tirés des tragédies de shakespear _ par m perrin the lamb do not however borrow anything from m perrin even if they be aware of he work the _ tale _ be peculiarly they own the _ tale from shakespear _ be and probably will continue to be the most widely distribute of all the lamb ' work in england it may be that _ elia _ have have as many reader but abroad the _ tale from shakespear _ easily lead in the british museum catalogue i find translation in french german swedish spanish and polish -lrb- no complete translation of _ elium _ into any language be know not even in french although a selection of the essay will be find at the end of depret 's monograph _ de l'humeur littéraire en angleterre _ 1877 -rrb- in england almost every christmas bring a new edition of the _ tale _ and often a imitation although mary lamb be the true author of the book as of _ mr leicester 's school _ and of _ poetry for child _ she share be much greater than she brother 's in all of these she be not until many year later associate publicly with any of they the _ tale _ be attribute to charle lamb presumably against he wish as we see from a sentence in the letter to wordsworth quote above and the other two book have no name attach to they at all why mary lamb preserve such strict anonymity we do not now know but it be probably from a natural shrinking from any kind of publicity after the unhappy publicity which she have once gain by she misfortune \* \* \* \* \* page 240 the adventure of ulyss lamb must have be as busy in the year 1806-1808 as in any of he life for he then not only have he indium house work but write he share of the _ tale from shakespear _ _ mr leicester 's school _ and _ poetry for child _ write all of _ the adventure of ulyss _ and finally prepare he _ dramatic specimen _ moreover in 1806 he have the harassment of the alteration and impending production of mr h on February 26 1808 he tell man that he have just finish _ the adventure of ulyss _ and the _ specimen _ describe _ the adventure of ulyss _ as intend to be a introduction to the reading of telemachus it be do out of the odyssey not from the greek i would not mislead you : nor yet from pope 's odyssey but from a older translation of one chapman the ` shakspeare tale ' suggest the do it many year after lamb write to barton -lrb- August 10 1827 -rrb- : do you ever read my ` adventure of ulyss ' found on chapman 's old translation of it for child or _ man _ ch be divine and my abridgment have not quite empty he of he divinity chapman 's _ homer _ be the folio which leigh hunt tell we he once see lamb kiss write to coleridge on October 23 1802 lamb say : -- i have just finish chapman 's homer do you ever read it -- it have most the continuous power of interesting you all along like a rapid original of any and in the uncommon excellence of the more finished part go beyond fairfax or any of 'em the metre be fourteen syllable and capable of all sweetness and grandeur cowper 's ponderous blank verse detain you every step with some heavy miltonism chapman gallop off with you he own free pace i will tell you more about chapman and he peculiarity in my next i be much interested in he a brief correspondence which pass between godwin and lamb just before the publication of _ the adventure of ulyss _ may be give here william godwin to charle lamb skinner street _ march _ 10 1808 dear lamb -- i address you with all humility because i know you to be _ tenax propositus _ hear I i entreat you with patience it be strange with what different feeling a author and a bookseller look at the same manuscript i know this by experience : i be a author i be a bookseller the author think what will conduce to he honor : the bookseller what will cause he commodity to sell you or some other wise man i have hear to say it be child that read child 's book when they be read but it be parent that choose they the critical thought of the tradesman put itself therefore into the place of the parent and what the parent will condemn we live in squeamish day amid the beauty of you manuscript of which no man can think more highly than i do what will the squeamish say to such expression as these -- ` devour they limb yet warm and tremble lap the blood ' page 10 or to the giant 's vomit page 14 or to the minute and shocking description of the extinguish the giant 's eye in the page follow you i daresay have no form plan of exclude the female sex from among you reader and i as a bookseller must consider that if you have you exclude one half of the human species nothing be more easy than to modify these thing if you please and nothing i think be more indispensable give I as soon as possible you thought on the matter i should also like a preface half we customer know not homer or know he only as you or i know the lose author of antiquity what can be more proper than to mention one or two of those obvious recommendation of he work which must lead every human creature to desire a nearer acquaintance -- believe I ever faithfully yours w godwin charle lamb to william godwin _ march _ 11 1808 dear godwin -- the giant 's vomit be perfectly nauseous and i be glad you point it out i have remove the objection to the other passage i can find no other objection but what you may bring to numberless passage besides such as of scyllum snatch up the six man etc -- that be to say they be lively image of _ shocking _ thing if you want a book which be not occasionally to _ shock _ you should not have think of a tale which be so full of anthropophagus and wonder i can not alter these thing without enervate the book and i will not alter they if the penalty should be that you and all the london bookseller should refuse it but speak as author to author i must say that i think _ the terrible _ in those two passage seem to I so much to preponderate over the nauseous as to make they rather fine than disgust who be to read they i do not know : who be it that read tale of terror and mystery of udolpho such thing sell i only say that i will not consent to alter such passage which i know to be some of the best in the book as a author i say to you a author touch not my work as to a bookseller i say take the work such as it be or refuse it you be as free to refuse it as when we first talk of it as to a friend i say do not plague yourself and I with nonsensical objection i assure you i will not alter one more word as the reader will see lamb make only the one alteration nor do he add a preface recommend the work of homer i have set up _ the adventure of ulyss _ from the second edition 1819 because it probably contain lamb 's final revision of the text the punctuation differ considerably from that of the first edition but there be i think only four change of word on page 251 line 34 and be insert before snout on page 257 line g do be substitute for do on page 266 line 7 from foot over be substitute for above and on page 276 line 5 from foot it be insert after keep the suggestion have be make that since lamb state in the preface that this work be design as a supplement to _ the adventure of telemachus _ he be also the author of one of the version of fénélon 's popular tale but this i think have no foundation in fact we know from lamb 's letter to godwin that the impulse to write _ the adventure of ulyss _ come from godwin and it be natural that he a bookseller should wish to associate this new venture with a volume so well know and so acceptable as the _ telemachus _ now and then in the story lamb deliberately refer to fénélon 's work as when in the fourth chapter he say : -- it be useless to describe over again what have be so well tell already or to relate those soft art of courtship which the goddess use to detain ulyss the same in kind which she afterwards practice upon he less wary son whom minerva in the shape of mentor hardly preserve from she snare when they come to the delightful island together in search of the scarce depart ulyss this be draw not from chapman or homer but from the archbishop of cambraus lamb introduce it in accordance with the first sentence of he preface lamb adapt chapman very freely for the material in chapter i we must go

xiii and xiv and for chapter ix to the end to chapman book xvi and onward it must be agree that lamb perform a difficult task with great skill and success especially when we consider he want of interest frequently admit in story but the pleasure of add dignity and sweetness to the character of ulyss seem to have be very considerable as he work -lrb- or so i imagine -rrb- and he make practically a new thing a very persuasive blend of ancient and modern the book have not be so popular as the _ tale from shakespear _ but it have i think finer literary merit and may perhaps be read by older intellect with more satisfaction \* \* \* \* \* page 316 mr leicester 's school this charming little book be publish by mr godwin at the end of 1808 dated 1809 with no author 's name attach besides however ample internal evidence as to its authorship there be many reference to it in lamb 's letter why it be issue anonymously we can not now learn probably as i have suggest from mary lamb 's unwillingness to have she name in print the _ tale from shakespear _ it will be remember be describe always as be by charle lamb although mary do far more than half and it be at the outset she book she share of _ mr leicester 's school _ be equally great and a sentence in one of she letter to sarah stoddart suggest that it be hers in inception also : i have be busy make waistcoat and plot new work to succeed the _ tale _ possibly it be because he share in the book be so small that lamb refuse to sign _ mr leicester 's school _ as he have the _ tale from shakespear _ possibly he have other reason the title-page of he _ dramatic specimen _ be one of they when a little while afterwards the _ poetry for child _ be publish it be state to be by the author of _ mr leicester 's school _ while several of the poem when reprint by mylius -lrb- see note below -rrb- be sign mr leicester thus mary lamb 's last chance of see she name on a title-page vanish but we may feel confident that she own wish be consult in the matter lamb 's share in _ mr leicester 's school _ we know from a letter to bernard barton -lrb- January 23 1824 -rrb- : my sister 's part in the leicester school -lrb- about two third -rrb- be purely she own as it be -lrb- to the same quantity -rrb- in the shakspeare tale which bear my name i write only the witch aunt the first go to church and the final story about a little indian girl in a ship the little book be well receive and be quietly popular for some year run into eight edition by 1823 i imagine however that it be little known between 1830 and the end of the century latterly there have be a revival in interest one or two critic have touch rapturous height in they praise landor write to crabb robinson in April 1831 : -- it be now several day since i read the book you recommend to I mr leicester 's school and i feel as if i owe you a debt in defer to thank you for many hour of exquisite delight never have i read anything in prose so many time over within so short a space of time as the father 's wedding-day most people i understand prefer the first tale -- in truth a very admirable one -- but other could have write it show I the man or woman modern or ancient who could have write this one sentence : when i be dress in my new frock i wish poor mamma be alive to see how fine i be on papa 's wedding day and i run to my favorite station at she bedroom door how natural in a little girl be this incongruity -- this impossibility richardson would have give he clarissa and rousseau he heloïse to have imagine it a fresh source of the pathetic burst out before we and not a bitter one if you german can show we anything comparable to what i have transcribe i would almost undergo a year 's gargle of they language for it the story be admirable throughout -- incomparable inimitable landor write to lady blessington to the same effect praise of this book be so pleasant to read that i quote he second letter too : -- one of she tale be with the sole exception of the _ bride of lammermoor _ the most beautiful tale in prose composition in any language ancient or modern a young girl have lose she mother the father marry again and marry a friend of he former wife the child be ill reconcile to it but be dress in new clothes for the marriage she run up to she mother 's chamber fill with the idea how happy that dear mother would be at see she in all she glory -- not reflect poor soul that it be only by she mother 's death that she appear in it how natural how novel be all this do you ever imagine that a fresh source of the pathetic would burst forth before we in this trodden and hardened world i never do and when i find myself upon it i press my temple with both hand and tear run down to my elbow and coleridge remark to allsop : -- it at once soothe and amuse I to think -- nay to know -- that the time will come when this little volume of my dear and well-nigh oldest friend mary lamb will be not only enjoy but acknowledge as a rich jewel in the treasury of we permanent english literature and i can not help run over in my mind the long list of celebrated writer astonishing genius novel romance poem history and dense political economy quarto which compare with _ mr leicester 's school _ will be remember as often and prize as highly as wilkie 's and glover 's _ epic _ and lord bolingbroke 's _ philosophy _ compare with _ robinson crusoe _ i have set up the book from the second edition 1809 because the lamb ' final text be probably to be find there although certain additional minor difference be make in the eighth and ninth edition 1821 and 1825 i think it very unlikely that they be make by mary or charle lamb the principal alteration between the second and first edition be page 317 line 6 you eye be red with weep for the trace of tear might still be see on you cheek the other difference be very slight mostly be in punctuation but there be also a few change of word i leave these however to the bibliographer the eighth edition be furnish with the follow preface which though it be sign the author be not i think from either mary or charle lamb 's pen i rather suspect mr godwin tell I a story mamma be almost the first request my own child make I when she understand the meaning of a story and i soon discover i have no easier method of manage a very difficult temper than by adapt my story to the error she commit or the good quality she announce but as i find it a very difficult and troublesome task to repeat the same story precisely the same each time and as a sensible child even at so early a period as three year of age will remember where the narrator forget and never fail to detect the mistake of the second repetition i come to the resolution to print a small collection of story for very young child compose merely of circumstance incidental to they age the great error of many juvenile book be they deviation from truth and as so much be absolutely necessary to be teach why add to the labor by impress false idea on the mind of a infant and thus lose the opportunity of make amusement the vehicle to convey instruction a mother only be perhaps capable of adapt story to the capacity of very young child for a mother only watch the unfold of they idea and the bent of they disposition if one good mother find these tale of service to she in she arduous but please task my purpose will be answer it be state that a french version of _ mr leicester 's school _ under the title _ les jeunes pensionnaires _ be publish i have see however only _ petit conies à l'usage de la feunesse traduits de l'anglais par m ` I m d'avot _ 1823 which contain elisabeth villier ou l'oncle marin charlotte wilmot marguerite green ou la jeune mahométane and arabellum hardy ou la traversée _ mrs leicester 's school _ call for little annotation except for the purpose of relate the story to the life of they writer for it contain some very valuable autobiographical matter but there be a few minor point too page 316 _ dedication _ in the choice of amwell school as the name of mr leicester 's establishment mary -lrb- or charle -rrb- return after a inveterate lamb habit to the old hertfordshire day amwell where the new river rise be only a few mile from widford and blakesware the signature to the dedication mb may have be a little joke for the amusement of martin burney who have take such interest in the progress of the _ tale from shakespear _ and be in those day a special favorite with mary lamb page 319 i -- _ elizabeth villier _ the sailor uncle by mary lamb the story of the little girl learn she letter from she mother 's grave may have belong to widford churchyard otherwise there seem to be no personal memory here page 328 ii -- _ louisa manners _ the farm house by mary lamb much of the description of the farm and country be probably from memory of the old day at mackery end where we know mary lamb to have go with she little brother charle some time about 1780 and perhaps herself earlier it be however possible that blakesware be mean since mary lamb speak of the grandmother : mr bruton of mackery end be she great aunt one feel that the grandmother 's sorrow at not be remember -lrb- on page 329 -rrb- be from life and also the episode with will tasker -lrb- on the same page -rrb- and the description -lrb- and probably the name -rrb- of old spot the shepherd on page 333 page 334 iii -- _ ann withers _ the changeling by mary lamb in one of the later edition of this story certain small change be make not i fancy by mary lamb for example on page 349 line 19 the sentence be make to read : neither dancing nor any foolish lecture could do much for miss lesley she remain _ for some time _ want in gracefulness of carriage but all that be usually attribute to dance music _ finally effect _ the italics indicate the addition of the nice editorial hand page 350 iv -- _ elinor forester _ the father 's wedding day by mary lamb it be this story which landor so much admire -lrb- see above -rrb- the pretty song balow my babe be probably ann bothwell 's lament begin balow my boy page 354 v -- _ margaret green _ the young mahometan by mary lamb and perhaps she most perfect work here we have a description of blakesware the home of the plumer which for many year be uninhabited by the family and leave from 1778 to 1792 in the sole charge of mr field charle and mary 's maternal grandmother charle since he be bear in 1775 would on he visit have know no power superior to he grandmother but mary who be bear in 1764 would have occasionally encounter mr plumer just as margaret green meet mr beresford probably mr plumer and mr beresford be very like probably also mr field maintain silence with she grandchild for we know that neither she nor she daughter rightly understand mary lamb mr field use to speak of she poor moythered brain mary 's description of the old house should be compare with charle 's in the _ elium _ essay blakesmoor in h -- shire and dream-child in one point they be at variance for mary say that the twelve cæsars hang round the hall and she brother that they be life-size bust i have the authority of a gentleman who remember they at gilston whither they be remove for say that charle lamb 's memory be the more accurate the picture of the little girl with a lamb seem to have make a equal impression on both they mind and both mention the shuttlecock on the table page 360 vi -- _ emily barton _ visit to the cousin by mary lamb possibly autobiographical in the matter of the first play charle lamb 's first play be the opera artaxerx mary 's may quite well have be congreve 's mourning bride the book-shop at the corner of st paul 's churchyard would be harri 's -lrb- late newbery 's -rrb- that in skinner street -lrb- no 41 -rrb- be of course godwin 's where _ mr leicester 's school _ be publish and sell this pleasant art of advertising one 's wares in one 's own child 's book be bring to perfection by newbery and by harri he successor whose tiny history be full of reminder of the merit of the corner of st paul 's churchyard by make mr barton hesitate between the two shop and then go to mr godwin 's lamb -lrb- for here it be probably he and not he sister -rrb- carry the joke a step farther than newbery the follow account of the figure on old st dunstan 's church -lrb- the child of to-day be take to cheapside to see bennett 's clock -rrb- be give in hughson 's _ london _ -lrb- 1805 -rrb- : -- on the outside of the church within a niche and pediment at the south-west end over the clock be two figure of savage or wild man carve in wood and paint natural color as big as the life standing erect with each a knotty club in he hand with which they alternately strike the quarter not only they arm but even they head move at every blow moxon tell we that when the old church be pull down and the figure be remove lamb shed tear the figure i be tell still exist in the garden of the villa in regent 's park -- st

schoolmistress mr reynold page 368 vii -- _ marium howe _ the witch aunt by charle lamb this story be peculiarly interesting to student of lamb 's life for it describe probably with absolute fidelity he aunt hetty and elaborate the passage concern stackhouse 's _ new history of the bible _ which be to be find in the _ elia _ essay witch and other night fear aunt hetty be describe elsewhere by lamb in he _ elium _ essay christ 's hospital and my relation and in the poem write on the day of my aunt 's funeral in mary lamb 's letter to sarah stoddart on September 21 1803 be a short passage corroborative of lamb 's account of the relation subsist between he aunt and he parent : -- my father have a sister live with we -- of course live with my mother she sister-in-law they be in they different way the best creature in the world -- but they set out wrong at first they make each other miserable for full twenty year of they life -- my mother be a perfect gentlewoman my aunty as unlike a gentlewoman as you can possibly imagine a good old woman to be so that my dear mother -lrb- who though you do not know it be always in my poor head and heart -rrb- use to distress and weary she with incessant and unceasing attention and politeness to gain she affection the old woman could not return this in kind and do not know what to make of it -- think it all deceit and use to hate my mother with a bitter hatred which of course be soon return with interest lamb tell coleridge in a letter upon he aunt 's death she be to I the ` cherisher of infancy ' in the _ elia _ essay on witch no mention be make of glanvil but there be a passage in the unpublished version of _ john woodvil _ which mention both it and stackhouse : -- i can remember when a child the maid would place I on they lap as they undrest I as silly woman use and tell I story of witch -- make I read glanvil on witchcraft and in conclusion show I in the bible the old family-bible with the picture in it the ` graving of the witch raise up samuel which so possest my fancy be a child that nightly in my dream a old hag come and sit upon my pillow that be write some eight or nine year earlier than marium howe the essay on witch some fifteen year later joseph glanvill -lrb- 1636-1680 -rrb- issue he _ philosophical consideration touch witch and witchcraft _ in 1666 page 375 viii -- _ charlotte wilmot _ the merchant 's daughter by mary lamb page 378 ix -- _ susan yate _ first go to church by charle lamb john lamb the father come from lincolnshire but charle do not know that county at all the remark to see how goodness thrive may well have be john lamb 's or possibly he father 's and lamb 's own first impression of church probably acquire at the temple -lrb- which he mention here by comparison -rrb- be it be easy to believe identical with the imaginary narrator 's church bell seem always to have have a attraction for he : he have a pretty reference to they in _ john woodvil _ and a little poem in _ blank verse _ 1798 entitle the sabbath bell page 384 x -- _ arabellum hardy _ the sea voyage by charle lamb nothing else that lamb write be quite so far from the ordinary run of he thought and nothing have i think more charm \* \* \* \* \* page 389 the king and queen of heart this be probably the first of charle lamb 's book for child of its history nothing be know : the proof that charle lamb write it be to be find in a letter from lamb to wordsworth now in america date February 1 1806 the conclude portion of which and the only portion that have be print -- begin _ apropos _ of spenser -- will be find in most edition of the correspondence tack on to the letter date June 1806 in the earlier part of this missive lamb enumerate the book which he have just despatch to wordsworth by carrier from london among these be a edition of spenser lead to the _ apropo _ also : there come w hazlitt 's book about human action for coleridge a little song book for sarah coleridge a box for hartley a paraphrase on _ the king and queen of heart _ of which i be the author beg mr johnny wordsworth 's acceptance and opinion _ liberal criticism _ as g dyer declare i be always ready to attend to as charle lamb be not know to have write child 's book for any one but the godwin who in 1806 be still publish under cover of thoma hodgkin ' name in hanway street it be reasonable to assume that if a paraphrase of _ the king and queen of heart _ nursery rhyme could be find bear hodgkin ' or godwin 's name and dated 1805 or 1806 lamb would be its author that such a work do exist be prove by the advertisement at the end of other of godwin 's juvenile book in the first edition of _ mr leicester 's school _ 1809 be this announcement : -- likewise the follow elegant and approve publication contain each of they the incident of a agreeable tale exhibit in a series of engraving price 1 plain or 1s 6d color 1 _ the king and queen of heart : show how notably the queen make she tart and how scurvily the knave steal they away _ & c this series be call the copperplate series in due course a copy of no 1 _ the king and queen of heart _ be find in the library of miss edith pollock buy by she at the sale of the late mr andrew w tuer a authority upon old child 's literature and the publisher to whose enterprise we owe the facsimile edition of _ prince dorus _ and _ poetry for child _ mr tuer however have not suspect lamb 's authorship the cover of miss pollock 's copy bear the date 1809 which mean that the little book be re-bound as require with the date of the current year upon it copy of the first edition have since be discover and sell for enormous sum the date be 1806 in a copy of _ the look glass _ another of godwin 's book _ the king and queen of heart _ be thus advertise with a new quatrain probably also from lamb 's pen : -- price 1 plain or 15 6ed color the king and queen of heart with the roguery of the knave who steal away the queen 's pie illustrate in fifteen elegant engraving : agreeably to the famous historical ballad on the subject i write of tart how sweet a tale you 'll lick you lip to hear it tell : i show you mighty king and queen robe of scarlet crown of gold this little book _ the look glass _ which relate the early life of william mulready -lrb- 1786-1863 -rrb- be issue in facsimile by mr fg stephen in 1885 with a interesting account of its history therein mr stephen write : mr linnell tell I that the cut to the once well-known _ nongtong paw _ -lrb- vol 6 of the copperplate series see above -rrb- _ the sullen woman and the pedlar _ -lrb- vol 2 of the same series -rrb- _ think before you speak _ and _ the king and queen of heart _ be design by mulready we thus discover who be the illustrator my own feeling be that the plate come first and lamb 's verse later _ the king and queen of heart _ can not be say to add anything characteristic to the body of lamb 's writings but its discovery be historically valuable in establish -- by the date 1805 on the engraved title-page -- the fact that before the _ tale from shakespear _ which be usually think to be the brother and sister 's first experiment in write for child charle at any rate have try he hand at that pastime _ the king and queen of heart _ thus become he first juvenile work \* \* \* \* \* page 404 poetry for child this little book attribute on the title-page merely to the author of _ mr leicester 's school _ be publish in two minute volume at three shilling by mr godwin in 1809 robert lloyd write from london to he wife in April 1809 say of charle and mary lamb : if we may use the expression they union of affection be what we conceive of marriage in heaven they be the world _ one _ to the _ other _ they be write a book of poetry for child together later : it be _ task _ work to they they be write for money and a book of poetry for child be likely to sell have induce they to compose one write to coleridge of the _ poetry for child _ in June 1809 lamb say : we little poem be but humble but they have no name you must read they remember they be task-work and perhaps you will admire the number of subject all of child pick out by a old bachelor and a old maid many parent would not have find so many charle lamb by the way be then thirty-four and mary lamb forty-four in send the book to man lamb say that he own share of the poem be only one-third the little book seem to have be quickly allow by its publisher to pass into the void possibly the two-volume form be find to be impracticable : at any rate _ poetry for child _ disappear many of its piece at various time reappear with the signature mr leicester in _ the junior class-book _ -lrb- two piece -rrb- in _ the first book of poetry _ -lrb- twenty-two piece -rrb- and _ the poetical class

lose until in 1877 a copy be find in australium two or three other copy of the english edition have since come to light mylius use also the frontispiece to the two volume as i have not see all the edition of these compilation it be possible that my figure may not be complete a american edition of _ poetry for child _ be publish in 1812 at boston the poem clock striking why not do it sir to-day and home delight be omit i have place against the poem in the note that follow the authorship -- brother or sister 's -- which seem to I the more probable but i hope it will be understand that i do

-- at the farm of newlaw in the parish of rerrick in kirkcudbrightshire scotland some people name crosbie live about the year 1782 -- at least they have a son dougla who be bear there in that year when the child grow old enough to trot about by himself he mother be in the habit of give he he plate of porridge and milk to take outside the farm and eat every morning he have probably do so for long enough when one day he mother happen to go out see he seat on the ground eat he porridge in company with a adder who however instead of hurt the child merely sup up the milk when the reptile edge a little nearer to the boy than be quite equal dougla slap the adder on he head with he horn spoon say keep yer ain side o ' the plate gray bairdie the mother be of course terrify but wait until the

ferdinand in whose mouth the apologue transfer or convey by lamb into the quaint and delightful little book over the recovery of which all the heart of he lover be yet warm with rejoicing have a tragic and terrible significance it may be worth remark that the _ poetry for child _ appear the year after that -- most fortunate of year for all student of the higher english drama -- which be make nobly memorable by the appearance of the matchless and priceless volume of ' _ specimen of english dramatic poet who live about the time of shakespear _ ' in which the fratricide 's apologue be
