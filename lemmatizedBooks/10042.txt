special branch of apply education the editor and he colleague have have in view the need of young teacher and of those train to be teacher but since the school and the schoolmaster be not the sole factor in the educative process it be hope that educator in general -lrb- and which of we be not in some sense or other a educator -rrb- as well as the professional schoolmaster may find in the series some help in understand precept and practice in education of to-day and to-morrow for we have bear in mind not only what be but what ought to be to exhibit the educator 's work as a vocation require

responsibility for the opinion express in each volume rest solely with its author albert a cook university of london king 's college author ' preface we have make this book between we but we have not collaborate we know that we agree in all essential though we experience have differ we both desire to see the best condition for development provide for all child irrespective of class we both look forward to the time when the condition of the public elementary school from the nursery school up will be such -- in point of number in freedom from pressure in situation of building in space both within and without and in beauty of surroundings -- that parent of any class will gladly let they child attend it we be teacher and we have deal mainly with the mental or as we prefer to call it the spiritual requirement of child it be from the medical profession that we must all accept fact about food value hour of sleep etc and the importance of cleanliness and fresh air be now fully recognize we do however feel that there be room for fresh discussion of ultimate aim and of daily procedure mr clutton brock have say that the great weakness of english education be the want of a definite aim to put before we child the want of a philosophy for ourselves without some understanding of life and its purpose or mean the teacher be at the mercy of every fad and be apt to exalt method above principle this book be a attempt to gather together certain recognize principle and to show in the light of actual experience how these may be apply to exist circumstance the day be come when all teacher will seek to understand the true value of play of spontaneous activity in all direction its importance be emphasise in nearly all the educational writings of the day as well in the senior as in the junior department of the school but we need a full and deep understanding of the say man be man only when he play it be easy to say we believe it but it need strong faith courage and wide

book on english school for little child now that nursery school have be specially select for notice and encouragement by a enlighten minister for education it be madame michaelis who in 1890 originally and most appropriately use the term nursery school as the english equivalent of a title suggest by froebel -lrb- 1 -rrb- for he new institution before he invent the word kindergarten a title which literally translate run institution for the care of little child -lrb- footnote 1 : froebel 's _ letter _ trans michaeli and moore p 30 -rrb- in england the word nursery which imply the idea of nurture belong properly to child though it have be borrow by the gardener for he young plant in germany it be the other way round froebel have to invent the term _ child garden _ to express he idea of the nurture as oppose to the repression of the essential nature of the child unfortunately the word kindergarten while be naturalise in england have two distinct meaning attach to it well-to-do people begin to send they child to a new institution a child garden or play school the child of the people however already attend infant school of which the chief feature be what mr caldwell cook call sit-stillery and here the word kindergarten really equivalent to nursery school become identify with certain occupation childlike in origin it be true but formalise out of all recognition how a real kindergarten strike a child be illustrate by the recent remark from a little new boy who have be with we for perhaps three morning shall i go up to the nursery now he ask the first attempt at a kindergarten be make in 1837 and by 1848 germany possess sixteen in that eventful year come the revolution in berlin which create such high hope doom alas to disappointment instead of the rosy dawn of freedom write eber -lrb- 2 -rrb- himself a old keilhau boy in the state the exercise of a boundless arbitrary power in the church dark intolerance it must have be a easy matter to bring charge of revolutionary doctrine against the man who say so innocently but i -- i only want to train up free-thinking independent man -lrb- footnote 2 : author of _ a egyptian princess _ etc -rrb- it be from stony berlin as froebel call it that the edict go forth in the name of the minister of education entirely prohibit kindergarten in prussium and the prohibition soon spread at the present time it seem to we quite fitting that the bitter attack upon kindergarten should have be launch by folsung a schoolmaster who begin life as a artilleryman nor be it less interesting to read that it be under the protection of von moltke himself that oberlin school be open to counteract the attraction of the godless kindergarten little wonder that the same man who in 1813 have so gladly take up arm to resist the invasion of napoleon and who have rejoice with such enthusiasm in the prospect of a free and united fatherland should write in 1851 : wherefore i have make a firm resolve that if the condition of german life will not allow room for the development of honest effort for the good of humanity if this indifference to all higher thing continue -- then it be my purpose next spring to seek in the land of union and independence a soil where my idea of education may strike deep root and to america he might have go have he live but he die three month later he end hasten by grief at the edict which close the kindergarten the prussian minister announce in this edict that it be evident that kindergarten form a part of the froebelian socialistic system the aim of which be to teach the child atheism and the suggestion that he be anti-christian cut the old man to the heart there have be some confusion between froebel and one of he nephew who have democratic leaning and no doubt anything at all democratic do mean atheism to stony berlin and its intolerant autocracy for a time at least in bavarium a curious compromise be allow if the teacher be a member of the orthodox church she might have she kindergarten but if she belong to one of the free church it be permissible to open a infant school but she must not use the term kindergarten froebel be by no means of the opinion that if only the teacher have the right spirit the name do not matter rather do he hold with confucius whose answer to the question of a disciple how shall i convert the world be call thing by they right name he refuse to use the word school because little child especially those under six do not need to be school and teach what they need be opportunity for development he have great difficulty in select a name those originally suggest be somewhat cumbrous eg _ institution for the promotion of spontaneous activity in child _ another be _ self-teaching institution _ and there be also the one which madame michaelis translate _ nursery school for little child _ but the name kindergarten express just what he want : as in a garden under god 's favor and by the care of a skilled intelligent gardener grow plant be cultivate in accordance with nature 's law so here in we child garden shall the noblest of all grow thing man -lrb- that be child -rrb- be cultivate in accordance with the law of they own being of god and of nature to one of he student he write : you remember well enough how hard we work and how we have to fight that we might elevate the darmstadt crèche or rather infant school by improve method and organization until it become a true kindergarten now what be the outcome of all this even during my own stay at darmstadt why the fetter which always cripple a crèche or a infant school and which seem to cling round its very name -- these fetter be allow to remain unbroken every one be please with so faithful a mistress as yourself yet they withhold from you the main condition of unimpeded development that of the freedom necessary to every young healthy and vigorous plant be there really such importance underlie the mere name of a system -- some one might ask yes there be it be true that any one watch you teaching would observe _ a new spirit _ infuse into it _ express and fulfil the child 's own want and desire _ you would strike he as personally capable but you would fail to strike he as priestess of the idea which god have now call to life within man 's bosom and of the struggle towards the realisation of that idea -- _ education by development -- the destine means of raise the whole human race _ no man can acquire fresh knowledge even at a school beyond the measure which he own stage of development fit he to receive infant school be nothing but a contradiction of child-nature little child especially those under school age ought not to be school and teach what they need be opportunity for development this idea lie in the very name of a kindergarten and the name be absolutely necessary to describe the first education of child for a actual definition of what froebel mean by he nursery school for little child or kindergarten it be only fair to go to the founder himself he have leave we two definition or description one announce shortly before the first kindergarten be open which run : a institution for the foster of human life through the cultivation of the human instinct of activity of investigation and of construction in the child as a member of the family of the nation and of humanity a institution for the self-instruction self-education and self-cultivation of mankind as well as for all-sided development of the individual through play through creative self-activity and spontaneous self-instruction a second definition be give in froebel 's reply to a proposal that he should establish my system of education -- education by development -- in london paris or the united state : we also need establishment for training quite young child in they first stage of educational development where they training and instruction shall be base upon they own free action or spontaneity act under proper rule these rule not be arbitrarily decree but such as must arise by logical necessity from the child 's mental and bodily nature regard he as a member of the great human family such rule as be in fact discover by the actual observation of child when associate together in company these establishment bear the name of kindergarten unfortunately there be but few picture of froebel 's own kindergarten but there seem to have be little formality in its earliest development a oft-told story be that of madame von marenholz in 1847 go to watch the proceedings of a old fool as the villager call he who play game with the village child a less well-known account be give by col von arnswald again a keilhau boy who visit blankenberg in 1839 when froebel have just open he first kindergarten arrive at the place i find my middendorf -lrb- 3 -rrb- seat by the pump in the market-place surround by a crowd of little child go near they i see that he be engage in mend the jacket of a boy by he side sit a little girl busy with thread and needle upon another piece of clothing one boy have he foot in a bucket of water wash they carefully other girl and boy be stand round attentively look upon the strange picture of real life before they and wait for something to turn up to interest they personally we meeting be of the most cordial kind but middendorf do not interrupt the business in which he be engage ` come child ' he cry ` let we go into the garden ' and with loud cry of joy the little folk with willing foot follow the splendid-looking tall man run all round he -lrb- footnote 3 : one of froebel 's most devoted helper -rrb- the garden be not a garden however but a barn with a small room and a entrance hall in the entrance middendorf welcome the child and play a round game with they end with the flight of the little one into the room where each of they sit down in he place on the bench and take he box of building block for half a hour they be all busy with they block and then come ` come child let we play spring and spring ' and when the game be finish they go away full of joy and life every one give he little hand for a grateful good-bye here in this earliest of free kindergarten be certain essential wash and mend the alternation of constructive play with active exercise rhythmic game and song and last but not least human kindliness and courtesy the shelter be but a barn but there be thing more important than premise froebel die too soon to see he ideal realize but he have sow the seed in the heart of at least one woman with brain to grasp and will to execute as early as 1873 the froebelian have establish something more than the equivalent of the montessori child 's house under the name of free kindergarten or people 's kindergarten it will bring this out more clearly if without refer here to any modern experiment in america in england and scotland or in the dominion we quote the description of a actual people 's kindergarten or nursery school as it be establish nearly fifty year ago the move spirit of this institution be henrietta schroder froebel 's own grand-niece train by he and of whom he say that she more than any other have most truly understand he view the whole institution be call the pestalozzi-froebel house the prussian edict which abolish the kindergarten almost before it have start be now rescind and we own princess royal -lrb- 4 -rrb- give warm support to this new institution the description here quote be actually write in 1887 when the institution have be in existence for fourteen year : -lrb- footnote 4 : the crown princess of prussium afterwards the empress frederick -rrb- the purpose of the national kindergarten be to provide the necessary and natural help which poor mother require who have to leave they child to themselves the establishment contain : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the kindergarten proper a national kindergarten with four class for child from 2-1\/2 to 6 year old -lrb- 2 -rrb- the transition class only hold in the morning for child about 6 or 6-1\/2 year old -lrb- 3 -rrb- the preparatory school for child from 6 to 7 or 7-1\/2 year old -lrb- 4 -rrb- the school of handwork for child from 6 to 10 or older dinner be provide for those child whose parent work all day away from home at a trifling charge of a halfpenny and a penny also for a trifle poor child may receive assistance of various kind in illness or may have milk or bath through the kindness of the kindred ` association for the promotion of health in the household ' in the institution we be describe there be a complete and well-furnished kitchen a bathroom a courtyard with sand for digging with pebble and pine-cone moss shell and straw etc a garden and a series of room and hall suitably furnished and arrange for game occupation handwork and instruction the occupation pursue in the kindergarten be the following : free play of a child by itself free play of several child by themselves associate play under the guidance of a teacher gymnastic exercise several sort of handwork suit to little child go for walk learn music both instrumental -lrb- on the method of madame wiseneder -lrb- 5 -rrb- -rrb- and vocal learning and repetition of poetry story-telling look at really good picture aid in domestic occupation gardening and the usual systematic order occupation of froebel madame schrader be steadfastly oppose to that conception of the kindergarten which insist upon mathematically shaped material for the froebelian occupation she own word be : ` the child find in we institution every encouragement to develop they capability and power by use not by they selfish use to they own personal advantage but by they use in the loving service of other the longing to help people and to accomplish little piece of work proportion to they feeble power be constant in child and lie alongside of they need for that free and unrestrained play which be the business of they life -lrb- footnote 5 : from certain old photograph i suppose this to have be what we now call a kindergarten band -rrb- the elder child be expect to employ themselves in clean take care of arrange keep in order and use the many various thing belong to the housekeeping department of the kindergarten for example they set out and clear away the material require for the game and handicraft they help in clean the room furniture and utensil they keep all thing in order and cleanliness they paste together tear wallpaper or picture they cover book and they help in the cooking and in preparation for it in lay the table in wash up the plate and dish etc the child gain in this manner the simple but most important foundation of they later duty as housekeeper and householder and at the same time learn to regard these duty as thing do in the service of other it be worth while to notice the order in which the necessity of this place be describe first come a kitchen and next a bathroom then a out-of-doors playground with abundant material for gain idea through action -- sand pebble pine-cone moss shell and straw then come the garden and only after all these the room and hall for indoors game handwork and instruction it be worth while also to note the prominence give to play music poetry and story-telling picture domestic occupation and garden all precede the systematic and order occupation which to some have seem so all-important if we compare this with the current idea about nursery school we do not find that it fall much below the present ideal there have be a time when some of we fear that only the bodily need of the little child be to be consider but the regulation for nursery school have banish such fear in these the child be regard as a human be with spiritual as well as bodily requirement to put it shortly the physical requirement of a child be food fresh air and exercise cleanliness and rest it be not so easy to sum up the requirement of a human soul the first be sympathy and though this may spring from parental instinct it should be nourish by true understanding next perhaps come the need for material material for investigation for admiration for imitation and for construction or creation power of sense-discrimination be important enough but in this case if we take care of the pound of admiration and investigation the penny of sense-discrimination will take care of themselves besides these the child have the essentially human need for social intercourse for speech for game for song and story for picture and poetry he must have opportunity both to imitate and to share in the work and life around he he must be a individual among other individual a necessary part of a whole allow to give as well as to receive service in the national kindergarten of 1873 no one of these requirement be overlook except the provision for sleep and from old photograph we know that this too be consider nursery school be need for child of all class it be not only the child of the poor who require sympathy and guidance from those specially qualify by real grasp of the fact of child-development well-to-do mother too often leave they child to ignorant and untrained servant or to the equally untrained and hardly less ignorant nursery governess mother in small house have much to do make bed and wash dish sweeping and dust baking and cooking making and mend not to mention tend a infant or tend the sick leave little leisure for sympathy with the adventuring and investigate propensity natural and desirable in a healthy child between three and five there be innumerable kindergarten open only in the morning for the child of those who can afford to pay and these could well be multiply and assist just as far as be necessary in town at least mother with but small income would gladly pay a moderate fee to have they little one especially they sturdy little boy guard from danger and train to good habit yet allow freedom for happy activity kindergarten and nursery school ought to be as much as possible fresh-air school they should never be large or the home atmosphere must disappear they should always have grassy space and common flower and they ought to be within easy reach of the child 's home there must for the present be certain difference between the free kindergarten or nursery school for the poor and for those whose parent be fairly well-to-do in both case we must supply what the child need if the mother must go out to work the child require a home for the day and the nursery school must make arrangement for feed the child all little child be the better for rest and if possible for sleep during the day but for those who live in overcrowded room where quiet and restful sleep in good air be impossible the need for daily sleep be very great all free kindergarten arrange for this most important also be the training to cleanliness this be not invariably the lot even of those who come from apparently comfortable home to attend fee-paying kindergarten and among the poor difference in respect of cleanliness be very great but soap and hot water do cost money and wash take time and the modern habit of brushing tooth have not yet be acquire by all class of the community the free kindergarten provide for necessary wash each child be provide with its own tooth-brush and tooth-brush drill be a daily practice somewhat amusing to witness the best baby room in we infant school carry out the same practice and these be likely to be turn into nursery school it can not yet be accept as conclusively prove that a completely open-air life be the best in we climate we have not yet sufficient statistics no doubt child do improve enormously in open-air camp but so they do in ordinary nursery school where they be clean happy and well feed and where they live a regular life with daily sleep housing condition complicate the problem and all child must suffer who sleep in crowded noisy unventilated room up to the present time nursery school have be provide by voluntary effort entirely and far too little encouragement have be give to those enlighten headmistress of infant school who have try to give to they lowest class nursery school condition since the passing of mr fisher 's education bill however we be entitle to hope that soon for all child in the land there may be the opportunity of a fair start under the care of a person with breadth of outlook and imagination the equivalent of froebel 's skilled intelligent gardener in the follow chapter a attempt be make to explain how it be that so many year ago froebel reach he vision of what a child be and of what a child need and the consideration on which he base he nursery school for little child or self-teaching institution chapter ii the biologist educator progress man 's distinctive mark alone not god 's and not the beast ' : god be they be man partly be and wholly hope to be a large bright room a sandheap in one corner a low tub or bath of water in another a rope ladder a swing step to run up and down and such like a line of black or green board low down round the wall little rough cart and trolley box which can be turn into house or shop or pretence ship etc a cooking stove of a very simple nature doll of all kind wooden animal grow plant in box a aquarium any froebelian would recognize this as the description of a more or less ideal kindergarten or nursery school and yet the writer have probably never read a page that froebel write on the contrary she show she entire ignorance of the real kindergarten by call it pretty employment devise by adult and impose at set time by authority the description be take from a very able address on child nature and education deliver some year ago by miss hoskyn abrahall it be quote here because for she conception of right surroundings for young child the speaker have go to the very source from which froebel take he idea -- she have go to what froebel indeed call the only true source life itself and she write from the point of view of the biologist there exist at present in certain quarter a belief that the kindergarten be old-fashioned out of date more especially that it have no scientific basis it be partly on this account that the idea of dr marium montessorus who have approach the question of the education of young child from the point of view of medical science have be warmly welcome by so large a circle but neither in england nor in america do that circle include the froebelian and this for several reason for one thing much that the general public have accept as new -- and in this general public must be include weighty name man of science educational authority and other who have never trouble to inquire into the meaning of the kindergarten -- be already matter of everyday life to the froebelian among these come the idea of training to service for the community and the provision of suitable furniture little chair and table which the child can move about and low cupboard for material all of which tend to independence and self-control it be a more serious stumbling-block to the froebelian that dr montessorus while advocate freedom in word have really set strict limit to the natural activity of child by lay so much stress on she didactic apparatus the intention of which be formal training in sense-discrimination this material which be a adaptation and enlargement of that provide by séguin for he mentally deficient child be certainly open to the reproach of have be devise by adult it be formal and the child be not permit to use it for he own purpose before everything else however come the fact that in no place have dr montessorus show that she have make any study of play or that she attach special importance to the play activity or natural activity of childhood on which the kindergarten be found this be probably account for in that she first observation be make on deficient child who be notably want in initiative among these play activity we should include the child 's perpetual imitation or pretence a matter which dr montessorus entirely fail to understand as show in she more recent book where she treat of imagination here she maintain that only the child of the comparatively poor ride upon they father ' walking-stick or construct coach of chair that this be not a proof of imagination but of a unsatisfied desire and that rich child who own pony and who drive out in motor-car would be astonish to see the delight of child who imagine themselves to be draw along by stationary armchair imitative play have of course nothing to do with poverty or riches but be as froebel say long since the outcome of a initiative impulse sadly want in deficient child a impulse which prompt the child of all land of all time and of all class to imitate or dramatise and so to gain some understanding of everything and of every person he see around the work of dr montessorus have help enormously in the movement begin long since for greater freedom in we infant school freedom not from judicious guidance and authority but from rigid time-table and formal lesson and from arbitrary restriction as well as freedom for the individual as apart from the class the best kindergarten and infant school have already discard time-table and kindergarten class have always be small enough to give the individual a fair chance froebel himself constantly urge that the child should become familiar with both the strongly opposed element of he life the individual determining and direct side and the general order and subordinate side he urge the early development of the social consciousness as well as insist on expansion of individuality but it be always difficult to combine the two and most kindergarten teacher will benefit by learn from dr montessorus to apply the method of individual learn to a greater extent we be however fully prepare to maintain that froebel even in 1840 have a wider and a deeper realisation of the need of the child than have as yet be attain by the dottoressa -lrb- 6 -rrb- in order to make this clear it be propose to compare the theory of froebel with the conclusion of a biologist for biology have a wider and a saner outlook than medical science it do not start from the abnormal but with life under normal condition -lrb- footnote 6 : she latest publication regard the instruction -- for it be not education -- of older child make this even more plain for here be no discussion of what child at this stage require but a mere plunge into subject in which formal grammar take a foremost place -rrb- in the address from which the opening word of this chapter be quote it be suggest that a capable biologist be set to deal with education but he be to be free from all preconceived idea derive from accept tradition after such fundamental as food and warmth light air and sleep the first problem consider by this biologist educator be stage of growth they appropriate activity and the stimulus necessary to evoke they always he bear in mind that interference with a grow creature be a hazardous business and take as he motto when in doubt refrain to discover the natural activity of the child the biologist rely upon first observation of the child himself secondly upon he knowledge of the nervous system and thirdly upon he knowledge of the past history of the race from these he come to a very pertinent conclusion viz the general outcome of this be that the safe way of educate child be by means of play play be define as the natural manifestation of the child 's activity systematic in that it follow the line of physiological development but without the hard and fast routine of the time-table -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : it be in this connection that the kindergarten be stigmatise as pretty employment devise by adult and impose at set time by authority a opinion evidently gain from the way in which the term have be misuse in a type of infant school now fast disappear -rrb- it be easy to show that although froebel be pre-darwinian he have be in close touch with scientist who be work at theory of development and that he be largely influence by krause who apply the idea of organic development to all department of social science it be because froebel be himself even in 1826 the biologist educator desire to break with preconceived idea and tradition that he wish one of he pupil have be able to call you work by its proper name and so make evident the real nature of the new spirit you have introduce -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : see p 4 -rrb- but froebel be more than a biologist he be a philosopher and a idealist such word have sometimes be use as term of reproach but wisdom can only be justified of she child at the back of all froebel have to say about the education of the human be lie he conception of what the human being be and it be impossible fully to understand why froebel lay so much stress on spontaneous play unless we go deeper than the province of the biologist without in the least minimize the importance of biological knowledge to educational theory as the biologist define play as the natural manifestation of the child 's activity so froedel say play at first be just natural life but to he the true inwardness of spontaneous play lie in the fact that it be spontaneous -- so far as anything in the universe can be spontaneous for spontaneous response to environment be self-expression and out of self-expression come selfhood consciousness of self if we be to understand froebel at all we must begin with the answer he find or accept from krause and other for he first question what be that self before reach the question of how to educate it seem to he necessary to consider not only the purpose or aim of education but the purpose or aim of human existence the purpose of all and any existence even whether there be any purpose in anything and that bring we to what he call the groundwork of all of which a summary be give in the follow paragraph in the universe we can perceive plan purpose or law and behind this there must be some great mind a living all-pervading energise self-conscious and hence eternal unity whom we call god nature and all exist thing be a revelation of god as bergson speak of the _ élan vital _ which express itself from infinity to infinity so froebel say that behind everything there be force and that we can not conceive of force without matter on which it can exercise itself neither can we think of matter without any force to work upon it so that force and matter mutually condition one another we can not think one without the other this force express itself in all way the whole universe be the expression of the divine but man be the highest and most perfect earthly be in whom the primordial force be spiritualise so that man feel understand and know he own power conscious development of one 's own power be the triumph of spirit over matter therefore human development be spiritual development so while man be the most perfect earthly be yet with regard to spiritual development he have return to a first stage and must raise himself through ascend degree of consciousness to height as yet unknown for who have measure the limit of god-born mankind self-consciousness be the special characteristic of man no other animal have the power to become conscious of himself because man alone have the chance of failure the lower animal have definite instinct and can not fail _ ie _ can not learn -lrb- 9 -rrb- man want to do much but he instinct be less definite and most action have to be learn it be by strive and fail that he learn to know not only he limitation but the power that be within he -- he self -lrb- footnote 9 : this would nowadays be consider too sweep a assertion -rrb- accord to froebel the aim of education be the steady progressive development of mankind there be and can be no other and except as regard physiological knowledge inaccessible in he day he be at one with the biologist as to how we be to find out the course of this development first by look into we own past secondly by the observation of child as individual as well as when associate together and by comparison of the result of observation thirdly by comparison of these with race history and race development froebel make much of observation of child he write to a cousin beg she to record in write the most important fact about each separate child and add that it seem to he most necessary for the comprehension of child-nature that such observation should be make public of the greatest importance that we should interchange the observation we make so that little by little we may come to know the grounds and condition of what we observe that we may formulate they law he protest that even in he day the observation development and guidance of child in the first year of life up to the proper age of school be not up to the exist level of the stage of human knowledge or the advance of science and art and he state that it be a essential part of he undertake to call into life _ a institution for the preparation of teacher train for the care of child through observation of they life _ in speaking of the stage of development of the individual froebel say that there be no order of importance in the stage of human development except the order of succession in which the earlier be always the more important and from that point of view we ought to consider childhood as the most important stage a stage in the development of the godlike in the earthly and human he also emphasise that the vigorous and complete development and cultivation of each successive stage depend on the vigorous complete and characteristic development of each and all precede stage so the duty of the parent be to look as deeply as possible into the life of the child to see what he require for he present stage of development and then to scrutinise the environment to see what it offer to utilise all possibility of meeting normal need to remove what be hurtful or at least to admit its defect if they can not give the child what he nature require if parent offer what the child do not need he say they will destroy the child 's faith in they sympathetic understand the educator be to bring the child into relation and surroundings in all respects adapt to he but afford a minimum of opportunity of injury guard and protect but not interfere unless he be certain that healthy development have already be interrupt it be somewhat remarkable that froebel anticipate even the conclusion of modern psycho-analysis in he view about childish fault the source of these he say be neglect to develop certain side of human life and secondly early distortion of originally good human power by arbitrary interference with the orderly course of human development a suppress or pervert good quality -- a good tendency only repress misunderstand or misguided -- lie at the bottom of every shortcoming hence the only remedy even for wickedness be to find and foster build up and guide what have be repress it may be necessary to interfere and even to use severity but only when the educator be sure of unhealthy growth the motto of the biologist on the subject of interference -- when in doubt refrain -- exactly express froebel 's doctrine of passive or follow education follow that be the nature of the child and passive as oppose to arbitrary interference free from this the child will follow he natural impulse which be to be trust as much as those of any other young animal in other word he will play he will manifest he natural activity the young human being -- still as it be in process of creation -- would seek though unconsciously yet decidedly and surely as a product of nature that which be in itself best and in a form adapt to he condition he disposition he power and he means thus the duckling hasten to the pond and into the water while the chicken scratch the ground and the young swallow catch its food upon the wing we grant space and time to young plant and animal because we know that in accordance with the law that live in they they will develop properly and grow well arbitrary interference with they growth be avoid because it would hinder they development but the young human being be look upon as a piece of wax a lump of clay which man can mould into what he please o man who roamest through garden and field through meadow and grove why dost thou close thy mind to the silent teaching of nature behold the weed grow among hindrance and constraint how it scarcely yield a indication of inner law behold it in nature in field or garden how perfectly it conform to law -- a beautiful sun a radiant star it have burst from the earth thus o parent could you child on whom you force in tender year form and aim against they nature and who therefore walk with you in morbid and unnatural deformity -- thus could you child too unfold in beauty and develop in harmony at first play be activity for the sake of activity not for the sake of result of which the child have as yet no idea very soon however have man 's special capacity of learn through experience the child do gather idea by this time he have pass through the stage of infancy and now he play become to the philosopher the highest stage of human development at this stage because now it be self-expression when froebel write in 1826 there have be but little thought expend on the subject of play and probably none on human instinct which be suppose to be nonexistent the hope he express that some philosopher would take up these subject have now be fulfil and we ought now to turn to what have be say on a subject all-important to those who desire to help in the education of young child chapter iii learn bear of play play which be the business of they life there may be nothing new under the sun but it do seem to be a fair claim to make for froebel that no one before or since he time have more fully realize the value to humanity of what in childhood go by the name of play froebel have distinct theory about play and he put he theory into actual practice not only when he found the kindergarten but in he original school for older child at keilhau before go into its full meaning it may be well first to meet the most common misconception about play it be not surprising that those who have give the subject no special consideration should regard play from the ordinary adult standpoint and think of it as entirely oppose to work as relaxation of effort but the play of a child cover so much that it be startling to find a real psychologist write that education through play be a pernicious proposition -lrb- 10 -rrb- statement of this kind spring from the mistaken idea certainly not derive from observation that play involve no effort that it run in the line of least resistance and that education through play mean therefore education without effort without training in self-control education without moral training the case for the kindergarten be the opposite of this education through play be advocate just because of the effort it call forth just because of the way in which the child and later the boy or girl throw he whole energy into it what froebel admire what he call the most beautiful expression of childlife be the child that play thoroughly with spontaneous determination perseveringly until physical fatigue forbid -- a child wholly absorb in he play -- a child that have fall asleep while so absorb that child he say would be a thorough determine man capable of self-sacrifice for the promotion of the welfare of himself and other it be because play be not trivial but highly serious and of deep significance that he appeal to mother to cultivate and foster it and to father to protect and guard it -lrb- footnote 10 : _ the educative process _ p 255 -lrb- bagley -rrb- -rrb- the kindergarten position can be sum up in a sentence from dr clouston 's _ hygiene of mind _ : play be the real work of child froebel call activity of sense and limb the first germ and play-building and model the tender blossom of the constructive impulse and this he say be the moment when man be to be prepare for future industry diligence and productive activity he point out too the importance of notice the habit which come from spontaneous self-employment which may be habit of indolent ease if the child be not allow to be as active as he nature require there be no theory of play in froebel 's day but he have certainly read _ levana _ and in all probability he know what schiller have say in he _ letter on aesthetic education _ the play theory be now too well know to require more than a brief recapitulation it will generally be allow that the distinctive feature of play as oppose to work be that of spontaneity the action itself be of no consequence one man 's play be another man 's work nor do it seem to matter whence come the feeling of compulsion in work whether from pressure of outer necessity or from a inner necessity like the compelling force of duty where there be joy in creation or in discovery the work and play of the genius approach the standpoint of the child indulge every instinct of the soul there where law life joy impulse be one thing in the play of early childhood there may be freedom not only from adult authority but even from the restriction of nature or of circumstance since let 's pretend annihilate time and space and all material consideration among theory of play first come what be know as the schiller-spencer theory in which play be attribute to the accumulation of surplus energy when the human being have more energy than he require in order to supply the bodily need of himself and he family then he feel impel to use it as the activity of he daily life be the only one know to he he fight he battle over again he simulate the serious business of life and transfer for instance the incident of the chase into a dance in this way he reach artistic creation so that play be the first poetry of the human be as a opposite of this we get a re-creation theory where play if not too strenuous understand as a change of occupation rest and re-create another theory be that of recapitulation which have be emphasise by stanley hall accord to which child play hunting and chase game or find a fascination in make tent because they be pass through that stage of development in which they primitive ancestor live by hunting or dwelt in tent lastly a most interesting theory be that which be associate with the name of groo and which be best express in the sentence : animal do not play because they be young but they have they youth because they must play play be regard as the preparation for future life activity the kitten therefore practise chase a cork the puppy worry boot and glove the kid practise jump and so on a full account of play will probably embrace all these theory and though they be not formulate in he day froebel overlook none though he may have lay special stress on the preparation side yet another value of play emphasise by professor royce viz its enormous importance from the point of view of mental initiative be strongly urge by froebel professor royce argue that in the mere persistence of the playful child one have a factor whose value for mental initiative it be hard to overestimate without this passionately persistent repetition and without also the constant vary of apparently useless activity the organism say professor royce would remain the prey of the environment to froebel as we have see the human being be the climax of animal evolution and the starting-point of psychical development the lower animal he maintain as all will now agree be hinder by he definite instinct but the instinct or instinctive tendency of the human being be so undefined that there be room for spontaneity for new form of conduct professor royce say that a general view of the place which being with mind occupy in the physical world strongly suggest that they organism may especially have significance as place for the initiation of more or less novel type of activity and to froebel the chief significance of play lie in this spontaneity play be the highest phase of human development at this stage because it be spontaneous expression of what be within produce by a inner necessity and impulse play be the most characteristic most spiritual manifestation of man at this stage and at the same time be typical of human life as a whole these various theory seem to reinforce rather than to contradict each other and it be more important to avoid run any to a extreme than to differentiate between they in the case of recapitulation we must certainly bear in mind froebel 's warning that the child should be treat as have in himself the present past and future so as dr drummond say : if we feel constrain to present he with a tent because abraham live in one he no doubt enter into the spirit of the thing and accept it joyfully but he also annex the ball of string and the coffee canister to fit up telephonic communication with the nursery he may play robber and hide and seek because he have reach a hunting and capture stage but the physiologist point out that violent exercise be a necessity for he circulation and nutrition and to practice swift flight to safety be useful even in modern time -lrb- 11 -rrb- gardening may take we back to a agricultural stage but digging be most useful as a muscular exercise and watering be scientific experiment and add to the feeling of power while the flower themselves appeal to the aesthetic side of the sense-play which be not limit to any age though conspicuous so soon -lrb- footnote 11 : a up-to-date riddle ask the difference between the quick and the dead and answer the quick be those who get out of the way of a motor-bus and the dead be those who do not -rrb- froebel recognize many kind of play he realize that much of the play of boyhood be exercise of physical power and that it must be of a competitive nature because the boy want to measure he power even in 1826 he urge the importance not only of town playground but of play leader that the play may be full of life among game for boy he note some still involve sense-play as hide game color game and shooting at a mark which need quick hearing and sight intellectual play exercise think and judgement _ eg _ draught and dramatic game one form of play which seem to he most important be constructive play where there be expression of idea as well as expression of power this side of play cover a great deal and will be deal with later its importance in froebel 's eye lie in the fact that through construction however simple the child gain knowledge of he own power and learn to master himself froebel want particularly to deepen this feeling of power and say that the little one who have already make some experiment take pleasure in the use of sand and clay impel by the previously acquire sense of power he seek to master the material in order to gain real knowledge of himself of he power a child need to compare he power with that of other this be one reason for the child 's ready imitation of all he see do by other another reason for this be that only through real experience or action can a child gain the idea which he will express later therefore he must reproduce all he see or hear in the family the child see parent and other at work produce do something consequently he at this stage would like to represent what he see be cautious parent you can at one blow destroy at least for a long time the impulse to activity and to formation if you repel they help as childish useless or even as a hindrance strengthen and develop this instinct give to you child the highest he now need let he add he power to you work that he may gain the consciousness of he power and also learn to appreciate its limitation as the child 's sense of power and he self-consciousness deepen he require possession of he very own say froebel : the feeling of he own power imply and demand also the possession of he own space and he own material belong exclusively to he be he realm he province a corner of the house or courtyard be it the space of a box or of a closet be it a grotto a hut or a garden the boy at this age need a external point choose and prepare by himself to which he refer all he activity as idea widen the child 's purpose enlarge and he find the need for that co-operation which bind human being together and so by play enjoy in common the feeling of community which be present in the little child be raise to recognition of the rights of other not only be a sense of justice develop but also forbearance consideration and sympathy when the room to be fill be extensive when the realm to be control be large when the whole to be produce be complex then brotherly union of similar-minded person be in place and we be invite to enter a education room where boy of seven to ten be use building block sand sawdust and green moss bring in from the forest each one have finish he work and he examine it and that of other and in each rise the desire to unite all in one whole so road be make from the village of one boy to the castle of another : the boy who have make a cardboard house unite with another who have make miniature ship from nut-shell the house as a castle crown the hill and the ship float in the lake below while the youngest bring he shepherd and sheep to graze between the mountain and the lake and all stand and behold with pleasure and satisfaction the result of they hand the educative value of such play have be bring forward in modern time in _ floor game _ by mr well _ magic city _ by mr nesbit and notably in mr caldwell cook 's play city in _ the play way _ join together for a common purpose do not only belong to younger boy what busy tumult among those older boy at the brook they have build canal sluice bridge etc at each step one trespass on the limit of another realm each one claim he right as lord and maker while he recognize the claim of other and like state they bind themselves by strict treaty every town should have its own common playground for the boy glorious result would come from this for the entire community for at this period game whenever possible be in common and develop the feeling and desire for community and the law and requirement of community the boy try to see himself in he companion to weigh and measure himself by they to know and find himself by they help it be the sense of sure and reliable power the sense of its increase both as a individual and as a member of the group that fill the boy with joy during these game justice self-control loyalty impartiality who could fail to catch they fragrance and that of still more delicate blossom forbearance consideration sympathy and encouragement for the weaker thus the game educate the boy for life and awaken and cultivate many social and moral virtue in england we have always have respect for boy ' game and more and more especially in america people be realize the need for play place and play leader but all this be write in 1826 when for ten year froebel have be experiment with boy of all age at keilhau play of all kind have a honor place we read of excursion for all kind of purpose of indian game out of fenimore cooper and of homeric battle it be part of froebel 's plan to have we work with spade and pick-axe and every boy have he own piece of ground where he might do what he please eber be literary construct in he plot a bed of heather on which he lay and read or make verse the boy build they own stage paint they own scenery and in winter once a week they act classic drama besides this there be a large and complete puppet theater belong to the school bookbinding and carpentry be teach and at christmas the embryo cabinet-maker make box with lock and hinge finish veneer and polish in england in 1917 we have give to we _ the play way _ in which one who have try it give the result of he own experiment in education through play mr caldwell cook be not satisfy with the condition of affair when school above the kindergarten be a nuisance because there be no play he dream be that of a play school commonwealth where education which be the training of youth shall be fill with the spirit of youth namely freshness zeal happiness enthusiasm the next chapter will show that it have take we exactly a hundred year to reach as far as public recognition of the nursery school where play be the only possible motive it be for the come generation of teacher to act so that the dream of the play school commonwealth shall be realize more quickly it be a significant fact that the line quote as head for the next chapter be write by a modern schoolmaster chapter iv from 1816 to 1919 poor mite you stiffen on a bench and stoop you curl to dusty law you petal finger curve and clench in slavery to parchment saw you suit you heart to sallow face in sullen place : but no pen nor pedantry can make you man yours be the morning and the day : you should be teach of wind and light you learning should be bear of play -lrb- _ cage : _ george winthrop young -rrb- have england but honor she own prophet we should have have nursery school a hundred year ago in 1816 the year in which froebel found he school for older boy at keilhau robert owen the socialist follow the plan prescribe by nature open a school where child from two to six be to dance and sing to be out-of-door as much as possible to learn when they curiosity induce they to ask question and not to be annoy with book they be to be prevent from acquire bad habit to be teach what they could understand and they disposition be to be train to mutual kindness and a sincere desire to contribute all in they power to benefit each other they be train and educate without punishment or the fear of it a child who act improperly be not consider a object of blame but of pity and no unnecessary restraint be impose on the child but the world be not ready owen 's rational infant school attract much notice and a infant school society be found but even the enlighten be incapable of understand that any education be possible without book and the promoter rightly though quite unconsciously condemn themselves when they keep the title infant school but drop the qualify rational still infant school have be start and interest have be arouse when the edict abolish kindergarten be promulgate in germany some of froebel 's disciple pass to other land and madame von marenholz come to england in 1854 already one kindergarten have be open by a madame ronge to which rowland hill send he child and to which dickens pay frequent visit in the same year there be hold in london a international educational exposition and congress and to this madame von marenholz send a exhibit which be explain by madame ronge and by a mr hoffmann dickens who have watch the actual working of a kindergarten give warm support to the new idea and write a excellent article on infant garden for _ household word _ urge that since child be by infinite wisdom so create as to find happiness in the active exercise and development of all they faculty we who have child round about we shall no longer repress they energy tie up they body shut they mouth the frolic of childhood be not pure exuberance and waste ` there be often a high meaning in childish play ' say froebel let we study it and act upon the hint -- or more than hint -- that nature give dr henry barnard represent connecticut at this congress and he take the kindergarten to america in whose virgin soil the seed take root and quickly bring forth abundantly but the soil be virgin and the field be ready for plant for america in these day have nothing corresponding to we infant school the kindergarten be welcome by people of influence dr barnard find he first ally in miss peabody one of whose sister be marry to nathaniel hawthorne while another be the wife of horace mann miss peabody begin to teach in 1860 but eight year later after a visit to europe she give up teaching for propaganda work owe to she effort the first free kindergarten be open in boston in 1870 philanthropist soon recognize its importance as a social agency and by 1883 one lady alone support thirty-one such institution in boston and its surroundings in new york dr felix adler establish a free kindergarten in 1878 and teacher ' college be influential in help to form a association which support several another name well know in this country be that of miss kate dougla wiggin -lrb- 12 -rrb- who be a kindergarten teacher for many year before she become know as a novelist it be miss wiggin who tell of a quaint translation of kindergarten hear by a san francisco teacher make friendly visit to the mother of she child while she stand on a door-step sympathise with one poor woman she hear a loud but not unfriendly voice from a upper window clear thing from under foot it peal in stentorian accent the teacher o ' the _ kid ' guard _ be comin ' down the street -lrb- footnote 12 : writer of _ penelope in england _ etc and of a capital collection of essay entitle _ child 's rights _ -rrb- in england thing be very different because of the infant school which have already be establish but which have fall far below the ideal set up by robert owen as every one know the education give in those day to teacher of elementary school be but meager and the result be often so bad that to justify the expenditure of public money payment by result be introduce in 1870 come the education act and the year 1874 see a good deal of movement miss caroline bishop be appoint to lecture to the infant ' teacher under the london school board miss heerwart take charge of a training college for kindergarten teacher in connection with the british and foreign school society the froehel society be found and madame michaelis take the kindergarten into the newly establish high school for girl for the child of the well-to-do kindergarten spread rapidly but for the child of the poor there be no such happiness the infant school be too firmly establish as a place where child learn to read write and count and above all to sit still infant ' teacher receive no special training for they work they course of study in which professional training play but a small part be the same as that prescribe for the teacher of older child some college notably the home and colonial stockwell and saffron walden do try to give they student some special training but it be not of much avail and the word kindergarten come to mean not nursery school as be the idea of its founder but dictate exercise with kindergarten material a kind of manual drill suppose to give hand and eye training and with this mean it make its appearance on the time-table visitor from america be shock to find no kindergarten in england but only large class of poor little automaton sit erect with hand behind or worse still hand on head and move only to the word of command one lady who ultimately find she way to we own kindergarten tell I that she have be inform at the lcc office that there be no kindergarten in london it be partly the scandalised expression of these american teacher that stimulate miss adelaide wragge to take she courage into she hand and in the year 1900 to open the first mission kindergarten in england she call it a mission not a free kindergarten partly because the parent pay the trifling fee of one penny per week and partly because it be connect with the parish work of holy trinity woolwich of which she brother be vicar the first report say : the neighborhood be suitable for the experiment little child need just the kind of training we propose to give they abound everywhere the woolwich child be typical slum baby vary in age from three to six year very poor very dirty totally untrained in good habit at first we only admit a few and when these begin to improve gradually increase the number to thirty-five they need great patience and care but they respond wonderfully to the love give they and before long they be real kindergarten child full of vigor merriment and self-activity as be do in connection with all free kindergarten parent ' evening be institute from the first and the mother be help to understand they child by simple talk sesame house for home life training have be open six month before this mission kindergarten it be found by the sesame club and at its head be miss schepel who for twenty year have be at the head of the pestalozzus froebel house the idea of home life training attract student who be not oblige by stern necessity to earn they daily bread though the method be not quite in line with progressive think the atmosphere create by miss schepel warmly second by miss buckton -lrb- 13 -rrb- be one of enthusiasm in the service of child the second nursery school in london have its origin in this enthusiasm miss maufe leave sesame house early in 1903 and start a free child garden in west london four year later she move to westminster to a block of workman 's dwelling erect on the site of the old millbank prison this child garden have a special interest from the fact that it be carry on actually in a block of workman 's dwelling like the child 's house of a later date the effort be voluntary and the room be small but if the experiment have be support by the authority it would have be easy to take down divide wall to get sufficient space miss maufe give herself and she income for about twelve year but difficulty create by the war the impossibility of finding efficient help and consequent drain upon she own strength have force she to close she little school to the grief of the mother in 48 ruskin building another sesame house student miss l hardy in she charming _ diary of a free kindergarten _ take we from london to edinburgh but the first free kindergarten in edinburgh begin in 1903 and have a different origin miss howden be a infant ' mistress in one of the slum and know well the need of little child in that wide street once deck with lordly mansion which lead from the castle to holyrood palace some of the fine house be leave but the inhabitant be of the poorest and miss howden leave she savings to start a free kindergarten in the canongate the sum be not large but it be seed sown in faith and its harvest have be abundant for edinburgh with its population of under 400000 have five free kindergarten in all of which the child be wash and feed and give restful sleep as well as teach and train with intelligence and love london with its population of 6000000 have but eight up to the time of the outbreak of the war -lrb- footnote 13 : author of the beautiful mystery play of _ eager heart _ -rrb- in 1904 the froebel society take part in a joint conference at bradford where one sit be devote to the need for nursery school for child from three to five year at present attend the public elementary school the speaker be mr miall of leed and miss k phillip who have wide opportunity for knowledge of the unsuitable condition generally provide for these little child among those who join in this discussion be miss margaret m ` millan so well know for she pioneer work in connection with school clinic and more recently for she now famous camp school miss m ` millan have already do yeoman service on the bradford education committee but be now resident in london and she have be warmly welcome on the council of the froebel society it be from the date of this conference that the name nursery school become general though it have be use by madame michaelis as early as 1891 in the following year 1905 the board of education publish its report on child under five year of age with its prefatory memorandum state that a new form of school be necessary for poor child and that parent who must send they little one to school should send they to nursery school rather than to school of instruction to school where there should be more play more sleep more free conversation story-telling and observation it would seem that the recommendation of 1905 may begin to be carry out in 1919 a consummation devoutly to be wish in the meantime voluntary effort have do what it could birmingham have good reason to be in the forefront since many of its public-spirited citizen have in they own childhood the benefit of the excellent work of miss caroline bishop a disciple of frau schrader the birmingham people 's kindergarten association open its first people 's kindergarten at greet in 1904 and a second the settlement kindergarten in 1907 sir oliver lodge speak strongly in favor of these institution call they a protest against the idea of the comparative unimportance of childhood miss hardy open she child garden in 1906 and that work have grow so that the child be now keep till they be eight year old the edinburgh provincial council for the training of teacher open another free kindergarten as a demonstration school for froebelian method a practise school for student and also as a experimental school where attempt might be make to solve problem as to the education of neglect child under school age it be the headmistress of this school miss hodsman who invent the net bed now in general use she want something hygienic and light enough to be carry easily into the garden that in fine weather the child might sleep out of door another sesame house student miss priestman open a free kindergarten in the pretty village of thornton-le-dale where the child have a sand-heap in a little enclosure allow they by the blacksmith and sail they boat at a quiet place by the side of the beck that run through the village it be in 1908 that miss esther lawrence of the froebel institute inspire she old student to help she to open the michaeli free kindergarten since the war the name have be alter to the michaeli nursery school which be in net dale on the edge of a very poor neighborhood where large family often occupy a single room as in the edinburgh free kindergarten dinner be provide for which the parent pay one penny the first report tell how necessary be nursery school in such surroundings the little child who be formerly tie to the leg of the bed and leave all day while he mother be out at work be now enjoy the happy freedom of the kindergarten the child whose clothes be formerly sew on to he to save he mother the periodical labor of sew on button be now undressed and bathed regularly the attack on child by drunken parent be less frequent when the kindergarten be first open many of the child be quite listless they do not know how to play do not care to play now they play with pleasure and with vigor and one can hardly believe they be the listless spiritless child of a year ago in 1910 miss lawrence succeed in open what be call from the first the somer town nursery school where the same kind of work be do one of the report say : it be interesting to see the child sweeping or dust a room wash they duster and doll ' clothes polish the furniture they shoe and anything which need polish on Friday morning the ` silver ' be clean and the brilliant result give great pleasure and satisfaction to the little polisher ` have you do you work ' be the question address to a visitor by a three-year-old child and the visitor beat a hasty retreat ashamed perhaps of be the only drone in the busy hive at dinner time four child wait on the rest and very well and quickly the food be hand round and the plate remove there be other free kindergarten at work one be in charge of miss rowland and be in connection with the bermondsey settlement it be miss rowland who tell of the candid mother she meet one Saturday who remark i tell the child to wash they face in case they meet you the phoenix park kindergarten in glasgow be interesting because the site be grant by a enlighten corporation and the park committee lay out the garden while the real start come from the pupil of a school for girl of well-to-do family by this time other social agency have be group round the kindergarten as a center the caldecott nursery school be open in 1911 and have grow into the caldecott community which have now take its child to live altogether in the country this nursery school be never intend to be a kindergarten it be start as a interesting experiment chiefly perhaps in the hope that the child might enjoy that instruction which be usually absorb by the child of the wealthy in they own nursery by virtue of they happier surroundings and in the very year in which we be plunge into war miss margaret m ` millan put into actual shape what she have long thought of and open she baby camp and nursery school with a place for toddler in between the full story of which be tell in _ the camp school _ in the camp itself the thing which impress the visitor most be first the space and the fresh air the sky above and the brown earth below and next the family feeling which be so plain in spite of the number the camp exist long before it be a baby camp and nursery school for miss m ` millan begin with a school clinic and go on to open-air camp for girl and for boy before go to the preventive and constructive work of the baby camp clean and healthy body come first but to miss m ` millan 's enthusiasm everything in life be educative the war have increase the supply of nursery school because the need for they have become glaringly apparent many experiment be go on now and it seem as if experimental work would be encourage not hamper by unyielding regulation the nursery school should cover the age for which the kindergarten be institute roughly from three to six year old already there be excellent baby room in some part of london and no doubt in other town and the only reason for disturb these be to provide the child with more space and more fresh air or with something resemble a garden rather than a bare yard one school in london have a creche or day nursery not exactly a part of it but in closest touch establish owe to the effort of a enthusiastic headmistress work along with the norland place nurse its space be at present insufficient but the neighbouring building be condemn and will come down after the war they need not go up again then the space could be use in the same way as in the camp school that would be to the benefit of the whole neighborhood and there could be at least one experiment where from creche to standard vii might be in close connection miss m ` millan 's ideal be to have a large space in the center of a district with covered passage radiate from it so that mother from a large area could bring they little one and leave they in safety it would be safety it would be salvation but as the scot proverb have it it be a far cry to loch awe another question much debate be who be to be in charge of these child the day nursery or crèche must undoubtedly be staff with nurse but with nurse train to care for child not merely sick nurse there be however certain people who believe that the trained nurse be the right person to be in charge of child up to five while other think that young girl or uneducated woman will suffice we be thankful that the board of education take up the position that a well-educated and specially trained teacher be to be the person responsible we certainly want the help both of the trained nurse and of the motherly woman the trained nurse will be far more use in detect and attend to the ailment of child than the teacher can be and the motherly woman can give far more efficient help in training child to decent habit than any young probationer useful though these may be but there be always the fear that the nurse may think that good food and cleanliness be all a child require and as miss m ` millan say the sight of the toddler ' empty hand and mute lip do not trouble they at all but every man to he trade and though the teacher in charge must know something about ail child it be very doubtful if a few month in a hospital will advantage she much here she trench on the province of the real nurse whose training be thorough and the little knowledge as every one know be sometimes dangerous one nursery school teacher with year of experience say that what she learn in hospital have be of no use to she and it be probable that attendance at a clinic for child would be really more useful certainly the main concern of the nursery school teacher be sympathetic understanding of child there must be no more of _ punch 's _ go and see what tommy be do in the next room and tell he not to but go and see what tommy be try to accomplish and make it possible for he to carry on he self-education through that ` foster of the human instinct of activity investigation and construction ' which constitute a kindergarten chapter v the world 's mine oyster a box of counter and a red-veined stone a piece of glass abrade by the beach and six or seven shell if early education consist in foster natural activity there can be no doubt that froebel hit upon the activity most prominent of all in the case of young child viz the impulse to investigate for he crest the little child should share in the motto give to the mongoose family in kipling 's _ rikki-tikkus _ ` run and find out ' most writer on the education of young child have emphasise the importance of what be most inadequately call sense training and it be here that dr montessorus take she stand with she didactic apparatus froebel 's idea seem wider he realize that the sword with which the child open he oyster be a two-edged sword that he use not only he sense organ as tool for investigation but he whole body he pathway to knowledge and to power over himself and he surroundings be action and action of all kind be as necessary to he as the use of he sens the child 's first utterance be force say froebel and he first discovery be the resistance of matter when he push with he foot against what resist they he first experiment be with he body he first toy be he own limb and he first play be the use of body sens and limb for the sake of use not for result one use of he body be the imitation of any move object and froebel tell the mother : if you child 's to understand action in the world without you must let he tiny hand imitative move about this be the reason why baby will never still imitate whatever 's by at this stage the child be to move freely and be active to grasp and hold with he own hand he be to stand when he can sit erect and draw himself up not to walk till he can creep rise freely maintain he balance and proceed by he own effort he be _ not _ to be hinder by swaddle band -- such as be in use in continental country -- nor later on to be _ spoil by too much assistance _ word which every mother and teacher should write upon she phylactery but as soon as he can move himself the surroundings speak to the child outer object _ invite _ he to seize and grasp they and if they be distant they invite he who would bring they nearer to move towards they this use of the word invite be worthy of notice and call to mind a sentence use by a writer on freud -lrb- 14 -rrb- that the activity of a human being be a constant function of he environment we adult who be so ready with we do not touch must endeavor to remember how everything be shout to a child : look at I listen to I come and fetch I and find out all you can about I by every means in you power -lrb- footnote 14 : _ the freudian wish _ edwin holt -rrb- if we have anything to do with little child we must face the fact that the child be if not quite a robinson crusoe on he island at least a explorer in a strange country and a scientist in he laboratory but there be nothing narrow in he outlook : the name of this chapter be deliberately choose the whole world be the child 's oyster he interest be all-embracing from he first walk he be the geographer each little walk be a tour of discovery each object -- the chair the wall -- be a america a new world which he either go around to see if it be a island or whose coast he follow to discover if it be a continent each new phenomenon be a discovery in the child 's small and yet rich world _ eg _ one may go round the chair one may stand before it behind it but one can not go behind the bench or the wall then come a inquiry into the physical property of surround object the effort to reach a particular object may have its source in the child 's desire to hold himself firm and upright by it but we also observe that it give he pleasure to touch to feel to grasp and perhaps also -- which be a new phase of activity -- to be able to move it the chair be hard or soft the seat be smooth the corner be pointed the edge be sharp the business of the adult froebel go on to say be to supply these name not primarily to develop the child 's power of speech but to define he sense impression next the scientist must stock he laboratory with material for experiment the child be attract by the bright round smooth pebble by the gaily flutter bit of paper by the smooth bit of board by the rectangular block by the brilliant quaint leaf look at the child that can scarcely keep himself erect that can walk only with the greatest care -- he see a twig a bit of straw painfully he secure it and like the bird carry it to he nest see he again laboriously stoop and slowly go forward on the ground under the eaves of the roof -lrb- the deep eaves of the thuringian peasant house -rrb- the force of the rain have wash out of the sand smooth bright pebble and the ever-observing child gather they as build stone as it be as material for future building and be he wrong be he not in truth collect material for he future life build the box of counter and the red-veined stone the brilliant quaint leaf the twig the bit of straw all the child 's treasure -- these be the stimulus which accord to the biologist educator must be supply if the activity appropriate to each stage be to be call forth every one know for how long a period a child can occupy himself examine compare and experiment like thing say froebel must be range together unlike thing separate the child love all thing that enter he small horizon and extend he little world to he the least thing be a new discovery but it must not come dead into the little world nor lie dead therein lest it obscure the small horizon and crush the little world therefore the child would know why he love this thing he would know all its property for this reason he examine the object on all side for this reason he tear and break it for this reason he put it in he mouth and bite it we reprove the child for naughtiness and foolishness and yet he be wiser than we who reprove he this experiment be one side of a child 's play and the thing with which he thus experiment be he toy or as froebel put it play material much of this be and ought to be self find and where the child can find he own toy he ask for little more the seaside supplies he with sand and water stone shell rock pool seaweed and he ask we for nothing but a spade which dig deeper than he naked hand and a pail to carry water which hand alone can not convey the vista of the sand be the child 's free land where the grown-up seem half afraid even nurse forget to sniff and to call come here as she sit very near to the far up cliff and you venture alone with you spade even indoors a child could probably find for himself all the material for investigation all the stimulus he require if it be not that he investigation interfere with adult purpose even in very primitive time the child probably experiment upon the revolving quality of he mother 's spindle till she find it more convenient to let he have one for himself and it become a toy or top froebel who make so much of play to whom it be spontaneous education and self realisation be bind to see that toy be important the man advance in insight he say even when he give he child a plaything must make clear to himself its purpose and the purpose of plaything and occupation material in general this purpose be to aid the child freely to express what lie within he and to bring the outer world nearer to he and thus to serve as mediator between the mind and the world froebel 's gift be a attempt to supply right play material true to he faith in natural impulse froebel watch child to see what plaything they find for themselves or which among those present by adult be most appreciate soft little colored ball seem right material for a baby 's tender hand and it be clear that when the child could crawl about he be ready for something which he could roll on the floor and pursue on all fours as early as two year old he love to take thing out of box and to move object about so box of brick be supply grade in number and in variety of form not for a moment do froebel suggest that the child be to be limit to these select plaything he expressly state the contrary and he frequently say that spontaneity be not to be check but from what have follow from the way in which these little toy have be misuse we be tempt to speculate on whether these gift supply that definite foundation without which in these day no notice would have be take of the new idea or whether they have prove the sunken rock on which much that be valuable have perish the world be not ready to believe in the educational value of play just pure play nor be it yet for the new system in its didactic apparatus out-froebel froebel in he mistake of try to systematise the material for spontaneous education carefully plan as be froebel 's own gift the new apparatus present a series of exercise in sense discrimination satisfy no doubt while unfamiliar but suffer from the defect of the too finished and complex plaything in which froebel see a danger which slumber like a viper under the rose the danger be that the child can begin no new thing with it can not produce enough variety by its means he power of creative imagination he power of give outward form to he own idea be thus actually deaden to realize he aim man and more particularly the child require material though it be only a bit of wood or a pebble with which he make something or which he make into something in order to lead the child to the handling of material we give he the ball the cube and other body the kindergarten gift each of these gift incite the child to free spontaneous activity to independent movement froebel would have sympathise deeply with the view of peter as express by mr well in regard to ideal which he however call toy : the theory of ideal play almost as important a part in the early philosophy of peter as it do in the philosophy of plato but peter do not call they ideal he call they ` toy ' toy be the simplify essence of thing pure perfect and manageable real thing be troublesome uncontrollable over-complicated and largely irrelevant a real train for example be a poor big clumsy limited thing that be oblige to go to redhill or croydon or london that be full of unnecessary stranger usually sit firmly in the window seat that you could do nothing with at all a toy train be you very own it take you wherever you want to fairyland or russium or anywhere at whatever pace you choose -lrb- 15 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : _ joan and peter _ p 77 -rrb- froebel ask what present be most prize by the child and by mankind in general and answer those which afford he a means of develop he mind of give it freest activity of express it clearly for she idea as to educative material dr montessorus go not to normal life not even to child but to what may he call curative appliance to the material invent by séguin to develop the dormant power of defective child she herself come to the study of education from the medical side the curative froebel with he belief in human instinct naturally go to what he call the mother 's room which we should call the nursery and to the garden where the child find he bright round smooth pebble and he brilliant quaint leaf no one would seek to under-value the importance of sense discrimination but it can be exercise without formalism and it need not be mere discrimination it be in connection with the taste and smell game that froebel tell the mother that the higher be root in the lower morality in instinct the spiritual in the material the baby enjoy the scent thanks the kind spirit that put it there and must let mother smell it too so from the beginning there be a touch of aesthetic pleasure and a recognition of what the dear god be say outside as to how sense discrimination may be exercise without formality there be a charming picture in _ the camp school _ : and then that sense of _ smell _ which get so little exercise and attention that it go to sleep altogether so that million get no warning and no joy through it we meet the need for its education in the baby camp by have a herb garden back from the shelter and open ground in a shady place we have plant fennel mint lavender sage marjoram thyme rosemary herb gerrard and rue and over and above these pungently smell thing there be little field of mignonette we have balm indeed everywhere in we garden the toddler go round the bed of herb pinch the leaf with they tiny finger and then put they finger to they nose there be two little couple go the round just now one be a pair of new comer very much astonish the other couple old inhabitant delighted to show the wonder of the place come back with odorous hand they perhaps want to tell we about the journey they eye be bright they mouth open in chapter ii we quote the biologist educator 's ideal conception of the surroundings best suit to bring about right development let we now visit one or two actual kindergarten and see if these condition be in any way realize by the follower of froebel the first one we enter be certainly a large bright room for one side be open to light with two large window and between they glass door open into the playground there be no heap of sand in a corner nor be there a tub of water for the practical teacher know how little hand if not little foot with they vigorous but as yet uncontrolled movement would splash the water and scatter the sand with dire effect as to the floor which the theorist fondly imagine would always be clean enough to sit upon but there be a sand-tray big enough and deep enough for six to eight child to use individually or together as spontaneous activity with its ceaseless effort at experiment ceaselessly spill the sand within easy reach be little brush and dustpan to remedy such mishap the sand-tray be line with zinc so that the sand can be replace by water for boat and duck etc when desire the low wall blackboard be there ready for use bright picture be on the wall well draw and well color some from nursery rhyme some of caldecott 's a frieze of hen and chicken etc box for house and shop be not in evidence but they place be take by brick of such size and quantity that house shop motor engine and anything else may be build large enough for the child themselves to be shopkeeper or driver and there be also piece of wood to use for various purpose of construction there be no cooking stove but simple cooking can be carry out on a open fire and when a baking oven be require a eager procession make its way to the kitchen where a kindly housekeeper permit the use of she oven there be a doll 's cot with a few doll of various size there be flower and grow bulb there be light low table and chair a family of guinea pig in a large cage and there be a cupboard which the child can reach water be to be find in a passage room between the kindergarten and the room for child above that stage and here so place that the child themselves can find and reach everything be the sawdust bran and oats for the guinea pig with a few carrot and a knife to cut they some tiny scrubbing-brush and a wiping-up cloth here also be store the empty box corrugated paper and odds and end in constant demand for construction in the cupboard there be certain shelf from which anything may be take and some from which nothing may be take without leave for the teacher here be of opinion that child of even three and four be not too young to begin to learn the lesson of _ meum _ and _ tuum _ and she also think it be good to have some treasure which do not come out every day and which may require more delicate handling than the ordinary toy ought to need for this ought to be strong enough to bear unskilled handling and vigorous movement for a broken toy ought to be a tragedy at the same time it be part of a child 's training to learn to use dainty object with delicate handling and such thing form the child 's art gem show beauty of construction and of color child as well as grown-up have they bad day when something out of the usual be very welcome do you know there be nothing in this world that i be not tire of be say one day by a boy of six usually quite contented give I something out of the cupboard that i have never see before say another whose digestion be troublesome the open shelf contain pencil and paper crayon paint-boxes box of building block interlock block wooden animal jigsaw and other puzzle color tablet for pattern lay toy scale bead to thread domino etc the only rule be that what be take out must be tidily replace this kindergarten be part of a large institution and the playground to which it have direct access be of considerable extent there be a big stretch of grass and another of asphalt so that in suitable weather the table and chair the sand-tray the brick and anything else that be want can be carry outside so that the child can live in the open which of course be better than any room in the playground there be a bank where the child can run up and down and there be a few plank and a builder 's trestle -lrb- 16 -rrb- on which they can be poise for seesaw or slide and these be a constant source of pleasure -lrb- footnote 16 : see p 55 -rrb- in another kindergarten we find the wall enliven with cecil aldin 's fascinating frieze : here be noah with all the animal walk in cheerful procession and in the next room be a attractive procession of child with push-carts hoop and toy motor car when we make we visit the day be fine and the room be empty the child be all outside the garden be not large but there be some space and under the shade of two big tree we find rug spread on which the child be sit stand kneel and lie accord to they occupation one be build with large block and must stand up to complete she erection another be lie flat put together a jigsaw another a boy be thread bead while another have build railway arch and with much whistling and the greatest carefulness be guide he train through the tunnel the play be almost entirely individual but very often you hear o miss x _ do _ come and see what i have do after about a hour during which a few of the child have change they occupation those who wish to do so join some older child who be play game involve movement this may be a traditional game like looby loo or round and round the village or it may be one of the best of the old kindergarten game after lunch the wash up be to be do in a beautiful new white sink which be display with pride we next visit be to a free kindergarten the room be quite as attractive as rich in charming frieze as in the other and the furnish in some way be much the same but here we see what we have not see before for here be a large room fill with tiny hammock bed the window be wide open but the blind be down for the child be have they afternoon sleep here as in all free kindergarten the child be provide with simple but pretty overalls which the parent be pleased to wash house shoe be also provide partly to minimize the noise from active little foot but principally because the poor little boot be often a painfully inadequate protection from wet pavement the child be train to tidy way and to independence they can not read but by picture card they recognize they own bed peg and other property they take out and put away they own thing and give all reasonable help in lay table and serve food in wash dust and sweep up crumb as be do in any true kindergarten in the garden of this free kindergarten there be a large sand-pit surround by a low wooden framework and have a pole across the middle so that it resemble a cucumber frame and a cover can be throw over the sand to keep it clean when not in use froebel 's own list of plaything contain besides ball and building block color bead color tablet for lay pattern color papers for cut folding and plait pencil paint and brush model clay and sand color wool for sew pattern and picture and such little stick and lath as child live in a forest region find for themselves consider in themselves apart from the tradition of formality these be quite good play material or stimulus and froebel mean the time to come when we shall speak of the doll and the hobby horse as the first play of the awaken life of the girl and the boy but he die before he have do so in the _ mother song _ too we find quite a good list of toy which be now to be find in most kindergarten toy for the playground should be provide -- a sand-heap a seesaw a substantial wheel-barrow hoop ball rein and perhaps skipping-rope something on which the child can balance log or plank which they can move about and a trestle on which these can be support be invaluable it be while a addition be be make to we place that we realize the importance of such thing and as in froebel 's case we teacher be the child themselves they be so supremely happy run up and down the plank road lay by the builder for they wheel-barrows seesawing or balancing and slide on other that we could not face the desolation of emptiness which would come when the workman remove they thing so for a few pound all that the child need be secure ordinary plank for seesaw narrower for balancing and a couple of trestle one exercise the child have specially enjoy be jump up and down on yield plank and this the workman have forbid because the plank might crack but a sympathetic foreman tell we what be need : two plank of special springy wood be fasten together by cross piece at each end and besides make excellent slide these make most exciting springboard for representation of real life the child require doll and the simplest of furniture -- a bed which need only be a box some means of carry out the doll 's wash she personal requirement as well as she clothes some little tea-thing and pot and pan a doll 's house be not necessary and can only be use by two or three child but will be welcome if provide and its appointment give practice in dainty handling train and signal of some kind home-made or otherwise animal for farm or zoo a pair of scale for a shop and some sort of delivery van which of course may be home-made there must also be provision for increase of skill and possibility of creation if the kindergarten can afford it some of the montessorus material may be provide there be no reason except expense why it should not be use if the child like it and if it do not take up too much room but it have no creative possibility and even at three year old this be require scissors be a important tool and a old book of sample wall-papers be most useful old match-box and use match paste and brush and some old magazine to cut blackboard chalk and crayon paint-box with four to six important color some kindergarten folding papers all these supply color certain toy seem specially suit to give hand control _ eg _ a noah 's ark where the small animal be to be set out carefully top or teetotum and tiddlywinks at which some little child become proficient the puzzle interest must not be forget and simple jigsaw picture give great pleasure it be interesting to note here that the youngest child fit these puzzle not by the picture but by form though they know they be make a picture and be please when it be finish the puzzle with six picture on the side of cube be much more difficult than a simple jigsaw all sort of odds and end come in useful and especially for the poorer child these should be provide any one who remember the pleasure derive from color envelope band from transparent paper from cracker and from certain advertisement will save these for child to whose home such treasure never come a box contain scrap of soft cloth possibly a bit of velvet some bit of smooth and shine color silk give the pleasure of sense discrimination without the formality of the montessorus grade box and be easier to replace some substitute for mother 's button box a box of shell or color seed a box of feather all these thing will be play with which mean observation and discrimination comparison and contrast and in addition where color be involve there be aesthetic pleasure and this also enter into the touch of smooth or soft surface softness be a joy to child as be show in the woolly lamb etc provide for baby a little one of my acquaintance have a bit of blanket which comfort many woe and when once i offer she a feather boa as a substitute she sob out : it be not so soft as the blanket in one of miss mcmillan 's early book she write : very early the child begin more or less consciously to exercise the basal sense -- the sense of touch on wake from sleep he put he tiny hand to grasp something or turn he head on the firm soft pillow he _ touch _ rather than look at first -lrb- for he hand and finger perform a great many movement long before he learn to turn he eyeball in various direction or follow the passage even of a light -rrb- and through touch many thing he begin he education if he be the nursling of wealthy parent it be possible that he first exercise be rather restricted he touch silk ivory muslin and fine linen that be all and that be not much but the child of the cottager be often better off for he mother give he a great variety of object to keep he quiet the ridiculous command ` do not touch ' can not be impose on he while he be scream in he cradle or protest in he dinner chair and so all manner of thing -- reel ring box tin that be to say a variety of surface -- be offer to he to he great delight and advantage and lest he should not get the full benefit of such privilege he carry everything to he mouth where the sense of touch be very keen -lrb- 17 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : _ early childhood _ : swan sonnenschein publish 1900 -rrb- among the treasure keep for special occasion there may be pipe for soap-bubble a prism of some kind with which to make rainbow a tiny mirror to make light-bird on the wall and ceiling and a magnet with the time-honoured duck and fish if these be still to be buy along with other article delicately make or color which require care picture and picture-book should also be consider some be in constant use some only bring out occasionally for the very smallest child some may be rag book but always child should be teach to treat book carefully the picture on the wall ought to be change sometimes with the child 's help sometimes as a surprise and discovery for that purpose it be convenient to have series of picture in frame with movable back but brown-paper frame will do quite well the picture belong to the story which have be tell to the child ought to have a prominent place and if the little one desire to have one retold they will ask for it it be of course not at all either necessary or even desirable for any one school to have everything and child should not have too much within the range of they attention at one time individual teacher will make they own selection but in all case there must be sufficient variety of material for each child to carry out he natural desire for observation experiment and construction chapter vi all the world 's a stage a wedding or a festival a mourning or a funeral as if he whole vocation be endless imitation in every country and in every age those who have eye to see have watch the same little drama what wordsworth see be see nineteen hundred year ago in the syrian market-place where the child complain of they unresponsive companion : we have pipe the glad chaunt of the marriage but ye have not dance we have wail we lamentation but ye have not join we mourning procession since the very name kindergarten be to imply a teaching which fulfil the child 's own want and desire it must supply abundant provision for the dramatic representation of life adult have always be ready to use for they own purpose the strong tendency to imitate which be a characteristic of all normal child but few even now realize to what extent a child profit by he imitative play the explanation that froebel find for this will now be generally accept viz that only by act it out can a child fully grasp a idea for what he try to represent or do he begin to understand he think in action or as one writer put it he apperceive with he muscle this explanation seem to cover imitative play from the little child 's imitative wave of the hand up to such elaborate imitation as be describe in stanley hall 's _ story of a sand pile _ -lrb- 18 -rrb- or in dewey 's _ school of to-morrow _ but when we think of the joy of such imaginative play as that of red indian shipwreck and desert island we feel that these show a craving for experience for life such a craving as cause the adult to lose himself in a book of travels or in a dramatic performance and which explain the phenomenal success of the cinema poor stuff as it be -lrb- footnote 18 : or that delightful play town in _ the play way _ -rrb- we thirst for experience even for those which be unpleasant we wonder how it feel to be up in a aeroplane or down in a submarine we be far indeed from desire air-raid but if such thing must be there be a curious satisfaction in be in it and though the experience they desire may be matter of everyday occurrence to we child probably feel the craving even more keenly you may write what you like say a teacher and a somewhat inarticulate child write i be out last night it be late why jack say another you have paint you cow green do you ever see a green cow no say jack but i would like to in early kindergarten day this imitative and dramatic tendency be chiefly meet in game and the child be by turn butterfly and bee baker and carpenter clock and windmill the program be suggest by froebel 's _ mother song _ in which he deal with the child 's nearest environment too often indeed the reality to which froebel refer be not reality to english child but that be recognize as a defect and the idea themselves be suitable chicken pigeon and farmyard animal the homely pussy cat or canary bird the worker to whom the child be indebted farmer baker miner builder or carpenter the sun the rain the rainbow and the light-bird -- such idea be choose as suitable centre and story and song game and handwork cluster round what be the reason for this binding of thing together why do froebel constantly plead for unity even for the tiny child and tell we to link together he baby finger-game or he first weak effort at build with he block chair table bed wall and ladder look back over the year it seem as if this idea of join together have be try to assert itself under various form each of which have reign for its day have be carry to extreme and be discard only to come up again in a somewhat different form it have always seem to aim at extend and order the mind content of child for the froebelian it be express in such word as unity connectedness and continuity while the herbartian call it correlation under these term much work have be and be still be carry out some very good and some very foolish idea catch on however because of the truth that be in they not because of the error which be likely to be mix with it and even the weakest effort after connection embody a important truth when we smile over absurd story of forced correlation we seldom stop to think of what go on before the kindergarten exist for instance the still more absurd and totally disconnect list of object lesson one actual list for child of four year old run : soda elephant tea pig wax cow sugar spider potato sheep salt mouse bread camel kindergarten practice be far ahead of this for here the teacher be expect to choose she material accord to -lrb- 1 -rrb- time of year -lrb- 2 -rrb- local condition such as the pursuit of the people -lrb- 3 -rrb- social custom when it be possible the child go to see the real blacksmith or the real cow and to let game or handwork be a expression and a re-ordering of idea gain be natural and right connectedness however mean more than this it mean that the material itself be to be treat so that the child would be help to that real understanding which come from see thing in they relation to each other as lloyd morgan put it we be mainly at work upon the mental background it be we object to make this background as rich and full and orderly as possible so that whatever be bring to the focus of consciousness shall be set in a relational background which shall give it mean and so that we pupil may be able to feel the truth which brown put into the mouth of fra lippo lippus : this world 's no blot for we nor blank it mean intensely and mean good : to find its meaning be my meat and drink accord to professor dewey some such link or join be necessary to foster that sense which be at the basis of attention and of all intellectual growth the sense of continuity the herbartian correlation be design to further that well-connected circle of think out of which would come the firm will guide by right insight inspire by true feeling which be they aim in education froebelian unity and connectedness have like the other a intellectual and a moral aspect intellectually the essential characteristic of instruction be the treatment of individual thing in they relationship morally the idea of unity be that we be all member one of another the child who through unhindered activity have reach the stage of self-consciousness be to go on to feel himself a part a member of a ever-increasing whole -- family school township country humanity -- the all to be one with nature man and god every one have hear something of the new teaching -- which by the way shed clearer light over froebel 's warning against arbitrary interference -- viz that a great part of the nervous instability which affect we generation be due to the thwart and check of the natural impulse of early year but this new school also give we something positive and reinforce older doctrine by tell we to integrate behavior this matter of the unthwarted lifelong progress of behavior integration be of profound importance for it be the transition from behavior to conduct the more integrated behavior be harmonious and consistent behavior toward a larger and more comprehensive situation toward a bigger section of the universe it be lucidity and breadth of purpose the child playing with fire be only wrong conduct because it be behavior that do not take into account consequence it be not adjust to enough of the environment it will be make right by a enlargement of its scope and reach -lrb- 19 -rrb- all selfish conduct all rudeness and roughness come from ignorance we be all more or less self-centred and the child 's consciousness of self have to be widen he scope have to be enlarged to sympathy with the thought feeling and desire of other self the sane man be the man who -lrb- however limit the scope of he behavior -rrb- have no such suppression incorporate in he the wise man must be sane and must have scope as well -lrb- 20 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 19 : _ the freudian wish _ edwin holt -rrb- -lrb- footnote 20 : _ the freudian wish _ edwin holt -rrb- professor earl barne always use to describe the child mind as scrappy how can we best aid development into the wholeness or healthiness and the scope of sanity and wisdom for it may well be that this widening and order of experience of consciousness of behavior into moral behavior be we most important task as teacher froebel emphasise the cry need for connection of school and life point out how the little child desire to imitate and the older to share in all that as professor dewey put it be surcharge with a sense of the mysterious value that attach to whatever they elder be concern with this be one of the point to which professor dewey call attention in he sum up of froebel 's educational principle this let the child reproduce on he own plane the typical doings and occupation of the larger maturer society into which he be finally to go forth it be in this connection that he say the kindergarten teacher have the opportunity to foster that most important sense of continuity in simple reproduction of the home life while there be abundant variety since daily life may bring we into contact with all the life of the city or of the country yet because the work be within a whole there be opportunity to foster that sense which be at the basis of attention and of all intellectual growth a sense of continuity since professor dewey give to the world the result of he experimental school all the kindergarten and most of the infant school in england have try to carry out they accustomed reproduction of home surroundings more or less on the line of the primary department of he experimental school they have extend they scope and in addition to the material already take from workman and shop from garden and farm have also with much profit to older child use he suggestion about primitive industry reproduction of home surroundings can be do in many way one of which be to help the child to furnish and to play with a doll 's house but the play must be play it be not enough to use the drama as merely offer suggestion for handwork and one small doll 's house do not allow of real play for more than one or two child we own child use to settle this by take out the furniture etc and arrange different home around the room i can remember the never-ending pleasure give by similar play in my own nursery day when the actor be the man and boy supply by tailor ' advertisement many and varied be the experience of these paper family family it may be note none of whom demean themselves so far as to possess any womankind for that nursery party of five have lose its mother sadly early and be rule by two boy who evidently think little of the other sex professor dewey tell we that nothing be more absurd than to suppose that there be no middle term between leave a child to he unguided fancy or control he activity by a formal succession of dictate direction it be the teacher 's business to know what be strive for utterance and to supply the need stimulus and material to show how under the inspiration of a thoroughly capable teacher this continuity may be secure and prolong for quite a long period a example may be take from the work of miss janet payne who be remarkably successful in meeting and stimulating without in any way force the strive for utterance mention by dewey on this occasion miss payne produce a doll about ten inch high dress to resemble the child 's father and suggest that a home should be make for he the child adopt he with zeal name he mr bird and he career last for two year mr bird require a family so mrs bird have to be produce with she little girl winnie and later a baby be add to the family bed table and chair include a high chair for winnie be make of scrap from the wood box and for a long time mr bird be most domesticated miss payne have use ordinary doll ' head but have construct the body herself in such a way that the doll could sit and stand and use they arm to wield a broom or hold the baby after some time one child say mr bird ought to go to business and after much deliberation he become a grocer he shop be make and stock and he attend it every day go home to dinner regularly one day he appear to be have a meal on the shop counter and it be explain that he have be rather in a hurry in the morning so mrs bird have give he he breakfast to take with he the bird family have various adventure they have spring cleaning removal visit the zoo and go to the seaside one morning a little fellow sit in a trolley with the bird family beside he for three-quarter of a hour evidently imagine i do inquire in pass if it be a drive or a picnic but the answer be so brief that i know i be a interruption and retire but a younger and bolder inquirer who want to conduct a experiment in modelling venture to ask if mr bird want anything that could be make at clay modelling yes he want some ink-pot for he post-office shop be the answer with the slightly irate addition but i _ wish _ you would call it the china factory when these child move to a upper class mr bird be lay away but the child request he presence so he enter the new room and become a farmer he have now to write letter to arrange rent etc and the money have to be make and count the letter serve for write and read lesson and miss payne be careful to send the answer through the real post properly address to mr bird with the name of class and school mr bird hire labourer the child grow corn and thrash it and send it to the mill a miller have to be produce and the child now he assistant grind the wheat and mr bird come in he cart to fetch the sack of flour which ultimately become the bird ' christmas pudding and be eat by the labourer now guest at the feast in spring after careful provision for they comfort mr bird go to the cattle market and buy cow though the milking have to be pretence the butter and cheese be really make the first question of the summer term be what be mr bird go to do this term like other teacher inspire by professor dewey we have find we child most responsive to the suggestion of play out primitive man but with some not of course with the brightest it be too great a stretch to go at one step from the present to the most primitive time and we often spend a term over something of the nature of robinson crusoe where the situation present character accustom to modern civilisation and deprive of all its convenience miss payne be careful to give the child full opportunity for suggestion -- one dull little boy puzzle he mother by tell she i make a very good ` gestion ' to-day -- so though she have not contemplate the renew appearance of mr bird she say what do you want he to do let he go out and shoot bear cry a embryo sportsman somewhat take aback miss payne temporise with he would not find they in this country then let he go to indium cry one child but another call out no no let he go to a desert island and that be carry with acclamation mr bird 's various home be on a miniature scale and be contain in a series of zinc tray which we have have make to fit the available table and cupboard top we find these tray convenient as a new one can be add when more scope be require to carry out new idea the following account take from the note of miss hilda beer while a student in training show another kind of play where the child themselves act the drama the note only cover a short period but they show how the play may arise quite incidentally _ mon June 18 _ -- as the ground be too damp for out-of-door work if the child be not ready with plan i mean to suggest build a railway station tunnel etc and later i think perhaps we might paint advertisement of seaside resort for we station but the child bring several thing with they and dorothy bring she own doll marie have leave the baby doll from the other room in the cot so dorothy and sylvium say they must look after the baby so cecil josie and i sweep and dust then we begin to play house cecil and dorothy be mr and mr harry sylvium be mrs loo -lrb- husband at the war -rrb- josie be nurse and i be aunt lizzie the doll be winnie harry and jack and doreen loo mr and mr harry build themselves a house and so do we cecil say but what be the name of the road mr harry choose 25 brookfield avenue and mr harry 7 victorium street but he give in and mr loo take he name for she house we have to put number on the house sylvium could make 7 but the other could not make 25 so i put it on the board and they copy it josie have also make a 7 want to use it but mr loo object and say the mother be more important than the nurse so josie fix she 7 on the house opposite after lunch we bath the baby and put they to sleep and as it be time for the child 's own rest we all go to bed when rest be over we wash and dress and then mr harry ask for clay to make a water-tap for she house that make all the child want to make thing in clay so we make cup and saucer plate and a baby 's bottle then scone and sponge-cake bread and a bread-board and one of the child say we must put a b on that then mr loo say but we have not any shelf i have to leave my class in miss payne 's charge and they spend the rest of the time fitting in shelf water-tap and sink _ June 19 _ -- after sweep dust and wash and dress the doll i read to the child how the house be build then we all pretend to bake make roll and cake as next day be to be the doll winnie 's birthday we baked we cake on a piece of wood on the empty fireplace the other child be invite to winnie 's party so we go out to shop the child want lettuce from they own garden but the grass be too wet so we pretend the shop be on the edge of the grass and we talk to imaginary shopman cecil often exclaim eightpence why it be not worth it as neither of the house would hold all the guest invite to the party we have to have a picnic instead _ June _ 20 -- i must see that sylvium and dorothy do the sweeping to-morrow and let josie bath the doll she be very good-natured and i see that they give she the less attractive occupation i think too that the food question have play too large a part so if the child suggest more cooking i shall look in the larder and say that really we must not buy or bake as food go bad in hot weather and we must not waste in war time the child have suggest make cushion paint picture and make knife and fork but we have not have time _ report _ -- dorothy and sylvium sweep cecil mend the wall of the house josie take the child down to the beach -lrb- the sand tray -rrb- and i dust we look into the larder and find that yesterday 's green be go bad so decide not to buy more then we take the baby for a walk we notice how many nasturtium be out how the blackberry bush be in flower and in bud and the runner-bean be in flower and the red flower look so pretty in the green leaf we look at the hollyhock because i have tell the child that they will grow taller than i be and they be always wonder how soon this will be the child find some cherry which have fall and dorothy say how pretty they be on the tree i call attention to one branch that be laden with fruit and look particularly pretty with the sun shine on it we also look at the pear tree and the almond everything have come on so fast and the child be ready to say it be because of the rain after rest we go to the hall to see the chicken to-day they be much bigger and sylvium say have bigger wing we be able to watch they drink how they hold up they head to let the water run down the rest of the morning we make curtain and the child love it there be much discussion and at first the child suggest make they all different but they agree that curtain at window be usually alike mr and mr harry nearly quarrel as one want green and the other pink i suggest trim the green with a strip of pink and they be quite pleased mr loo and nurse choose green which be to be sew with red silk sylvium say a pattern and i say you see something red and green to-day and she call out oh cherry she cut out a round of paper and try to sew round it hold it in place with she other hand i suggest put in a stitch to hold the paper cecil be absorb in sewing and it seem quiet for such a excitable boy and good for he weak hand one child say fancy a boy sew so i tell how soldier and sailor sew they sew just as they like these note be continue in chapter ix where they be use to show child 's attitude towards nature though separate here for a special purpose it be clear that there neither be nor ought to be any real separation in the life of the child they life be whole and they continually pass from one subject to another because life and its circumstance be make new demand if it rain and you can not gather the lettuce you have grow from seed you take refuge in happy pretence if it clear and the sun call you out of door you take you doll-baby for they walk chapter vii joy in make i too will something make and joy in the make robert bridge build by that only law that use be suggester of beauty arthur clough there have always be _ make _ in the kindergarten since to froebel the impulse to create be a characteristic of self-conscious humanity stopford brooke point out that browning 's caliban though almost brute show himself human in that besides think out he natural religion he also dramatise and create fall to make something ` tis solace make bauble ay and sport tasteth himself no finer good i ' the world than try what to do with wit and strength -- what do a child gain from he ceaseless attempt at make froebel 's answer be that intellectually through make he gain idea which receive in word remain mere word to learn through life and action be more develop than to learn through word : expression in plastic material unite with thought and speech be far more develop than mere repetition of word morally it be through impress himself on he surroundings that the child reach the human attribute of self-consciousness and self-control one of the most important passage froebel ever write be this : the deepest craving of the child 's life be to see itself mirror in some external object through such reflection he learn to know he own activity its essence direction and aim and learn to determine he activity in accordance with outer thing such mirroring of the inner life be essential for through it the child come to self-consciousness and learn to order determine and master himself it be from the point of view of expression alone that froebel regard art and draw he take to be the first revelation of the creative power within the child the very earliest draw to which he refer be what he call sketch the object on itself that be the trace round the outline of thing whereby the child learn form by co-ordinate sight and motor perception a stage on which dr montessorus have also lay much stress besides note how child draw round scissors and box leave and twig they own hand and even shadow he see that from experimentation with any pointed stick or scrap of red stone or chalk may come what mr e cooke call a language of line and now the horse of line the man of line will give much pleasure after this it be true that whatever a child know he will put into he drawing and the teacher 's business be to see that he have abundant perception and image to express another kind of draw which child seem to find for themselves be what they call make pattern out of this come the old-fashioned chequer draw now condemn as injurious to eyesight and of little value when child see anything rich in color the general cry be let 's paint it which be they way of take in the beauty we should not say froebel give they paint and brush inconsiderately to throw about but give they the help they need and he describe quite a sensible lesson give to boy whose own painting do not seem to paint they long teacher who want real help in the art training of child should read the excellent papers by miss findlay in _ school and life _ where we be tell that we must rescue the term design from the limited use to which it be often condemn in the draw class viz the construction of please arrangement of color and form for surface decoration we shall use it in its full popular significance in constructive work the term will cover build house make kettle lay out street plan room dress hair as well as make pattern for cushion cover and cathedral window in thus widen we art study we shall be hark back in a slight degree to the kind of training that in past age produce the great master giotto design he campanile primarily for the bell that be to summon the florentine to they cathedral the venetian want façades for they palace and make façades to delight they eye the japanese have want small furniture for they small room and have develop wonderful skill and taste in design it neither art nor science can remain long afloat in high abstract region above the need and interest of human life to quote ah clough : ' a cathedral pure and perfect build by that only law that use be suggester of beauty nothing conceal that be do but all thing do to adornment meanest utility seize as occasion to grace and embellish ' if this be true of the interest of the professional artist much more must it be true of the art training of the child we must not then despise the rough and ready production of a child nor force upon he a standard for which he be not ready before any other construction be possible to he a child can _ make _ with sand and this be a constant joy from the endless pudding that be turn out of patty pan up to such model as that of the whole isle of wight with its tunnel cliff and system of railway make by a ex-kindergarten boy as yet innocent of geography lesson the child then who be make especially make for use be to a certain extent develop himself as a artist the little boy at keilhau be well provide with sand moss etc to use with they building block and it be a former keilhau boy who suggest to he old master that some kind of sand-box would make a good plaything for the child in he new kindergarten miss wiggin tell we that indirectly we owe the child 's sand-heap in the public park to froebel since these be the result of a suggestion make by frau schrader to the empress frederick and the idea be carry out during she husband 's too brief reign another very early making be the arrange of furniture for shop carriage train and the ship upon the stair which make bright picture in stevenson 's memory building block be truly as froebel put it the finest and most variable material that can be offer a boy for purpose of representation the little box associate with the kindergarten be originally plan for the use of nursery child two to three year of age and in most if not in all kindergarten these have be replace by larger brick it be many year now since at miss payne 's suggestion we buy some hundred of road paving block and these be such a source of pleasure that the child often dream about they live out the life around present much opportunity for make which may be do with block but which even in the kindergarten can be do with tool care must be exercise but child have quite a strong instinct for self-preservation and if show how real workman handle they tool they be often more careful than at a much later stage to make a workable railway signal be more interesting and much more educative than to use one that come from a shop the teacher may make illuminating discovery in the process as when one set of child desire to make a counter for a shop and arrange they piece of wood vertically so that the counter have no top it be find that to these very little people the most important part be the high front against which they be accustom to stand not the flat top which they seldom see another set of child make a cart on which the farmer be to carry he corn and exemplify dewey 's concrete logic of action at first they only want a board on wheel but the corn fall off so they nail on side but the cart never have either back or front and resemble some see in early english picture any kind of cooking that can be do be a most important kind of make even the very little one can help and they thoroughly enjoy watch she hand be in the dough from three year old say a north-country mother so i teach she how to bake and now -lrb- at seven -rrb- she can bake as well as i can child delight in carry out the process involve in the making of flour and they can easily thrash a little wheat then winnow grind between stone and sift it they best effort produce but a tiny quantity of flour but the experience be real interest be great and a new significance attach to the shop flour from which bread be ultimately produce butter and cheese can easily be make also jam and even a christmas pudding in very early kindergarten we read of the grow digging and cooking of potato and of the extraction of starch to be use as paste special anniversary require special make we possess a doll of 1794 to whom she old mother bequeath she birthday the doll 's birthday be a great event and on the previous day each class in turn bake tiny loaf or cake or pastry for the party christmas create a need for decoration christmas card and present and empire day and trafalgar day for flag while in many place there be a annual sale on behalf of a charity it do not do to be too modern and to despise all the old-fashioned makings which give such pleasure some year ago kindergarten paper-folding have fall into a undeserved oblivion the making of boat or cocked-hat from old newspaper be a great achievement for a child and to make pig and purse corner cupboard and chair for paper doll be still a delight and call forth real concentration and effort making in connection with some whole such as the continuous representation of life around we and at a later stage the re-inventing of primitive industry or make which arise out of some special interest may have a higher educational value but apart from this child want to make for make 's sake can not i make something in wood like boy do ask a little girl there be joy in the make joy in be a cause and for this the child need opportunity space and time there be a lesson to many of we in some verse by miss f sharpley lately publish -lrb- _ educational handwork _ -rrb- which should be entitle when can i make my little ship i would like to cut and cut and cut and over the bare floor to strew my papers all about and then to cut some more i would sweep they up so neatly too but mother say oh no there be no time it be seven o'clock to bed you quickly go in school i would just begin to make a pretty little ship but i be slow and all the rest stand up to dance and skip when shall i make my little ship at home there be no gloy and father build it by himself or go to buy a toy chapter viii story let I tell the story and i care not who make the textbook stanley hall be it bible story to-day or any _ kind _ of a story be the greet of a eager child one morning usually they be persuade he to tell story write eber from he recollection of froebel as a old man at keilhau he be never see cross the courtyard without a group of the younger pupil hang to he coat tail and clasp he arm usually they be persuade he to tell story and when he condescend to do so the older one flock around he too and they be never disappoint what fire what animation the old man have retain so froebel could write with feeling of the joyful face the sparkling eye the merry shout that welcome the genuine story-teller he have a right to pronounce that the child 's desire and craving for tale for legend for all kind of story and later on for historical account be very intense surely there be never a little one who do not crave for story though here and there may be find a older child who get none at the right time and who therefore lose that most healthy of appetite most of we will agree that there be something wrong with the child who do not like story but it may be that the something wrong belong to the mother one such say to the abbé klein one day my child have never ask for story but madame be the reply neither would they ask for cake if they have never eat it or even see it it be easy for we to find reason why we should tell story we can brush aside minor aim such as increase the child 's vocabulary undoubtedly he vocabulary do increase enormously from listen to story but it be difficult to imagine that any one could rise to real height in story-telling with this as a aim or end that the narrator should clothe he live story in word expressive of its atmosphere and that the listener should in this way gain such power over language that he too can fitly express himself be quite another matter first then we tell story because we love to tell they and because the child love to listen we choose story that appeal to we audience it be something beautiful humorous heroic or witty that we have find and be social animal we want to share it as educator with a aim before we we deliberately tell story in order to place before we child ideal of unselfishness courage and truth we know from we own experience not only in childhood but all through life how the story reach we feeling as no sermon or moralising ever do and we have learn that out of the heart be the issue of life unguided feeling may be a danger but the story do more than rouse feeling -- it give opportunity for the exercise of moral judgement for the exercise of judgement upon question of right and wrong feeling be arouse but it be not usually a personal feeling so judgement be likely to be unbiassed it may however be biass by the tone absorb from the environment even in childhood as when the mother make more of table etiquette than of kindness and the child instead of condemn jacob 's refusal to feed he hungry brother with the red pottage as all natural child do condemn say : no esau should not have get it 'cause he ask for it as a rule the child 's standard be correct enough and approval or condemnation be justly bestow provide that the story have be choose to suit the child 's stage of development one little girl object strongly to macaulay 's ideal roman who in rome 's quarrel spare neither land nor gold nor son nor wife that be not right she say stoutly he ought to think of he own wife and child first she be satisfied however when it be explain to she that horatius might be able to save many father to many wife and child in my earliest teaching day have find certain history story successful with child of seven i try the same with child of six but only once edmund of east anglium die for he faith fall very flat what be the good of that say one little fellow 'cause if you be dead you can not do anything but if you be alive you can get more soldier and win a victory the majority of the class however seem to feel with another who ask why do not he promise while the dane be there he need not have keep it when they go away another way of state we aim in tell story to child be that a story present morality in the concrete virtue and vice _ per se _ neither attract nor repel they simply mean nothing to a child until they be present as the deed of man or woman boy or girl living and act in a world recognize as real one tell story be that of the boy who get hold of miss edgeworth 's _ parent 's assistant _ and who say to he mother mother i have be read ` the little merchant ' and i know now how horrid it be to cheat and tell lie i have be tell you that ever since you could speak say he mother to which the boy answer yes i know but that do not interest I we child have be tell the story of how the countess of buchan crown the bruce a duty which should have be perform by she brother the earl of fife who however be too much afraid of the wrath of english edward a few day after a argument arise and one little girl be hear to say i do not want to be brave and a boy rejoin girl do not need to be brave i say which would you rather be the countess who put the crown on the king 's head or the brother who run away and quickly come the answer oh the brave countess from the very child who do not want to be brave froebel sum up the teacher 's aim in the word : the tell of story be a truly strengthen spirit-bath it give opportunity for the exercise of all mental power opportunity for testing individual judgement and individual feeling but why be it that child crave for story education say miss blow a veteran froebelian be a series of response to indicate need and undoubtedly the need for story be as press as the need to explore to experiment and to construct what be the unconscious need that be express in this craving why be this desire so deeply implant by nature so far no one seem to have give a better answer than froebel have do when he say that the desire for story come out of the need to understand life that it be in fact root in the instinct of investigation only the study of the life of other can furnish point of comparison with the life the boy himself have experience the story concern other man other circumstance other time and place yet the hearer seek he own image he behold it and no one know that he see it man can not be master of he surroundings till he investigate and so gather knowledge but he have to adapt himself not only to the physical but to the human environment in which he live in story of all kind child study human life in all kind of circumstance nay if the story be sufficiently graphic they almost go through the experience narrate almost live the new life with very young child the most popular of all story be the the three bear and it be worth a little analysis a little girl run away and run away be a great temptation to little girl and boy as great a adventure as run off to sea will be at a later stage she go into a wood and meet bear : what else could you expect the story then deal with really interesting thing porridge basin chair and bed the strong contrast of the bear ' voice fascinate child and just when retribution might descend upon she the heroine escape and get safe home child revel in the familiar detail but these alone would not suffice there must be adventure excitement romance one feel that southey have the assistance of a child in make he story so complete and we can hear the question : how do the big bear know that the little girl have taste he porridge oh because she have leave the spoon how do he know that she have sit in he chair because she leave the cushion untidy and as for the little bear 's chair why she sit that right out that quite little child desire fresh experience or adventure and really exciting one be show by the follow story make by child the first two be by a little girl of two-and-a-half the third be take from lady glenconner 's recently publish _ the saying of the child _ once upon a time there be a giant and a little girl and he tell a little girl not to kiss a bear aco he would bite she and the little girl climb right on he back and she jump right down the stair and the bear come walk after the little girl and kiss she and she call it a little bear and it be a big bear -lrb- immense amusement -rrb- once upon a time there be a little piggy and he be right in a big green and white fire and he do not hurt hisself and -lrb- tell as a tremendous secret -rrb- he touch a fire with he handie ` what a naughty piggy ' say auntie ` and what next ' he jump right out of a fire auntie can you smile -lrb- for auntie can not smile when people be naughty -rrb- the third story be say to have be fill with pause due to a certain slowness of speech but the pause be light by the lightning flash of a fly eyebrow and the impressive nodding of a silken head once you know there be a fight between a little pony and a lion and the lion spring against the pony and the pony put he back against a stack and bite towards the lion and the lion roll over and the pony jump up and he run up and the pony turn round and the lion he mother feel she have lose the thread which win she ask which win he repeat and after a moment 's pause he say oh the little bear this surprising conclusion point to a stage when it be difficult for a child to hold the thread of a narrative and at this stage along with simple story of little one like themselves repetition or accumulation story seem to give most pleasure henny penny and billy bobtail -- tell by jacob as how jack go to seek he fortune -- be prime favorite repetition of rhythmic phrase have a great attraction as in three little pig with its delightful repetition of little pig little pig let I come in no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then i 'll huff and i 'll puff and i 'll blow you house in very soon however the child be ready for the time-honoured fairy-tale or folk-tale the orthodox beginning once upon a time in a certain country there live fit the stage when neither time nor place be of any consequence animal speak well why not we can the fairy accomplish wonder again why not wonderful thing do happen and they must have a wonderful cause and as one child say if there never have be any fairy how could people have write story about they goodness be reward and wickedness be punish as be only right in the child 's eye and goodness usually mean kindness the virtue best understand of child obedience be no doubt the nursery virtue in the eye of authority but kindness be much more human and attractive both child and man say froebel desire to know the significance of what happen around they this be the foundation of greek chorus especially in tragedy and of many production in the realm of legend and fairy-tale it be the result of the deep-rooted consciousness the slumbering premonition of be surround by that which be higher and more conscious than ourselves the fairy tale be the child 's mystery land he recognition that there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of in we philosophy or in we science dr montessorus protest against the idea that fairy-tale have anything to do with the religious sense say that faith and fable be as the pole apart she do not understand that it be for they truth that we value fairy-tale the truth they teach be such as that courage and intelligence can conquer brute strength that love can brave and can overcome all danger and always find the lose that kindness beget kindness and always win in the end the good and the faithful marry the princess -- or the prince -- and live happy ever after and assuredly if he do not marry he princess he will not live happy and if she do not marry the prince she will live in no beautiful palace and there be more take for instance the story of toad and diamond the courteous maiden who go down the well who give help where it be need and who work faithfully for mother holle -lrb- 21 -rrb- come home again drop gold and diamond when she speak she silence may be silver but she speech be golden and she word give light in dark place the selfish and lazy girl who refuse help and whose work be unfaithful and only do for reward have she reward henceforth when she speak down fall toad and snake she word be cold as she be they may glitter but they sting -lrb- footnote 21 : this version be probably a mixture of the version of perrault and grimm but mother holle shake she feather be worth bring in -rrb- fairy - and folk-tale give wholesome food to the desire for adventure whereas in what we may call realistic story adventure be chiefly confine to the naughty child who be therefore more attractive than the good and stodgy even among fairy-tale we may select beauty and the beast and the sleep beauty and snow-white and rose-red be distinctly preferable to jack the giant killer or puss in boot while bluebeard can not be tell it seem to I that child can often safely read for themselves story the adult can not well tell the child 's notion of justice be crude bad be bad and whether embody in a ogre or in pharaoh of egypt it must be get rid of put out of the story no child be sorry for the giant when jack 's axe cleave the beanstalk and as for pharaoh well it be a good thing he be drown for he be a bad man be not he death mean nothing to child as a rule except disappearance when child can read for themselves they will take from they story what suit they stage of development they standard of judgement and we need not interfere even though they regard with perfect calm what seem gruesome to the adult as a valuable addition to the best-known fairy-tale we may mention one or two other : _ grannie 's wonderful chair _ be a delightful set of story full of charming picture though the writer france brown be bear blind mr ewe 's story for child _ the brownie _ with _ amelium and the dwarf _ and _ timothy 's shoe _ be inimitable and she _ old-fashioned fairy tale _ be very good but not for very young child she other story be certainly about child but be as a rule write for adult george macdonald 's story be all too well know and too universally beloved to need recommendation but in tell they _ eg _ the princess and the goblin or at the back of the north wind the young teacher must remember that they be beautiful allegory before she venture to tell they the beginner should ponder well what the poet -- for these be prose poem -- means and who be represent by the beautiful great-great-grandmother always old and always young or north wind who must sink the ship but be able to bear the cry from it because of the sound of a far-off song which seem to swallow up all fear and pain and to set the suffering singing it with the rest _ water-baby _ be a bridge between the fairy-tale of a child and equally wonderful and beautiful fairy-tale of nature and it too be full of mean if the teacher have gain this the child will not lag behind it be a child of backward development who when she hear of mother carey who make thing make themselves say oh i know who that be that be god such story must be spread out over many day of tell but they gain rather than lose from that though for quite young child the story do require to be short and simple and often repeat if child get plenty of these the stage for longer story be reach wonderfully soon pseudo-scientific story in which for example a drop of water discuss evaporation and condensation be not story at all but a kind of mental meat lozenge most unsatisfying and probably not even fulfil they task of supply nourishment in form of fact fable usually deal with the fault and failing of grown-up and may be leave for child to read for themselves to extract what suit they illustration be not always necessary but if well choose they be always a help warne have publish some delightfully illustrated story for little child the three pig hop o ' my thumb beauty and the beast etc they be illustrate by hm brock and by leslie brooke and they really be illustrate the artist have enjoy the story and child equally enjoy the picture the teacher must consider what idea she be present and whether word alone can convey they properly we must remember that most child visualise and that they can only do so from what they have see so without illustration a castle may be a suburban house with nottingham lace curtain and a aspidistra while perseus or mose may differ little from the child 's own father or brother again town child can not visualise hill and valley forest and moor brook and river not to mention jungle and snowfield and the trackless ocean it be not easy to find picture to give any idea of such scene but it be worth while to look for they and it be also worth while for the teacher to visualise and to practice vivid describe of what she see child of course only want description when it be really a part of the story as when tom cross the moor descend lewthwaite crag or travels from brook to river and from river to sea as to how a story should be tell opinion differ it must be well tell with a well-modulated voice and with slight but effective gesture but the model should be the story as tell in the home not the story tell from a platform the child need not be spellbound all the time but should be free to ask sensible question and to make childlike comment in moderation the language should fit the subject beautiful thought need beauty of expression high and noble deed must be tell in noble language a teacher who wish to be a really good teller of story must herself read good literature and she will do well not only to prepare she story with care but to consider the language she use in daily life there be a happy medium between pedantry and the latest variety of slang and if daily speech be careless and slipshod it be difficult to change it for special occasion we story should not only prepare for literature they should be literature and those who realize what the story may do for child will not grudge time spend in preparation if the story be to present a ideal let we see that we present a worthy one if it be to lead the child to judge of right and wrong let we see that we give they time and opportunity to judge and that we do not force they judgement lastly if the story be to make the child feel let we see that the feeling be on the right side that they shrink from all that be mean selfish cruel and cowardly and sympathise with whatsoever thing be true whatsoever thing be lovely whatsoever thing be of good report chapter ix in grassy place my heart leap up when i behold a rainbow in the sky so be it when my life begin so be it when i shall grow old or let I die what be the real aim of what we call nature-lessons nature-teaching nature-work it be surely to foster delight in beauty so that we heart shall leap up at sight of the rainbow until we die for indeed if we lose that uplift of the heart some part of we have die already yet even wordsworth mourn that nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass and glory in the flower in its answer to the question what be the chief end of man the old shorter catechism have a grand beginning : man 's chief end be to glorify god and to enjoy he for ever do we lose the vision because we be not bold enough to take that enjoyment as we chief end to enjoy good be to enjoy god we end or aim be we desire and mr clutton brock in he _ ultimate belief _ urge teacher to recognize that the spirit of man have three desire three end and that it can not be satisfied till it attain all three man desire to do right so far as he see it for the sake of do right he desire to gain knowledge or to know for the sake of know for the sake of truth and he desire beauty we do not value that which we call beautiful because it be true or because it be good but because it be beautiful there be a glory of the universe which we call truth which we discover and apprehend and a glory of the universe which we call beauty and which we discover or apprehend froebel begin he _ education of man _ by a inquiry into the reason for we existence and he answer be that _ all _ thing exist to make manifest the spirit the _ élan vital _ which bring they into be _ sursum corda _ say stevenson lift up you heart art and blue heaven April and god 's lark green reed and sky scattering river a stately music enter god and browning if you get simple beauty and nought else you get about the best thing god invent to let child get that beauty should be we aim and they must get it in they own way life in and with nature and with the fair silent thing of nature should be foster by parent and other froebel tell we as a chief fulcrum of child-life and this be accomplish chiefly in play which be at first simply natural life let we surmount the rut of we teaching experience and climb high enough to look back upon we own childhood to see where beauty call to we where we attain to beauty among my own earliest recollection come a first view of the starry sky and the discovery of heaven no one call attention to the star they speak themselves to a child of four or five and declare the glory of god heaven be not on high among these glorious star however it be a grassy place with flower and sunshine it have to be heaven because you go through the cemetery to reach it and because it be so bright and flowery and there be no grave in it i never find it again because i have forget how to get there another very early memory be one of grief to see from the window how the gardener be mow down all the daisy and there be so many in the grass and yet another be of a high grassy sunny field with a little stream run far down below it be not really far and there be nothing particularly beautiful in the place to grown-up eye but the beholder be very small and love it dearly to he art and blue heaven stevenson might have add sun and green grass for he know what grassy place be to the child and that happy play in grassy place might well be heaven to the little one a most interesting little book call _ what be a kindergarten _ -lrb- 22 -rrb- be publish some year ago in america it be write by a landscape gardener and contain most valuable suggestion as to how best to use for a kindergarten or nursery school plot of ground which may be secure for that purpose naturally the writer have much to say on the lay out and stock the available space to the best advantage choose the most suitable position for the house where the teacher must live he say to supply the atmosphere of a home for animal hutch for sand-heap and seesaw for the necessary shelter for the child 's garden and for the lawn for even on he smallest plan a twenty-five-foot lot we find room for a spot of green later he explain that for this green one must use what will grow and if grass will not perhaps clover will the way in which the tree and plant be choose be most suggestive beauty and suitability be always consider but he remember he own youth and also consider the special joy of childhood for it be not nature lesson that come into he calculation but the mere association of plant and child so the birch tree be choose partly for its grace and beauty but also because of its bark for one can scribble on its papery surface the hazel because child delight in the catkin with they shower of golden dust and the nut hide in its cap of frill and tuck and he add : how much more alluring than the naked fruit from the grocer 's sack be these nut especially when dot for eye and mouth be add and a whole little face be tuck within this natural bonnet -lrb- footnote 22 : g hansen pub elder morgan & shepherd san francisco 1891 -rrb- in addition to the flower choose for beauty of color this lover of child and of garden want canterbury bell to ring forget-me-not because they can stand so much watering and flower with face pansy sweet-peas lupin snapdragon monkey flower red and white dead nettle and red clover to bring the bee some of these be choose because the child can do something with they can find they own use for they can play with they and speak generally play with they be the child 's way of appreciate both plant and animal pick feathery grass red-tipped daisy sweet-smelling clover and golden dandelion feed snapdragon with fall petal find what be o'clock by blow dandelion fruit pay for dock tea out of a fairy purse shade poppy doll with woodruff parasol that be how a child enjoy the beauty of color scent and form he get not more but less beauty when he must sit in a class and answer formal question must we talk about they before we take the flower home ask a child one day they be so pretty clearly the talk be go to lessen not to deepen the beauty and animal the child play with cat and dog he feed the chicken the horse and the donkey he watch with the utmost interest caterpillar snail and spider but he do not want to be ask question about they -- he do want to talk and perhaps to ask the question himself -- nor do he always want even to draw paint or model they mostly he want to watch and perhaps just to stir they up a little if they do not perform to he satisfaction he do not necessarily mean to tease only why should he watch a animal that do nothing the animal have not any habit when i watch they a little girl once say to professor arthur thomson all child should live in the country at least for part of the year they should know field and garden and have intercourse with hen and chicken cow and calf sheep and lamb should make hay and see the corn cut they would still want the wisely sympathetic teacher not to arouse interest -- that be not necessary but to keep it alive by keep pace with the child 's natural development it be not merely live in the country that develop the little child 's interest in shape and color and scent into something deeper people still spend all they time in the field and forest and see and feel nothing of the beauty of nature and of they influence on the human heart and this say froebel -- and it be just what mr clutton brock be say now -- be because the child fail to find the same feeling among adult two effect follow : the child feel the want of sympathy and lose some respect for the elder and also he lose he original joy in nature there be in every human be the passionate desire for this self-forgetfulness -- to which it attain when it be aware of beauty -- and a passionate delight in it when it come the child feel that delight among spring flower we can all remember how we feel it in the first apprehension of some new beauty of the universe when we cease to be little animal and become aware that there be this beauty outside we to be love and most of we must remember too the strange indifference of we elder they be not consider the lily of the field they do not want we to get we foot wet among they we might be forget ourselves but they be remember we and we become suddenly aware of the bitterness of life and the tyranny of fact now parent and nurse -lrb- and teacher -rrb- have of course to remember child when they forget themselves but they ought to be aware that the child when he forget himself in the beauty of the world be pass through a sacred experience which will enrich and glorify the whole of he life child because they be not engage in the struggle for life be more capable of this aesthetic self-forgetfulness than they will afterwards be and they need all of it that they can get so that they may remember it and prize it in later year in these heaven-sent moment they know what disinterestedness be they have a test by which they can value all future experience and know the dullness and staleness of worldly success therefore it be a sin to check more than need be they aesthetic delight -lrb- _ the ultimate belief _ -rrb- we can not all give to we child the experience we should like to supply but if we be clear that we be aim at enjoyment of nature and not at supply information we shall come nearer to what be desirable for year almost since it open in 1908 miss reed of the michaeli free kindergarten have take she child to the country it mean a great deal of work and responsibility it mean collect fund and give up one 's scanty leisure it mean devoted service but it have be do and it have be keep up even during war time though with great difficulty as to fund because of the inestimable benefit to the child miss stoke of the somer town nursery school secure a country holiday for she little one in various way partly through the child 's country holiday fund but since the war she have be unable to secure help of that kind and have manage to take the child away to a country cottage a paragraph in the report say : the child in the country have a delightful time and what be see and do during they holiday be still talk about continually these joy enter into all the work of the nursery school and help the child for month to retain a breath of the country in they london surroundings they realize much from that visit cow now have horn wasp have wing and fly -- alas they sting also hen sit on egg a almost unbelievable thing fish newt tadpole be all meet with and greet as friend child and helper alike return home full of health and vigor and longing for the next time one little maid weep bitterly and there seem no joy in life at home until she come across the school rabbit which be tenderly caress and console she with memory of the country and hope for future visit in the day when teacher argue about the difference between object-lesson and nature-lesson one point insist upon be that the nature-lesson far surpass the object-lesson because it deal with life we have learn now that we should as much as we can surround we child with life and growth even indoors it be easy to give the joy of grow seed and bulb and of open chestnut branch : without any cruelty we can let they enjoy watch snail and worm and we can keep caterpillar or silkworm and so let they drink they fill of the miracle of development but beauty come to child in very different way and always it be nature though it may not be life child revel in color color for its own sake and should be allow to create it in a modern novel there be a description of a mother do she wash in the open air and at she foot sit a baby intent upon the assimilation of a gingerbread elephant but now and then tug at she skirt and hold up a fat hand each time he be reward by a dab of soapsud which she deposit good-naturedly in he palm he receive it with solemn delight watch the roseate play of color as the bubble shrink and break and the lovely iridescent treasure vanish in a smear of dirty wetness while he look then he would beat he fist delightedly against he mother 's dress and presently demand another handful the follow note from another student 's report show how this may spring naturally out of the child 's life : -lrb- 23 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 23 : miss edith jone -rrb- we be spin the teetotum yesterday and it do not spin well so we make new one while the child be paint they top oliver grow very eager when he find he could fill in all the space in different color but betty make she color very insipid i want they to get the feeling of beautiful color so i shall show they a book with the color grade in it and we shall each have a paper and paint on it all the rich color we can think of the color will probably run into each other and so the child will get idea about the blending of color but i will watch to see that they do not get the color too wet if they be not tire of painting i want to show they a paint circle to turn on a string and they can make these for themselves use the color they have already use i want the child to do some group work and i think we might make a village with shop and house under the tree in the garden and have little man and woman to represent ourselves the suggestion will probably have to come from the teacher but the child will probably have the desire when it be suggest and i hope we shall be able to go on enlarge we town on the pattern of the town the child know if they want brick for they house they can dig clay in the garden _ report _ -- the child want to make a tea-set so we carry we clay outside they begin discuss why they china would not be so fine as the china at home and i say the clay might be different then bernard ask what sort of china we should get from the clay in the garden and i tell he that kind of clay be generally make into brick and suggest make brick from that we go on to the use of brick and to-morrow we be go to dig and make brick to build a town bernard be anxious to know how we shall make mortar just then it start to rain and bernard say that if the sun keep shine and it rain hard enough we should have a rainbow and he wish it would come so as to see the beautiful color i think this rather a coincidence and tell he i have a book with all the rainbow color in it they ask to see it so i show it and suggest paint the color ourselves those who have finish they dish start and we talk about the richness of the color one or two child start with very watery color so i show they the book and begin to paint myself they all enjoy it very much especially the different color make where the color run into each other the result please they and they be to be use as wall-papers to sell in we town but sybil want to have a toy shop and she be go to make a paint circle for it like the one i show this be clearly the time to show a glass prism and to let these child make rainbow for themselves to tell the story of iris and to use any color material milton bradley spectrum papers montessori silk color top and anything else so long as the child keep up they interest the interest in color need never die out it will probably show itself now in finer discrimination and more careful reproduction of the color of flower and leave and the sympathy give will heighten interest and increase enjoyment here be some note show child 's numerous activity in a suburban garden where they be allow to visit a hen and chicken _ Monday _ -lrb- 24 -rrb- -- to-day the child take up they mustard and cress dig and rake the ground ready for transplant the lettuce after they rest we go to see the chicken at the hall -lrb- the student ' hostel -rrb- and the hall garden seem to they a wonderful place they watch the train go in and out of the station at the foot of the garden and explore all the side door go up and down all the step and into the cycle shed they help miss s to stir the soot water then they go to the grassy bank and run down it slide down it and roll down it they peep over the wall into the next garden they peep through hole in the fence and finish up with a swing in the hammock each child have twenty swing and they enjoy count in time with the swaying of the hammock and sway they own body as they push -lrb- footnote 24 : these note be part of those already give on pp 68-71 -rrb- another example of love and rhythm be when they go to say good-bye to the hen and chicken and keep on repeat ` good-bye good-bye ' all together nod they head at the same time i do not know if i should have let they do so much but i be not sure that we should be allow to come back and i want they to enjoy the garden _ Wednesday _ -- first we water the lettuce we have transplant and transplant more then as we have permission to come again we take some of we lettuce to the chicken we see the mother hen with one wing spread right out and the child be much surprised to see how large it be we look at the rose and see how the bud of yesterday be full blow to-day the child again run down and roll down the bank and have turn in the hammock this time to the rhythm of margery daw sing twice through and then count up to twenty very often they go to watch the train cecil be particularly interested in they and want to know how long be the time between he say three minute i guess nine but we find they be irregular in the interval while wait for a train to pass we play a ` listen ' game listen to what sound we could hear a thrush come and sing right over we head so the listening be concentrate on he song and we try to say what we think he mean to say one child say ` he say come here come here ' but they find this too difficult we also watch a boy clean the station window and dorothy say ` miss beer be not it wonderful that you can see through glass ' i agree but make no other remark because i do not know what to say we rest outside to-day under a almond tree i point out how pretty the sky look when you only see it peeping through the leaf after rest the child notice feathery grass and spend the rest of the morning gather they i suggest that they should see how many kind they could find they find three but be not enthusiastic about it be content just to pluck but they be delight when they find specially long and beautiful grass hide deep under a leafy bush they also find clover leaf and i tell they its name and sing to they the verse from ` the bee ' with ` the sweet-smelling clover he hum hang over ' _ Thursday _ -- brush and dust the room give fresh water to the flower and then go to garden the child be delighted to find ladybird on the lettuce they be transplant and we also notice how the cherry be ripen they join the transition class for game later while play with the sand cecil make a discovery he say ` miss beer do you know i know what sand be it be little tiny tiny stone ' it may be worth while to notice some thing in these note first the pleasure in explore the new surroundings and then the variety of delight we landscape gardener mention that any slope to we grounds should be welcome for as we leave the level land and flee to the mountain to spend we vacation so will a child avoid the street and seek the gutter and the bank on the unimproved lot to enjoy its pastime we own child have be fortunate enough to have a bank for they play and though unfortunately extension of building have take away much of this we have have abundant opportunity to see the value of sloping ground then there be the discovery the feathery grass especially those which be hide the ladybird that sand be really tiny tiny stone -- have every adult notice that or be sand just sand -- and the wonder that we can see through glass a wonder realize by a little girl of four year old also we can notice what the child do not desire they like listen to the thrush but to make out what the thrush be say be beyond they they like gather feathery grass but to sort these into different kind give no pleasure though older child would have enjoy try to find many variety perhaps teacher with a fair amount of experience might have feel like the beginner who frankly say i do not say anything more because i do not know what to say when dorothy discover the wonderfulness of glass perhaps we be silent because the child have go ahead of we it be wonderful but we have never think about it in such case we must as froebel say become a learner with the child and humbly with real sympathy and earnestness ask be it wonderful i suppose it be but i never think about it why do _ you _ call it wonderful if the child answer it be well if not the teacher can go on think aloud think with the child let 's think what other thing we can see through we can never understand it we can only reach the fact of transparency as a wonderful property of certain substance and consider which possess this magic quality there be water of course and there be jelly or gelatine but these be not hard they be not stone as glass seem to be the child will be pleased too to see a crystal or a bit of mica but the main thing be that we should not imagine we have dispose of the wonder by a mere name with a glib oh that be just because it be transparent but that we realize and reinforce and deepen the child 's sense of wonderfulness so teacher and child enter into the thought of he who endlessly be teach above my spirit utmost reach what love can do in the leaf or stone so that to master this alone this do in the stone or leaf for I i must go on learn endlessly chapter x a way to god wonder chiefly at himself who can tell he what he be or how meet in human elf come and past eternity emerson it be of set purpose that this short chapter refer to what we specially call religion be place immediately after that on the child 's attitude to nature the actual word religion which to he express be bind do not appeal to froebel so much as one which express one-ness with god as a son can share the aspiration of he father so man a thought of god can aspire from earth 's level where blindly creep thing perfect more or less to the heaven 's height far and steep but we begin at earth 's level and a child 's religion must be largely a natural religion how to introduce a child to religion be a problem which must have many solution in froebel 's original training course he kindergarten teacher be to be train to the observation and care of the earliest germ of the religious instinct in man these earliest beginning he find in different source first come the relation between the child and the family begin with the mother fatherhood and motherhood must be realize before the child can reach up to the father of all then there be the atmosphere of the home the real reverence for higher thing if it exist affect even a little child more than be usually suppose but child be quick to distinguish reality from mere conventionality though the distinction be only half conscious reality impress while conventionality be apt to bear even to quite young child froebel 's ideal mother would begin to show god in nature some one put into the flower the scent and color that delight the child -- some one whom he can not see the sun moon and star give light and beauty and love be what they mean to show this mother teach she little one some sort of prayer and the gesture of reverence the fold hand affect the child even if the word mean little or nothing akin to the feeling of community between the child and he family be the join in religious worship in church the entrance in a common life and the emotional effect of the deep tone of the organ then there be the interdependence of the universe : the baby be to thank jenny for he bread and milk peter for mow the grass for the cow until you come to the last ring of all god 's father love for all next to this come the child 's service other work for he and he also must serve every age have its duty and duty be not burden and it be necessary that feeling should have expression for even a child 's love unfostered -lrb- by action in form of service -rrb- droop and die away there be also the desire for approbation the child must be rouse to good by inclination love and respect through the opinion of other about he and this should be guide until he learn to care chiefly for the approval of the god within right ideal must be provide : religion be a continually advance endeavor and its reward must not be a material reward we ought to lift and strengthen human nature but we degrade and weaken it when we seek to lead it to good conduct by a bait even if this bait beckon to a future world the consciousness of have live worthily should be we highest reward froebel go so far as to say that instead of teach the good will be happy and leave child to imagine that this mean a outer or material happiness we ought rather to teach that in seek the highest we may lose the lower renunciation the abandonment of the outer for the sake of secure the inner be the condition for attain highest development dogmatic religious instruction should rather show that whoever truly and earnestly seek the good must need expose himself to a life of outer oppression pain and want anxiety and care even a child though not a baby can be lead to see that to do good for outer reward be but enlighten selfishness these suggestion be take for the most part from the _ mother song _ some from _ the education of man _ each parent or teacher must use what seem to she or to he most valuable some may from the begin desire to teach the child a baby prayer or at least to let he hear god bless you other may prefer to wait for a more intelligent stage perhaps when the child begin to ask the invariable question -- who make the flower the animal who make I if so we must remember that child see and hear and think that often in thoughtless ejaculation or in those of heartfelt thankfulness child may hear the name of god that a simple story may have something that stir thought that church be much in evidence and that the conversation of little playfellow may take a unexpected turn to I it seem a great mistake to put before young child idea which be really beyond the conception of a adult there be many story tell of how child receive teach about the omniscience or omnipotence of god the story sound irreverent and be often repeat as highly amusing but they be really more pathetic miss shinn tell of one poor mite who resent be constantly watch and say i will not be so tag and another say then i think he be a very rude man when in reply to she puzzle question she be tell that god could see she even in she bath and the boy who say if i have do a thing could god make it that i have not must have make he instructor feel somewhat foolish it never do harm for we honestly to confess we own limitation and we ignorance and that be better than weak materialistic explanation which after all explain nothing to tell a child that the great father be always grieve when we be unkind or cowardly always ready to help we and to put kindness and bravery into we heart that we know he have power to do that if we will let he but that he power be beyond we understanding : to say that he be able to keep we in all danger and that even if we be kill we be safe in he keep surely that be enough he who bless the child utter strong word against he who cause the little one to stumble from every point from every object of nature and life there be a way to god the thing of nature form a more beautiful ladder between heaven and earth than that see by jacob it be deck with flower and angel with child 's eye beckon we toward it this be true but it do not mean that we be always to be try to make thing sacred but that we be to realize that all beauty and all knowledge and all sympathy be already sacred and that to love such thing be to love something whereby the creator make himself know to we that to enjoy they be to enjoy god religion be not always explain as imply the idea of be bind but sometimes as be set free from the bond of the lower or animal nature in this sense mr clutton brock may well call it a sacred experience for the child when he forget himself in the beauty of the world if we could all rise to a wider conception of the meaning of the word religion we should know that it come into all the work of the day that it do not depend alone upon that special scripture lesson which may become mere routine the greatest teacher of all teach by story and when any story deepen we feeling for human nature and we recognition of the height to which it can rise when it make we long for faith courage and love to go and do likewise who shall say that this be not religious teaching teaching which help to deliver we from the bond that hamper spiritual ascent many of we will feel with froebel that the fairy-tale with its slumbering premonition of be surround by that which be higher and more conscious than ourselves -lrb- 25 -rrb- have its place and a important place in religious development -lrb- footnote 25 : p 85 -rrb- the fairy sense say dr greville macdonald be innate as the religious sense itself the fairy story best beloved be those steep in meaning -- the unfathomable meaning of life such story teach -- even though no lesson be intend -- the wisdom of the book of job : wisdom that by this time surely should have make religious teaching saner and therefore more acceptable -lrb- 26 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 26 : the fairy-tale in education by greville macdonald md _ child life _ dec 1918 -rrb- fairy like angel may be god 's messenger a child who have hear of st cuthbert as a shepherd boy be carry home from the hillside when hurt by a man on a white horse repeat the story in she own word and he think it be a fairy of god 's send to help he there be however nothing the child love more than the bible story the story which show so simply humanity struggle as the child struggle fail as the child fail and believe and trust as the child believe and as we at least strive to do in the ultimate victory of right over wrong of good over evil but just because the story be often so beautiful and so inspiring the teacher should have freedom to deal with they as the spirit move she what experience have teach I in this way have already be pass on to younger teacher in _ education by life _ and there seem little more to add wonder chiefly at himself who can tell he what he be it be for we to tell the child what he be that he too like all the thing he love be a manifestation of god i be a be alive and conscious upon this earth a descendant of ancestor who rise by gradual process from lower form of animal life and with struggle and suffer become man -lrb- 27 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 27 : _ the substance of faith ally with science

lullaby not to mention they abundance in all country the very rocker on the cradle testify to the rhythmic nature of man in infancy in he _ mother song _ froebel couple rhythm with harmony of all kind not only musical harmony but harmony of proportion and color and in urge the very early training of the germ of all this he give perhaps the chief reason for training if these germ do not develop and take shape as independent formation in each individual they at least teach how to understand and to recognize those of other people this be life-gain enough it make one 's life richer richer by the life of other it be to the genius of m jacque dalcroze that the world of to-day owe some idea of what may be effect by rhythmic training and m dalcroze start he work with the same aim that froebel set before the mother that of make the child capable of appreciation capable of be make richer by the life of other but froebel prophesy that far more than appreciation would come from proper rhythmic training and this m dalcroze have amply prove through movement the mother try to lead the child to consciousness of he own life by regular rhythmic movement -- this be of special importance -- she bring this power within the child 's own conscious control when she dandle he in she arm in rhythmic movement and to rhythmic sound cautiously follow the slowly develop life in the child arouse it to greater activity and so develop it those who regard the child as empty who wish to fill he mind from without neglect the means of cultivation in word and tone which should lead to a sense of rhythm and obedience to law in all human expression but a early development of rhythmic movement would prove most wholesome and would remove much wilfulness impropriety and coarseness from he life movement and action and would secure for he harmony and moderation and later on a higher appreciation of nature music poetry and art _ -lrb- education of man _ -rrb- here then be a aim most plainly state higher appreciation of nature music poetry and art and if we adopt it we must make sure that we start on a road lead to that end to kindergarten child apart from movement rhythm come first in nursery rhyme and if we honestly follow the method of the mother we shall not teach these but say or sing they over and over again let the child select they favorite and join in when and where they like this be the true _ baby ' opera _ as walter crane justly name a illustrated collection froebel 's _ mother song _ though contain a deal of sound wisdom in its motto and explanation be a annotated expurgated and decidedly pedantic version of the nursery rhyme of he own country that these should ever have be introduce to we child arise from the fact that the first kindergarten teacher be foreigner do not know we own home-grown production long since we have shake off the foreign product in favor of we own sing a song of sixpence baa baa black sheep and they refreshingly cheerful compeer froebel 's book suggest song to suit all subject and all frame of mind -- the wind the moon and star the farm with its cow and sheep its hen and chicken the baker and carpenter fish in the brook and bird in nest the garden and the christmas fair we can supply good verse for all these if we take pain to search and if we eschew ignorant and unpoetic modern doggerel as we eschew poison besides the nursery rhyme we have stevenson with he wind shadow and swing christina rossettus 's wren and robin she rainbow verse and brownie brownie let down you milk white as swansdown smooth as silk there be many other and a recent charming addition to we stock be chimney and fairy by rise fyleman one thing we should not neglect and that be the child 's sense of humor for the very young this be probably satisfy by the cow that jump over the moon the dish that run after the spoon jill tumble after jack and miss muffet run away from the spider but older child much enjoy nonsense verse by lewi carroll or by lear and john gilpin be another favorite it be a mistake to keep strictly within the limit of a child 's understanding of the word what we want here as in the realm of nature be joy and delight the delight that come from musical word and rhythm as well as from the picture that may be call up even a child of four can enjoy the poetry of the psalm without ask for much understand the mother repeat she rhyme and verse solely to give pleasure and if we aim be the deepen of appreciation there be no reason for leave the green and grassy path that nature have show to the mother for the hard and beaten track of recitation in we own kindergarten there have never be either rote learning or recitation the older child learn the word of they song but not to a word-perfect stage because word and music suggest each other except for that we just enjoy we verse the child ask for they favorite and get new one sometimes by request sometimes not anything not enjoy be lay aside we need variety but everything must be good of its kind and verse about child be seldom for child because child love baby they love where do you come from baby dear but nothing like tennyson 's baby wait a little longer and especially nothing of the toddlekin type have any place in the collection of a self-respecting child it be doubtful if eugene field 's verse be really good enough for child all child enjoy singing but here as in everything we must keep pace with development or the older one especially the boy may get bore by what suit the less adventurous in all case the music should be good and tuneful model not on the modern drawing-room inanity but on the healthy and vigorous nursery rhyme or folk song child also enjoy instrumental music and will listen to piano or violin while quietly occupy for example if they be draw one nursery school teacher play soft music to get she baby to sleep and we little one fidget less if some one sing softly during they compulsory rest the kindergarten band be another way in which child can join in rhythm it come to we from miss bishop and be probably the music refer to in the description of the pestalozzi-froebel house the child be provide with drum cymbal tambourine and triangle and keep time to music play on the piano they can do some analysis in choose which instrument be most suitable to accompany different melody or change from grave to gay etc a full account be give in _ child life _ for may 1917 several year ago know nothing of m dalcroze miss marie salt begin a experiment the result of which be likely to be far-spreading and of great benefit desire to help child to appreciation of good music miss salt experiment deliberately with the froebelian learn through action and she success have be remarkable because of its freedom from any kind of formality this system be perhaps better suit to little child than the dalcroze work unless that be in the hand of a exceptionally gifted teacher m dalcroze himself be delightfully sympathetic with little one miss salt tell she own story in a appendix to mr stewart macpherson 's _ aural culture base on musical appreciation _ good music be play and the child listen and move freely in time to it sometimes march or dance in circle sometimes quite freely express whatever feel the music call forth in they the stress be lay on listen if you see a picture you reproduce it if the music make you think of tree or wind thunder or goblin you become what you think of it be astonishing to see how little child learn in this way to care for music by schumann mendelssohn grieg dvorák brahm chopin and beethoven the music be of course select with skill and care be take that the expression shall not make the child foolishly self-conscious emphasis be always place on listen and the child 's appreciation be apparent such appreciation must enrich they life chapter xii from fancy to fact creep ever on from fancy to the fact fairy tale suit little child because they knowledge be so limited that the fairy must have do it be regard as a satisfactory answer to early problem just as it satisfied childlike man thing that to we be wonderful child accept as commonplace while other commonplace to we be marvel to the child but fairy tale do not continue to satisfy all need as knowledge grow the child begin to distinguish between what may and what may not happen though there will always be individual difference and the more poetic soul be apt to suffer when the outrush of they imagination be check by a barb wire of fact the question be it true and the desire for true story arise in the average child of seven to eight year and at that age history story be enjoy real history be of course impossible to young child whose idea of time be still very vague and whose understanding of the motive and action of those immediately around they be but embryonic they still crave for adventure and romance and they thrill to deed of bravery bravery in the fight appeal to all boy and to most girl and it be a question for serious consideration how this admiration be to be guide it certainly can not be ignore it be legitimate to admire knight who ride about redress human wrong fight dragon and rescue fair lady from wicked giant and at this stage there be no need to draw a hard and fast line between history and legendary literature it be good to introduce child especially boy to some of the arthurian legend if only to impress the ideal live pure speak true right wrong else wherefore bear story should always help child to understand human being man and woman with desire and feeling like we own but in history and geography story we deal particularly with people who be different from ourselves and we should help child to understand and to sympathise with those whose surroundings and custom be not ours they may have live century ago or they may be live now but afar off they may be far from we in time or space but we story should show the reason for they custom and action and should tend to lessen the natural tendency to feel superior to those who have fewer advantage and gradually to substitute for that a sense of responsibility but the narration of story be not the only way in which we can treat history we present minister of education say that history teaching ought to give discipline in practical reasoning and help in form judgement not merely in remember fact indeed he go so far as to say eliminate date and fact by which of course he only mean that the power of reasoning the power of form judgement be of far more consequence than the mere possession of any quantity of fact and date training in reasoning however must involve training in verification of fact before pronounce judgement training in practical reasoning take a prominent place in that form of history teaching introduce by professor dewey accord to he history be worth nothing unless it be a indirect sociology a account of how human being have learn so far as the world have yet learn the lesson to co-operate with one another a study of the growth of society and what help and hinder so he find he beginning in primitive life and although there be much in this that will appeal to any age there be no doubt that child of seven to ten or eleven revel in this material if use at all it should be use as think material -- here be man without tool without knowledge everything must be think out it do not do much good to hand over the material as a story as some teacher use the dopp series of book these book do all the child 's think for they every set of child must work thing out for themselves use they own environment and they own advantage the teacher must read to be ready with help if the child fail and also to be ready with the actual problem it be astonishing how keen the child be and how often they suggest just what have really happen where there be space out-of-door and the child can find branch for hut clay for pot etc the work be much easier for the teacher and more satisfactory but even where that be impossible and where one have sometimes to be content with miniature reproduction the interest be most keen child under eight can not really produce fire from flint or rub stick nor can they make useable woollen thread with which to do much weave but even they can get spark from flint make a little thread from wool invent loom and weave enough to get the idea the romance of long ago ought to be take advantage of to deepen respect for the dignity of labor we life be so very short that we be apt to get out of perspective in the age read and write be so new -- it be only about four hundred year since the first book be print in england the roman occupation last as long and who think of that as a long period perhaps it be because we be in the reading and write age that we boy and girl must become braw braw clerk instead of live on and by the land history particularly primitive history should help we all to be grateful to those unknown pioneer of the human race to whose struggle and suffer discovery and energy we present favored mode of existence on the planet be due the more people realize the effort that have precede they and make they possible the more be they likely to endeavor to be worthy of it : the more pitiful also will they feel when they see individual fail in the struggle upward and fall back toward a brute condition and the more hopeful they will ultimately become for the brilliant future of a race which from such lowly and unpromising beginning have produce the material vehicle necessary for those great man who flourish in the recent period which we speak of as antiquity -lrb- 29 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 29 : _ the substance of faith _ p 18 -rrb- professor dewey urge that the industrial history of man be not a materialistic or merely utilitarian affair but a matter of intelligence a record of how man learn to think and also a ethical record the account of the condition which man have patiently work out to serve they end this interest in how human being have create themselves and they surroundings ought to be deeply interesting to any and every age young child can reach so little that one hope the interest arouse will be lasting and lead to fruitful work later but it certainly make a good foundation for the study of history and geography if history be treat as sociology and if geography be recognize as the study of man in he environment come now to practical detail in we own work we have follow fairly closely the suggestion make by professor dewey but everything must vary from year to year accord to the suggestion of the child or they apparent need one extra step we have find necessary and that be to spend some time over a desert island or robinson crusoe stage some child can do without it but all enjoy it and the duller child find it difficult to imagine a time when you could buy it in a shop do not fit all difficulty they can easily grasp the idea of sailing away to a land where no man have ever be before and play at desert island have always be a joy the starting-point for primitive life have be various sometimes the work have find its beginning in chance conversation as when a child ask be man animal and the class take to the suggestion that man mean think animal and begin to consider what he have think often after robinson crusoe there have be a direct question how do robinson crusoe know how to make he thing have any one teach he who make the thing he have see who make the very first and how do he know one answer invariably come god teach they which can be meet by say this be true but that god teach by put thing into the world and give man power to think this lead to a discussion about thing natural what god make and what man make which be sometimes illuminate on the limited conception of town child year ago we name primitive man the long-ago people and the title have seem to give satisfaction though once we have the suggestion of old-time man we always start with the need for food and the child suggest all the wild fruit they know often leave out nut till ask if there be anything that can be store for winter root be not always give but bud of tree be a frequent answer child in the country ought to explore and to dig and in we own playground we find at least wild barley blackberry of a sort cherry hard pear almond and cherry gum kill animal for food be suggest and the child have to be tell that the animal be fierce and to realize that in these time man be hunt not hunter little head be quite ready to tackle the problem of defense and attack they could throw stone use stick that the wind blow down pull up a young tree or a lot of people could hang on to a branch and get it down when one child suggest find a dead animal and use it for food some be disgusted but a little girl say i do not suppose they would mind they would not be very particular the idea of throw stone start the examination of different kind which have to be provide for the purpose flint be invariably select and for month the child keep bring lovely sharp flint but there be much careful observation observation which have a motive i would put a stone in a stick and chuck it at they be follow by much experiment at fix string be of course taboo but bass be allow because it grow also strip of skin we very often get the suggestion they might find a stone with a hole in it which lead to renew search and to the endeavor to make hole to make a hole in flint be beyond we but in a softer stone it can be do then may come the question of safety and tree-climbing and how to manage with the baby child generally know that tiny baby can hold very tight and have various idea for the mother how to keep the baby from fall bring the idea of twist in extra branch which be recognize as a cradle in the tree and the child delight in this as a meaning for rock-a-bye baby in the tree-top the possibility of tree-shelter come in and various experiment be make sometimes in miniature sometimes in the garden out of this come the discussion of clothes animal ' skin be a invariable suggestion though all child do not realize that what they call fur mean skin skin be provide and much time be take in experiment to see if it can be cut with bit of flint how could the long-ago people fasten on the skin bring the answer by thorn tie with narrow piece and the child be pleased to see that they own leather belt be strip or strap sometimes much time be take up in cut out skin to wear from paper or cheap calico the child work in pair one kneel down while the other fit on the calico to see where the head and leg come the skin be paint or chalk and picture be consult to see whether the choose animal be striped or spot it may be state here that we be not very rigid about period or climate and that we long-ago people be of a generalised type we business be not to supply correct information on anthropological question but to call forth think and originality to present opportunity for closer observation than be ever evoke by observation lesson and for experiment full of meaning and full of zest naturally we do not despise correct information but these child be very young and all this work be tentative we be never dogmatic it be all do you think they might have or well i know what i should have do i should have and the teacher 's reply be usually suppose we try child be apt of course to make startling remark but it be only the teacher who be startle by : be all this before god 's birthday i do not think god have learn to be very clever then it be a curious fact but orthodox opinion have only twice in the course of many year bring up adam and eve probably this be because we never talk about the first man but about how thing be discover the first time the question do come up miss payne be take the subject and she suggest that adam and eve be never in this country which dispose of difficulty so well that i give the same answer the only time i ever have to deal with the question when we come to the problem of fire we always use part of miss dopp 's story of _ the tree-dweller _ if the child be ask if they ever hear of fire that come by itself or of thing be burn by fire that no human being have anything to do with one or two be sure to suggest lightning they will tell that lightning sometimes set tree on fire that thunderstorm generally come after hot dry weather and that if lightning strike a tree with dry stuff about the fire would spread and the long-ago people would run away a question from the teacher as to what these people might think about it may bring the suggestion of a monster if not one only have to say that it must have seem as if it be eat the tree to get they would think it be a dreadful animal then the story can be tell of how the boy call bodo stop to look and see the monster grow smaller so he go closer feed it on wood and like to feel its warm breath after the heavy rain that follow thunder -- why have the monster grow smaller -- find that no animal would come near it and so on we never tell of the fire country though sometimes the child read the book for themselves a little later we have never succeed in make flame but it be thrill to get spark from flint once a child bring a old tinder box with steel and flint but even then we be not skilful enough to get up a flame still it be something to have try and we be leave with a respectful admiration for those who could so easily do without match what make these long-ago people think of use they fire to cook food we child have suggest that a bit of raw meat fall into the fire by accident and we have also work it out in this way we be pretend to warm ourselves by the fire and i say my frozen meat be so cold that it hurt my tooth hold it to the fire then we burn we finger and stick be suggest but we suck the burnt finger and i say it taste good and the child shout with glee because the meat 's roasted really then something be suppose to drop and the cry be gravy catch it in a shell dip you finger in and let you baby suck it a small shell be suggest and the boy who say and put a stick in for a handle be dub the spoon-maker at that time we be earn name for ourselves by suggestion we start with fair hair curly hair big tooth long leg and arrive at quick runner climber and even thinker we have get at pottery in a similar way the meat be suppose to be tough soak it come at once and could you get hot water then come suggestion : a stone saucepan scoop out a stone and put it on the fire build a stone pan and fix the stone with cherry gum dig a hole in the ground and put fire under _ that _ would be a kind of oven when ask if water would stay in the hole and if any kind of earth would hold water the answer may be no nothing but clay and you would have to make that no you get clay round a well my cousin have a well and there be clay round it why there be clay in the playground you could put the meat into a skin bag or a basket ask if the skin or basket could be set on the fire or if anything could be do to keep the basket from catch fire the answer come yes dab clay round it then joyfully it would hold water and you _ could _ boil what would happen to the clay when it be put on the fire this have to be discover by a quick experiment but the child readily guess that when the hot water be take off the fire there would be a sort of clay basin then they could make more and plate and cup experiment depend upon circumstance and upon the age of the child a thick and tiny basin put into a hot part of a ordinary fire do harden and hold water to a certain extent even without glaze but elaborate bake may also be do i have find it convenient to take weave as a bridge to history story by use sir frederick leighton 's picture of the phoenician bartering cloth for skin with the early briton the child be tell that the people dress in cloth come from near the bible-story country and those dress in skin be the long-ago people of this very country what would these people think of the cloth they would think it be animal ' skin and what would they do they would feel it and look at it so cloth be produce and we pull it to piece first into thread and then into hair and the child say the hair be like fur then sheep 's wool be produce and we try to make thread attempt at thread-making and then at weave last a long time and along with this come some history story probably arise out of the question how do people know about all this the child be tell about the writings of julius caesar and picture of roman ship and house be show beside picture of coracle and bee-hive dwelling etc old coin a flint battle-axe some roman pottery be also show along with description and picture of the roman villa at brade and other roman remain the child be thus help to realize that other country exist where the people be far ahead of those in this country and they can begin to understand how social condition vary and how nation act upon each other the work vary considerably from year to year accord to how it take hold upon the child 's interest but child of eight to nine be usually consider ready for broad idea of the world as a whole and the inquiry into where julius caesar come from and why he come give a fair start chapter xiii new need and new help i be old so old i can write a letter write and read have no place in the actual kindergarten much less arithmetic the story be tell to the child draw modelling and such-like will express all he want to express in any permanent form and speech as froebel say be the element in which he live he counting be of the simplest and the main thing be to see that he do not merely repeat a series while he handle material but that the series correspond with the object even this can be leave alone if it seem to annoy the little one in the school he be on a very different level he have attain to the abstract he can use sign : he can express thought which he could not draw and can communicate with those who be absent he can read any letter receive and he be no longer dependent on grown-up for story he can count he own money and can get correct change in small transaction and he can probably do a variety of sum which be of no use to he at all between these two come what froebel call the transition or connect class in which the child learn the meaning of the sign which stand for speech and those which make calculation less arduous for weak memory much have be write as to when and how child be to be teach to read some great authority would put it off till eight or even ten stanley hall say between six and eight while dr montessorus teach child of five and even of four froebel would have support stanley hall and would wait till the age of six the strongest reason for keep child back from book be a physiological one in the _ psychology and physiology of read _ -lrb- 30 -rrb- strong argument be adduce against early reading as very injurious to eyesight so it be surprising that dr montessorus begin so soon it have be say that she child only learn to write not to read but it be to be suppose that they can read what they write and therefore can read other material -lrb- footnote 30 : macmillan -rrb- if we agree not to begin until six year old the next question be the method the alphabetic whereby child be teach the letter name and then memorise the spelling of each single word have no supporter but controversy still go on as to whether child shall begin with word whole or with the phonic sound it be not a matter of vital importance for the child who begin with word come to phonics later and so far as english be concern the child who begin with phonics can not go far without meeting irregularity unless indeed they be limit to book like those of miss dale in other language which be phonic the difficulty be minimize child in the ordinary elementary school in italy though teach in large class can write long sentence to dictation in four or five month -lrb- 31 -rrb- but in italian each letter have its definite sound and every letter be sound it be true that these child appear to spend most of they time in formal work -lrb- footnote 31 : a class of child who begin in the middle of October write correctly to dictation on march 28 patrium e lavoro siamo miei cari bambini parole sante per voi amate la nostra cara e bella italia crescete onesti e laboriosi e sarete degni di lei -rrb- the froebelian who believe in learn by action will of course expect the child to make or write from the beginning as a method of learn whether she begin with word or with sound but in english unless simplify spelling be introduce the time must soon come when reproduction must lag behind recognition one child say with pathos one day may we spell as we like to-day for i have get such a lot to say the phonic method date back to about 1530 the variety use in the pestalozzi-froebel house be say to have originate with jacotot -lrb- 1780-1840 -rrb- it be call the observing-speaking-writing and reading method froebel 's own adaptation be simpler it be he principle to begin with a desire on the part of the child and he give he method in story form how lina learn to write and read lina be six she have leave the kindergarten and be presently to attend the primary school she notice with what pleasure she father perhaps a somewhat exceptional parent receive and answer letter she desire to write and she mother make she say she own name carefully notice first the open or vowel sound and then by note the position of she tongue she find the closed sound as she hear the sound she be show how to make it she father leave home at the right moment lina write to he receive and be able to read he answer print like she own in roman capital he send she a picture book and she be help to see how the letter resemble those she have learn and the reading be accomplish in england the phonic method best know be probably miss dale 's it be very ingenious the analysis be thorough and the book be prettily get up but to those who feel that read though a most valuable tool still be but a tool and one not need for child under seven the method seem over-elaborate much depend upon the teacher but to see fifty child sit still while one child place the letter in they place on the board suggest a great deal of lose time the system be also so rigidly phonic that it be a long time before a child can pick up a ordinary book with any profit stanley hall hold that it be best to combine method and probably most of we do this the grow agreement be he say that there be no one and only orthodox way of teaching and learn this greatest and hardest of all the art in which ear mouth eye and hand must each in turn train the other to automatic perfection in way hard and easy by device old and new mechanically and consciously actively and passively this be a great gain and seem now secure while a good pedagogic method be one of the most economic -- both of labor and of money -- of all invention we should never forget that the brightest child and indeed most child if teach individually or at home need but very few refinement of method idiot as mr seguin first show need and profit greatly by very elaborate method in learn how to walk feed and dress themselves which would only retard a normal child above all it should be bear in mind that the state use of any method do not preclude the incidental use of any and perhaps of _ all _ other a adaptation of phonic combine with the word method can be find in _ education by life _ it be simpler than miss dale 's and be combine with the word method child get much more quickly to real story stanley hall advocate the individual teaching of reading and since dr montessorus call every one 's attention to this we have use it much more freely and have find that once the child know some sound there be a great advantage in a certain amount of individual learning but class teaching have its own advantage and it seem best to have a combination long since we teach a boy who be mentally deficient and incapable of intelligent analysis by whole word and corresponding picture miss payne have develop this to a great extent it be practically a appeal to the interest in solve puzzle the child choose they own picture and be supply with envelope contain either single sound or whole word correspond with the picture they lay _ h _ on the house _ g _ on the girl _ p _ on the pond and later do the same with word they certainly enjoy it and no one be ever keep wait sometimes the puzzle be to set in order the word of a nursery rhyme which they already know sometimes it be to read and draw everything mention it be not only how child learn to read that be important : even more so be what they read much unintelligent reading in later life be due to the reading primer in which there be nothing to understand child should read book as adult do to get something out of they the time often waste in teaching reading too soon would be far better employ in cultivate a taste for good reading by tell or read to the child good story and verse -lrb- 32 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 32 : it be difficult to find easy material that be worth give to intelligent child and we have be glad to find brown 's _ young artist ' reader _ series a -rrb- a revolution be go on just now in the method of teaching write it be now generally recognize that much time and effort have be waste in teaching child to join letter which be easier to read unjoined a very interesting article appear in the fielden school demonstration record no ii and mr graily hewitt have bring the subject of write as it be do before copperplate be invent very much to the fore the child study society have publish a little monograph on the subject give the experience of different teacher and specimen of the write little marjorie fleming be a voracious reader with a remarkable capacity for write she spelling be unconventional at time but there be never any doubt about she meaning she express herself strongly on many subject and one of these be arithmetic i be now go to tell you the horrible and wretched plaege -lrb- plague -rrb- that my multiplication give I you cant conceive it the most devilish thing be 8 time 8 and 7 time 7 it be what nature itself cant endure yet if you speak with the tongue of man and angel and make not mention of arithmetic it profiteth you nothing say miss wiggin there be a few little child who be really fond of number work there be not many of they and they would probably learn more if they be leave to themselves there be even a few mathematical genius who hardly want teaching but who be worthy of be teach by a professor of mathematics always suppose that he be worthy of they but the majority of child would probably be farther advance at ten or twelve if they have no teaching till they be seven they ought to learn through actual number game through keep score for other game and through any kind of calculation that be need for construction or in real life there be but few true number game but domino and card game introduce the number group in old maid the child pair the group and so learn to recognize they in domino they use this knowledge while snap involve quick recognition any one can make up a game in which score be necessary ninepin or skittle be a number game and one can score by use number group or by fetch counter shell bead etc as reminder the number group be important they form what miss punnett call a scheme for those who have no great visualising power and they combine the smallest group into large one it ought to be remember that the repetition of a group be a easier thing to deal with than the combination of two group that be six be a name for two three and eight for two fours but five and seven have not so definite a meaning -lrb- 33 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 33 : this very morning a child cut out brown paper penny for a shop say ` look there be two six that _ would _ be a big number ' -rrb- the tillich brick be good plaything and so be cardboard money -- shilling sixpence threepence penny and halfpenny when the name have a mean the child will want sign ie figure clock figure -lrb- roman -rrb- can be use first as simplest show the closed finger and the thumb for v the only difficulty be ix the arabic figure can be make by draw round the number group or by lay out they shape in little stick 5 and 8 show very plainly how to arrange five and eight stick for two and three they be place horizontally the curve merely join the line in teaching child to count the decimal system should be keep well in mind and the teacher should see that thirteen means three-ten and that the child can touch the three and the ten as they speak the word eleven and twelve ought to be call oneteen and twoteen half in joke the idea of group should never be lose sight of and larger number should at first be name for so many three four fives etc in order to keep the meaning clear the child should say threety fourty and fivety but there should be no need to write these number the kindergarten stick tie in bundle of ten be quite convenient counting material when any counting be necessary tram ticket and cigarette picture can be use in the same way the decimal notation be a great thing to learn how great any one will discover who will take the trouble to work a simple addition sum involve hundred in roman figure child be always teach the number of the house they live in which make a starting-point if for instance 35 be compare with xxxv a meaning be give to the 3 many teacher make formal sum of number which could quite well be add without any write at all by use any kind of material by which ten can be make plain as a higher unit -- bundle of stick or ticket sonnenschein 's apparatus miss punnett 's number scheme or the new montessorus apparatus with its chain of bead : the material use be of no great consequence -- child should be able to deal as easily with ten as with one and there be no need for little formal sum which have no meaning everything in daily life should be use before formal work be attempt measure reckon weigh compare say rousseau child love to measure whether by lineal or liquid measure or by learn to tell the time or to use a pair of scale there be a few occasion when interest be in actual number relation as when a child for himself discover that two six be six two one boy on he own account compare a shilling and a hour and say that he could set out a shilling in five part by the clock he look at the clock and choose out a sixpence a threepence and 3 penny but usually what be abstract belong to a stage farther on so we can end where we begin by let froebel once more define the kindergarten crèches and infant school must be raise into kindergarten wherein the child be treat and train accord to he whole nature so that the claim of he body he heart and he head he active moral and intellectual power be all satisfied and develop not the training of the memory not learn by rote not familiarity with the appearance of thing but culture by means of action reality and life itself bring a blessing upon the individual and thereby a blessing upon the whole community since each one be he the highest or the humblest be a member of the community part ii the child in the state school i thing as they be chapter xiv certain characteristic of growth early in the nineteenth century two man move by very different impulse found what might be consider the beginning of the infant school for nearly fifty year they work grow separately but now they be merge together into something that seem to be permanent in a bleak lanarkshire factory village in the south of scotland robert owen millowner socialist and welshman find that unless he could provide for the education of the child of he factory hand no parent would consent to settle in the district and he would be without worker in he mill as a consequence owen find himself in the position of education authority privy purse and organiser and he do not flinch from the situation he impose no cheap makeshift because he believe in education as a end and not as a economic mean a twofold institution be therefore establish by he in 1816 one part for the child of recognize school age presumably over six and one for those under school age whose only entrance test be they ability to walk it be with the latter that we be concern the instruction give by owen to the man and the woman he choose for he infant school may serve to show he general aim the baby under they care be above all to be happy to lead a natural life outdoor or indoor as weather permit learn they surroundings play singing dancing not annoy with book not shadow by the need of the upper school but live the life they age demand in the light of the 1918 education bill this seem almost prophetic they guardian be select solely on the grounds of personality and expect to work in the spirit in which owen conceive the school they be gentle without personal ambition fond of child care only for they welfare but the sole guide principle be owen and this be at once the success and doom of the school for the personality of owen be thus make the pivot round which the school revolve without he there be nothing to take hold of very soon the experiment become know : person with the stamp of authority come to see it and even official heart be move by the reality of the child 's happiness and they consequent development the visitor feel rather than know that the thing be right arrangement be make to establish similar institution in london and after one or two experiment a permanent one be found which be under the control of a man name wilderspin wilderspin 's contribution to education be difficult to estimate certainly he never catch owen 's spirit or realize he simple purpose : he have ambition reach beyond the happiness of the child and far from try to make they education suit they stage of growth he seek to produce the infant prodigy just as a contemporary of he seek to produce the infant saint from what we can see he aim be what he honestly believe to be right as far as he light go but he seek for no light beyond he own and he outlook be not so narrow as he application be unintelligent owen be still in lanarkshire to be consult rousseau have already write _ émile _ pestalozzus 's work be by this time fairly well know in england the child be there to be study but wilderspin pursue he limited and unenlightened work until the infant school be almost a dead thing in he hand and in the hand of those who follow the following be birchenough 's account : the school be in charge of a master and a female assistant presumably he wife much attention be give to training child in good personal habit cleanliness tidiness punctuality etc and to moral training great stress be lay on information the curriculum include read write arithmetic geometry lesson on common object geography singing and religion and a effort be make to make the work interesting and ` concrete ' to this end much importance be attach to object-lesson to the use of illustration to question and exposition while the memory be aid by means of didactic verse the real teaching devolve upon the master and mistress this be of two kind : class teaching to a section of the child of approximately equal attainment either on the floor or in the class-room and collective teaching to the whole school regardless of age on the gallery it be a curious coincidence that in 1816 the year of owen 's experiment a humble educational experiment be begin by frederick froebel in a very small village in the heart of the thuringian forest like owen he aim be education solely for its own sake and he have a simple faith in the human goodness of the older germany but he come to education as a philosopher rather than a social reformer with a strong belief in its power to improve humanity this belief remain with he it be embody in he aim and leaven all he work the first twenty year of he experience convinced froebel that the neglect or mismanagement of the earliest year of a child 's life render useless all that be do later what come to owen as a inspiration grow in froebel to be a reason truth and like owen he put it into practice in 1837 the little kindergarten at blankenburg be begin with the village child as pupil the beautiful surroundings of forest-covered hill and green slope make a very different background from the bleak little lanarkshire village overshadow by the factory where owen 's school stand but the spirit be the same the child be in surroundings suitable for they growth and the very name of kindergarten do more to make froebel 's aim clear than any explanation he live to see other kindergarten establish in different part of thuringium and about the middle of the nineteenth century some of he teacher come to england and do similar work in london croydon and manchester the private kindergarten become a established thing and educationalist come to understand something of its meaning in 1870 the london school board suggest that the kindergarten system should be introduce into they infant school and in do so they be unconsciously the factor in bring together the work initiate by owen and by froebel the infant school of wilderspin already briefly describe be almost a dead thing with its gallery and its mechanical prodigy its object-lesson and its theology now it be breathe upon by the spirit of the man who say : play be the highest phase of child development of human development at this period : for it be the spontaneous representation of the inner from inner necessity and impulse play be the purest most spiritual activity of man the play of childhood be the germinal leaf of all later life if the child be injure at this period if the germinal leaf of the future tree of he life be mar at this time he will only with the greatest difficulty and the utmost effort grow into strong manhood it be perhaps not altogether to be wonder at that teacher at first seize the apparatus rather than the spirit of the kindergarten when we remember that we have not accept in anything like its fulness the teaching of froebel formalism and materialism always die slowly : play in the board school be interpret as something that have to be dictate and teach : the gift occupation and game be organise and appear on the time-table as subject side by side with wilderspin 's theology and object-lesson the combination must have be curious but even with its formalism the change be welcome to the child : at least they could use they hand and do something at least they could leave they back-breaking gallery and dance and skip even though the do and the dancing be accord to strict rule the change be not welcome to all teacher as late as 1907 a headmistress who be a product of the training of that time remark : we have kindergarten on Wednesday afternoon and then it be over for the week but there be teacher who see beneath the brick and stick and pretty movement who feel the spiritual side and keep themselves alive till greater opportunity come what be imperishable have remain the system of prescribe activity be nearly dead but the spirit of the true kindergarten be more alive than ever the change from the early ` eighty till now be difficult to describe because it be a growth of spirit a gradual change of value rather than a change in outward form there have be no definite throw off and no definite adoption of any one system or theory but the difference between the best infant school of 1880 and the best infant school of to-day be chiefly a difference in outlook the older school aim at copy a method while the school of to-day be more concern with realize the spirit at present we be try to reconstruct education for the new world after the war and so it be convenient to regard the intervene period of nearly half a century as a transition period : during that time the education of the child under eight have change much more than the education of older child at least in the elementary school and there have be certain marked phase that though apparently insignificant in themselves have mark stage of progress in think perhaps the most significant and most important of these be the effect of the child-study movement on the formal and external side of kindergarten work it be first of all to america that we owe this to the pioneer stanley hall and more especially here to mr earl barne very slowly but surely it be evident to the more enlighten teacher that child have they own way of learning and do and the adult-imposed system mean work against nature for the logical method of present material from the simple to the complex from the know to the unknown from the concrete to the abstract be substitute the psychological method of watch the child 's way of learning and develop teacher find that what they consider to be the simple be not the simple to child what they take to be the know be the unfamiliar to child for instance the simple in geography in the adult sense be the definition of a island with which most of we begin that study and in geometry it be the point to child of the ordinary type both be far-away idea and not related to everyday experience the know in arithmetic for example be to teacher the previous lesson quite regardless of the fact that arithmetic enter into many problem of life outside school the life in school and the life outside school be in these early day of infant teaching two separate thing and only occasionally do a teacher stoop to take a example from everyday life a little girl in one of the poorest school bring she baby to show she teacher and proudly display the baby 's power of speech -- say a pint of ` alf-an - ` alf for teacher say the little girl to the baby by way of encouragement to both this be the kind of rude awakening teacher get from time to time when they realize how much of the real child elude they psychology have make it clear that life be a unity and must be so regarded part of this child-study movement have result in the slow but sure death of formalism : large class material result and a lack of psychology make formalism the path of least resistance painting become blob constructive work be interpret as course of paper folding cut tear book of these course be publish with minute direction for a graduate sequence the aim be obedient imitation on the part of the child and the imagine virtue accrue to he in consequence be good habit patience accuracy and technical skill self-expression and creativeness be still only theory a second interesting phase of the transition period be the method adopt for the training of the sens from the day of comenius till now the importance of this have hold its place firmly but the means have greatly change pestalozzus 's object-lesson be adopt by wilderspin and thoroughly sterilise many teacher still remember the lesson on the orange leather camphor paper sugar in which the teacher 's sens be train for only she come in contact with the object and the child from they gallery answer question on a object remote from most of they sens and only dimly visible to they eye similar lesson be give after 1870 on froebel 's gift ii in which the ball cylinder and cube be treat in the same manner : progress be slow but sometimes the child follow nature 's prompting and play with they specimen this be follow by book of gift-play where organise play take the place of organised observation about 1890 or thereabout the nature study movement sweep over the school and nature specimen then become the material for sense training : as far as possible each child have a specimen and by the minute examination of these stimulate they sens and stifle they appreciation of all that be beautiful question and answer still dominate the activity the poor little withered snowdrop take the place of the dead camphor or leather but underlie all the paralyse organization the truth be slowly grow and the child be be bring nearer to real thing a third phase in this transition period be that know as correlation most teacher remember the elaborate program of work that drive they to extreme in find connection the following take from a reputable book of the time will exemplify the principle : a week 's program object lesson the horse phonetic the foal _ oa _ sound number problem on the work of horse story the bell of atrus -lrb- story of a horse ring a bell -rrb- song busy blacksmith -lrb- shoe a horse -rrb- game the blacksmith 's shop reading on the horse poetry kindness to animal paper cut the bell of atrus paper folding a trough free-arm draw a horseshoe clay model a carrot for the horse brushwork a turnip for the horse brown paper draw a stable underneath it all the truth be grow namely the need of make association and so unifying the child 's line but the process of find the truth be slow and cumbersome a fourth phase of the early infant school be the strong belief of both teacher and inspector in uniformity of work and of result it be difficult to disentangle this from the paralysing influence of payment by result and large class : it be probably the teacher ' unconscious expression of the instinct of self-preservation when work against the heaviest odds but it be constantly evident to the teacher that any attempt on a child 's part to be a individual either in work or in conduct have to be arrest : and the theory of individual development be regard as so utopian that the idea itself be lose goodness be synonymous with uniform obedience and silence naughtiness with individuality spontaneity and desire to investigate a frequently-heard admonition on the part of the teacher be teacher do not tell you to do it that way -- that be a naughty way but such a attitude of mind be doubtless generate by the report of the inspector when he commend a class by say : the work of the class show a satisfactory uniformity to obtain uniform result practice have to come before actual performance and many weary hour be spend over drill in read drill in number drill in handwork drill in needlework the extreme point be reach when baby of three have thimble and needle drill long before they begin needlework there be also conduct drill miss grant of devon road school remember a school where the baby practice they conduct before the visit of the spectre as they call he he be represent as a stick set up on a chair there be a curious symbolism in the whole occasion it be difficult to see the good underlie this phase but it be there there be undoubtedly a place for practice though not before performance and uniformity be undoubtedly the germ of a ideal all these phase stand for both progress and arrest the average person be readier to accept method than investigate principle but we must recognize that all struggle and searching after truth have make the road of progress shorter for we by many a mile perhaps the chief cause of stumbling lay in the fact that there be no clearly realize aim or policy except that of material result there be many fine-sounding principle in the air but they be unrelated to each other and the condition of teaching be likely to crush the finest endeavor and to make impossible a teaching that could be call educative chapter xv the infant school of to-day take neither the best nor the worst but the average school of to-day it will be profitable to review shortly where it stand to consider how far it have learn the lesson of experience and what kind of ideal it have set before itself in externals there have be many improvement modern building be better in many way there be more space and light and the surroundings be more attractive most of the gallery have disappear but the furniture consist chiefly of dual desk fix and heavy so that the arrangement of the room can not be change the impression give to a visitor be that it be plan for listen and answer except in the baby room where there be generally light table and chair and consequently no monotonous row of child unless a teacher arrange they thus from sheer habit in each room be a high narrow cupboard about one quarter of the necessary size for all that education demand most education authority provide some good picture but the best be usually hang on the class-room wall behind the child and all be above the child 's eye level oh teacher my neck do ache be the only appreciative remark make by a child after a tour make of the school picture which be really beautiful as a rule the window be too high for the child to see from and the lower part be generally frost in a new school which have a view up one of the loveliest valley in great britain the window be of this description the head of the school explain that it be a precaution in case the child might see what be outside in other word they might make the mistake of see a real river valley instead of listen to a description of it in country school of the older type the accommodation be not so good but the newer one be often very attractive in appearance and have both space and light the school garden be a common feature in the country and it be to be regret so few even of the plot description be to be find in town school of late year the apparatus have improve though there be still much to be do in this direction instead of the original tiny box of gift we have frequently real nursery brick of a larger and more varied character and many other nursery toy one of the best sign of a progressive policy be that large number of _ little _ toy have take the place of the big expensive one that only a occasional child could use it be a pity that the use of toy come to so sudden a end and that learn by this method do not follow the baby after they have officially cease to be baby as be the custom in real life one of the most striking change for the better be the evidence of care of the child 's health of which some of the external sign be doctor nurse and care committee a sense of responsibility in this respect be gradually grow in the school a fair number provide for sleep a few try to train the child to eat lunch slowly and carefully and some try to arrange for milk or cod-liver oil in the case of very delicate child though these instance be very much in the minority they represent a change of spirit this be one of the striking characteristic of the new education bill a legacy from the old formalism lie in the fact that every room have a highly organised time-table except perhaps in the baby ' room where the child 's actual need be sometimes consider first the morning in most class be occupy with scripture reading arithmetic write and some less formal work such as nature lesson or recitation some form of physical exercise be always take the afternoon be mostly devote to game story handwork and singing : this order be not universal but the general principle hold of take the more difficult and formal subject in the morning in the baby ' room some preparation for reading be still too frequent the lesson be short and the order vary but in one single morning or afternoon there be a bewildering number of change some year ago the unfortunate principle be lay down in the code that fifteen minute be sufficient time for a lesson in a infant school and though this be not strictly follow the lesson be short and numerous give a unsettled character to the work child appear to be swing at a moment 's notice from topic to topic without a apparent link or reason : for example the day 's work may begin with the story of a little boy send by train to the country settle at a farm and take out to see the _ cow _ and the _ sow _ : soon this be find to be a reading lesson on word end in ow but after a short time the whole class be tell quite suddenly that one shilling be to be spend at a shop in town and while they be still interested in calculate the change paint be distribute and the child be paint the bluebell the whole day be apt to be of this broken character which certainly do not make for training in mental concentration or for a realisation of the unity of life some teacher still aim at correlation but in a rather half-hearted way : other have entirely discard it because of its strained application but nothing very definite have take its place the curriculum which have be give be vary in character and sometimes include a free period except in the baby ' class the three r 's occupy a prominent place and child under six spend relatively a great deal of time in formal subject while child between six and seven if they be still in the infant school be teach to put down sum on paper which they could nearly always calculate without such help as soon as a child can read well and work a fair number of sum on paper he be consider fit for promotion and the question of whether he understand the method of work such sum be not consider so important as accuracy and quickness the test of so-called intelligence for promotion be read and number but it be really the test of convenience so that large number of child may be teach together and bring against the law of nature to a uniform standard this poison of the promotion and uniformity test work down through the infant school : it can be see when the baby be divert from they natural activity to learn reading or when they be examine : it can be see when a teacher yield up she bright child to fill a few empty desk it can be see in the grind at reading and formal arithmetic of the child under six when weary and useless hour be spend in work against nature and precious time be waste that will never come back yet we _ say _ we believe that child have they youth that they may play and that play be the purest most spiritual activity of man at this stage -lrb- childhood -rrb- the lack of any clear aim show itself in the fluid nature of the term result to some teacher it signify readiness for promotion or a piece of work that present a satisfactory external appearance such as good write neat handwork a orderly game fluent reading to other it mean something deeper which they discover in some chance remark of a child 's that mark the growth of the spirit or the awakening of the interest of a child whose development be late or the quicken power of a child to express or evidence of independent thought and the power to use it in some piece of handwork or appreciation of music or literature accord to the meaning attach to the term result so the method of the teacher must vary but one get the general impression that in this respect matter be in a transitional state the first kind of teacher be always a little uncertain of she ground and a little fearful that she be not quite up-to-date while the second class of teacher be sometimes a little timid and not quite sure that she be prepare to account for the rather subtle and intangible outcome of she work the same transitional character hold in the case of discipline : while what be know as military discipline still prevail in many school there be a very fair number with whom the grip have relax but it be a courageous teacher that will admit the term free discipline which have nearly as bad a reputation as free thought use to have and few be prepare to go all the way probably the reason lie in the vagueness of the meaning of the term and the fact that its value be not clearly realize because it be not clearly understand teacher have not face the question squarely : what be i aim at in promote free discipline take a general view of the present school one get the impression of a constant change of activity on the part of the child but very little change of position a good deal of provision for general class interest but little for individual interest of less demand than formerly for uniformity of result but the existence of a good deal of uniformity of method arrest the teacher 's own initiative of very constant teaching on the part of the teacher and a good deal of listen and oral expression on the part of the child of many lesson and little independent individual work below all this there be evident a very friendly relationship between the teacher and the child a good deal of personal knowledge of the child on the part of the teacher and a good deal of affection on both side there be less fear and more love than in the earlier day less government and more training less restraint and more freedom and the child be greatly attach to they school from consideration of the foregoing summary it will be see that education in the infant school be a thing of curious patch of strength and weakness of light and shade perhaps the greatest weakness be its lack of cohesion of unification : on the one hand we find much provision for the child 's real need much singleness of purpose in the teacher 's work such a genuine spirit of whole-hearted desire for they education : on the other hand a unreasoning sense of haste of push on of introduce prematurely work for which the child admittedly be unready a acceptance of new thing on popular report without scientific basis and a lack of courage to maintain the truth for its own sake in the face of so-called authority and a craving to be modern at the root of all this inconsistency and possibly its cause be the lack of a guide policy or aim the lack of belief in the scientific or psychological basis of education and consequently the want of that strong belief in absolute truth which help the teacher to pass all barrier chapter xvi some vital principle if it be true that the infant school of to-day suffer from lack of a clear basis for its general policy it will be profitable to have clearly before we such principle as great educator have find to be most vital to the education of young child we all believe that we have a aim and a high aim before we : it have be variously express by past educationalist but in the main they all agree that the aim of education be conduct in actual practice however we act too often as if we only care for economic value if we be to live up to we educational profession we must look we aim in the face and honestly practice what we believe while training of character and conduct be the accept aim for education in general to make this useful and practical each teacher must fix she attention on how this ultimate aim affect she own special part of the whole work by watch the free child she will discover how best she can help he : he know he own business and when unfettered by advice or command show plainly that he be chiefly concern with _ gain experience _ he find himself in what be to he a new and complex world of people and thing actual experience be the foundation for complete living and the stronger the foundation the better the result of later building _ the first vital principle then be that the teacher of young child must provide life in miniature that be she must provide abundant raw material and opportunity for experience _ the next question be that of the best method of gain this actual experience the child be unaware that he be lay foundation he be only vaguely conscious that he find great pleasure in certain activity and that something impel he in certain direction he realize no definite future he be content with the present he can not work for a purpose other than the pleasure of the moment without this stimulus concentration be impossible in the activity of this stage he probably assimilate more actual matter than at any other period of he life and it be the same with he acquirement of skill in happy unconsciousness he gain knowledge of he own body and of its power of the external world of he mother tongue and of he relation to other people : he make mistake and commit fault but these do not necessarily cripple or incriminate he he be not consider a social outcast because he once kick or bit or because he throw he milk over the table he learn to balance and adjust he muscle on a seesaw when a fall on soft grass be a matter of little importance and this be better than wait till he be compel hastily to cross a river on a narrow plank it be all a kind of joyous rehearsal of life which we call play we can force a child to passivity to formal repetition of second-hand knowledge to the acquisition of that for which he have no apparent need but we can never _ educate _ he by these thing child do not play because they be young they have they youth that they may play as surely as they have they leg that they may walk _ the second principle be therefore that the method of gain experience lie through play and that by this road we can best reach work _ the third principle be the nature of the experience that a child seek to gain -- the life he desire to live how can we he sure that the surroundings we provide and the activity we encourage be in accord with child 's need let we imagine a child of about five to six year of age one of a family living in a small house to which a garden be attach inside he have the run of the house but keep he own toy picture book and collection of treasure we will suppose that not be at school he be free to arrange he own day sometimes alone and sometimes with other child or with he parent what do he do he be interested in inanimate thing especially in use they and so he play with he toy he build brick run engine solve simple puzzle picture ask to work with he father 's gardening tool or he mother 's cooking utensil he be interested in the life of the garden in the grow thing in the snail or spider he find in the cat dog or rabbit of the family he want to dig water and feed these various thing but he decline regular responsibility he interest be in spurt he be interested in sound both in those he can produce and in those produce by other : soon he be interested in music he will listen to it for considerable period and may join in it : at first more especially on the rhythmical side so too he like the rhythm of poetry and the melody sound of word he be interested in make thing on a wet day he will ask for scissors and paste or bring out he paint box or chalk on a fine day he mix sand or mud with water or build a shelter with pole and shawl at any time when he have a opportunity he shut himself into the bathroom and experiment with the tap sail boat color water blow bubble try to mix thing wet and dry he be interested in the doings of other people in they conduct and in he own he be more interested in they badness than in they goodness : tell I more of the bad thing you child do say a little boy to he teacher aunt and the request be significant and general we learn so little by mere uncontrasted goodness he be interested in the word that clothe narration and in they style he be impatient of a change in form of a accept piece of prose or poetry he be hungry for the sound of tell word and phrase he be interested in reproduce the doings of other people so that he may experience they more fully and this involve minute observation careful and intelligent imitation and vivid imagination he own word for it be pretence there be other thing that he grasp at more vaguely and later he be dimly aware that people have live before and he be less dimly aware that people live in place different from he own surroundings he realize that some of the story such as the fairy story be true in one sense a sense that respond to something within himself that some be true in another more material and external sense one concern with thing that really happen he hear of black man and of ship that carry people across the sea and of thing that come back in those ship he be interested in the immaterial world suggest by the mystery of wood and garden he have a dim conception that there be some life beyond the visible he feel a power behind life and he reveal this in he early question he be keenly interested in question of birth and death and sometimes come into close contact with they he feel that other wonder must be account for -- the snow thunder and lightning the color of summer the changeful sea at first the world of fairy lore may satisfy he later come the life of the undying spirit but the two be continuous he may attend religious observance and these may help or they may hinder he be keenly interested in game whether they be game of physical skill of mental skill or game of pretence here most especially he come into contact with other people and here he realize some of the experience of social life such be the most usual side of life seek by the ordinary child and on such must we base the surroundings we provide for we child in school and the aspect of life to which we introduce they commonly call subject of the curriculum _ we third principle be therefore evident : we find in the child 's spontaneous choice the nature of the surroundings and of the activity that he crave for in other word he make he own curriculum and select he own subject matter _ the next consideration be the atmosphere in which a child can best develop character by means of these experience a young child be a stranger in a unknown untried country : he have many strange prompting that seek for satisfaction he have strong emotion arise from he instinct he feel crudely and fiercely and he must act without delay as a result of these emotion he be like a tourist in a new strange country fresh and eager and with a similar holiday spirit of adventure : the stimulation of the new arouse a desire to interpret to investigate and to ask question : it arouse strong emotion to like or dislike to fear to be curious it lead to certain mode of conduct as a result of these emotion picture such a young tourist buttonhole by a blasé guide who have forget what first impression mean who insist on accompany he wherever he go regulate he procedure by tell he just what should be observe and how to do so pour out information so premature as to be obnoxious correct he taste subdue he enthusiasm and modify even he behavior the tourist would presumably pay off the unwelcome guide but the child can not pay off the teacher : they can and do rebel but docility and adaptability seem to play a large part in self-preservation for the young child freedom must precede docility because the only reasonable and profitable docility be one that come after initiative and experiment have be satisfied and when the child feel that he need help the world that the free child choose represent every side of life that he be ready to assimilate and he freedom must be intellectual emotional and moral freedom in the school with the rigidly organise time-table where the remark of the child provoke the constantly repeat reproach : we be not talk of that just now where the apparatus be formal and the method of use it prescribe where home life and street life be ignore where there be neither garden nor picture book where childish question be pass over or hastily answer where the room be full of desk and the normal attitude be sit where the teacher be teach more often than the child be do there be no intellectual freedom where passion and excitement be instantly arrest where appreciation for strong color fierce punishment loud noise be kill where fear be ridicule where primitive likes and dislike be interpret as coarseness there be no emotional freedom a child must have these experience if he be to come to he own later : this be not the time to stamp out but only to deflect and guide otherwise he become a weak and pale reflection of he elder with little resource or enthusiasm where it be almost impossible to be openly naughty where there be no opportunity for choice or for make mistake where control be all from the teacher and self-control have no place there be no moral freedom the school be not for the righteous but for the so-called sinner who be only a child learning self-control by experience self-control be a habit gain through habit a child must acquire the habit of arrest desire of hold the physical side in check the habit of reflection of choice and most of all the habit of either act or hold back as a result of all this if in the earliest year he will be in the hand of other and he have the habit of obedience to the exclusion of all other habit then he development as a self-reliant individual be arrest and may be permanently weaken there be no other way to learn life and build up a ideal from the raw material he have gain in other way in the rehearsal of life at school he can do this without serious harm but every time a mode of conduct be impose upon he when he might have choose every time he be externally control when he might have control himself every time he be balk in make a mistake that would have be experience to he he will be proportionally less fit to choose to exercise self-control to learn by experience and these be the chief lesson at this impressionable period _ the fourth principle therefore be that the atmosphere of freedom be the only atmosphere in which a child can gain experience that will help to develop character and control conduct _ these four vital principle will be apply to practical work in the follow chapter ii practical application of vital principle before apply these principle it be necessary for practical consideration to set out clearly the various stage of this period during the first eight year of life development be very rapid and not always relatively continuous sometimes it take leap and sometimes appear for a time to be quiescent but roughly the first stage of a child 's develop life end when he can walk eat more or less ordinary food and be independent of he mother at this point the nursery school stage begin : the child be learn for himself he world by experience and through play he choose he raw material in a atmosphere of freedom when the period of play pure and simple begin to grow into a desire to do thing better to learn and practice for a more remote end -- in other word when the child begin to be willing to be teach the transitional period from play to work begin it can never be say to end but the relative amount of play to work gradually define the life of the school : and so the transitional period merge into the school period thus we be concerned first with the nursery school period which correspond to what froebel mean by he kindergarten and owen by he infant school secondly with the transitional period which have be far too long neglect or rush over and which roughly correspond to the standard i of the elementary school and thirdly we have the beginning of the junior school where work be the predominant factor in spite of shakespeare 's assertion there be much in a name and if these name be definitely adopt teacher would realize better the nature of they business the follow chapter seek to apply practically the four vital principle to these period of a child 's life but in many case the transition class and the junior school be consider together chapter xvii the need for experience the first vital principle be that the teacher of young child must provide for they life in miniature ie she must provide abundant raw material and opportunity for acquire experience the practical translation of this in the word of the teacher of to-day be i must choose furniture and requisition apparatus the teacher of to-morrow will say to she child i will bring the world into the school for you to learn the local education authority of to-day say we must build a school for instruction the local education authority of to-morrow will say we must make a miniature world for we child the world of the nursery school child probably require the most careful thought in this respect : a large room with sunlight and air low clear window a door lead to a garden and playground low cupboard full of toy low-hung picture light chair and table that can be push into a corner stretcher bed equally disposable a dresser with pretty utensil for food these be the chief requirement for satisfy physical need apparent in the actual room physical habit will be consider later under another head outside in the playground there should be opportunity for physical development for its own sake : swing giant stride ladder lay flat slightly slope plank and a seesaw should all be available for constant use if the child be not warn or give constant advice about they own safety there be little fear of accident thus the purely physical side of the child be provide for the side that they be if healthy quite unconscious of what else do experience demand at this stage roughly classify the raw experience of this stage may be divide into the experience of the natural world of live thing the world of inanimate thing and the social world for the natural world there should be the garden outside with its tree grass and flower bed with its dovecot and rabbit hutch and possibly a cat sun herself on its path inside there will be plant and flower to care for the element especially water earth and air be very dear to a young child and it be quite possible to satisfy he craving with a large sand-heap of _ dry _ and _ wet _ sand a large flat bath for sailing boat and test the theory of sink and float a bin of clay a pair of bellows and several fan to set the air in motion there be always the fire to gaze at on the right side of the fire-guard and appreciation of the beauty of this element should be encourage the world of inanimate thing include most of the toy that stimulate activity and give idea the chief that should be find in the cupboard round the wall or scatter about the room be brick of all size and shape skittle ball and bat or racket hoop rein spade and other garden tool pail and patty pan for the sand-heap pipe for bubble shell fir-cones button acorn and any collection of small article for handle all kind of vehicle that can be push such as cart barrow pram engine drum and other musical instrument material for construction and expression such as chalk board paint and paper for experience of the social world which be not very real at this individualistic period come the doll and doll 's house horse and stable tea-things cooking utensil noah 's ark scale for a shop boat soldier and fort : a very important item in this connection be the collection of picture-book : they must be choose with the greatest care and only picture of such merit as those of caldecott leslie brooke and jessie wilcox smith should be select picture form one of the richest source of experience at this stage as indeed at any stage of life and truth beauty and suggestiveness must be they chief factor the toy should be above all thing durable and if possible washable broken and dirty toy make immoral child besides the material surroundings there be opportunity the seize of which give valuable experience these belong to the social world and lie chiefly in the training in life 's social observance and the development of good habit this side of life be one of the most important in the nursery school and need material help the lavatory and cloakroom should be construct so that there be every chance for a child to become self-reliant and fastidious the cloakroom should be provide with low peg boot hole clothes brush and shoe brush : there should be low basin with hot and cold water enamel mug and tooth brush _ for each child _ nail brush plenty of towel and where the district need it bath the type provide by the middlesex education authority at greenford avenue school hanwell give a shower bath to a whole group of child at once thus make a more frequent bath possible perhaps for very small child of the nursery school age separate bath be more suitable this be a question for future experience on the part of teacher there should be plenty of time for the child to learn to wash and dress themselves in the school-room there should either be tablecloth or the table should be capable of be scrub by the child after each meal they almost inevitable lack of manners at table give a invaluable opportunity for training and again in such a case there should be no question of haste the meal should be lay wait on and clear away and the dish wash by the child themselves and they should be responsible for the general tidiness of the room this involve tea-cloth mop duster wash bowl brush and dustpan in the transition class and junior school the furniture and apparatus can be to a great extent very much the same they difference lie chiefly in degree it be a pity to bring the age of toy to a abrupt conclusion in real life the older child still borrow the toy of the younger one while there be some definitely they own : such be jigsaw and other puzzle domino article for dramatic representation play card toy for game of physical skill such as top kite skip rope etc such prepared constructive material as meccano -- and a great mass of raw material for construction generally term waste there should be a series of box or shelf where such waste product of the home or of the wood or of the seashore or of the shop might be store in some classified order : the collective instinct be stronger than the more civilised habit of orderliness : here be a opportunity for develop a habit from a instinct there should also be material for expression such as clay paper chalk pencil paint weave material cardboard and scenery material and such tool as scissors cardboard knife needlework tool paste brush and other that may be necessary and suitable the room should be large and suitable for much move about : the most usual condition should be a scatter class and not a seat listen class this mean light chair and table or bench where handwork can be do low cupboard and locker so that each child can get at he own thing broad window-sill for plant and flower and a bookcase for reading and picture book here again good picture-book be as essential as even more essential than reader in the transition class they will be a little more advanced than in the nursery school and will be of the type of the pied piper illustrate or picture of child of other land and time some of rackham 's of harold copping 's of the publication by black in _ peep at many land _ be suitable for this stage reader should be choose for they literary value from the recognize child 's classic such as the peter rabbit type _ alice in wonderland water-baby _ and not make up for the sake of reading practice the picture on the wall should be hang at the right eye-level and the window low enough for look at the outside world -- whatever it may be the teacher 's desk should be in a corner not in the central part of the room for she must remember that the child be still in the main seek experience not listen to the experience of another they should have access to the garden and playground and all the incitement to activity should be there -- similar to those of the nursery school or those provide by the london county council in park the bare wilderness of playground now so familiar where there be neither time nor opportunity for child to be other than primitive savage do not represent the outside world of beauty and of adventure the lower class of junior school should differ very little in they miniature world life be still activity to the child of eight and consequently should contain no immovable furniture there will be more book and the child may be in they seat for longer period the atmosphere of guide but still spontaneous work be more definite but the aim in choice of both furniture and apparatus be still the gain of experience of life by direct contact in the main such be the requisition sheet to be present to the store superintendent of the local education authority in the future with a explanatory note state that in a general way what be actually require be the world in miniature chapter xviii gain experience by play the second principle be that the method of gain experience lie through play and that by this road we can best reach work play be mark off from work chiefly by the absence of any outside pressure and pleasure in the activity be the characteristic of play pure and simple : if a child have force upon he a hint of any ulterior motive that may be in the mind of he teacher the pleasure be spoil for he and the intrinsic value of the play be lose in bring child into school during they play period probably the most important formative period of they life and in utilise they play consciously we be interfere with one of they most precious possession when they be still too helpless to resent it directly too many of we make play a means of conceal the wholesome but unwelcome morsel of information in jam and we try to force it on the child prematurely and surreptitiously but nature generally defeat we the only sound thing to do be to _ play the game _ for all it be worth and recognize that in do so education will look after itself to understand the nature of play and to have the courage to follow it be the business of every teacher of young child the nursery school especially if it consist chiefly of child under five present at first very hard problem to the teacher however strong she belief in play may be it receive severe test so much of the play at first seem to be aimless running and shout or throw about of toy and break they if possible so much quarrelling and fighting and weep seem involve with any attempt at social life on the part of the child there seem very little desire to co-operate and very little desire to construct as a rule a child roam from one thing to another with apparently only a fleeting attempt to play with it yet on the other hand to make the problem more baffle a child will spend a whole morning at one thing : quite lately one child announce that he mean to play with water all day and he do another never leave the sand-heap and apparently repeat the same kind of activity during a complete morning visitor say in a rather disappointed tone they just play all the time by themselves one teacher bring out a attractive picture and when a group of child gather round it she proceed to tell the story they listen politely for a few minute and then the group gradually melt away they be not ready for concentrated effort if those child have be in the ordinary baby room of a school they would have be quite docile sit in they place apparently listen to the story amiably use they brick or other material accord to the teacher 's direction but they would not in the real sense have be play this be a example of the need for both principle and courage it be into this chaotic method of gain experience that the teacher come with she interpretive power -- she see in it the beginning of all the big thing of life -- and like a bigger child she join and like a bigger child she improve she see in the apparent chaos a attempt to get experience of the different aspect of life in the apparently aimless activity a attempt to realize and develop the bodily power in the fighting and quarrel a attempt to establish a place in social life it be all unconscious on the part of a child but a necessary phase of real development gradually the little primitive man begin to yield to civilisation he be interested in thing for longer and ask for story music and rhyme and what do this mean as he develop a child learn much about life in he care of the garden about language in he game about human conduct from story but he do these thing because he want to do they and because there be a play need behind it all which for he be a life need in order to build a straight wall he must classify he brick in order to be a real shopman he must know he weight in order to be a good workman he must measure he paper all the idea gain from these thing come to he _ along with sense activity _ they be associate with the need and interest of daily life and because of this he put into the activity all the effort of which he be capable or as dewey have express it the maximum of consciousness into the experience which be he play this be real sense training differ in this respect from the training give by the montessorus material which have no appeal to life interest aim at exercise the sens separately and discourage _ play _ with the apparatus it be activity without a body practice without a end and nothing develop from it of a constructive or expressive nature in the nursery class therefore we curriculum be life we apparatus all that a child 's world include and we method the one of joyful investigation by means of which idea and skill be be acquire the teacher be player in chief ready to suggest co-operate supply information lead or follow as circumstance demand : responsibility must still belong to the child for while most of they know quite naturally how to play there be many who will never get beyond a rather narrow limit through lack of experience or of initiative it be quite safe to let experience take its chance through play but there be certain thing that must be deal with quite definitely when the teacher be not there as a playmate but as something more in the capacity of a mother it be impossible to train all the habit necessary at this time through the spontaneous play although incidentally many will be greatly help and make significant by it if the child come from poor home where speech be imperfect probably mere imitation of the teacher which be the chief factor in ordinary language training will be insufficient it will be necessary to invent way chiefly game by which the vocal organ may be use this may be consider play but it be more artificial and less spontaneous than the informal activity already describe it be well to be clear as to the kind of exercise best suit to make the vocal organ supple and then to make these the basis of a game : for example little child constantly imitate the cry of ordinary life town child could dramatise a railway station where the sound produce by engine and by porter give a valuable training they could imitate street cry the sound of the wind of motor hooter siren or of church bell country child could use the sound of the farm-yard the bird or the wind in the recognition of sound which be as necessary as its production such a guess game could be teach as i send my son to be a grocer and the first thing he sell begin with _ s _ and end with _ p _ use the _ sound _ not name of the letter for the acquisition of a vocabulary such a game as the family coach might be play and turn into many other vehicle or object about which many story could be tell all the time the game must be play with the same fidelity to the spirit of play as previously but the introduction must be recognize as more artificial and forced and this can be justified because so many child be not normal with regard to speech and only where this be the case should language training be force upon they habit of courtesy of behavior at table of position of dress and undress of wash hand and brushing tooth and many other must all be _ teach _ but teach at the time when the need come occasion will certainly occur during play but the chance of repetition be not sufficient to count on thus we summarise the chief business of the nursery school teacher when we say that it be concerned chiefly with habit and play and right surroundings play in the transition class be less informal after the age of six certain ambition grow and must be satisfy the aspect of life be more separated and concentration on individual one be commoner this mean more separation into subject and thus a child be more willing to be organise and to have he day to _ some _ extent arrange for he while in the nursery class only what be absolutely necessary be fix in the transition class it be convenient to fix rather more for the sake of establish certain regular habit and because it be necessary to give the freshest hour to the work that require most concentration we must remember however that it _ be _ a transition class and not set up a completely fashion time-table for the whole day reading and arithmetic must be acquire both as knowledge and skill the mother tongue require definite practice there must be a time for physical activity and live thing must not be attend to spasmodically therefore it seem best that these thing be take in the morning hour while the afternoon be still a time for free choice of activity the follow be a plan for the transition class show the bridge between absolute freedom and a fully organise time-table -- morning afternoon Monday | nature | reading | story from | organise game and | work | and number | scripture or other | handwork --------- | care | ----------- | literature and | ----------------------- Tuesday | of the | reading | story of social | music and handwork | room | and number | life music and | --------- | nature | ----------- | singing industrial | ----------------------- Wednesday | chart | reading | activity such as |

grant this arrangement we must be clear how play as a method can still hold it do not hold in the informal incidental sense of the nursery school : there be period in the transition class when the child know that they be work for a definite purpose which be not direct play -- as in reading and there be time when they be dissatisfy with they performance of skill and ask to be show a better way and voluntarily practice to secure the end as in handwork arithmetic and some kind of physical game the remainder be probably still pursue for its own sake how then can this play spirit be maintain side by side with work first of all the child should not be require to do anything without have behind it a purpose that appeal to they it may not be the ultimate purpose of they good but a secondary reason may be give to which they will respond readily generally the pretence reason arithmetic to the ordinary person be a thing of real life we count chiefly in connection with money with make thing with distribute thing or with arrange thing and we count carefully when we keep score in game in adult life we seldom or never count or perform arithmetical operation for sheer pleasure in the activity but there be many child who do so in the same spirit as we play patience or chess and all this be we basis the arithmetical activity in the transition class should therefore be base on such everyday experience as have be mention else there will be no association make between the experience of school and those of life outside the two must merge there be no such thing as arithmetic pure and simple for child unless they seek it they must play at real life and the real life that they be now capable of appreciate skill in calculation accuracy and quickness can be acquire by a kind of practice that child be quite ready for if it come when they realize the need most child feel that they power to score for game be often too slow and inaccurate as store clerk they be uncertain in they calculation they will be willing to practice quick addition subtraction multiplication and division in pure arithmetical form if the pretence purpose be clearly in view which to they be a real purpose the same thing occur in write which should be consider a side issue of read meaningless word or sentence be write wearily and without pain but to write the name of a picture you have paint at the bottom of it or to write something that cinderellum 's godmother say or bit by bit to write a letter will be have a purpose that give life to a apparently meaningless act and thoroughness to the effort in handwork too at this stage practice take a important place : a child be willing to hem to try certain brush stroke to cut evenly and later on to use he cardboard knife to effect for the sake of a future result if he have already experiment freely this be in full harmony with the spirit of play when we think of the practice stroke and throw of the later game but it be a more advanced quality of play because there be the beginning of a purpose which be separate from immediate pleasure in the activity there be the hint of a end in view though it be a child 's end and not the adult or economic one the training of the mother tongue can be make very effective by means of game : in the day when child 's party be simple and family life be unite language game in the long dark evening give to many a grip of word and expression child learn to describe accurately to be very fastidious in choice of word to ask direct question to give verbal form to think all through the stress of such game -- man and he shadow clump subject and object russian scandal the minister 's cat i see a light charade and act of all kind no number of picture talk oral composition or observation can compete in real value with these game because behind they be a purpose or need for language that compel the greatest effort physical development and its adjustment to mental control owe its greatest stimulus to game when physical strength speed or nimble adjustability be the pivot upon which the game depend special muscle be make subservient to will : behind the game there be the stimulus of strong emotion and here be the greatest factor in establish permanent association between body and mind psychologist see in many of these game of physical activity the evolution of the race : drill pure and simple have its place partly in the same sense as practice in number or handwork and partly as a corrective to we fallacious system of education by listen instead of by activity : and we can not in a lifetime acquire the power of the race except by concentrated practice but no amount of drill can give the all-round experience necessary for physical readiness for a emergency physical and mental power to endure active co-operation where self-control hold in check ambitious personal impulse : and no drill seem to give grace and beauty of motion that the natural activity of dancing can give it be through the game that british child inherit and by means of which they have unconsciously rehearse many of the situation of life that they have be able to take they place readily in the life of the nation and even to help to save it again as in other direction child must be make to play the game in its thoroughness for a well-played game give the right balance to the activity : drill be more specialised and have specialisation for its end : a game call on the whole of a individual : he must be alert mentally and physically and at the same time the sense of fairness can not be too strongly insist on no game can be tolerate as part of education where there be looseness in this direction from the skittle of the nursery class to the cricket and hockey of the seventh standard and nothing will so entirely outrage the child 's feeling as a teacher 's careless arbitration in physical game too the social side be strongly develop : leadership self-effacement and co-operation be more valuable lesson of experience than fluent reading or neat writing or accurate addition : but they have not count as such in we economic system of education they have take they chance : few inspector ask to see whether child know how to play the game and yet they be so soon to play the independent game of life but the individual output of reading and sum of a sneak and cowardly or assertive and selfish child be as good probably as that of a child that have the makings of a hero in he and then we wonder at the propensity of the lower class it be because we have never make sure that they can play the game to summarise : play in the nursery school stage be unorganised informal and pursue with no motive but pleasure in the activity itself it be mainly individual play in the transition class be more definitely in the form of game _ ie _ organise play effort of skill mental or physical it become social play in the junior school be almost a occasional method because the work motive be by this time get stronger chapter xix the unity of experience we find in the child 's spontaneous choice the nature of the surroundings and of the activity he crave for in other word he make he own curriculum and select he own subject matter the next problem we have to solve be how to unify the bewildering variety of idea and activity that a child seek contact with during a day we find that the curriculum of the infant school of to-day present a rather confusing variety of idea not necessarily arrange as the child would have choose they would certainly not have choose to break off some intense interest because a arbitrary timetable hurry they to something else and they would have be right if we ask the child they reason for choose we would find no clue except that they choose what they want to neither could they tell we why they spend so much more time over one thing than another if a similar study be to be make of a child from a slum also free to arrange he day we should find that while certain general feature be the same other would be different : he would ask for different story probably play different game or the same game in a different way he back-yard would present different aspect the thing he make would be different it be evident that the old correlation method have little or nothing to do with the matter a child may or may not draw the rabbit he feed he certainly do not play a rabbit game because of the rabbit he have feed nor do he build a rabbit-hutch with he brick he might try to make a real one if the rabbit really need it but that arise out of a obvious necessity if he could put he unconscious prompting into word he would say he do the thing because he want to because somebody else do they or because of something he see yesterday and so on but he would always refer back to _ himself _ the central link in each case be in the child with he special store of experience derive from he own particular surroundings he bring to new experience he store of present experience he interest not always satisfied he power variously use he interpret the new by these and seek for more in the line of the old it be life he have experience and he seek for more life how then can we secure for he that the new experience present to he in school will be in line with the old we will take three typical case of child to illustrate the real nature of this problem the first be the case of a child living in a very poor district of london or of any large town the school be presumably situate in a narrow street run off the high street of the district the street where all the shopping be do at the corner be a hide factory with a evil smell most of the dwelling-house abut on the pavement some with a very small yard behind some without any several family live in one house and often one room be all a family can afford as that have to be pay for in advance the family address may change frequently the father may be a dock labourer with uncertain pay a coster a rag and bone merchant or he may follow some unskilled occupation of a similarly precarious nature in consequence the mother have frequently to do daily work the home be lock up till evening and she often leave before the child start for morning school it be a curious but very common fact that free though these child be they know only a very small radius around they own home they be accustom to be send shopping into high street where household store be buy in pennyworth or twopennyworth owe to uncertain finance and no storage accommodation generally there be one tap and one sink in the basement for the need of all the family in the house there be usually a park somewhere within reach but it may be a mile away in it would at least be tree a pond grass flower but a excursion there unless it be undertake by the school can only be hope for on a fine bank holiday there be neither time nor money to go on a Saturday and Sunday can not be say to begin till dinner-time about 3 pm when the public-house close and the father come home to dinner it be difficult to imagine the conversation of such a household family life exist only on Sunday at dinner-time the child 's background of family life be a room which be at once a bedroom living room and laundry there be nearly always some part of a meal on the table and some wash hang up outside there be the dingy street the crowded shop the pavement to play on and both outside and in the bleaker and more sordid aspect of life sometimes miserable sometimes exciting on Saturday night the light be brilliant and life be at least intense bed be a very crowded affair in which many half-undressed child sleep cover with the remainder of the day 's wardrobe what store of experience do a child from such a neighborhood bring to school to be assimilate with the new experience provide there what do such term as home dinner bed bath birth death country mean to he they mean _ something _ -lrb- 34 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 34 : see _ child life _ October 1916 -rrb- not a mile away we may come to a very respectable suburb of the average type and what be say of it may apply in some degree to a provincial or country town or at least the application can easily be make the school probably stand at the top corner of a road of house rent at # 25 to # 35 per annum with garden in front and behind the road generally run into a main road with shop and traffic here and there in the residential road be little oasis of shop patronise by the neighborhood and some of the child may live over these the home life be more ordinary and need less descriptive detail but there be some feature that must be consider the decency not to say refinement of eat sleeping and wash be take for grant : there be often a bath-room and always a kitchen the father 's occupation may be local but a good many father will go to town there be generally a family holiday to the sea or less often to the country in the house the degree of refinement vary there be nearly always picture of a sort book of a sort and the child be supply with toy of a sort they visit each other 's house and the observance of social life be keep variously often the horizon be very narrow the mother 's interest be very local and timid the father 's business life may be absolutely apart from he home life and never mention there the family conversation while quite amiable and agreeable may be round very few topic and the vocabulary while quite respectable may be most limited child 's question may be put aside as either trivial or unsuitable in one sense the slum child may be say to have a broader background the reality of life be bare to he on they most sordid side there be neither mystery nor beauty around life or death or the natural affection the suburban child may on the contrary be balk and restrict so that unnecessary mystery give a unwholesome interest to these thing and conventionality a dishonest reserve a suburb of this type be describe by beresford in _ housemate _ : -- in such district -lrb- as gospel oak -rrb- i be depress by the flatness of a awful monotony the slum vex I far less there i find adventure and jest whatever the squalor the mark of the primitive struggle through dirt and darkness towards release those horrible line of moody complacent street represent not struggle but the achievement of a worthless aspiration the house with they deadly similarity they smug false exterior they conformity to a ideal which be typify by they poor imitative decoration could only be inhabit by people who have no thought or desire for expression the dweller in such district be cramp into the vice of they environment they home represent the dull concession to a state rule and they life take tone from the gray smoke-grimed repetition of one endlessly repeat design the same foolish ornamentation on every house reiterate the same suggestion they place of worship the blank chapel and pseudo-gothic church rear themselves head and shoulder above the dull level only to repeat the same threat of obedience to a gloomy law the thought of gospel oak and its like be the thought of imitation of imitation fall back and become stereotyped until the meaning of the thing so persistently copy have be lose and forget a third case be that of the country child the child who attend the village school many village lie several mile from a railway station so that the younger child may not see a railway train more than once or twice a year the father may be engage in village trade such as a shoemaker carpenter gardener general shop merchant farm labourer or farmer the village house be often cramped and small but there be wholesome space outside and generally a good garden which supply some of the family food milk and egg be easily obtainable and condition of living be seldom as crowd as in a town the country child see more of life in complete miniature than the slum or the suburban child can do for the whole life of the village lie before he the school be generally in the center with a good playground and of late year a good school garden be frequent the village church generally old be another center of life and there be at least the vicarage to give a type of life under different social condition the home intellectual background may vary but on the whole can not be reckon on very much though in some way it be more narrow than the suburban one it be often less superficial in a different way from the slum child but none the less definitely the country child come face to face with the reality of life in a more natural and desirable way than either of the other it be difficult to estimate some of the effect of live in the midst of real nature on child unconsciously they acquire much deep knowledge impossible to learn through nature study however good a kind of knowledge that be part of they be but how far it affect they emotionally or enter into they scheme of life be hard to say as they grow up much of it be merely economic acquirement : if they be to work on the land or rear cattle or drive a van through the country it be all to the good but one thing be noticeable that they take very quickly to such allurement of town life as a cinema or a picture paper or gramophone and this point to unsatisfied craving of some sort not necessarily so unworthy or superficial as the means seek to satisfy they from these rather extreme case we get near the solution of the problem it be quite evident that each of these child bring to school very different contribution of experience on which to build though they general need and interest be similar therefore the curriculum of the school will depend on the general surroundings and circumstance of the child and all program of work and many question of organization will be build on this the model program so dear to some teacher must be banish as a doctor would banish a general prescription no honest teacher can allow this part of she work to be do for she by any one else therefore the central point be the child 's previous experience and on this the experience provide by school _ ie _ curriculum and subject matter depend one or two example of the work out of this might make the application clearer probably the reality of life in relation to money differ greatly the kind of problem present to the poor town child will deal with shopping in pennyworth or ounce with get coal in pound bagful clothes be generally second-hand and so ordinary standard price be out of the question bread be buy stale and therefore cheaper early in the morning preserved milk only be buy and that in halfpenny quantity only problem base on these will be real to this child at first the suburban child 's economic experience may be base on he pocket-money money in the bank and the normal shopping of ordinary life the country child be frequently very ignorant of money value probably it will be necessary to take the country general shop as the basis he could also begin to estimate the produce of the school garden the nursery school program it be quite obvious from the nature of play at this stage that a time-table be out of the question and in fact a outrage against nature only for social convenience and for the establishment of certain physical habit can there be fix hour there must be approximate limit as to the time of arrival and departure but nothing of the nature of mark register to record exact minute little child sometimes sleep late or on the other hand the mother may have to leave home very early all this must be allow for there should be fix time for meal and for sleep and these should be rigidly observe and there should be regular time for the child to go to the lavatory all these establish regularity and self-control as well as improve general health but anything in the nature of story period game period handwork period only impede the variously develop child in they hunger for experience they curriculum be life as the teacher have spread it out before they there be no subject at this stage the various aspect ought to be of the nature of a glorious feast to these young child traherne say in the seventeenth century : -- will you see the infancy of this sublime and celestial greatness those pure and virgin apprehension i have in my infancy and that divine light wherewith i be bear be the best unto this day wherein i can see the universe verily they form the greatest gift he wisdom can bestow for without they all other gift have be dead and vain they be unattainable by book and therefore will i teach they by experience certainly adam in paradise have not more sweet and curious apprehension of the world than i when i be a child all appear new and strange at first inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful i be a little stranger which at my entrance into the world be salute and surround with innumerable joy i know by intuition those thing which since my apostasy i collect again by the highest reason all thing be spotless and pure and glorious yea and infinitely mine and joyful and precious i saw in all the peace of eden be it not that a infant should be heir of the whole world and see those mystery which the book of the learn never unfold the corn be orient and immortal wheat which never should be reap nor be ever sow i think it stand from everlasting to everlasting the dust and stone of the street be as precious as gold : the gate be at first the end of the world the green tree when i see they first through one of the gate transport and ravish I : the sky be mine and so be the sun and moon and star and all the world be mine : and i the only spectator and enjoyer of it so that with much ado i be corrupt and make to learn the dirty device of this world which i now unlearn and become as it be a little child again that i may enter into the kingdom of heaven if this be what life mean to the young child and traherne only record what many of we have forget there be little need for interference : we can only spread the feast and stand aside to watch for opportunity the following extract be give from a teacher 's note-book : it show how many possibility open out to a teacher and how impossible it be to keep to a time-table or even to try to name the activity the child concern be about five year old newly admit to a poor school in se london the record be select from a continuous period and do not apply to one day : -- plan for the day what actually happen _ number occupation _ -- this will the child play freely be entirely free and the child chalk most of the time those will choose they own toy and thread bead be most put they away interested again i notice the lack of idea of color i find one new boy place he stick accord to color without know the name of the color the boy think the soldier belong to they and laugh at a little girl for choose they _ language training _ -- i have i realize this be a failure discover that they love to for i ask the child to use imitate sound so we will play they board and chalk for a at this they could draw a cat definite drawing and they should and say miauw and a duck and have have the time to use they say quack they could also freely and discover they use i imitate the wind get very little information about they vocabulary _ language training _ -lrb- _ another i find that many child day _ -rrb- -- i shall try to induce the pronounced word so strangely child to speak to I about they that i could only with difficulty home in order to discover any recognize they one say she difficulty of pronunciation and have a bresser with clate to make they more fluent on it and kny other speak of manckle firebrace fort one child speaking of curly hair call it killeyer we have no time for the story _ play with toy _ -- the noah 's ark doll and brick child will choose they own toy be use and i find that the and as far as possible i will put girl who have no doll at home a child who know how to use they be delighted to be able to dress next to one who desire to sit and undress they and put they still to bed one little girl walk backwards and forwards before the class get she doll to sleep the boy be make a noise with they ark and she remark on this so we induce they to be silent while the doll be put to sleep the boy arrange they animal in long line the brick be much more carefully put away to-day the transition and the junior school program even after the nursery school period much of the curriculum and subject matter be in the hand of the child themselves though the relative proportion will vary accord to the child 's experience it be pretty evident to the honest-minded teacher that the subject be in school term nature work and elementary science mathematics constructive and expressive work literature music language physical exercise and religion the business of the younger child be with real thing and activity not with symbol and passivity therefore he be not really in need of read write or arithmetic we hear argument from ambitious teacher that child be fond of read lesson because they enjoy the fantasy in which these lesson be wrap or the effort make by the teacher to create interest we hear that child ask to be teach to read they also ask to be teach to drive a tram or to cook a dinner but it be all part of the pretence game of play at be grow up they do not need to read while story and poetry can be tell or read to they they be not ready to make the effort of work for a remote economic end where there be no real pleasure in the activity and no opportunity of put they power to use no child under six want to sit down and read and it would be very harmful if he do he business be with real thing and with he vocabulary which be not nearly ready to put into symbol yet if reading be delay hour of weary drudgery will be save and energy store for more precious attainment therefore in the transition class -lrb- _ ie _ child over six at lowest -rrb- the only addition to the curriculum already set out for the nursery class would be arithmetic and reading include write the other difference would be in degree only in the junior class -lrb- with child over seven at lowest -rrb- a desire to know something of the doings of people in other country to hear about other part of we own land will lead to the beginning of geography while with this less imaginative and more literal period come the request for story that be more verbally true and question about origin lead to the beginning of history it be very much easier to give the general curriculum than to deal with the choice of actual material because that be involve largely with the principle of the unity of experience and as we know experience vary the normal town and country child and the abnormal child of poverty have all certain human craving in common and these be provide for in the aspect of life or subject that have be name -- but this be far too general a application to be the end of the matter each subject have many side to offer there may be for example the pottery town the weave town the country town the fishing town the colliery town : in the country there be the district of the dairy farmer of the sheep farmer of the grain grower and miller of the fruit farmer of the hop grower and many district may partake of more than one characteristic perhaps the most curious anomaly of experience be that of the child of the london slum who go hop into some of the loveliest part of kent in early autumn and so in a general way at least the concentrated experience of school must fill gap and supply experience that life have not provide for one of the pottery town in staffordshire be build on very unfertile clay there be several pottery in the town belch out smoke and in addition row of monotonous smoke-blackened house almost always a yellow pall of smoke hang over the whole district and even where the edge of the country might begin the grass and tree be poor and blacken and distant view be see through a haze there be almost no garden in the town and very little attempt have be make to beautify it because the result be so disappointing beauty therefore in various form must be a large part of the curriculum : already design be a common interest in the pottery museum of the district and this could be make a motive for the older child but in the junior and nursery school picture of natural beauty wild flower if it be possible to get they music painting and drawing and literature should bulk largely enough to make a permanent impression on the child in a very remote country village where life seem to go slowly and day be long child should be encourage by means of the school influence to make thing that absorb think and interest to tell and hear story storytelling in the evening round the fire be a habit of the past and might well supply some of the craving that have to be satisfy by the picture most of we have to keep ourselves well in hand when we listen to a recitation in much the same way as when a slate pencil use to creak it would be very much better if the art of storytelling be cultivate at school encourage at home and apply to entertainment indeed the entertainment of a village school instead of be the unnatural and feverish production of hour of overtime might well be the ordinary outcome of work both at school and at home -- and thus a motive for leisure be naturally supply and probably a hobby initiate it be profitable sometimes to group the subject of experience in order to preserve balance all get of experience be active but some kind more obviously than other undoubtedly in hear story and poetry in watch a snail or a bee in listen to music the activity be mental rather than physical and assimilation of idea be more direct in discover experience by means of construction expression experiment or imitation assimilation be less direct but often more permanent and secure froebel discriminate between impression and expression or take in and give out and although he constantly emphasise that the child take in by give it be convenient to recognize this distinction another helpful grouping be the more objective one some subject refer more particularly to human conduct the enlargement of experience of human being and the building up of the ideal : these be literature music history and geography other refer to life other than that of human being commonly know as nature study and science other to the property of inanimate thing and to question throughout all life of measurement size and force -- this be know as mathematics other of the life behind the material and the spiritual world -- this be know as religion chapter xx gain experience through freedom the atmosphere of freedom be the only atmosphere in which a child can gain experience that will help to develop character the principle of freedom underlie all the activity of the school and do not refer to conduct simply intellectual and emotional aspect of discipline be too often ignore and we have as a product the commonplace narrow imitative person too timid or too indolent to think a new thought or to feel strongly enough to stand for a cause self-control be the goal of discipline but independent thinking enthusiasm and initiative be all include in the term it will be well to discriminate between the occasion both in the nursery school and in the transition and junior class when a child should be free to learn by experience and when he should be control from without we shall probably find occasion which partake of the nature of each the nursery school be a collection of individual presumably from 2-1\/2 to 5-1\/2 year of age they know no social life beyond the family life and family experience be relative to the size of the family in any case they have not yet measure themselves against they peer with the exception of the occasional twin a few month ago about twenty child of this description form the nucleus of a new nursery school where as far as possible the world in miniature be spread out before they and they be guide in they entrance to it by a experienced teacher and a young helper for the first few week the chief characteristic be noise the child rush up and down the large room shout and push any portable toy they could find one little boy of 2-1\/2 employ himself in what can only be call punch the other child snatch they possession away from they and respond to the teacher by the law of contra-suggestion he be the most intelligent child in the school he generally leave a line of weep child behind he and several begin to imitate he the pugnacious instinct require little encouragement lunch be a period of snatch spilling and make plan to get the best many of the toy provide be carelessly trample upon and break : request to put away thing at the end of the day be almost unavailing when the time for sleep come in the afternoon many of the child refuse to lie down : some consent but only to sing and talk as they lay only one a child of 2-1\/2 sleep because he cry himself to sleep from sheer strangeness this apparently unbeautiful picture be only the first battle of the individual on he entrance to the life of the community on the other hand there be interval of keen joy : water sand and clay chiefly absorb the younger child : the older one want to wash up and scrub and many spend a good deal of time look at picture-book this be the raw material for the teacher to begin with : the child come from comfortable suburban home : none be really poor and many have know no privation they be keen for experience and dispose to be very friendly to she after five month there be a marked difference in spirit the noise be modify because the child find other absorb interest though at time nature still demand voice production during lunch time and sleep time there be quiet but the teacher have never _ ask _ for silence unless there be some such evident reason there be no silence game the difference have come from within the child all now lie down in the afternoon quietly and the greater number sleep but there have be no command or any kind of general plan : again the desire have gradually come to individual from suggestion and imitation lunch be quite orderly but not yet without a occasional accident or struggle there be much less fighting but primitive man be still there the most marked development be in the growth of the idea of take turn the child have begin to master this all-important lesson of life the strong pugnacious habit in the little punching boy reach a point that show he be unable to conquer it from within : about two month after he arrival the teacher consult he mother who confirm all that the teacher have experience : she prescription be smack after a good deal of thought and many ineffectual talk and experiment with the boy the teacher come to the conclusion that the mother be right : she take he to the cloakroom after the next outbreak and smack he hand : he be surprised and a little hurt but very soon forget and continue he practice : on the next occasion the teacher repeat the punishment and it be never again necessary for a few day he be at a loss for a occupation because punching have become a confirm habit but soon other interest appeal to he : he have never change in he trust in he teacher of whom he be noticeably very fond and he have now realize that he must control a bad habit this example have be give at length to illustrate the relation of government to freedom if these child have be in the ordinary baby room subject to a time-table to constant plan by the teacher for they activity few or none of these occasion would have occur : the incipient so-called naughtiness would have be display only outside in the playground or at home : there would have be little chance of chaos of fighting of punching of try to get the best thing and foremost place there would have be little opportunity for choice and less real absorption because of the time-table the child would have be happy enough but they would not have be train to live as individual outward docility be a fatal trait and very common in young child probably it be a form of self-preservation but the real child only lie in wait to make opportunity out of school the school be therefore not prepare he for life \* \* \* \* \* freedom in the transition and the junior school must be differently apply : individual life begin to merge into community life and the child begin to learn that thing right for individual may be wrong for the community but the problem of freedom be not as easy as the problem of authority : standard must be greatly altered and outward docility no longer mistake for training in self-control individual training can not suddenly become class discipline neither can child be switch from the nursery school to a full-blown class system the idea of class teaching must be postpone for out of it come most of the difficulty of discipline and it be not the natural arrangement at this transitional period a teacher be impose on a number of very different individual a system that say they difficulty be alike that they must all work at one rate and in one way : and so we have the weary reading round class when the slow one struggle and the quick one find other and unlawful occupation : we have the number lesson break by the teacher 's breathless attempt to see that all the class follow : we have the handwork that impose a average standard of work that fit nobody exactly intellectual freedom can only come by individual or group work while class teaching be only for such occasion as a literature or a singing lesson or the presentation of a occasional new idea in number individual and group work need much organization but while class consist of over forty child there be no other way to permit intellectual and moral freedom of course the furniture of the room will greatly help to make this more possible and it be hope that a enlighten authority will not continue to supply heavy iron-framed desk for the junior school those describe as desk for listen the prevail atmosphere should be a busy noise and not silence -- it should be the noise of child work oftener than of the teacher teaching _ ie _ teach the whole class the teacher should be more frequently among the child than at she desk and the child 's voice should be hear more often than hers such child will inevitably become intellectually independent and morally self-controlled most of the order should be take in hand by child in office and they should be distinguish by a badge : most question of punishment should be refer to they this mean a constant appeal to the law that be behind both teacher and child and which they learn to reach apart from the teacher 's control where ` thou shalt ' of the law become ' i will ' of the doer then we be free iii consideration of the aspect of experience the aim of the follow chapter be to show how principle may be apply to what be usually know as subject of the curriculum and what place these subject take in the acquisition of experience a exhaustive or detailed treatment of method be not intend but merely the establishment of a point of view and method of application chapter xxi experience of human conduct it be always difficult to see the beginning of thing : we know that story form the raw material of morality it be not easy to trace morality in _ little black sambo the three bear alice in wonderland _ or _ the sleep beauty _ but nevertheless morality be there if we recognize morality in everyday thing it be not too much to say that everybody should have a ideal even a burglar : he ideal be to be a good and thorough burglar and probably if he be a burglar of the finer sort it be to play fair to the whole gang it be better to be a burglar with a ideal than a blameless person with very little soul or personality who just slide through life accept thing : it be better to have a coster 's ideal of a holiday than to be too indifferent or stupid to care or to know what you want now ideal be suppose to be the essence of morality and morality come to we through experience and only experience test its truth the story with a moral be generally neither literature nor morality except such unique example as _ the pilgrim 's progress _ or _ everyman _ the kind of experience with which morality be concern be experience of human life in various circumstance and the way people behave under those circumstance the beginning of such experience be we own behavior and the behavior of other people we know but this be too limit a experience to produce a satisfactory ideal so we crave for something wider it be curious how strong be the craving for this kind of experience in all normal child in whom one would suppose sense experience and especially muscular experience to be enough the need to know about people other than ourselves and yet not too unlike in circumstance other than we own and yet not too strange seem to be a necessary part of we education and we interpret it in the light of we own personal conduct out of this as well as out of we direct experience we build we ideal when one realize how a ideal may color the whole outlook of a person one begin to realize what literature mean to a child the early ideal be crude it may be jack the giant-killer or a engine-driver cinderellum or the step-cleaner this may grow into hiawatha or robinson crusoe for boy and a fairy tale princess or one of the little woman for girl in every hero a child half-unconsciously see himself and the ideal stimulate all that hidden life which be probably the most important part of he growth as indirect experience grow or in other word as he hear or read more story he ideal widen and he knowledge of the problem of life be enlarged this be the raw material of morality for out of he answer to these problem he build up standard of conduct and of judgement he project himself into he own ideal and he project himself into the experience of other people : he live in both : this be imagination of the highest kind it be often call sympathy but the term be too limited it be rather imaginative understanding there be another side of life grasp by means of this new world of experience and that be the spiritual side that lie between conduct and ideal child have always accept the supernatural quite readily and it be not to be wonder at for all the world be new and therefore supernatural to they magic be do daily in child 's eye and there be no line between what be understandable and what be not until adult try to interpret it for they they be curious about birth and death and all origin : thunder be terrifying the sea be enthral the wind be mysterious the sky be immense and all suggest a power beyond : in this the child be reproduce the race experience as express in myth when power be embody in a god or goddess therefore the fairy world or the giant world or the wood full of dwarf and witch ' house be as real to they and as acceptable as any part of life it be they recognition of a world of spirit which later on mingle itself with the spiritual life of religion that life be behind all matter be the main truth they hold and while it be difficult here to disentangle morality from religion it be supremely evident that a very great and significant side of a child 's education be before we it be by means of the divine gift of imagination probably the most spiritual of a child 's gift that he can lay hold of all that the world of literature have to offer he because of imagination he be independent of poverty monotony and the indifference of other people he have a world of he own in which nothing be impossible edwin pugh say of a child of the slum who be passionately fond of read cheap literature : -- it be by means of this penny passport to heaven that she escape from the hell of she surroundings it be in the maudlin fancy of some poor besotted literary hack maybe that she find surcease from the pain of weariness the cark and care of she miserable estate a teacher realize this should feel a almost unspeakable sense of responsibility in have to select and present matter : but the problem should be solve on the one hand by she own high standard of story material and on the other by she knowledge of the child 's need accord to he experience of life the interpretation of the story will differ : for example it be find that the child of a low slum neighborhood translate _ jack the giant-killer _ into term of a street fight : to child live by a river or the sea the _ water-baby _ would mean very much while _ jan of the windmill _ would be more familiar ground for country child fairy story of the best kind have a universal appeal in choose a story a teacher should be aware of the imperishable part of it the truth around which it grow sometimes the truth may seem a very commonplace one sometimes a curious one for example very young child generally prefer story of home life because round the family they experience gather : the subject seem homely but it be really one of the fundamental thing of life and the teacher should realize this in such a way that the tell or read of the story make the kernel its central point to some child the ideal home life come only through literature : daily experience rather contradict it humor be a important factor in morality unless a person be capable of see the humor of a situation he be likely to be want in a sense of balance the humor of a situation be often cause by the wrong proportion or wrong balance of thing : for example the humor of _ the mad tea-party _ lie partly at least in the absurd gravity with which the animal regard the whole situation the extreme literal-mindedness of alice and the exaggerated imitation of human being : a really moral person must have balance as well as sympathy else he see thing out of proportion these example make evident that we be not to seek for anything very patently high-flown in the story for child it be life in all its phase that give the material but it must be true life : not false or sentimental or trivial life : this will rule out the pretty story for child write by trivial people in teacher ' papers or the pseudo-nature story or the artificial myth of the how do type or the would-be childish story where the language be rather that of the grown-up imitating child than that of real child of late year with the discovery of child child 's literature have grow and there be a good deal to choose from past and present writer there be no recognize or stereotyped method of tell a story to child : it be something much deeper than merely a acquire art it be the teacher give something of she personality to the child something that be most precious one of the finest of we english kindergarten teacher once say i feel almost as if i ought to prepare my soul before tell a story to young child and this be the sense in which the story should be choose and tell there be of course certain external qualification which must be so fully acquire as to be use unconsciously such as a good vocabulary power over one 's voice a recognition of certain literary phase in a story such as the work up to the dramatic crisis the work down to the end so that it shall not fall flat and the dramatic touch that give life these be certainly most necessary and should be study and cultivate but a teacher should not be hamper in she tell by be too conscious of they rather she should feel such respect and even reverence for this side of a child 's education that the framework and setting can only be of the best always remember at the same time what be framework and setting and what be essence much that have be say about the method and aim of story might apply to those take from the bible but they need certain additional consideration here religion and morality come very closely together : the recognition of a definite personality behind all circumstance of life to whom we conduct matter give a soul to morality the old testament be a record of the growth of a nation more fully conscious of god than be the record of any other nation and because of this child can understand god in human life when they read such story as the childhood of mose and of samuel child resemble the young jewish nation in this respect : they accept the direct intervention of god in the life of every day they primitive sense of justice which be a eye for a eye will make they welcome joyfully the plague of egypt and the cross of the red sea it would be premature to force on they the more mature idea of mercy which would probably lead to confusion of judgement : they must be clear about the balance of thing before they readjust it for themselves much of the material in the old testament be hardly suitable for very young child but the most should be make of what there be : the life of eastern people be interesting to child and help to make the phraseology of the psalm and even of the narrative clear to they wonder story such as the creation the flood the burning bush elijah 's experience appeal to they on another side the side that be eager to wonder : the account of the childhood of ishmael isaac joseph mose david and samuel and the little syrian maid come very close to they such story should be give to young child so that they form part of the enchanted memory of childhood -- which be permanent with the new testament the problem be more difficult : one hesitate to bring the life of christ before child until they be ready to understand even in some degree its significance the subject be apt to be deal with either too familiarly and make too commonplace and everyday a matter or as something so far remove from human affair as to be mysterious and remote to a child to mix old and new testament indiscriminately as for example by take they on alternate day be unforgivable and no teacher who have study the bible seriously could do so if she care about the religious training of she child and understand the bible if the child can realize something of the sense in which christ help human being then some of the incident in he life might be give such as he birth he work of healing feeding and help the poor and some of he story such as the lose sheep the lost son the sower the good samaritan it be difficult to speak strongly enough of the mistreatment of scripture under the name of religion : it have be spoil more than any other subject in the curriculum chiefly by be take too often and too slightly by teacher who may be in themselves deeply religious but who have not apply intelligence to this matter the religious life of a young child be very direct : there be only a little in the religious experience of the jew that can help he and much that can puzzle and hinder he they interpretation of god as revengeful cruel and one-sided in he dealings with they enemy must greatly puzzle he when he hear on the other hand that god be the father of all the nation on the earth what be suitable should be take and take well but there be no virtue in the bible misunderstand poetry be a form of literature which appeal to child _ if they be not make to learn it by rote _ unconsciously they learn it very quickly and easily if they understand in a general way the meaning and if they like the sound of the word rhythm be a early inheritance and can be encourage by poetry music and movement the sound of word appeal strongly to young child and rhyming be almost a game the kind of poetry prefer vary a good deal but on the whole narrative or nonsense verse seem most popular few child be ready for sentiment or reflection even about themselves and this be why some of stevenson 's most charming poem about child be not appreciate by they as much as by grown-up people and for the same reason only a few nature poem be really like without doubt the only aim in give poetry to child be to help they to appreciate it and the only method to secure this be to read it to they appreciatively and often besides such anthology as _ the golden staircase _ ev luca 's _ book of verse for child _ and other we must go to the bible for poem like the song of miriam or of deborah and the psalm to shakespeare for such song as where the bee suck i know a bank ye spot snake either with or without music to longfellow 's _ hiawatha _ for descriptive piece and to scott and tennyson for ballad and song and to many other simple classic source outside the ordinary collection in both prose and poetry probably the ultimate aim be appreciation of beauty in human conduct clutton brock say the value of art be the value of the aesthetic activity of the spirit and we must all value that before we can value work of art rightly : and ultimately we must value this glory of the universe to which we give the name of beauty when we apprehend it again he say parent nurse and teacher ought to be aware that the child when he forget himself in the beauty of the world be pass through a sacred experience which will enrich and glorify the whole of he life if all this be what literature mean in a child 's experience of life then it must be give a worthy place in the time-table and curriculum and in the serious preparation by the teacher for she work chapter xxii experience of the natural world the first experience the child gain from the world of nature be those of beauty of sound color and smell flower at first be just lovely and sweet-smelling the keen sens of a child be more deeply satisfied with color and scent than we have any idea of unless some faint memory of what it mean remain with we but he begin to grasp real scientific truth from he experience with the element which have for he such a mysterious attraction by the very contact with water something in the child respond to its stimulus mud and sand have they charm quite intangible but universal from prince to coster a bonfire be something that arouse a kind of primeval joy again race experience reproduce itself may account for all this and it must be satisfy the demand for contact with the rest of nature be a strong and fierce part of human nature and it mean the growth of something in life that we can not do without we induce child to come into we school when this hunger be at its fiercest and very often we do nothing to satisfy it but set they in room to look at thing inanimate when they very be be cry out for life i want something and i do not know what to want be the expression of a state very frequent in child and not infrequent in grown-up people because they have be balk of something how then can we provide for they experience of this side of life we have try to do so in the past by object and nature lesson but we must admit that they be not the means by which young child seek to know life or by which they appreciate its beauty we have be try to kill too many bird with one stone in we economic way to train the power of observation to teach a child to express himself to help a child to gain useful knowledge about live thing have be the most usual aim and the method have be that of minute examination of a specimen from the plant or animal world utterly detach from its surroundings consider by the docile child in part such as leaf stem root petal and use or head wing leg tail and habit the innocent listener might frequently think with reason that a number lesson rather than a nature lesson be be give the day of the object lesson be past and to young child the nature lesson must become nature work it be in the term nature lesson that the root of the mischief lie : nature be not a lesson to the young child it be a interest from which he seek to gain more pleasure by means of he own activity : plant encourage he to garden animal stir he desire to watch feed and protect water earth and fire arouse he craving to investigate and experiment : there be no motive for passive study at this juncture and without a motive or purpose all study lead to nothing adult compare and count the various part of a living thing for purpose of classification connect with the subdivision of life which we call botany and zoology but such thing be far remove from the young child 's world -- only gradually do it begin to dawn on he that there be interesting likeness and that in this world as in he own there be relationship when he realize this the time for a nature lesson have come but much direct experience must come first in set out the furnishing of the school the need for this activity be imply no school worthy of the name can do without a garden any more than it can do without read book or blackboard indeed the former need be greater : if it be possible and possibility gradually merge into acceptance a pond should be in the middle of the garden and tree should also be consider as part of the whole it be not difficult for the ordinary person to make a pond or even to begin a garden in a school situate in se london in the midst of row of monotonous little house and close to a busy railway junction a miracle be perform : the playground be not very large and of the usual uncompromising concrete the child most of whose father work on the railway live in the surround street and most of they have a back-yard of sort they have little or no idea of a garden one of the teacher have however a vision which become a reality she ask she child to help to make a garden and for week every child bring from he back-yard he little paper bag of soil which be deposit over some clinker that be spread out in a narrow border against the outside wall in a few month there be a border of two yard in which flower be plant : the caretaker inspire by the sight do he share of fix a wooden strip as a kind of support border to the whole : in two year the garden have spread all round the outside wall of the playground and belong to several class a even greater miracle be perform in a dock-side school where to most of the child a back-yard be a luxury beyond all possibility the school playground be very small and evening class make a school garden quite impossible but the head mistress be one who see life full of possibility and so she see a garden even in the sordidness round the parish church be a graveyard long disused and near one of the gate a small piece of ground that have never be use for any graveyard purpose : it be near enough to the school to be possible and in a short time the miracle happen -- the entrance to the graveyard become a child 's flowering garden inside the school where plant and flower in pot be numerous a part of the morning should be spend in the care of these : few people know how to arrange flower and fewer how to feed and wash they if there be a aquarium or chrysali box they have to be attend to : all this should be a regular duty with a strong sense of responsibility attach to it it be curious how many people be content to live in a atmosphere of decay matter if the child enjoy so intensely the color of the leaf and flower they will be glad to have the opportunity of paint they this be as much a part of nature work as any other and it should be use as such because it emphasise so strongly the side of appreciation of beauty a side very often neglect it be here that the individual paint box be so important if child be to have any sense of color they must learn to match very truthfully there be a great difference between the blue of the forget-me-not and of the bluebell but only by experiment can child discover that the difference lie in the amount of red in the latter by means of discovery of this kind they will see new color in life around they and a new depth of meaning will come to they everyday observation this be true observation not the look and say of the oral lesson which have no purpose in it and lead to no natural activity or to appreciation it be difficult to satisfy the interest in animal in connection with the nursery school the most suitable have be mention the transition and junior school child may see other when they go for excursion at this stage too child have a great desire to learn about wild animal and the need often arise out of they literature : the camel that bring rebecca to isaac the wolf that adopt mowglus the reindeer that carry kay and gerda the fox that try to eat the seven little kid androcle ' lion and black sambo 's tiger might form a interesting series help by picture of the creature _ in its own home _ it be difficult to say whether this may be term literature geography or nature study the difficulty serve to show the unity of life at this period book such as seton thompson 's long 's and kearton 's and many other supply live experience of animal life impossible to get from less direct source as child get older and have the power to look back they will feel the necessity of keep record and thus the nature calendar forerunner of geography will be adopt naturally another important feature in nature experience be the excursion froebel say : not only child and boy but indeed many adult fare with nature and she character as ordinary man fare with the air they live in it and yet scarcely know it as something distinct therefore these child and boy who spend all they time in the field and forest see and feel nothing of the beauty of nature and they influence on the human heart they be like people who have grow up in a very beautiful country and who have no idea of its beauty and its spirit therefore it be so important that boy and adult should go into the field and forest together strive to receive into they heart and mind the life and spirit of nature it be evident from this that excursion be as necessary in the country as in the town where instead of the field and forest perhaps only a park be possible but there be no virtue in a excursion take without preparation the teacher must first of all visit the place and see what it be likely to give the child she must tell they something of it give they some aim in go there such as collect leaf or fruit or record different shape of bare tree or collect thing that grow in the grass these be example of what a town park might yield within one group of child there might be many with different aim during the day follow the excursion time should be spend in use these experience either by means of painting and modelling or make classified collection of thing find or compile record oral or write otherwise the excursion degenerate into a school treat without its natural enjoyment with regard to the inevitable gap in the child 's mind in connection with the world of live thing such picture as the follow should be in every town school : a pine wood a rabbit warren a natural pond a ditch and hedge a hayfield in June a wild daffodil patch a sheet of bluebell a cornfield at different stage a orchard in spring and in autumn and many other these must be constantly use when they be need and not misuse in the artificial method know as picture talk there be another side to nature work froebel say : the thing of nature form a more beautiful ladder between heaven and earth than that see by jacob not a one-sided ladder lead in one direction but a all-sided one lead in all direction not in dream be it see it be permanent it surround we on all side froebel believe that contact with nature help a child 's realisation of god and any one who believe in early religious experience must agree a child 's early question and difficulty as well as he early awe and fear show it -- he be probably nearer to god in he nature work than in many of the _ daily _ scripture lesson all he education should be permeate by spiritual feeling but there be some aspect in which the realisation be clearer and possibly he contact with nature stand out as the highest in this respect there be no conscious method or art in bring this about the teacher must feel it and be convince of it thus we come to the conclusion that the nursery school nature work can be safely leave to look after itself provide the surroundings be satisfy and the child be free in the transition and the junior school there should be no nature lesson of the object lesson type but plenty of nature work lead to talk handwork and poetry the aim be not economic or informational at this stage but the development of pure appreciation and interest there can hardly be a regular place on the time-table for such irregular work comprise excursion garden handwork and literature at least and depend on the weather and the season there should always be a regular morning time for attend to plant and animal and for the nature calendar but no living teacher will be a slave to mere time-table thraldom chapter xxiii experience of mathematical truth by means of toy handwork and game as well as various private individual experiment a child touch on most side of mathematics in the nursery class in experiment with brick he must of necessity have consider relative size balance and adjustment form and symmetry in fitting they back into they box some of the most difficult problem of cubic content in weigh out pretence sugar and butter by means of sand and clay new problem be there for consideration in make a paper-house question of measurement evolve this be all in the incidental play of the nursery school and yet we might say that a child thus occupy be learn mathematics more than anything else here if he remain till six he do a certain amount of necessary counting and he may have acquire skill in recognize group he may have unconsciously and incidentally perform achievement in the four rule but never of course in any shorten or technical form probably he know some figure it be best to give these to a child when he ask for or need they as in the case of record of game on the other hand he may be content with stroke various mathematical relationship be make clear in he game or trial of strength such as distance in relation to time or strength weight in relation to power and to balance length and breadth in relation to material value of material in relation to money or work by means of many of he toy the property of solid have become work knowledge to he here then be we starting-point for the transition period after the nursery stage undoubtedly the aim of the transition class be partly to continue by means of game and dramatic play the kind of knowledge gain in the nursery school but it have also the task of begin to organise such knowledge as the group into ten and hundred this organization of raw material and the presenting of shorten process as occur in the first four rule form the work also of the junior school to give to a child shorten process which he would be very unlikely to discover in less than a lifetime be simply give he the experience of the race as primitive man do to he son but the important point be to decide when a child 's discovery should end and the teacher 's demonstration begin this be the period when we be accustom to speak of begin abstract work it be well to be clear what it mean and how it stand related to a child 's need for experience when we leave the problem of life such as shopping keep record of game and make measurement for construction and when we begin to work with pure number we be say to be deal with the abstract formerly deal with pure number be call simple and deal with actual thing such as money and measure compound and they be take in this order but experience have reverse the process and a child come to see the need of abstract practice when he find he be not quick enough or accurate enough or he set out seem clumsy in actual problem this be discuss at greater length in the chapter on play for instance he might set down the point of a game by stroke each line represent a different opponent : john | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | henry | | | | | | | | | | | tom | | | he will see how difficult it be to estimate at a glance the exact score and how easy it be to be inaccurate it seem the moment to show he that the idea of grouping or enclose a certain number and always keep to the same grouping be helpful : john | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | = 1 ten and 6 singles henry | | | | | | | | | | | = 1 ten and 1 single tom | | | = 3 singles after do this a good many time he could be tell that this be a universal method and he would doubtless enjoy the purely puzzle pleasure in work long sum to perfect practice this pleasure be very common in child at this stage but too often it come to they merely through be show the trick of carry ten they have reach a purely abstract point but they can not get through it without some more material help the following be a example of the kind of help that can be give in get clear the concept of the ten grouping and the process it involve : -lrb- illustration : board with hook in rank of nine and ring -rrb- the whole apparatus be a rectangular piece of wood about 3\/4 of a inch thick and about 3x1-1 \/ 2 foot of surface it be paint white and the horizontal bar be green so that the division may be apparent at a distance it have perpendicular division break it up into three column each of which contain row of nine small dresser hook it can be hang on a easel or support by its own hinge on a table each of the division represent a numerical group the one on the right be for singles or unit the central one for ten and the left side one for hundred : the counter use be button mould dip in red ink with small loop of string to hang on the hook : it be easily see by a child that after nine be reach the unit can no longer remain in they division or house but must be gather together into a bunch -lrb- fasten by a safety pin -rrb- and fix on one of the hook of the middle division sum of two or three line can thus be set out on the horizontal bar and in process of addition the answer can be on the bottom line it be very easy by this concrete means to see the process in subtraction and indeed the whole difficulty of deal with ten be make concrete the whole of a sum can be go through on this board with the button-mould and on board and chalk with figure side by side thus interpret symbol by material but the whole process be abstract the piece of apparatus be less abstract only in degree than the figure on the blackboard because neither represent real life or its problem : in abstract work we be merely go off at a side issue for the sake of practice to make we more competent to deal with the economic affair of life there be a place for stick and counter and there be a place for money and measure but they be not the same : the former represent the abstract and the latter the concrete problem if use as in real life : the bridge between the abstract and the concrete be largely the work of the transition class and junior school in respect of the foundation of arithmetic know as the first four rule game of skill very thorough shopping or keep a bankbook or sell ticket for tram or train represent the kind of everyday problem that should be the center of the arithmetic work at this transition stage and out of the necessity of these problem the abstract and semi-abstract work should come but it should _ never _ precede the real work a real purpose should underlie it all a purpose that be apparent and stimulate enough to produce willing practice a child will do much to be a good shopkeeper a good tram conductor a good banker he will always play the game for all it be worth chapter xxiv experience by means of do in the nursery school activity be the chief characteristic : one of its most usual form be experiment with tool and material such as chalk paint scissors paper sand clay and other thing the desire to experiment to change the material in some way to gratify the sens especially the muscular one may be stronger than the desire to construct the handwork play of the nursery school be therefore chiefly by means of imitation and experiment and direct help be usually quite unwelcome to the child under six there be little more to be say in the way of direction than provide suitable material give freedom and help if the child want it but the case be rather different in the transitional stage as the race learn to think by do so child seem to approach think in that way they have a natural inclination to do in the first case they try do wrongly consider examine observe and do again : for example a girl want to make a doll 's bonnet like the baby 's she begin impulsively to cut out the stuff find it too small try to visualise the right size examine the real bonnet and make another attempt at some apparently odd moment she stumble on a truth perhaps the relation of one form to another in the maze of bonnet-making it be at these odd moment that we learn or a boy may be paint a christmas card and in another odd moment he may _ feel _ something of the beauty of color if for example he be copy holly-berry no purposeless look at they would have stir appreciation whether the end be do or whether it be think the two be inextricably connect in the earlier stage the way to know and feel be very often by action and here be the basis of the maxim that handwork be a method this idea have often be only half digested and consequently it have lead to a very trivial kind of application a nature lesson of the look and say description have be follow by a painting lesson a geography lesson by the making of a model if the method of learning by do be the accept aim of the teacher then it be not carry out for this be learn and then do not learn for the purpose of do but do for the purpose of test the learning which be quite another matter and not a very natural procedure with young child many people have try to make thing from print direction a woman may try to make a blouse and a man to make a knife-box they procedure be not to separate the do and the learning process probably they have first try to do find need for help and go to the print direction which they follow side by side with the do and in the light of former failure or in the course of look or of experiment they stumble upon knowledge : this be learn by do therefore the making of a box may be arithmetic the painting of a buttercup may be nature study the construction of a model or of dramatic property may be geography or history not by any mean the only way of learning but one of the earlier way and a very sound way there be a purpose to serve behind it all that will lead to very careful discrimination in selection of knowledge and to pain take to retain it if this be fully understand by a teacher and she be content to take nature 's way and abide for nature 's time to see result then she method will be appropriately apply : she will see that she be not train a race of box-maker but that she be guide child to discover thing that they need to know in a natural way and ensure that as these fact be discover they shall be use consequently neither haste nor perfection of finish must cloud the aim it be not the output that matter but the method by which the child arrive at the finish object not forty good box but forty good thinker dewey have put it most clearly when he say that the right test of a occupation consist in put the maximum of consciousness into whatever be do froebel say what man try to represent or do he begin to understand this be what we should mean by say that handwork be a method of learning but handwork have its own absolute place as well a child want to acquire skill in this direction even more consciously than he want to learn : if he have be free in the nursery class to experiment with material and if he know some of he limitation he be now in the transition class ready for help and he should get it as he need it this may run side by side with the more didactic side of handwork which have be describe but it be more likely that in practice the two be inextricably mix up and this do not matter if the two end be clear in the teacher 's mind both side have to be reckon with the important thing to know be the kind of help that should be give and when and how it be need it be well to remember that in this connection a child 's limitation be not final but only mark stage : for example in he early attempt to use thick cardboard he can not discover the neat hinge that be make by the process know as a half-cut he try in vain to bend the cardboard so as to secure the same result there be two way of help he : either he can be quite definitely show and make to imitate or he can be set to think about it he be give a cardboard knife and allow to experiment : if he fail it may be suggest that a clean edge can only be get by some form of cut probably he will find out the rest of the process the second method be the better one because it promote think while the first only promote pure imitation and the habit of reckoning on this easy solution of difficulty a dull child may have to be show but there be few such child unless they have be train to dulness imitation be not however always a medicine for dulness nor do it always produce dulness there be a time for imitation and there be a kind of imitation that be very intelligent for example a child may come across a toy aeroplane and wish to make one he will examine it carefully think over the use of part and proceed to make one as like it as possible : here again be the maximum of consciousness the essence of think or the imitation may consist in follow verbal direction : this be far from easy if the teacher be at all vague and promote valuable effort if she be clear but not diffuse : the put of word into action necessitate a considerable amount of imagine and the establishment of very important association in brain centre such case might occur in connection with weave cardboard and paper work or the more technical process of draw and paint where race experience be actually _ give _ to a child by means of which he leap over the experience of century this be progress if a teacher be to take handwork seriously and not as a pretty recreation with pleasing result she should be fully conscious of all that it mean and apply this definitely in she work : it be so easy to be trivial while appear to be thorough by have well-finished work produce which have necessitate little hard thinking on the child 's part construction give a sense of power a strengthening of the will ability to concentrate on a purpose in learn a social sense of serviceableness a deepen individuality : but this can only be look for if a child be allow to approach it in the right way first as a experimenter and investigator or as a artist and afterwards as a learner who be also a individual and learn in he own way and at he own rate : but if the teacher 's ambition be external and economic then the child be a tool in she hand and will remain a tool we can not expect the fruit of the spirit if we goal be a material one one of the lesson of the war be economy in handwork this have come to we through the quest for material but it have be a blessing if now and then in disguise in the more formal period of handwork only prepare almost patented material be use everything be requisition and eager manufacturer supply very highly finish stuff not very many year ago the keeper of a kindergarten stall at a exhibition say while point to card cut and print with outline for sew and prick we have so many order for these that we can afford to lay down considerable plant for they production a example in another direction be that of a little girl who attend one of the best so-called kindergarten of the time : she be afflict while at home with the do not know what to do malady she mother suggest that she might make some of the thing she make at school but she negative that at once with the remark i could not do that you see because we have none of the right kind of stuff to make they of here it be quite unnecessary to give more direct detail as to the kind of work suitable and the method of do it more than enough book of help have be publish on every kind of material and it might perhaps be well if we make less use of such term as clay-modelling cardboard-work raffia and take handwork more in the sense of constructive or expressive work let the child select one or several media for they purpose they ought to have access to a variety of material and except when they waste they should use it freely it be limit and unenlightened to put down a special time for the use of special material if the end might be better answer by something else : if modelling be at 1130 on Monday and child be anxious to make christmas present what law in heaven or earth be we obey if we stick to model except the law of red tape chapter xxv experience of the life of man this aspect of experience come in two form the life of man in the past with the memorial and legacy he have leave and the life of man in the present under the vary condition of climate and all that it involve in other word these experience be commonly know as history and geography though in the earlier stage of they appearance in school it be perhaps better to call the work -- preparation for history and geography they would naturally appear in the transition or the junior class preferably in the latter but they need not be wholly new subject to a child he literature have prepare he for both to some extent he experiment in handwork have prepare he for history while he nature work especially he excursion and record have prepare he for geography that he need this extension of experience can be see in he grow demand for true story true in the more literal sense which he be come fast to appreciate undoubtedly most child pass through a stage of extreme literalism between early childhood and what be generally recognize as boyhood and girlhood they begin to ask question regard the past they be interested in thing from abroad however vague that term may be to they perhaps it will be best to treat the two subject separately though like all the child 's curriculum at this stage they be inextricably confuse and mingle both with each other and with literature as experience of man 's life and conduct the beginning of geography lie in the child 's foundation of experience probably the first real contact unconscious though it may be that any child have in this connection be through the production of food and clothing a country child see some of the beginning of both but it be doubtful how much of it be really interpret by he the village shop with its inexhaustible store probably mean much more in the way of origin and he may never go behind its contents in he speculation it be true he see milk harvest sheep-shearing and many other operation but he often miss the stage between the actual beginning and the finish product -- between the wool on the sheep 's back and he Sunday clothes between the wheat in the field and he loaf of bread the town child have many link if he can use they : the goods train the dock the grocer 's green-grocer 's or draper 's shop foreigner in the street the van that come through the silent street in the early morning in big town such market as covent garden or leadenhall or smithfield such a river as the thame humber or mersey -- from any one of these beginning he can reach out from he own small environment to the world a town child have very confused notion of what a farm really mean to national life and a country child of what a big railway station or dock involve all child need to know what other part of they own land look like and what be produce they ought to trace the product within reach to they origin and this will involve description of such thing as fishery at hull or aberdeen the coal mine of wale or lanarkshire pottery district of stafford woollen and cotton factory of yorkshire and lancashire mill drive by steam wind and water lighthouse the sheep-rearing district of cumberland and midlothian the flax-growing of northern ireland and much else and the means of transit and communication between all these the child will gradually realize that many of the thing they be familiar with such as tea orange silk and sugar have not be account for and this will take they to the life of people in other country the means of get there the time take and mode of travel they will also come to see that we do not produce enough of the thing that be possible to grow such as wheat apple wool and many other common necessaries and that we can spare much that be manufacture to country that do not make they such as boot clothes china and cutlery there will come a time when the need for a map be apparent : that be the time to branch off from the main theme and make one it will have to be of the very immediate surroundings first but it be not difficult to make the leap soon to country beyond previous to the need for it map-making be useless this work outwards from actual experience from the home country to the foreign from actual contact with real thing to thing of traveller ' tale be the only way to bring geography to the very door of the school to make it part of the actual life the beginning of history as of geography lie in the child 's foundation of experience in the country village he see the church possibly some old cottage or a elizabethan or jacobean house near in the churchyard or in the church the tombstone have quaint inscription with reference possibly to past war or to early colonisation the slum child on the other hand see much that be wear out but little that be antiquated unless the slum happen to be in such place as edinburgh or deptford situate among the remains of really fine house : but he realize more of the technicality and officialism of a social system than do the country child the suburban child have probably the scantiest store of all he district be presumably make up of row of respectable but monotonous house and the social life be similarly respectable and monotonous there be certain craving interest and need common to all child which come regardless of surroundings all child want to know certain thing about people who live before they not so much they great doings as they smaller one they want to know what these people be like what they work at and learn how they travel what they buy and sell : and there be undoubtedly a primitive strain in all child that come out in they love of building shelter play at savage and make thing out of natural material one of the most intense moment in _ peter pan _ to many child be the building of the little house in the wood and later on of the other on the top of the tree : that be the little house of they dream they be not interested in constitution or the making of law war and invasion have much the same kind of interest for they as the adventure of una and the red cross knight how be these craving usually satisfy in the early stage of history teaching of to-day as a rule a series of biography of notable people be give regardless of chronology or the child 's previous experience and equally careless of the history lesson of the future joan of arc alfr and the cake gordon of khartoum boadicea christopher columbus julius caesar form a list which be not at all uncommon there be no lead thread no develop idea and the old test the child like it excuse indolent thinking on the other hand the desire to know more of the robinson crusoe mode of life have be apparent to many teacher for some time but the material at they disposal have be scanty and uncertain it be to prof dewey that we owe the right organization of this part of history he have show that it be on the side of industry the early mode of weave cooking lighting and heating make implement for war and for hunting and making of shelter that prehistoric man have a real contribution to give : but for the beginning of social life for realisation of such imperishable virtue as courage patriotism and self-sacrifice child must go to the life of real people and gradually acquire the idea that certain thing be so to speak from everlasting to everlasting while other change with change and grow circumstance the prehistoric history should be largely concern with do and experiment with make weapon or firing clay or weave rush or with visit to such museum as horniman 's at forest hill the early social history may well take the form best suit to the child and not appeal merely to surface interest and the spirit in which the life of other people be present to child must not be the narrow prejudiced insular one so long associate with the people of great britain which call other custom dress mode of : live funny or absurd or extraordinary but rather the scientific spirit that interpret life accord to its condition and so build up one of its greatest law the law of environment the geography syllabus even more than the history one depend for its beginning at least on the surroundings of the school -- out of the mass of possible material a very rich and comprehensive syllabus can be make begin with any one of the central point already suggest above all there should be plenty of picture not as amplification but as material by means of which a child may interpret more fully a picture should be of the nature of a problem or of a map -- and picture reading should be in the junior school what map reading be in the upper school in both history and geography the method be partly that of discovery especially be this the case in that part of history which deal with primitive industry and in almost the whole of the geography of this period the teacher be the guide or leader in discovery not the story-teller merely though this may be part of he function the follow be a small part of a syllabus to show how geography and history material may grow naturally out of the child 's experience it be mean in this case for child in a london suburb with no particular characteristic : -- geography it grow out of the shop of the neighborhood and the adjoining railway system _ home-produced goods _ -- a the green-grocer 's shop trace of fruit to its own home source or to a foreign country home-grown fruit the fruit farm garden orchard and wood the packing and send of fruit -- railway line covent garden the dock fruit stall jam factory b a grocer 's or corn-chandler 's shop flour and oatmeal trace to they source the farm a wheat and grain farm at different season a dairy farm and a sheep farm a mill and its process woollen factory a dairy making of butter and cheese distribution of these goods c a china shop lead to the pottery district and making of pottery _ foreign goods _ -- fur -- red indian and canada date -- the arab and the sahara cotton -- the negro and equatorial region cocoa -- the west indy the transit of these they arrival and distribution -lrb- the need for a map will come early in the first part of the course and the need for a globe in the second -rrb- history this grow naturally out of the geography syllabus and might be take side by side or afterwards the development of industry the growth of spin and weave from the simplest process bring in the distaff spinning-wheel and loom the making of garment from the join together of fur the growth of pottery and the development of cook the growth of road and means of transit -lrb- this will involve a good deal of experimental and constructive handwork -rrb- chapter xxvi experience record and pass on reading and write be hold to have lift man above the brute they be the means by which we can discover and record human experience and progress and as such they value be incalculable but in themselves they be artificial convention symbol invent for the convenience of mankind and to acquire they we need exercise no great mental power a good eye and ear memory and a certain superficial quickness to recognize and apply previous knowledge be all that be need for reading and spelling while for write the development of a specialised muscular skill be all that be necessary in themselves they do not as a rule hold any great interest for a child : sometimes they have the same puzzle interest as a long addition sum and to child of a certain type mechanical work such as write give relief one of the most docile and uninteresting of little boy say that write be he favorite subject and it be easy to understand : he do not want to be stir out of he commonplaceness unconsciously he have assimilate the atmosphere and adopt the standard of he surroundings which be monotonous and commonplace in the extreme and so he desire no more adventurous method of expression than the process of write which he could do well imitation be often a strong incentive to read it be part of the craving for grown-upness to many child they desire to do what they brother and sister can do but _ during the first stage of childhood roughly up to the age of six or even later no child need to learn to read or write take need in the psychological sense : _ that period be concern with lay the foundation of real thing and with learn surroundings -- any record of experience that come to a child can come as they do to he earliest forefather -- by word of mouth when he want to read story for himself or write he own letter then he be impel by a sufficiently strong aim or incentive to make concentration possible without resort to any of the fantastic device and apparatus so dear to so many teacher indeed it be safe to say of many of these device that they prove the fact that child be not ready for read when a child be ready to read and write the process need not be a long one : by wise delay many tedious hour be save tedious to both teacher and child they have already learn to talk in those precious hour to discriminate sound as part of language training but without any resort to symbol -- merely as something natural it have be amply prove that if a child be not prematurely force into read he can do as much in one year as he would have do in three under more strained condition with regard to method a great deal have be write on the subject it be pretty safe to leave a teacher to choose she own -- for much of the elaboration be unnecessary if reading be rightly delay and if a child can read reasonably well at seven and a half there can be no grounds for complaint if he phonetic training have be good in the earlier stage of language then this may be combine with the look and say method or method of reading by whole word the cat on the mat type of book be disappear and its place be be take by book where the subject matter be interesting and suitable to the child 's age but as in other subject the book choose should be consider in reference to the child 's surroundings either to amplify or to extend writing be in the first instance a part of reading : when word be be learn they must be write or in the earliest stage print but only those interesting to the child and write for some definite purpose should be select : a great aid to spelling be transcription and child be always willing to copy something they like such as a verse of poetry or they name and address as in arithmetic and in handwork they will come to recognize the need for practice and be willing to undergo such exercise for the sake of improvement as well as for the pleasure in the activity -- which actual write give to some child we must be quite clear about relative value read and write be necessity and the means of open up to we thing of great value but the art of acquire they be of little intrinsic value and the recognition of the need be not a early one nothing be gain by begin too early and much valuable time be take from other activity notably language the incentive should be the need that the child feel and when this be evident time and pain should be give to the subject so that it maybe quickly acquire but the art of reading be no test of intelligence and the art of write be no test of original skill _ the claim of the upper department must be resist _ chapter xxvii the thing that really matter the _ first _ thing that matter be what be commonly call the personality of the teacher she must be a person unmistakable from other person and not a type what she have as a individual of gift or goodness she should give freely and give in she own way that she should be train be of course as indisputable as the training of a doctor but she training should have deepen she personality pestalozzus 's curriculum and organization leave much to be desire what he have hand down to we come from himself and he own experience not from anything superimpose : record of he pupil constantly emphasise this : it be he goodness assimilate with he outlook on life and readiness to learn by experience that matter and it be this that remain with he pupil the teacher 's own personality must dominate she choice of principle else she be a dead method a machine and not a living teacher she must not keep she interest and gift for out-of-school use if she have a sense of humor she must use it if she be fond of pretty clothes she must wear they in school if she appreciate music she must help she class to do the same if she have dramatic gift she must act to they she standard of goodness must be high and she must be strong enough to adopt it practically so that she be unconscious of it : goodness and righteousness be as essential as health to a teacher : for something intangible pass from the teacher to she child however young and unconscious they may be and nothing can awaken goodness but goodness part of she personality be she attitude towards religion it be difficult to think of a teacher of young child who be not religious _ ie _ whose conduct be not definitely permeate by she spiritual life : young child be essentially religious and the life of the spirit must find a response in the same kind of intangible assumption of its existence as goodness no form of creed or dogma be mean only the life of the spirit common to all but of course there may be people who refuse to admit this as a necessity the _ next _ thing that matter be that all child must be regard as individual : there have be much more talk of this lately but practical difficulty be often raise as a bar if teacher and parent continue to accept the condition which make it difficult such as large class and a need to hasten there will always be a bar : if individuality be hold as one of the greatest thing in education authority can not continue to economise so as to make it impossible it be the individual part of each child that be he most precious possession he immortal side : froebel call it he divine essence and make the cultivation of it the aim of education he be right and any more general aim will lead only to half-developed human being if we accept the principle that only goodness be fundamental and evil a distortion of nature we need have no fear about cultivate individual every doctor assure we that all normal baby be naturally healthy they be also naturally good but evil be easily arouse by arbitrary interference or by mismanagement the _ third _ thing that matter belong more especially to the intellectual life it might be describe as the making of right association more than any other side of train the making of association mean the making of the intelligent person to see life in patch be to see piece of a great picture by the square inch and never to see the relationship of these to each other -- never to see the whole the _ fourth _ thing that matter be the making of good and serviceable habit : much have be say on this in connection with the nursery class and it be at that stage that the process be most important but it should never cease if a child be to have time and opportunity to develop he individuality he must not be hamper by have to be conscious of thing that belong to the subconscious region to start a child with a foundation of good habit be better than riches the _ fifth _ thing that matter be the realisation by teacher that _ opportunity _ matter more than result opportunity to discover to learn to comprehend all side of life to be a individual to appreciate beauty to go at one 's own rate some be material in they nature such as the actual surroundings of the child in school other be rather in the atmosphere such as refrain from interference encouragement suggestion spirituality the teacher have the making of opportunity largely in she own hand the _ sixth _ thing that matter be the cultivation of the divine gift of imagination both morality and spirituality spring from this meanness cowardice lack of sympathy sensuality materialism quickly grow where there be no imagination it refine and intensify personality it open a door to thing beyond the sens it make possible appreciation of the thing of the spirit and appreciation be a thousand time more important than knowledge the _ last _ thing that matter be the need for freedom from bondage of the body and of the soul only from a free atmosphere can come the best thing -- personality imagination and opportunity and all be great need but the greatest of all be freedom
