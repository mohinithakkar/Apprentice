switzerland italy and egypt adapt to the want of young american take they first glimpse at the old world by geo h heffner 1876 preface it have be fashionable among the ancient for man of learn to visit distant country and improve they education by travel after they have complete they various course of study in literary institution and the same custom still prevail in europe at the present time but in we country comparatively few avail themselves of this finish course it be not strange that this should have be so with a people who be separate from the rest of the world by such wide ocean as we be which could up to a comparatively recent period only have be cross at a sacrifice of much time and money and at the risk of loose either life or health these difficulty have be greatly reduce by the application of steam-power to navigation and the time have come when a american can make the tour of europe with but little more expenditure of time and money than it cost even a native of europe to do it one of my principal object in write this book be to encourage other to make similar tour we would have plenty of book no travel if some of they do represent the reader in the humbler sphere of life but the general impression in america be that no one can see europe to any satisfaction in less than a year or two and with a outlay of from a thousand to two thousand dollar this be a great mistake if one travels for pleasure mainly it will certainly require a great deal of time and money but a hard-working student can do much in a few month permit I to say that one will see and experience more in two week abroad than many a learn man in america expect could be see in a year i sometimes give the particulars of sight and adventure in detail that the reader may take a example of my experience for any tour he may propose to make the time devote to different place be give that he may form a estimate of the comparative importance of different place statistics form a lead feature of this work and these have be gather and compile with special reference to the want of the student many a american scholar study the geography and history of foreign country at a great disadvantage because he can not obtain a general idea of the institution of europe unless he read half a dozen work on the subject to do this he have not the time this work give in the compass of a single volume a general idea of all the most striking feature of the manners custom and institution of the people of some eight different nation speak as many different language and dialect as the sight that one see abroad be so radically different from what we be accustom to see at home i feel pained whenever i think of describe they to any one if you would know the nature of my perplexity then go to washington and see the stately magnificence of we national capitol there and then go and describe what you have see to one who have never see a larger building than he village church or go and see the centennial exposition at philadelphium and then tell you neighbor who have never see anything greater than a county fair how what he have see compare with the world 's fair i too be proud of we country -lrb- not so much for what she now be but because she promise to become the greatest nation that ever exist -rrb- but it must be confess that america present little in the sphere of architecture that bear comparison with the castle palace and church of the old world the capitol at washington erect at the cost of twelve and a half million the city hall of baltimore perhaps more beautiful but less magnificent and other edifice that have be erect of late be structure of which we may justly be proud but let we take the building of the centennial exposition for a standard and compare they with some of those in europe the total expense incur in erect all the exposition building and prepare the grounds & c with all the contingent expense be less than ten million but st peter 's in rome cost nine time and the palace and pleasure-garden of versaille twenty time as much as this it be safe to assert that if a young man have but two hundred dollar with six week of time at he

represent Tuesday June 22d i spend the morning in write farewell letter and make the final preparation for leave at one o'clock i go on board the manhattan which be still quite empty in order to have something to do by which to while away the slow dull hour yet remain i commence write a letter none of my friend or acquaintance be with I i bid all my farewell by note but such write though the vessel be lock to the pier by immense cable still she be anything but steady as passenger begin to multiply acquaintance be form by and by the stewart come around and assign to we we berth ship government be monarchic in form the officer have almost absolute authority and the passenger like bashful pupil do they best to learn the new rule and regulation and adapt they conduct to they as soon as possible so that nobody may find occasion for make observation or pass remark all these thing remind one very much of a first day at school as the parting hour approach large number of the friend and relative of some of we passenger come upon deck to bid good-by some cry other laugh and many more _ try _ to laugh some that seem to relish repetition or be carry away by enthusiasm and the excitement of the hour shake hand over and over again with the same person at 3:00 o'clock pm the gangway be lower and the cable be remove a shock a boom and the vessel swing away and glide into the river the die be cast and we fate be seal shout and huzza rent the air as the steamer skim proudly over the wave while cloud of handkerchief on deck and upon the recede shore wave in the air as long as we could see each other down down the river glide the steady manhattan and we thought begin to run in new channel good-by dear sweet america think we a hundred time while we watch the retreat shore perhaps we thought be whisper europe with its innumerable attraction its alp appennine and vesuvius its castle palace wall town fine city great battle field ancient ruin and a thousand other milestone of civilization lay before we but a wide ocean and all the danger and peril of a long sea voyage lay between we and that other -- long for shore the question whether we would ever realize the pleasure of a visit to the old world be now reduce to the alternative of _ success _ or _ failure by accident or disease _ sea-sickness i have labor under the erroneous impression that sea-sickness be breed of fear and terror and would attack only woman -lrb- of both sex -rrb- and child of tender mind and frail constitution but when the wave commence to roll higher and the ship begin a ceaseless rock which be in direct opposition to the want and comfort of my system as all manner of swing ever be i begin to have fear that it be not _ fright _ but _ swing _ that make people sick at sea the inner man threaten to rebel and i make my calculation how much higher the billow might swell before stomach would be apt to revolt we sail out of sight of the land before dusk by which time however number of ill-mannered stomach have give evidence of they bad humor though i nodded but once or twice to old neptune during the entire voyage still i suffer much during the first five day from the pressure of intense dizziness and headache occasion by the incessant rock of we vessel upon the restless wave we have a very fine passage as the sailor would say but it be far from be as fine as i have always fancy fine sea voyage would be the rock of the ship would never be less than about two foot up and down in its width of thirty foot when the wind blow hard and the wave roll high it swing some twenty or twenty-five foot up and down at its bow and at the stern the highest wave that we see in we outward passage be probably from twelve to eighteen foot that the rock or swing of the ship be the one and only cause of sea-sickness may admit of a question but that it be the principal cause there can be little doubt my observation and experience in five or six voyage -lrb- long and short -rrb- do not point to any other cause as the sea air be generally regard as more salubrious and healthier than that on land it can certainly not be a cause of sea-sickness fright and terror in a timid person might perhaps aggravate the disease in few instance though it seem doubtful to say the least when the sea be calm and smooth everybody feel well even if the vessel swim in the middle of the ocean but let a storm come on and the number of sick will increase in proportion to its violence whale on the second day of we voyage in the afternoon at about 4:00 o'clock we come across a shoal of whale there must have be two or three dozen of they they apparently avoid we ship as only a few make they appearance very close by though we sail through the midst of they they swim about leisurely near the surface betray they whereabouts frequently by spout but occasionally they would rise considerably above the surface of the water and expose large portion of they body to we view the excitement occasion among all on board by the appearance of so many of these terrible monster greatly quicken we dull spirit and tend much to alleviate the lonesomeness occasion by the monotony of the sea voyage no one who have never experience it can form a idea of how the mind be depressed and benumb by the monotony of sea life the night drag along so slowly and the day -- they seem to have no end one will often loose he bearing so completely that he know neither what day of the week it be nor whether it be forenoon or afternoon without keep a diary or record of some kind it would be difficult for many to keep a sure run of the date ordinarily one sit down early in the morning _ to wait for the evening to draw by _ and often it happen when it seem to he that he have wait the length of three day on the land he be mortify by the announcement that it be yet far from be noon a eternal present seem to swallow up both the past and the future after a week or two of such weary wait one feel as if he have forget almost every thing that happen before the day of he leave home i remark one day to a company of passenger on deck that i could scarcely recall any thing that have happen in the past indeed it require quite a effort to remember that i have ever be in america or anywhere else except on the old manhattan in a everlasting voyage yes observe one of the company and i hear a fellow say yesterday that time seem so long to he that he have really forget how many child he have there be little doubt that if a ship-load of passenger could be suddenly and unexpectedly land upon the grassy slope of a verdant hillside many would under momentary impulse of overwhelming pleasure kiss the dear earth as columbus do on landing at san salvador if indeed extreme joy do not impel they to make themselves ridiculous by imitate old nebuchadnezzar in commence to graze on the herbage but the longest day must have a end and so have sea voyage the first sight of land on Saturday morning July 3rd everybody come upon deck in hope of see land a report be soon circulate that the sailor with they telescope have already see the mountain of ireland those passenger that have telescope or opera glass soon bring they upon deck some say they see the land but other use the same glasee could see nothing this create a pleasant excitement with but little satisfaction however except a lively hope of soon see _ terra firma _ again at about 8:00 o'clock -lrb- 4:00 o'clock penna time -rrb- it be believe by the passenger generally that land be really in sight when i first see the outline of the mountain through the mist and cloud that hang near the horizon it stand out so clear and bold that i feel surprised at not have be able to see it long before as some other have there be some who could not see the land till a hour afterwards the inexperienced must first _ learn _ before they will know _ how _ to see land the first light-house -lrb- one sixty mile from queenstown -rrb- come into view at 9:35 be we pass it at 10:00 o'clock white sea-gull come one or two day ' journey into the sea to meet the ship and follow they for food these have be increase from a early hour and amount to about fifty in number in the afternoon it seem as if they wing would never tire all-day long they fly after the ship sometimes even come over the deck near the passenger a great excitement prevail on board during the whole day because a number of we passenger be to leave we there while these be get ready to depart and bidding good-by to they many friend on board many of we be busy write letter to we friend and relative in america those letter be take on to queenstown there mail and bring the first news of we safe passage across the atlantic we be still a day from liverpool but it be a day of pleasure the danger of the deep be now forget the strong wind of the ocean have abate and health and happiness over all on board prevail we course continue along the coast of ireland and wale at about 4:00 o'clock pm the little steamer lord lyon come up to we ship to fetch the passenger that be bind for queenstown a company of fruit-woman come on board with gooseberry raspberry and many other good thing with which they feed we famished passenger these be we first fruit of the season and be highly relish by all the vegetation of ireland be remarkable for its fresh green color we all agree that we have never see such a rich green color before emerald isle -lrb- the _ green island _ -rrb- be a very appropriate name for ireland we see many light-house and beautiful castle hang upon the rocky shore or stand proudly upon command eminence steamer keep so close to the shore in sailing from queenstown to liverpool that the land be nearly always in sight on Sunday morning July 4th the charming field of ireland have be exchange for the lofty mountain of wale we pass holyhead at 9:00 o'clock and liverpool come into sight at 1:30 pm a hour later we come so near to the coast that the individual tree of a shady wood upon the shore could readily he discern by 3:25 we have enter the mersey and half-speed be order five minute later we anchor and be touch by a tender here we learn what custom-house officer be for every trunk carpet-bag and satchel have to be open for they and they busy hand be run all through we wardrobe in order to detect any smuggling that might be attempt they will examine every trunk or chest & c from top to bottom they do not search we pocket however but short of that they be require to do most anything disagreeable to the traveler as it be Sunday all the shipping be tessellate with the color of every nation it be a grand sight to see acre upon acre of ship so profusely decorate with flag that it seem as if the sky be ablaze with they brilliant color we own manhattan sail proudly into port with twenty-six flag streaming from she mast-head and rigging after we have pass muster we pass over a kind of bridge or gangway from the manhattan into a little steamer that have come down the river to fetch we how glad we be to leave the good old ship and bind into the arm of another that promise to take we ashore in a very few minute it be a glorious time we have come to regard the manhattan as a prison-house from which we have long desire to take we leave if we only could but now that the parting hour have come how change we feeling as the little boat sail away we feel sorry to leave she and commence to call she by pet name good-by dear ` manhattan ' many thanks to you for carry we so safely across the deep wide sea cry many of we while other give the customary _ three cheer _ and wave they hat though we leave she empty behind -- no friend and no acquaintance remain there still we continue to wave we handkerchief at she so long as we could see she and have ever since remember she as the noblest of all the ship that be in harbor that day she color seem the brightest and a hundred happy passenger separate that hour that will never cease to sing she praise permit I kind reader to add one line more and in that line make mention of life-boat no 5 you may not be able to understand it or to appreciate how a small party of we passenger come to regard she as almost a sacred thing but there be a few that know the spell and who will ever bless the page that tell the tale thither we go when the wind blow harder and the wave roll higher when we head become heavier and we step unsteady she hang at or near the center of the ship where there be the least rock or swing of all place in the whole vessel during day-time we lay down beneath she shade and at night we would sit by she side relate to each other we feeling and experience & c when sea-sickness have leave we company we agree upon that place as we general rendezvous by day and by night for the remainder of the voyage there we spend we day and there we meet every night if we sleep be interrupt by a storm at the midnight hour thither would we go for relief a thousand recollection gather around that boat and bind we heart together there as with so many cord because we heart meet there in fond remembrance therefore will we never forget the place step ashore i have bid adieu to all my acquaintance before leave the steamer and consequently go ashore quite by myself i do not experience that pierce thrill through my system as i have expect to on touch the firm earth again for we have see the shore so long before we could land that all its novelty have disappear chapter ii liverpool traveling-bag in hand which contain my entire wardrobe i now go in search of a hotel the angel hotel be soon point out to I and on enter it i learn that several of my fellow-passenger have already take room there it be entirely under the control of lady be manage by a proprietress and female clerk the house be a excellent one and the accommodation be first-class it bear a very appropriate name after partaking of a hardy supper i walk out to take a look at europe at 6:45 pm i enter st peter 's church and be conduct to a pew here as elsewhere in europe the young and the old of both sex occupy the same seat together one of the little boy of the family occupy the same pew with I give I a hymn-book a part of the exercise consist in chant psalm the eagle lectant and the bible character represent in the stain glass of the window soon enlist my attention but the meaning of have two bird perch upon a high stand in the middle of the church i could not unfold nor be there any one about that could tell I the next day i see the same bird beside a noble female form in the museum what bird be that say i to a by-stander that figure say he be the emblem of liverpool and the bird be the _ liver _ which abound down in the pool and after which the place be first name st luke 's be visit after service the chorister seem much pleased to meet a american and show I every mark of attention when ask whether all the church of liverpool have they chancel in the _ east _ end he answer in the affirmative i afterwards find this to be true all over europe the dead be bury everywhere so as to face the rise sun around st john 's the memorial slab lie flat upon the grave ih with a cross over the h be engrave upon the tombstone of the catholic these same letter ih equivalent to je or jesus be to be see in almost every church and chapel in all christian europe upon goblet chrismatory and cross in the church they be generally write in gold while myriad of cross on headstone in the graveyard bear the same mystical letter various other interpretation be give to they by

_ king charle stand on this tower September _ 24 1645 _ and see he army defeat on rowton moor _ _ the row _ be a very curious feature of the two principal street run at right angle to each other besides the ordinary walk or pavement of these street there be a continuous covered gallery through the front of the second story some one have say great be the puzzle of the stranger as to whether the roadway be down in the cellar or he be upstairs on the landing or the house have turn outside of the window on this upstairs street as some call it be situate all the first-class shop the other be in the lower story on a level with the road picture to yourself a row of house have porch in the second story but not in the first and you have a correct idea of the row of chester to compare they to the arcade of rue de rivoli in paris be a mistake as they do not resemble those more than a porch over a pavement resemble one in the second story the cathedral be a grand old church it be build in the latter part of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century upon the same site where two of its predecessor have already crumble into decay _ st john 's church _ be even more ancient than the cathedral have be build in the eleventh century i shall never forget its weather-beaten wall and its mossy roof in many place the thickness of the wall be greatly reduce by the rain and hail that have wash and beat against it so long in my ramble through chester i have the good fortune of meeting and form the acquaintance of a irish catholic priest and a wine merchant from wolverhampton two intelligent and amiable gentleman who teach I much about those curious relic still find in heap among the ruin of old chester at about 2:00 o'clock we stand upon the high square : tower of st john 's -lrb- thirty-five foot each side at the top -rrb- amidst the elderberry and grass which flourish at that giddy height look at the town from this elevation one get no idea of its _ unique _ feature as the numerous slate-roof give it the appearance of a modern town the descent be make with difficulty land even attend with some danger for the long wooden stair or ladder be become shaky and a break of one of its step might precepitate one from such a height that instant death be the most desirable alternative but who would not become bold or even sometimes more that amid such surroundings when one say we _ can not _ get there another be sure to declare that we _ must _ get there what would you come so far to see antiquity and then count you step how near you would approach she eight bell constitute the peal in this venerable old tower near by stand the ivy-clad and moss-covered ruin of portion of the sacred edifice that date back even to the earlier age of the christian era and from among the dust and rubbish be pick up the broken image of hideous-looking idol that be the ornament -lrb- -rrb- of the temple once stand there we find a large collection of those ghastly-looking idol pile away in the crypt of the church whether the emblem of druid or christian worship these image cut out of stone evidently represent a age in which the heart be subdue by superstitious fear rather than by _ love _ the wall merit especial attention they still surround the city completely and form in a certain sense the proudest and most admirable promenade that the world afford anywhere from it be obtain the best view of the cathedral and of the country around the ascent to it be make by a flight of step on the north side of the east-gate a ditch or canal about twenty-five foot wide run all around the wall and use to render the batter of the wall a matter of extreme difficulty before the invention of powder and the introduction of fire-arm the pavement on top of the wall be four and a half to six foot wide and skirt on both side by thinner wall that on the outside be about four or five foot high from behind this wall the soldier would hurl spear javelin & c at the attack enemy and keep they in check how thing have change since that time now this walk form the peaceful and delightful promenade of the private citizen here meet the young and the gay fashion display its gaudiest color and lover take they moonlight stroll such be the use now make of the wall of chester america have no walled city europe have but few without wall in the early history of europe every town even have its wall in many place where the wall have almost disappear there be still remain the gate of the city at those point the wall be make doubly strong and high and impregnable tower build over they in which be station strong guard to defend the gate then no stranger could enter without some kind of pass from recognize authority do not the system of pass-port which have be hand down to we day but which seem to be fall into disuse even in europe have its origin in this way at 5:40 i leave chester for birmingham on we way we pass crewe one of the great railroad center of england at this station _ five hundred _ train pass each other every twenty-four hour we arrive at birmingham at 8:45 pm between wolverhampton and birmingham lie the great ore and manufacturing district of england ore-bed and smoke-stack cover all the area some thirty mile long and sixteen mile wide except that occupy by the miserable cottage -lrb- some of they mere hovel -rrb- of the laborer look at this immense area from the car it present the appearance of one continuous town no wonder that england can accommodate a population of some twenty odd million on a area but little more than that of pennsylvanium when poor humanity be thus crowd together in the car i have form the acquaintance of a sociable party of lady and gentleman who point out place to I and instruct I concern the manners and social habit of the people from liverpool hither i find very small brick house the rule and spacious building like we pennsylvanium farm house the exception barn i see none small stable supply they place even on large farm we see several very fine castle by the way however birmingham be know as the toy-shop of europe but most of the toy be for child of larger growth one can nowhere see richer sight than in the show-room of many of these shop one that i visit a glass show-room contain chandelier price upward of a thousand dollar and all variety of fancy-wares of every description have large mirror at the end of the room cover the entire wall and produce the grandest effect conceivable the object in the room be thus infinitely multiply in both direction so that whichever way one turn he face glitter glassware be see as far as the eye could reach such sight be simply bewilder it be a little difficult to gain admittance to the manufacturing department of many of these place but to literary character that represent newspaper the door be generally open quite readily in hunting these shop i discover a great want of system in the naming and numbering of the street of this otherwise quite elegant city i have pass a certain street twice from end to end in search of a particular number upon further inquiry i learn that what i have consider one street be number and name as two though there be not the slightest deviation from a perfectly straight line at any point of it to make bad worse the house be count and number upward on one side of the street and downward on the other side in such a city the stranger must find place by _ speculation _ strange thing one meet at every step in europe and soon get so use to it that it seem the strangest to see something that be not strange but oddity be perhaps no plentier on one side of the atlantic than they be on the other and be equally amusing everywhere upon the burial ground of st philip 's stand a monument in honor and memory of a wife that die at the age of fifty-nine year which have a bee-hive and the inscription : she look well to the way of she household and do not eat the bread of idleness a number of fine statue adorn some of the public square one of these a bronze statue to _ peel _ face _ east _ while _ priestley 's _ marble statue face _ south _ the first thing that arrest the tourist 's attention on arrive at birmingham be its magnificent railroad station the largest and finest that i have thus far meet with in england as it be late in the evening when i arrive i have no time to pay much attention to it until the next day the part enter by the train be about 1050 foot long and 200 foot wide all in one apartment this part be spring by forty-two immense iron arch support a roof half of whose cover be glass the numerous track be separate by platform run lengthwise through the building from which the passenger enter the car in order to avoid the danger of cross the track there be a fine foot-bridge eighteen foot wide run across the track above the reach of the locomotive stack from this bridge stair descent to the platform between the track as before mention three hundred train pass through this station every twenty-four hour a officer receive and dismiss these train by means of a signal-bell the ticket-office be in the second story of a large building adjoining railroad in europe there be no conductor upon the train after they leave the station -lrb- which by the way i never hear any one call depot in europe -rrb- but officer be station at the head of every stairway to punch the ticket five minute before any particular train leave the ticket-office be close and the conductor pass through the car and inspect the ticket if any one do come into a wrong car or train there be still time leave to correct the mistake ticket be not collect till one 's destination be reach where they _ must _ be deliver to the door-keeper on leave the station without it a passenger be a prisoner railroading be so perfectly systemize in europe that it be quite impossible either to cheat a company or to be cheat out of one 's time by miss train there be little danger of miss a train even in country where one can not speak the language the car be divide into compartment _ -lrb- ger abtheilungen -rrb- _ of two seat or bench each run across the car with door at the side in 1st class car the seat be finely cushion and the compartment be about as invite in appearance as we palace car in 2nd class car the seat be comfortable but common but 3rd class car have only bare wooden bench there be in some country 4th class car which have no seat i do not see any of those but from what i learn of other they must resemble we freight car in those too passenger have the privilege of standing or sit down accord to they taste or comfort ticket to 1st class car cost about the same as in this country 2nd class ticket cost three-fourths and 3rd class about half as much in hilly section of the country the railway generally cross the wagon road by bridge but wherever the two kind of road intersect each other on a level travel on the latter be interrupt by gate and watchman who permit no one to pass while a train be approach the cross thus every railway cross in europe be superintended day and night by watchman these watchman be notice by signal-bell at the departure of every train run in the direction of they crossing under such a system accident be impossible even the door of each compartment be bar by the conductor before the train be dismiss and will not be open by the conductor of the next station until the train stand still the ticket besides contain the ordinary matter on ticket in this country have also the price print upon they some of the station of the old world be building of extraordinary beauty and magnificence the grandest structure of this kind be probably the station -lrb- ger _ station _ or _ bahnhof _ italian _ stazione _ -rrb- of stuttgart among many other might also be mention the station of pari of turin of milan and of rome but the great western station of london lake the palm of those all for magnificence beauty and convenience combine what the station at clapham -lrb- seven mile above london -rrb- look like i do not know but it be say that from 1000 to 1200 train run through it every twenty-four hour what multitude of people must be streaming over the platform and past the window of the ticket-office of such a station every day at birmingham and at crewe where 300 and 500 train pass daily the swarm thousand remind one of _ flood _ and _ inundation

soldier poet and other eminent person that have flourish within the last five or six century a mere catalogue of whose name would fill whole page it seem odd enough to a american to find large graveyard in the interior of church and cathedral and to see monument tomb and altar-tomb with the effigy of person lie in state have all kind of animal -lrb- they crest -rrb- lie at they foot but a day in westminster will accustom one to such scene arm and crest in england it be very common to place the crest of the nobility with they effigy upon they tomb thus mary queen of scot have the lion

griffin even literary character be not without they shakespeare for example have adopt the falcon rise argent support a spear in pale Sunday in london on Sunday morning July 18th i start out at random to find a church where religious service be hold before go far i come to a large church edifice -lrb- st pancra -rrb- where number of people be assemble from all direction and gradually fill up that capacious building which have seat for about 3000 worshiper upon the portico i meet the superintendent of the mission house who have accompany the vicar of st pancra on a visit to canada some year ago and who seem as much pleased to meet a american as i be benefit by he kind attention and accommodation for three-fourth of a hour he answer I question and explain the organization of the church of england which by the way be quite as complicate as the organization of the civil government of a nation arch-bishop bishop vicar canon dean chapter curate & c constitute a list of ecclesiastical dignitary whose function be not very easily define and comprehend by a stranger just before service commence he conduct I to a seat near the pulpit rev thorold the officiate clergyman be a very able speaker and make the first attempt at argument in he discourse that i have yet listen to in england preaching in england like the recite of prayer be all so much blank assertion -- no more and no less i have never before so feel the force of _ unquestioned authority _ as i learn to feel and appreciate it in the service of the episcopal church of england the very fact of argue a question be in itself a compromise of its one-sidedness and of the infallibility of the position the preacher may have take but let the clergy of a entire nation read the same mass and recite the same prayer in all they congregation and let they refrain from discuss scriptural text and all give one and the same answer to each and every question and there will soon be a end of sectarianism the best reasoning have always provoke more doubt than it have establish faith and in consequence ever be more fruitful of contention than of peace so long as a people be one-minded they will be peaceful and contend even if they be bind in wretched slavery but the tide of revolution have set in at london and the church begin to tremble and the clergy to argue in the afternoon the weather be very fair i go to hyde park this park have a area of 388 acre upon which may be see all the wealth and fashion and splendid equipage of the nobility and gentry of england a meeting of the radical have be announce and placard over the city invite all workingman to be present and enter they protest against parliament appropriate any money to the prince of wale for defray the expense of he contemplated trip to india the novelty of see a political meeting on _ Sunday _ and that too on the part of the republican in monarchial england be enough to entice I thither so i go early and spend a hour with a silver-haired clergyman upon a settee under the shade of a tree not far from the reform tree around which as this gentleman inform I the nucleus of radical meeting be always form on my way to the park i be accompany for some distance by a certain policeman -lrb- whose acquaintance i have form during the week -rrb- to he i express my surprise at see great britain compromise the sacredness of the sabbath with radical republicanism and rationalism well say he if we let they have they own way they will come here and hold they meeting and after they have listen to they leader awhile and cheer right lustily they will scatter and that be the end of it but when we interfere there be no tell where the matter will end in 1866 we once close the park against they and the consequence be a riot in which the police suffer severely from brick-bat and the mob finally take hold of the iron fence and tear it away for a long distance along the park make they entry and take they own way well could you not have punish those offender accord to due process of law i ask yes he rejoin we might but they number be so great that we could never have finish try they all thus it often happen that what be criminal for one or several to do go unpunished when a thousand offend and besides they open the way to new privilege and greater liberty at 3:00 o'clock a mighty flood of the reform party head by bradlaugh and watt march into the park and soon a large meeting of many thousand be form which increase in number as long as the speaker continue to address they it be a striking feature of these reform agitation perhaps of every revolutionary movement that have ever be undertake and accomplish that they be head and lead by man whose personal influence embody the whole power of the organization and whose word and command be they supreme law this meeting be variously estimate at between 20000 and 50000 person and this immense concourse of people be we perfectly under the control of cha bradlaugh as the best organize army can be under its general this harmony must be attribute to the fact that the movement be a spontaneous one in which each member participate because he like the leader and he principle it be a encouraging feature of these reformer that they do not despise _ everything _ that the past have hand down to we time as the hot-blooded communist of pari seem to be incline to do in the late _ crisis _ the dress of these agitator speak nothing about bloody revolution as do the red cap and slouch hat of the political reformer of europe of earlier time bradlaugh for a example wear a black dress coat silk dress hat lay-down collar and black necktie and carry a cane the great majority of the meeting wear also the fashionable stove-pipe these thing and the sound judgment of the leader promise peaceable reform but the boundless enthusiasm of the mass of they when imflammatory remark be make betray the existence of feeling that be akin to pen up volcano and may break out in violent eruption when least expect there be certainly fire enough in european republicanism to impel they on to mighty effort when the proper time come the part play by several lady in this movement have a salutary influence for moderation and order mr besant and the two daughter of mr bradlaugh be always accompany he wherever he lecture in london a table be place in the center of a circle form around the leader and upon this mr bradlaugh take he stand in address the meet he voice be far more powerful than that of any other man that i have ever hear and by the use of medicine which he elder daughter -lrb- alice -rrb- reach up to he very frequently during he speech he keep it perfectly clear to the end though in these open air meeting he often stand in the face of 10000 to 100000 person speak by the hour with a force quite equal to the roaring of a lion this violent exercise of he vooal organ he sometimes repeat several time every day for a month in succession display power of endurance which be perhaps not equal by any other live orator it be a exciting scene to behold acre of hat becloud the sky while cheer rend the air and to see a field white with hand when vote be take only three person in this entire meeting vote in favor of grant the prince of wale the $ 700000 ask for while some acre of people vote against it it should be remember that this be a meeting of the _ extreme _ branch of the republican party in london there be a more moderate party head by leader who only despise royalty but abide with the church and the christian religion and which be say to be far more numerous than the extremist be in the evening the radical have a meeting in the hall of science where mr bradlaugh address they on the subject of religion and social ethic he discourse here be generally very abtruse none but a very intelligent audience and educate in he system of philosophy would understand he logic or appreciate he wit and humor at the expense of royalty and christianity the hall will hold about 1500 adult and he congregation -lrb- -rrb- be a mixed one comprise both sex just like all church organization after which it be a copy there be no pray but the miss brad laugh render music upon a melodian or organ both before and after the lecture in place of the collection they charge a small admittance which become a source of considerable revenue as the hall be crowd at almost every meeting i must here record one more feature which imply besides the oratorical power and progressive originality of the father a intensity of interest on the part of a daughter in she father 's view such as be seldom witness miss alice b will from the begin to the end of every lecture keep the eye of she father watch every change of he countenance from the flush of a glowing enthusiasm to the pallor of bitter contempt catch every syllable he utter reflect with beam smile every happy hit he make and sink down to the paleness of utter disdain with he when he come to the recital of the heartless oppression of the aristocracy continually follow he remark with such a interest as if she be see and hear he for the first time in she life i have give a somewhat lengthy account of these radical meeting and rationalistic sentiment not on account of they popularity in england for though hundred of thousand endorse the movement in london and a number of other

french and be on he way to pari to spend he vacation there he offer at once very kindly to assist I in pari and i feel from that moment that i should be ten-fold luckier in make my entry into pari than i have thus far have reason to expect the train leave london at 6:35 pm and be to make connection with a steamer for calai -lrb- pron k -lrb- -rrb- a -rrb- l' -lrb- -rrb- i -rrb- -rrb- thence by rail to pari reach the latter place the next afternoon the through ticket 3rd class from london to pari cost 21 shilling distance 262 mile soon after leave london i discover that i be surround by the

paris _ pleasantly even if we be to be confine to the car and the boat with the exception of a few hour we cross the strait of dover at about midnight though not _ unaware _ as i have no fear of get sea-sick upon the strait of dover i take my seat on the deck in confidence of a pleasant voyage mr l soon ask I whether i do not expect to get sick state that she be in great fear of it i reply that i hope we passage be too short for get sick as the wave be not apt to rise very high in such a narrow strait but i be mistake the sick be soon moan in every direction my gay companion all disappear except the old gentleman and he younger daughter a large steamship of 3000 ton burden would probably show more dignity but the little steamer upon which we have take passage be as fiercely knock about by the wave and make fully as much ado about it as the old manhattan ever do in the middle of the atlantic the young lady be keep close to she father and have already cease to laugh when i ask he the last time about they health _ he _ be well but the young lady be also become dizzy from the rock and turn pale at the terror of the sea i hasten to the cabin below and seek relief in lie down be both weary and giddy i soon fall into a sleep from which i do not wake until we reach calai the train for pari be not to leave until the next morning so i try to find rest and sleep in the wait room but without success by and by a gentleman come round and offer to conduct we to lodge place i follow he into the city through strange street into a strange house and be show to retire in a strange room everything seem in its place however so that i have no occasion for feeling uneasy the next morning i rise at break of day and take a long walk through the city of calai to look about and see as much as possible before i have to leave this be my first walk on the continent of europe i look about where i might get breakfast but as most of the business house be not yet open i stand a poor chance into the saloon i would not go as i could not have ask for what i want on account of my inability to speak french my only hope therefore be to find a shop or store that display in the window what i want so that i could make my purchase by gesture i have provide myself with a conversational guide book in london contain the french italian and german equivalent of english word and phrase most necessary to the tourist but the french pronunciation be so difficult that i could after all not make myself understand except by point out these french word to the shop-keeper to give the reader a idea of what mistake a american be apt to make in pronounce french i offer the name of two of the most common article of food they be _ pain _ -lrb- bread -rrb- pronounce pä and _ lait _ -lrb- milk -rrb- pronounce l -lrb- = a -rrb- i succeed however later in the morning when the shop be generally open to procure a breakfast whereupon after have visit a very antique church and examine the strong fortification of the city i start for the railway station on my way thither i pass the open door of a saloon in which mr and mr l whose friendship i have form the previous day sit at coffee it be a pleasant surprise and i take my seat with they drink coffee for the benefit of the milk -lrb- _ du lait _ -rrb- which i pour into it this do mr l invite I to accompany he to they hotel to see what a nice place they have find last night it be a excellant hotel and as we approach the beautiful flower-bed which line the path lead to the entrance they daughter come down the walk and greet we the old gentleman remark that they have be inquire last night what have become of I it be very pleasant and agreeable to fall into such society and to behold the cloth spread and the china and glass ware set with a excellent breakfast -lrb- a regular home-fashion scene -rrb- after one have spend several hour in lingual conflict for a breakfast and see nothing but the outside of old weather-beaten house i take my seat with the english party and my french friend -lrb- prof p -rrb- in the same car and leave calai at 7:20 be everything look strange again even more so than when i first come to england everybody except we english company speak french and the car the building and the ticket and conductor seem all different from what i be accustom to in england the house which we see from the train be small and cover with tile like those which i have see in northwestern england we soon pass burial grounds in which the grave be head with cross in place of marble slab for tombstone large quantity of peat and the white stone quarry in the chalk formation next arrest we attention though it be the 22nd of July haying be not yet finish some of the farmer be however engage in reap both they wheat and barley at 8:34 be the english channel come again into view thus we pass along enjoy the scenery of belle france -lrb- beautiful france -rrb- but by and by we become tired of watch landscape to see odd style of architecture and watch the strange way about a people may afford a pleasant diversion for a time but the eye too become tired of look a striking feature about the agriculture be the smallness of many of the field there be no fence the field be distinguish by they crop some of they be but several rod in extent the various color which the different kind of vegetable assume in they progress of growth and ripen make the landscape look like a immense expanse of checkered carpet exceedingly beautiful to behold when these scene seem no longer to be charming or we have become too fatigue to appreciate they we commence to amuse ourselves in game joke and trick of which the traveler see and enjoy he fill gambling which be such a wide-spread social evil in america be prohibit or restrict to certain fixed day of the year in some country of europe but game of various kind be play by the best society almost everywhere notwithstanding all the argument that may be advance in favor of game at chess and back-gammon as exercise in mental gymnastics and of play card as afford pleasant diversion for mixed party the diligent tourist like the industrious student should not squander much of he time at it chapter viii pari in the middle of the afternoon we reach the northern railway terminus _ -lrb- embarcadere du nord -rrb- _ in pari this magnificent station cover nearly 10 acre of ground the arrival and departure shed in the center be 230 metre long and 70 metre wide -lrb- the meter be equal to 39370079 inch -rrb- its facade be 180 metre long 38 metre -lrb- about 125 foot -rrb- high and consist of a lofty central arch and two lateral arch this impose front be adorn with twenty-three colossal statue of noble female figure represent the follow principal city of europe : pari -lrb- surmount the central arch -rrb- londre st petersburg berlin frankfort vienne bruixelle cologne amsterdam donaus dunkerque boulogne compeigne st quentin cambraus beauvai lille armien rouen arras laon calai valengien -lrb- 1864 -rrb- there be a number of other very fine railway station in pari but we can only take room to define they area the largest be the strasbourg railway terminus nearly 13 acre in extent while the western railway terminus cover a area of 5 acre as soon as we train have stop i follow my french companion -lrb- prof s -rrb- into the extensive apartment of the station and pass muster i expect to be ask for my passport but slip through unchallenged on pass out into the yard i be again salute by my english friend who be about enter a bus to drive to a hotel in bidding each other good-by and god-speed on we journey i run a great risk of lose my parisian friend in the great multitude of people that throng the yard and pavement but fortunately i find he again in a few minute before we reach the street i be already make to feel that some strange scene and experience be undoubtedly in store for I in pari and likely throughout the rest of my continental tour for i have already observe one of those strange social habit of the parisian in a most public place which the nice delicacy of we language and custom forbid to describe the french the italian and many of the inhabitant of south germany and part of switzerland -- i should say all the sunny land in europe -- have hand down to we day manners and custom which speak in a language that can not be misunderstand and with a force far louder than a whisper that _ it be not very long since man take to dress himself _ in my intercourse with those people from pari to egypt i nowhere observe any baneful influence exert over morality by these practice in question for they be not think about by those people which be guilty of they but many a american will be shock at they and go home declare that such indecency _ must _ lead to immorality even if they have never go to the trouble to see whether they actually _ do _ they pernicious influence upon american taste and manners may be grant but that do not prove that foreigner who be cradle nurse and bring up in these custom will be affect in like manner american and english tourist be alike shock and provoke at the sight of the innumerable nude statue and painting on the pleasure garden and in the art gallery but the lady of the continent seem to see as little of indecency or impropriety in those thing as we do in open we bible and see saint and apostle represent with bare foot -- the _ toe _ stand out naked over the sandal or when we read in the family circle and in the public capacity of teacher and minister passage from scripture such as no one would be capable of read if they be find in a periodical or a newspaper during my first month on the continent i be often vex to think that much of what i see that be not only very interesting and impressive but which have likewise a important bearing on history be of such a nature that it would either constitute unfit material for general diffusion or seem to be incredible to the average reader we go down boulevard -lrb- pron bool ` var ' -rrb- de magenta about one-third of a mile to boulevard de strasbourg -lrb- pron straw ` boor ' -rrb- thence along that avenue -lrb- -rrb- to the foot of it -lrb- another third of a mile -rrb- and continue we walk down boulevard de sebastopol to rue de rivoli along which latter street we go half a mile west where my friend guide and teacher procure for I a room not far from _ he _ home -lrb- with this gentleman i spend from three to five hour daily during my first stay of fifteen day in walk about the city see sight and study french reading and pronunciation -rrb- as soon as i have take my room i retrace my step to the railway station and fetch my sachel this time alone it be not a little task for the distance from my quarter which be near the center of pari to the station be over two mile the name of the boulevard magenta strasbourg and sebastopol i be constantly repeat in my mind so that i might not forget the way that i have come with my friend the first time it be dark by the time i reach my lodging place the second time but i have see and learn enough for one day almost two mile of _ boulevard _ and nearly half a mile of rue de rivoli -lrb- the finest _ rue _ in pari -rrb- thrice walk that afternoon have present to I more that be new than i have expect to see in a week the boulevard like a dozen other of the distinguish feature of pari be _ new thing _ to the american and as they be quite different from anything that i have yet see of the kind in this country i shall here take room to note some of they striking characteristic they be the grandest street in paris sustain about the same relation to the rue that the avenue in we american city sustain to the street in the french nomenclature the name apply the different class of thoroughfare & c run as follow : 1st avenue 2nd boulevard 3rd rue 4th allee or ruelle and 5th passage -lrb- pron pahsahje -rrb- in america the corresponding term be 1st avenue 2nd -- 3rd street 4th alley and 5th passage it will be observe that we have here nothing to correspond with the boulevard in the classification here present the term avenue be to designate thoroughfare of great width and shaded with row of tree on each side as be the avenue in washington dc in most american city the avenue be diagonal street or opening connect distant point of the city but this definition lose most of its force when apply to european city as they be not build square or rectangular champ elysee intersect a fine and extensive reservation -lrb- have many of the characteristic of the pleasure garden -rrb- extend from the jardin des tuilery -lrb- garden of the tuilery -rrb- to the arc de triomphe -lrb- the arch of triumph -rrb- its length be a mile and a quarter and the garden or park of which it be the grand thoroughfare be in one place about a third of a mile in width the building be consequently a considerable distance off from this carriage-way but in the boulevard nothing except the pavement intervene between the street and the house the boulevard of pari be its widest as well as its noblest street the pavement on each side of they be in many instance from twenty-five to thirty foot in width thick row of large and elegant shade-tree border they on both side and under these be placed numerous wooden settee for the accommodation of the public many of the 6000 cafe which be strew over pari grace these boulevard with they glass front during the summer season most of the refreshment and meal be serve in front of the cafe on the pavement and grand be the sight of see ten thousand gay parisian seat along these splendid street chatter away over they wine and coffee pari be about five mile long by four mile wide and few be the house in the entire city that be less than five or six story high a few only of the outer street have as low as four and five story house these house be mostly build of stone have stone floor even each room be arch over from the four wall upon these arch be place the flagstone constitute the next floor and it be in consequence of this arch that each story be so very high the white sandstone of the pari basin constitute the principal build stone the city be divide into seven section and each section be require by law to either scrape the front of they house once every seven year so that the wall look new again or to paint they anew no proprietor can choose he time but when the year be come for he section to repair they house it must be do in consequence of this regulation the street never look _ checkered _ by old and new house contrast with each other but the external appearance of the building be make to harmonize and each street be a unit in appearance in the finest part of pari there be few alley or stable but splendid rue and boulevard line with magnificent building with elegant front have take they place this section be over three mile in length nearly two in width and present scene of beauty grandeur and magnificence which be _ unrivaled _ by anything that the first other city of the world have ever bring forth its beautiful balcony as numerous as the window constitute another very charming feature of parisian scenery the street be always keep clean and wet by sweeper and sprinkler and the broad smooth pavement along the boulevard free from dust and all manner of rubbish or obstruction afford a suitable promenade for gayety wealth and fashion to roam here beauty 's foot may stray array in the most showy color or the stateliest attire without fear of encounter nasty crossing or of be splash over and soil by team upon muddy street lady attire in gaudy ball-room dress with long trail would scarcely present a contrast in dress with the average promenader all dress equally well on sunday and on week-day so that pari present to the foreigner the appearance of a city celebrate a eternal sabbath even when it rain the pedestrian can walk _ for mile _ about the city without be in want of a umbrella in that event he need only confine he course to the arcade and passage webster define a arcade as a long arched building or gallery line on each side with shop may the reader not be mislead by this definition for the arcade of pari do not have shop on _ both _ side they be a uniform system of portico generally from twenty to thirty foot in width those on rue de rivoli be about a mile in length and the house to which they belong have be exempt from tax for thirty year from these ramify numerous passage and other arcade connect different part of the city a passage -lrb- pron pä-sahj -rrb- be a street cover with a glass roof elegantly pave animal and vehicle exclude or shut off and line by the first-class shop in the city the most remarkable be the passage des panoramas jouffroy verdean vivienne colbert choiseul delorine du saumon & c the first of these be the most brilliant and be perhaps not excel or even equal by any other in the world with the solitary exception of passage des victor emanuel of milan in italy some of these passage be call gallery the galerie d'orlean in palais royal be a good example this lofty hall forty foot wide and 300 foot long extend between a double range of shop connect the arcade extend around the other three side of the inner court of that palace -lrb- now turn into shop bazaar etc -rrb- many of the grand boulevard and rue of pari have be build since 1848 and the work of widen and improve old street and build new one be still go on with constantly increase vigor there be now in progress of construction broad boulevard which can only be construct at the sacrifice of many acre of some of the finest building in pari but only beauty and grandeur be regard anything in this noble city expense be but little estimated notwithstanding the lavish expenditure of money upon this class of improvement paris be of all city perhaps the most prosperous on the globe of the wide-spread destruction of public building occasion by the late war and the stormy day of the commune there be but few mark remain the palace of the tuilery hotel de ville and a few other building lie still in ruin but the thirty or more church which be either greatly damage or quite demolish and numerous other public edifice that have be destroy have already be restore -- some of they with increase magnificence besides this the french have almost finish pay they immense war-debt while america whose war end seven year before theirs be oblige to sail into the centennial year still heavily freight with the obnoxious burden do heaven ever smile upon a more bless city than pari to give the reader a idea of how building be tear down to make room for the purpose of extend fine street let we refer to the statistics concern rue de rivoli this street cost $ 30000000 it be two mile in length and its establishment cause the demolition of upward of one thousand house thirty million of dollar enough to pay for a tract of land that be twenty mile long and eleven mile wide buy at the rate of $ 200 per acre and all this expend on the improvement of two mile of road in the old world a strip of three to five or six story house several hundred foot wide and a quarter of a mile to upward of a mile in length be tear down with as much complacent indifference concern the destruction as man manifest in mow so much grass as among the most fashionable place in pari may be mention boulevard des italiens palais royal champ elysee jardin des tuilery and other pleasure garden and public square boulevard des italiens in fair weather be densely crowd with lady and gentleman seat on chair hire for two to three sous -lrb- cent -rrb- each the city clear over $ 7000 a year from this source of revenue but several hundred step toward the west of this street stand the academic de musique -lrb- the most splendid opera-house in the world -rrb- and the grand hotel -- two of the most brilliant edifice in the city palais royal as it now stand be complete in 1786 this building like most of the palace in europe be build around a quadrangle and its plan may be compare to a pupil 's slate use for cipher the frame correspond to the form or ground-plan of the building and the slate to the court or yard which they inclose this inner court or garden 700 foot long and 300 foot wide contain nearly five acre of land be plant with lime -lrb- linden -rrb- tree from end to end and two flower garden in the middle be a fine _ jet d'eau _ -lrb- a fountain -rrb- the garden be thus arrange in 1799 it contain bronze copy of diane a la biche of the louvre and the apollo belvedere two modern statue in white marble one of a young man about to bathe by d'espercieux the other of a boy struggle with a goat by lemoine ulyss on the sea-shore by bra and eurydice sting by the snake by nanteuil a fine copy in bronze but more fit for a gallery than the place it now occupy near this statue be a _ solar cannon _ which be fire by the sun when it reach the meridian and regulate the clock of palais royal from the privilege of supply refreshment and from the hiring of chair the government derive a annual rent of $ 7000 the shop under the arcade be chiefly devote to article of luxury and be among the most elegant in paris many restaurant be on the first floor here be formerly the gambling-house which render this place so notorious the best time for visit palais royal be in the evening when the garden and arcade be brilliantly illuminate and full of people the shop of the watch-maker and the diamond window be then particularly brilliant in the most magnificent window the article have no price mark but in the best window in which the article have price mark i see locket price $ 200 ring for $ 900 ear-ring for $ 1000 a pair a pair of diamond stud for $ 2800 cross for $ 320 and a necklace worth $ 3000 palais royal have be call the capital of pari during the early part of the first revolution its garden become the resort of the most violent politician here the tri-coloured cockade be first adopt and the popular party decide on many of its bolder measure there be little room for doubt that the cafe one of the characteristic feature of french society be a potent factor in civilize and refine the human race in these latter time religion and intelligence -- moral idea moral habit and the collective knowledge of we ancestor -- have be transmit from one generation to another down to we time by the church and the school principally but the affair of the human race have take a new turn since the invention of printing by which the steady development of traditional idea have be arrest so that the propriety of retain the standard of ancient civilization as pattern for the present be be question and discuss everywhere in this great revolutionary era the authority of the past and even the respect naturally due to parent be very generally disregard this latter sad feature of fail to do homage to the aged be not more the result of a lack of love and esteem on the part of child for they parent than of the want of confidence which parent have in themselves we can take a illustration from we young lady a few generation ago the traditional white cap constitute the head-dress of the young maiden among the catechumen when they present themselves for the first time at the altar now in place of have all the head look alike every head must present a different phase we still find section in the old world where all the dress of the young be cut out of the same piece so to say and make after the same pattern so that all the individual of a company be almost as nearly dress alike as soldier in uniform rev bausman in he wayside gleanings page 141 in describe the appearance of people at church in a certain section of germany portray one feature in these word : very pleasant be it to see every lady old and young have she hymn book carefully fold in she white handkerchief the clergy and the monk and nun in europe display like uniformity in they dress in every old picture or painting represent a group or company of person it will be observe that all the individual be dress and comb after the same fashion this incessant yearning and seek for something new be of recent date and the key-note of a universal system of revolution every season bring a new style of dress and what be true of fashion be true of everything else as it would ill become mother to leave they family for a time and learn the milliner ' trade she make choice of one of she daughter to be educate in that trade this young girl after she have learn dressmaking take the place of the mother in the matter of provide clothes for the family and become in a large measure the mistress of the house the same thing happen to the baking department of the family a score of new kind of pie and cake have become fashionable in we day and it be the daughter that have the greatest opportunity to earn this bake of pastry the quickest the consequence be that the mother soon turn out to be only a _ second rate cook _ fully aware that she can neither cook nor make dress she resign she position as head of these department respectively to she daughter who when once master of the culinary and millinery affair will soon be master of the balance of the household affair need i say that the father of this generation be serve about the same way by they son and it be the same between the teacher and the pupil old fogy teacher or he have the old way yet be expression that be too common to require any explanation happily most old teacher have clear the turf and yield they laurel to a host of youngster range in age from about sixteen to twenty year thus all difficulty be surmount in this line and young america have the rein to himself look at the improvement that have result from the effort of inventive genius and at the progress that the art and science have make we be in a _ new world _ so different from that of we forefather that they experience count almost nothing in this new era it be a sad picture to see the young and the inexperienced thus grope in the dark but it be the inevitable consequence of the new turn that thing have take since the inauguration of the _ age of reason _ -lrb- date from the introduction of printing -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- nevertheless the young would display much greater prudence if they would bring many of they scheme and purpose to a lower temperature by sit still when age rise to speak and be they to take heed of the counsel and admonition of those who be older than themselves this radical change in the affair of the world be recognize it become apparent how the power and influence of the church and school must abate in a measure and give scope for a season to a class of institution more fit for revolutionary time this transition era will likely be mark as a glacial period in the history of religion during which time rationalism and infidelity will possibly be rampant in europe if indeed they do not even establish they dominion in america but we may hope for a calm after the storm when thing will be steady down again to a smooth and even flow in this we time the transition era theater opera cafe and the printing press will play a very important part the press for the literary public in general the theater and opera for the social benefit of the upper class and the cafe for the middle and _ large class _ the class which give shape and character to the predominant method of social evolution the first cafe in pari be establish in 1697 by a armenian and like the establishment of the hippodrome in new york by barnum be a success from the begin these institution increase rapidly in number under loui xv and become the favorite resort of distinguished individual at present they abound in every quarter and justly rank among the most remarkable feature of the city be very generally decorate with unrivaled costliness and splendor besides coffee wine beer and other refreshment they frequently provide breakfast and many of they also dinner and supper in 1874 there be over 6000 cafe in pari do business to the amount of $ 24000000 annually or a average income of $ 4000 to each establishment the furniture of the cafe and the plan of conduct its business resemble that of we fashionable ice-cream saloon more than any other establishment that we be acquaint with the hall be furnish with little table or marble-stand surround by chair or costly sofa and every person that enter be expect to order some kind of drink or refreshment as soon as he have take he seat both sex frequent they alike and a grand sight it be to see a brilliant company of lady and gentleman sit in group and couple about these gorgeously decorate hall enjoy they wine and each other 's company thus present scene of gayety and festive pleasure that be seldom outvie even in the ball-room and the

conservatoire and the _ corps de ballet _ consist of the most distinguished dancer of the day great attention be pay to costume and general effect during the matchless performance of a night that i be present there be at one time nine large horse and a procession of several hundred actor upon the stage and it be far from be full one of the most beautiful and astounding performance of the night be the production of a series of transformation that be as sudden and as astonishing in they development as be the metamorphosis of the gaudy butterfly from the grovel worm as the curtain rise there stand upon the stage a mighty fortress massive and strong we have see it but long enough to observe how thick and how rough from age its weather-beaten wall be when there be hear a crash and the mighty citadel have fall out of sight but there still remain a most beautiful castle which must have be contain inside of the citadel but hide from the view by its towering wall this castle be beautiful beyond description it be fairer far than the castle of the king seem to be except when distance lend enchantment to they view but the second scene be as ephemeral as the first we behold its fascinating beauty only a few seconds when its four wall again drop into the abyss below and there issue from its inner apartment a host of beautiful little actress such as i do not see upon any other stage in europe these little fairy-like beauty many perhaps not more than from 5 to 10 year of age all dress in the most brilliant costume at once skip into a dance run the ring and trace the mazy

and almost miraculous appearance at a ball dancing be the favorite amusement in pari and these exercise be conduct on a grand scale even during the summer season i attend a public ball one evening when almost the entire floor -lrb- cover nearly three fourth of a acre -rrb- and the adjoining garden of about the same area be throng by thousand of gay and jovial dancer all wild from the excitement produce by the rhythmical motion and music of that playful exercise incident the reader can not be more curious to know how one that be unacquainted with the french language can get along in pari than i be when i first take up my residence there the first morning i go out to seek some place where i might get fresh milk _ lait _ be the french name of it as i find it in my conversational guide book i soon find that name upon a card of pasteboard hanging at the door of a shop where bread and fruit be display in the window on enter the store a clever frenchman politely address I but he soon discover that i be none of the _ loquacious _ kind in french i ask for _ lait _ pronounce the word as if it be spell l-a-t-e but he do not understand I i could adorn my conversation neither with verb nor with adjective so i repeat the word _ lait _ several time with the rise inflection by which he readily infer that i want something though what that something be remain a mistery to he all the same by and by i point out the word lait to he on see which he exclaim -- du lá and give I what i want thereafter i visit he from two to five time every day accord to convenience to get my du l -lrb- = a -rrb- _ it _ of du pä_in _ -lrb- bread -rrb- and smoked sausage i constantly keep a supply in my satchel so that when i enter a new city i could well get along until i have become acquaint fruit and a very healthy and nutricious kind of nut -lrb- the brazilian nut -rrb- i buy in great abundance and exceedingly cheap from such as hawk they about on the street five to ten centime -lrb- 1 to 2 cent -rrb- would buy 7 or 8 large brazilian nut and 6 to 8 fine juicy pear or as many delicious plum of which i be extremely fond by thus reduce the number and variety of my dish at the regular meal i only enhance the pleasure of the palate instead of reduce they for he who do not eat but when he be hungry nor drink except when he be thirsty will enjoy the humblest meal much more than the pampered dedauchee can relish the richest feast as beer do not please my palate and because the water fountain of pari be often out of my reach when i be thirsty i soon take fruit to supply the place of drink and thus in pari already i lay the foundation of a dietary system that ensure I not only health happiness and convenience of procure it alike in all country but that prove to be very economical too for from 40 to 60 cent a day i supply all the necessaries and more of the luxury of life than most of we be accustom to even in voluptuous america chapter ix versaille on my voyage across the atlantic i have form the friendship of a young clergyman -lrb- rev o -rrb- of new york who wish to make a summer vacation tour through western europe visit ireland scotland england france italy switzerland and germany on compare program we notice that he would likely come to pari during the time that i have alot to that city we therefore agree that each should drop a letter to the other immediately after reach paris so that he who should happen to come last might at once know where to find the other one evening when i come home the card of rev o my american friend be hand to I by the landlord who inform I by he gesture that he have be there to call on I the card be back by a note ask I to meet he at no -- rue -------- though that street be perhaps not more than a eighth of a mile long i soon find it upon my map of pari which be a very excellent one as the map of all large foreign city generally be and must be in order that person who can not speak the language of those city may still be able to find any place without ask any one where they be or which way to go the map of pari for example be divide into numerous square by arbitrary line those which run vertically down the map be letter and those which cross it horizontally be number at the side of the map be a table of all the street with reference to the square on the map designate between what line they be find or which they intersect by the aid of such a map i start out the next morning to meet my friend whose quarter be in a distant part of the city about three mile away i find he without difficulty he be accompany by two gentleman from london that have come with he to see paris and its environs it be both novel and pleasant for two such lonely pilgrim as my new york friend and i be when we leave home to meet each other again in a foreign city and introduce to each other the friend which one pick up by the way we soon agree to go all together to versaille the french capital that day this be Tuesday July 27th at 10:40 be we cross the fortification of pari and soon come into view of bois de boulogne the great park of pari five minute later we cross the seine at st cloud a small town where we stop to see the ruin occasion by the siege of pari in 1870 we have considerable trouble however in identify the stronghold and redoubt hold by the prussian in that memorable siege as nobody seem to understand any of we french on one occasion rev o while ask a lady for a certain place call on mr k -- one of the londoner to come and see whether he could make this woman understand any of _ he _ french it be altogether a day of odd adventure and fun after enjoy the lovely prospects a hour we walk another hour in great perplexity as to what direction we should take to find a railway station where we might take a train for versaille but finally succeed we do not understand more from those who direct we than the direction we should take never know the distance it be more than a joke for a party to be oblige to walk several mile for a station when they have expect to reach it in a quarter or half a mile at most when we arrive at the station at sevre we difficulty only commence when will the next train leave for versaille and where can we procure we ticket be question which engage we best energy and all we ingenuity for half a hour besides a rash adventure on my part before they be solve -lrb- it seem to I now that throughout my tour i always get into more trouble when i have company to rely upon than when i be alone -rrb- by means of motion with we hand and by pronounce the name versaille we make they understand where we intend to go to but when we ask for billet they do not offer we any they show we however that the train be due at 1:10 by point out those figure on the dial of the clock about 15 minute before the train be due we ask again for ticket and when they be again refuse we begin to fear that the ticket have to be procure on the opposite side of the railroad we therefore cross by a foot-bridge near the station but could not approach the house on the other side on account of the high fence which shut every body off from the track when we plan be thus frustrated we company become alarm with the fear that we might miss the train for want of ticket and fail to see versaille that day at this crisis i ascend the bridge and climb down along the wall on the inside of the fence suspend myself from the lowest iron bar along the bridge i thus drop myself into the yard below but we discouragement reach its climax when i find that the door be close and lock which we have hope be the ticket office i could not get out of that inclosure as the fence be high the gate lock and the bridge from which i have drop myself be out of my reach several railroad man see I immediately who appear as much astonished at my come into that place as i be perplex in my awkward position i do not misinterpret they french this time however for the way they look up toward the sky and they gesture and chatter plainly indicate that they wonder where i come from i motion they that i come from above and pointed toward the bridge what fine or punishment might have be inflict for my intrusion i do not know but i be only rebuke in language which i do not understand and send out through one of the office door which they unlock for the purpose my companion be now in great glee at this termination of my adventure one of they observe that i might soon be land in _ close quarter _ at my present rate of progress i respond that we be a party corporate and that three

to see old neptune take he turn we have see the wonder and beauty present by the other fountain as they shoot they silvery column and cloud of vapor high into the air or span they pyramidal basin with innumerable liquid arch intersect each other in every conceivable direction but the grandest sight it be say be still in store for we all the other fountain have commence they playing with humble spasm -- the column rise higher by degree but old neptune take every body by surprise hundred leap and shout for joy when they see that the southern heaven which have be so clear and beautiful but a moment before be suddenly whiten with cloud of vapor upon which the ray of the western sun produce a most charming effect a gentle breeze give to each spout jet a misty tail comet-like in appearance to the admiring spectator a incident which add much to my pleasure and enjoyment of that glorious day deserve notice here as it illustrate that if one even start to make the tour of the world alone so that he may not be detain by the loitering of a companion whose taste and fancy differ from he need not therefore be without pleasant associate when he be in want of they early in the afternoon as i be about take my seat under the shade of a yew-tree on a terrace where i might have a fair view of bassin de latone -lrb- the play of whose liquid arch render it the most _ beautiful _ of all in the garden -rrb- i be accidentally meet by the same english party with whom i have travel from london to pari it be a happy meeting indeed and the incident of we walk and conversation upon that pleasure-garden will ever remain fresh and green on memory 's tablet they have finish they tour of germany and return in time to spend the great day of the month at versaille as the band be discourse excellent music the fountain play and crowd of people streaming hither and thither in the midst of these splendid scene one of the lady pass a remark which i only learn to appreciate fully several month afterwards she say _ i love the quiet english sabbath _ she father have experience before what the continental sabbath be but he daughter though they appreciate these charming scene none the less would have prefer they on week-day for nearly a month of sight-seeing among a people who keep no sunday such as we do have make they long for a day of sweet and silent repose several month later after i have travel through france belgium germany switzerland and italy without find a day of rest such as england and america make of they sunday i feel that even the pleasure-seeker should rest one day in seven often thought of the quiet english and american sabbath chapter x leave pari on the 6th of August after a stay of fifteen happy day in paris i begin to make preparation to leave for brussels i have walk during that time accord to my daily register about 140 mile make a average of over 9 mile per day for i could not avail myself of the omnibus and city car as i have do in london because i could not make myself understand in french pari have present so much that be new or radically different from what i have see elsewhere in the world even london not except that i feel justified in address the follow conclusion to a american journalist : -- in pari there be such a harmonious combination of civilize and refine instrumentality and influence which if i do not elsewhere find a nearer approach to than i have thus far will not only throw sufficient light upon the question how do she lead the nation in thought and fashion that the most thoughtless may be able to solve it but which will even entitle she to be style _ queen of city and capital of the social world _ as i have definitely decide to return from egypt to america by way of pari in order that i might see the great city once more toward the end of my tour and be the better qualify to estimate she true position in the world i make a little bundle of the guide book and view which i have already accumulate on my trip and also drop some of the superfluity of my wardrobe -- these thing i give into the care of my chamberlain and bid good-by to pari for a season my friend and tutor prof p accompany I to the station and buy I a ticket for brussels as we call it in we language but the french and belgian call it bruixelle -lrb- pron broo - -lrb- -rrb- i -rrb- x-el -rrb- my friend inform I of this and give I a drill on pronounce the word correctly for if i should have call it brussel no frenchman would have understand what i mean i be now about to leave the only acquaintance that could speak my language and go to another people of the same strange language as the parisian speak with no right to expect that i should be so lucky again in meet a suitable companion i have order my mail to be forward to cologne germany until September 1st at 11:15 pm August 6th the train move away with I toward belgium i have forget to ask how often and where i must change car from pari to brussels and now where no one understand either english or german what could be do possibly i need not make a change all night and perhaps i should at the next station already how readily my friend could have inform I have i only ask he but i manage to keep the right track though at the expense of considerable anxiety and the sacrifice of some rest and sleep that i might otherwise have enjoy during that night-journey i learn a lesson however which aid I in avoid such perplexity in the future as soon be we reach the first station i run to a conductor and hold up my ticket cry out broox-el he understand I and motion I to keep my seat some accommodate frenchman soon tell I that he be travel the same way for a considerable distance -lrb- as he ticket also make clear to I -rrb- and offer kindly to inform I when i have to leave that train my peace of mind be thus restore again i make a pillow of my satchel and go to sleep the next forenoon -lrb- Saturday August 7th -rrb- we reach douane where we have to pass muster under the belgian custom-house officer i be now with the wooden-shoed belgian a large company of the poor peasant pass muster with I each be provide with a pick or a hoe or both lie over he shoulder and a large flaxen bag of other implement & c suspend from it nearly all wear cap and the whole company look very shabby indeed my clothes be in strange contrast with they tattered garment for there be not another well-dressed passenger in the whole company and i feel like one out of he element because i do not also have a pick or hoe a hundred belgian with a hundred bundle crowd into several small apartment of the station find little room for they career which consist of the irony end of they pick and hoe so that those occasionally hook the prominent point of the face of those immediately behind they strange to say these collision do not provoke any to insult or the use of vulgar adverb but gentle reproof keep they all cool and steady till we enter the car again the reader will pardon I for say that a similar crowd of person in this country place under the same tempting and exasperating circumstance would have create a row in five minute as would be the natural consequence if there be but a single ruffian in the whole lot nothing will strike the american tourist more when he come to the old world than the good order which prevail everywhere to meet two person scold and insulting each other be a extremely rare occurrence the orderly behavior of such a company of peasant will impress one more with the importance of teach the young lesson of patience humility and _ obedience _ -lrb- which latter quality of character be the mother of a hundred virtue -rrb- than volume of dry philosophy on social ethic will generally avail i see a elderly lady kiss a middle-aged man alternately upon each cheek a incident that be common in european social life and that show how the affection of the heart be cultivate and find expression in brussels i see a son rest he hand affectionately upon he mother 's shoulder as they stand amongst the multitude in a public square i reach bruixelle -lrb- brussels -rrb- at about three o'clock in the afternoon in order to see what kind of money be in circulation in belgium i immediately buy some pear of a fruit-woman and hand she half a franc -lrb- 10 cent -rrb- you may imagine how i be perplex when the lady hand I a dozen coin of various size and value as my change know however that though the coin have different impression the-system be the same as that of french money i murmered to myself bless be the decimal system and go to some retired quarter to count it one piece be a large whitish coin marked 10c and worth 2 cent in we money other be centime which be equivalent to but one fifth of we cent i soon learn to know they all after have take a long walk through the city i engage a room at a hotel where one of the boarder could speak a little english and soon retire to take a afternoon nap i awake to broad daylight but do not at once know whether it be _ that day _ or _ the next day already _ and there be no one about just then whom i could have ask as the sun be stand in the western sky i conclude that it be more likely that i have sleep only a few hour than that i should have sleep 27 hour and when the landlord be contend with the payment of one night 's lodging i feel satisfied that i could not have stay two night with he on Saturday afternoon after my nap i go out again to see the city brussels be one of the most progressive capital in all europe several splendid boulevard line with fine cafe and large edifice adorn with innumerable balcony remind I of pari and its architectural scenery it have a passage that compare well both in brilliancy and magnificence with some of the grandest in paris the bourse de commerce -lrb- just complete -rrb- with its four elegant facade would do credit to any city and its market house be among the finest that i have ever see on Sunday -lrb- August 8th -rrb- i find all kind of business be transact just as be do in pari on my way to the cathedral i meet a dozen dog-team that Sunday morning quite a small dog will draw a larger cart load of milk than i would have expect that half a dozen of they could pull the milk be distribute over the city by woman principally it seem strange how much work must be do by the woman where the man be require to spend a large portion of they time in the service of they respective country constitute the large standing army with which europe be flood some of these woman have large dog to draw they milk-cart other have smaller one hitch to one side and assist they by pull themselves on the other side of the shaft the cathedral -lrb- st gudule -rrb- be a grand old

statue and fountain evidently a relic of the _ shameless age _ i spend some of my time with a intelligent merchant who have be travel in america and could in consequence speak the english quite well he inform I that he be not aware that belgium have any sunday-law upon she statute any one may do upon the sabbath-day everything that he might do on week-day if he feel so inclined on Sunday afternoon i leave brussels for antwerp -lrb- anver -rrb- nothing can be more delightful than the rural scenery of belgium the whole country be as carefully till as a garden -- every foot of available soil be under cultivation most of the dwelling house be small but everything about the house yard and garden be keep in the most perfect order occasionally a beautiful vista open to a fine residence in the distance as we ride along in the car we would occasionally see a afternoon or evening party seat around a richly laden table glitter with glassware and enjoy they dinner and supper under some shade tree in the midst of they garden this custom be common in europe and present most beautiful and homely sight soon after i have enter the car i notice that the tone of the conversation among the passenger be different from what i have be accustom to hear in france and belgium thus far i now hear the chatter of the dutch but understand no more than if it have be so much french dutch and german be two entirely different language dutch print in the newspaper do however not look so perfectly strange as the conversation sound to the ear after arrive at antwerp i be soon find by a porter who conduct I to a german hotel how social and hospitable these german be -- and i must add european in general _ die deutsche wirthschaft _ -lrb- german hotel -rrb- occupied quite a small building which present a very ordinary appearance on the outside but i shall never forget that carpeted bar-room the costly furniture of the parlor and the accommodate landlady which we find there taste and comfort be always consult even where the greatest simplicity prevail antwerp be one of the most catholic city -lrb- some say the most catholic city -rrb- in the world its street be fill with image of the virgin and child the savior and the cross these stand at the corner of the crossing or preside over the street lamp on one of its church tower over a gas light be represent a candle stick with the ray emanate from its light on each side be a little cherub -- one have a cross and the other a anchor over they stand the mystical letter ih the cross be combine with the h after the fashion of a monogram

be about 20 foot high effigy of two woman in oriental costume stand on either side of it in antwerp as in brussels the spirit of progress : have seize the lead circle and the hand of improvement have commence tear down she ancient house and build new street upon the modern plan and style of architecture one of the most handsome avenue in the world be from 290 to 350 foot in width and about two mile long run through the very heart of this city it have several moderate angle which render it convenient to assign different name to different section of it avenue du commerce reach from the northern end of the city to its magnificent square in the center know as place de la commune and place de la victoire here begin avenue des art which with avenue de l'industrie lead to the southern confines of the city these avenue consist of three parallel roadway with two broad foot-pavement between they and wide pavement at the side let we cross this avenue from one side to the other and estimate the width of its different part first we cross a broad payement of perhaps 30 foot then a roadway of about 50 foot next a foot-pavement line by thick row of tree whose branch form a arch over it then the central roadway perhaps 150 foot wide and afterwards another foot-pavement a roadway and the pavement on the other side correspond with those already mention the great square in the center of the city occupy about 6 acre in this section of antwerp nearly all the old building have be tear down and new one erect during the last few year and in many other section the same work of widen street and erect new building in place of the old be be do with reckless haste it seem as if old house be regard as a disgrace to the city that few image be to be see in the new section of the city be a sure sign that commerce art and industry -lrb- see the name of three avenue which run through this city -rrb- have sound the tocsin of revolution and that the ancient religion with its emblem form and ceremony be yield to the spirit of modern civilization and refinement as many other city of europe have already do it be a remarkable fact that as catholicism sink in continental europe its communicant will not stop to join prodestantism but go strait over to rationalism france for example have have these two extreme element fight each other for the ascendency for a long time and no middle-road sentiment ever gain a foothold prodestant europe will cling to the church the longest and do we not already see the indication very planely that after all europe have turn rationalistic america will continue to cherish the church and build she a rome for future generation to bless as the foster mother of modern christianity notre dame cathedral the cathedral be the most elegant gothic church in belgium and one of the most famous in the world some part of it date from the 13th and other from the 16th century the spire -lrb- 403 foot in height -rrb- be a proud rival of that on

imitate nature so perfectly that the eye almost fail to detect a flaw in the execution the spectator may know that he only stand before a flat surface of paper daub with paint but he soul will be stir he pulse begin to beat faster and he imagination run away with he as he look at such masterly execution of a skillful hand as be the dead jesus and some other in this museum the congeal blood in he side upon he hand and on he head with the tear of joseph and mary and other so natural that one mistake the picture for the reality create feeling in the beholder such as he seldom experience elsewhere even in europe he first mourn for the dead and pity the afflict then he recover himself again and thanks the artist for have give he a key to the thought and feeling which he himself must have cherish while execute this painting it be say that when roubiliac be erect the nightingale monument in westminster abbey describe on page 86 he be find one day by gayfere the abbey mason standing with he arm fold and he look fix on one of the knightly figure which support the canopy over the statue of sir francis vere as gayfere approach the enthusiastic frenchman lay he hand on he arm point

london in the louvre in pari and in palais de versaille but it be reserve for I to see the painting of ruben and of van dyck last so that i might know they merit near the entrance of the museum stand

brilliant apartment in existence antwerp have a population of about 120000 inhabitant and be the chief sea-port of belgium the scaut fleuve -lrb- river scheldt -rrb- be from a quarter to a third of a mile wide at antwerp chapter xi holland early on Tuesday morning -lrb- August 10th -rrb- i start on a run through holland the meuse and the rhine form numerous mouth and they delta be low and marshy a most magnificent bridge cross these which be several -lrb- three -rrb- mile in length fourteen immense iron arch be require to span one of the mouth of the rhine much of the land be lower than the ocean and a great conflict be wage between the hollander and the sea for the possession of the land it be a strange sight to see vessel sail along the embankment higher than the chimney top of the house along the shore watchman be station along these embankment and when the ocean break a leak they will ring the alarm bell and every body will arm himself with a spade or shovel and run to the sea-shore to battle with the water thus have these people defend they property against the encroachment of the sea for many century a great part of holland be as level as the ocean and there be neither fence nor hedge to be see but ditch surround every little field and lot and innumerable wind-mill pump the water that gather into these ditch up into canal which intersect the country like a net-work and conduct the water to the sea extensive meadow and rich pasture land support large herd of fine cattle and sheep which constitute the wealth of flemish industry these hollander have some very curious style of dress and like the swiss still wear they ancient costume even after the rest of europe have adopt the fashion of pari in the larger town and city however the tide of revolution have set in and the young belle and beau have commence to sail in pari style a few year more and the traditional costume of the flander will have disappear altogether the man be very partial to burnside and wear they hair pretty long comb wet and stroke down so as to look smooth and glossy the old woman in place of ear-ring wear ornament in the form of immense spiral suspend from the end of half of a brass hoop that pass around they head below they white cap these hang down over the cheek and be almost as long as they face some of the young lady come in from the rural district carry a head rig -- i do not know what else to call it for it be neither bonnet hat nor cap nor any combination of these but it be a apparatus for the head that baffle description and which for want of a better name we must call a _ tremendous thing _ both in magnitude and in design i have see woman with straw hat that must have be well nigh a yard in diameter in the hague i see little girl however -lrb- from 6 to 12 or 15 year of age -rrb- that be dress as tidily and look as fair and as sweet as any of we american school-girl public highway in holland these be _ highway _ in fact as well as in name they run in perfectly strait line through the country be about a yard higher than the meadow at they side and be line by thick row of willow-tree they be turnpike of course as be all the road in civilized europe from these road the traveler have always the same field of vision -- a circle around he that be about 8 to 5 mile in diameter tower spire may be see in all direction i visit dordrecht rotterdam the hague amsterdam utrecht arnheim and intermediate place the hague in dutch 's gravenhage or 's hage in french la haye be the capital of holland as well as one of its finest town it be originally a hunting seat of the count of holland -lrb- whence its name 's graven hage ` the count 's enclosure ' -rrb- -- _ hurd and houghton 's satchel guide to europe _ the supreme attraction be the museum rich im the best painting of the dutch school here be paul potter 's world renowned ` bull ' alone worth a trip to holland to see this famous picture represent a rural scene a ram a ewe a lamb a bull and a cow be gather together under a old tree and the old farmer standing somehow behind the tree take a look at they it be so perfectly true to nature that one can hardly persuade himself that the living animal be not before he the picture know as rembrandt 's school of anatomy be also as deservedly famous what ever the criticism of one who be no artist may be worth it be my opinion that ruben 's painting and some of those in this museum be the truest to nature of all that i have see in europe raphael 's painting in rome be shady in comparison to those of the dutch school Tuesday August 10th 4:21 pm leave the hague for amsterdam where i arrive at 7:30 pm have pass haarlem at 6:45 pm at 8 o'clock as i sit on the platform of the oosterspoorweg station the bell of three different tower commence simultaneously to chime they peal and that too with mathematical precision the exactness with which the clock in the clock-tower of europe keep time be remarkable and the music of the peal bell be beautiful when number of they chime at the same time at amsterdam i be ask for my passport i tell the blue coat that i have it in my satchel you should have it with you say the german-speaking official i reply that i have not be aware of that and as i have not be ask for it either in england france or belgium i have place it into my satchel so as not to wear it out in my pocket i send the porter to fetch my satchel take the passport from it and after have show it to the official place it into my pocket again so that i might have it ready in any emergency these officer be very accommodate to I afterwards however during the time that i wait for the next train for utrecht after have have quite a social chat with they i ask they what they would have do with I if i could not have produce they a passport from the government of my country well say one of they we would have be oblige to subject you to a examination and if you answer would have satisfy the committee you would have be allow to pass on cloak-room in connection with the railway station wherever i travel in europe there be cloak-room in which the baggage of the traveler be store away it cost 1 to 2 cent to have a package parcel umbrella or satchel deposit into one of these and then the depositor receive a receipt or check for he luggage which he must present when he wish to have it again but holland offer none of these excellent accommodation else i would have spend a day more among these flander when i come to amsterdam i be immediately assail by a herd of porter each anxious to take my satchel into charge it have be my rule to carry it to the cloak-room myself but here i could not find one after a vehement struggle with the fierce porter one of they who could say yes in german and who nod he head when i ask he whether he would take it to a cloak-room take it and carry it into the station a distance of about fifty foot but they keep no cloak-room as i observe when it be not place into a special apartment for the purpose it do not seem homelike at all to I so i ask the agent whether he would give I a receipt for it yes if you satisfy the porter i will he answer this reply make I more tired of amsterdam than anything else for thought i if the agent of the would-be cloak-room be a party to such a set of fellow i must indeed have fall into pretty bad company i offer the porter 4 cent which be twice as much as it cost I in other city to have my satchel care for a whole day but he refuse to take it be unwilling to become the victim of they extortion i take my satchel and carry it -lrb- almost three fourth of a mile -rrb- through town to the oosterspoorweg on the other side of the city there i obtain good accommodation i have ask for lodge while come through the city but could not suit myself so i decide to start that evening with the first train for utrecht how different be the social atmosphere of the oosterspoorweg station not only be the porter and the officer civil but there be a excellent restaurant connect with it and the waiting-girl of the coffee-room be tidily dress in french costume speak german and be social polite and accommodate at 9:30 i leave by train for utrecht which i reach at 10:35 pm the station be a new and spacious one and the accommodation be again like those which i have be accustom to before i see holland so i feel quite at home again utrecht it be entirely wrong for the tourist to come into a strange city late at night but i could not avoid it this time on account of my sudden determination in amsterdam not to spend the night there as have be my intention a clever and kind-hearted gentleman accompany I through comparatively dark street and find a good hotel for I the next forenoon i ascend the high tower -lrb- 469 step 321 foot in height -rrb- in this tower at the height of 124 step live the lady custodian of this stupendous building she must have _ high _ time up there the tower be a large square structure afford plenty of room even for several family but i be think that she must have quite a time of it carry up she water and all the numerous other thing necessary to house-keep the view from the top of the tower take in the greater part of holland the country all around be quite level as far as the eye can see level in holland _ mean _ level here one see the innumerable wind-mill and the labyrinthic net-work of canal which intersect holland a almost boundless expanse of meadow land stretch out in every direction and afford excellent pasture to the low herd that roam upon it one see but a few scattered tree and several small wood all the rest be clear and bear -- no hedge-fence even to interrupt the dull monotony of the scene below a strong wind and it be high too whistle around that lofty tower remind I of we winter storm when they whistle over the chimney-top -- a music that often make melancholy heart home-sick it be exactly 12:00 o'clock and i be in the middle of the sentence how beautiful these bell chime when a boy motion I to come quickly to a certain place where i could see the cylinder revolve which communicate with the peal of bell two point of lightning-rods crown this tower few lightning-rod be to be see upon private building in europe but upon public building they be occasionally meet with i must not leave holland without once more refer to the rattle of the wooden shoe upon the pavement the red artificial flower which old gray-headed woman wear upon they head and the gaudy color of some of they dress also to the universal custom of carry everything upon they head the denomination of dutch money be _ florin _ or _ guldin _ and cent 100 cent equal one florin the florin be equal to 40 cent in united state money at 12:38 pm i leave by train for cologne germany by 1:00 o'clock we enter a desolate section of country consist of barren sandy soil scanty crop and dwarfish shrub and tree on we way i form the acquaintance of a elderly gentleman who move

cathedral in travel through foreign land one see so much that be indecent obscene and shockingly profane accord to he we way of think that he scarcely know what to include and what to suppress in he account of foreign manners custom and institution some writer incline to the policy of render a true account of what they touch but will restrain they pen from give any notice of about one fourth of all they see because they do not wish to pain the feeling of they reader by recite to they narration of horrible tragedy that occur in the past or of grovel superstition that prevail such as we all wish have never disgrace the history of infant humanity or constitute the day-dream of we ancestor they carefully select that which flatter and please the vanity of they fellow and pass by unnoticed everything else this course may tickle vain people but it can not meet with favor among those who love the truth and the whole truth there be sin of _ omission _ as well as of _ commission _ and writer betray and deceive the world as much by the former class as by the latter some fastidious writer be afraid to call thing by they proper name consider it more appropriate to paint a african with a brownish color than to shock the beholder with a picture of a man with a _ black _ face i can not take the reader through europe in that way to paint a negro we need _ black _ paint and to describe scene which be unfamiliar we need word and language that be not use in the draw room or parlor every time we meet so much for the introduction to a episode that be characteristic of the profanity of some of the descendent of the old teutonic stock when they become exasperated the second day that i spend in cologne i go to a german barber to be put into trim for make my descend into the lower latitudes and consequently warmer country another customer be ahead of I while the barber be at work upon he all the time in a rage and swearing _ barber_ously at some proceedings a thunder storm come up very suddenly and so obscure the light of the sun -lrb- though it be midday -rrb- that he could not see to go on with he work hereupon he begin first to swear at the cloud then at the lord himself use all the epithet of abuse that he could find in he entire vocabulary of profanity there be heavy peal of thunder and vivid flash of lightning but the darker it become and the more tremendous the crash of the thunderbolt the more the senseless and exasperated barber curse and swear after the shower and hail i walk out into the pure fresh air and under the blue vault of heaven smile down upon the refreshed vegetation and try to draw a picture of that profane man 's mental panorama but i never succeed even to this day such behavior be not of rare occurrence else i should not have relate it but even sacred history refer to similar incident the wicked it be record dance and be merry even until the water of the flood sweep they away a certain divine related to I a similar story concern the behavior of a large body of the passenger with he on the great eastern when she be founder at sea and oblige to return after they have advance 500 mile when the storm be assail the great ship break down its mast and tear away its rig so that most of the passenger be in despair and expect to sink any hour they keep prayer-meeting almost continually another faction find fault with these declare that pray be a intolerable nuisance and ask the captain to prohibit it the captain decide that he would not interfere whereupon the party offend take to dance cursing and swearing and try they utmost in this way to break up the prayer-meeting i hear similar profanity on my return trip across the atlantic one night when a storm assail we ship so that the wave roll over the deck and the fierce rock of the vessel throw many almost out of they bed i hear many of they swear even during the very time that the thunder roll with tremendous roaring and crash across the heaven it seem almost impossible that conscious intelligent being could behave thus but the fact that they do help we to believe other strange truth record in history without which no correct conception of man 's former depraved condition can be form at this advanced day for example few seem to appreciate the part play by the catholic church with she image shrine sacred relic pay magnificent temple in tame and civilize man because they do not know who and what he be when the light of intelligence first begin to direct he footstep and he have not yet learn to control he selfish nature which have hitherto be guide by a instinct worth a hundred time more than intelligence without morality or religion we make a sad mistake yet in the nineteenth century in cultivate the intellect and leave morality so much out of the question we see some of the fruit already in the corruption which prevail alike in all circle without regard to party or sect i will recur to this again in speaking of the influence of the church when i come to describe the magnificent church of italy on the second afternoon that i spend at cologne there have be a shower and from sunset till dusk i beheld one of the grandest atmospheric phenomenon that i have ever witness from a window of mlüler 's hotel -lrb- face the _ dom-platz _ -rrb- i be look over the cathedral at the western sky as the sun throw its color light through the small drop of rain still descend and thus color both the green foliage of the tree and the grand edifice before I present a scene of such enchanting beauty as would afford almost a sufficient excuse for one to go into rapture or sink down in a fit of ecstatic delight i may add that before leave cologne i saw among the many dog-team use in distribute produce over the city a span whose disproportion i shall

of a heavy stone which a attendant remove by means of a crow-bar the step lead down be narrow and the passage very low so that several of the lady at first decline to enter but we persuade they however to accompany we a tallow candle afford we some little light and after brushing away the cobweb which the spider have spin since the last party have make they entry we come upon the sickening sight of the dozen or more skeleton still preserve the lady in the party be intelligent and dress tastefully and i shall never forget how the gaudy color of they dress contrast with the gloom of that nasty cellar the frequent odd adventure into such place as many would not like to enter in they own home in the presence of they friend and companion constitute a prolific source of amusement after we have creep out of that dirty cobwebbed passage we clothes be slightly soil and cobwebby with the remark if we be all with we fashionable circle at home i suppose we should not go on this way or some such allusion that remind the company of how differently they be wont to go on at home-one can under such circumstance generally provoke a fit of merriment to the traveler every day be a day of adventure -- frequently of rather funny adventure at 2:30 pm i leave bonn by rail for mehlen -lrb- 5 mile further up -rrb- where i cross the rhine on a ferry and come to königswinter on its right bank southeast of this village lie the seven mountain -lrb- siebengebirge -rrb- from the drachenfel -lrb- 1066 foot high -rrb- the view be the most picturesque and this one about a mile from the village i

water broadly swell between the bank which hear the vine and hill all rich with blossom tree and field which promise corn and wine and scatter city crowning these whose far white wall along they shine have strew would a scene which i should see with double joy go _ thou _ with I while luxuriate here amidst these grand and beautiful scene of the rhine we be visit by a shower after which i enjoy the sublime sight of _ look down upon a rainbow _ which stand in the valley below I that evening i ride by rail to ehrenbreitstein which be opposite to coblentz chapter xiii coblentz on Saturday afternoon August 14th i prepare a program of my contemplated trip through south germany switzerland italy and the east which together with several hundred card i get print in the afternoon by means of these program i inform my correspondent in america in which city i would look for mail matter and at what time i expect to reach they mr elmer of the _ coblentzer volkszeitung _ tell I that the dialect of the german language be so different that the people of coblentz and those of cologne can scarcely understand each other when they speak they peculiar dialect the principle that whenever a stream of water make a curve the outside bank -lrb- that which turn the water from its strait course -rrb- be always more precipitous than the other in proportion to the amount of curvature of the stream be well illustrate at the confluence of the mosel and the rhine at coblentz by the course of the latter the water of the mosel flow almost perpendicularly against the right bank of the rhine and have help it in form the precipitous rock of ehrenbreitstein rise to the height of 387 foot above the river upon which stand the famous fortification of that name the rhine curve toward the leave for about six or eight mile and its right bank be in consequence high and steep while the left bank be in the form of a gradual slope bear a striking resemblance to the valley of the jordan for a mile around siegersville lehigh co pa another principle that the width of a valley and the hardness of its bed be always in proportion to the fall of the stream of water flow through it do also find as ample illustration in the sweeping rhine as in any of the humbler stream whose course i have watch and study at home these two principle afford perhaps the strongest and most conclusive of all proof that the hill and valley of we planet be all the result of erosion the street of coblentz be mostly narrow as be also its pavement many of the latter be only from one to two foot wide there be several

impose rock of the lurleus to the height of 433 foot above the rhine the river be very narrow in this place have much fall and make a decide turn so that it be with considerable difficulty and some danger that steamer make they ascent the river be here 76 foot deep and its water form a whirlpool -lrb- gewirre -rrb- this place and every other one of interest along the rhine as well as all its castle have they legend it be say that a siren who have she abode on the rock be wont by means of charming music to entice sailor and fisherman to they destruction in the rapid at the foot of the precipice as it be dangerous for steamer to meet on these rapid they have a rule that every steamer come up the stream must fire a few small cannon as soon as it approach the lurleus so that steamer that be descend may hear it and wait to let the ascend steamer pass before they enter upon the rapid near bingen be the mouse tower so call because the cruel archbishop hatto of mayence have once

about a week in mannheim neustadt speyer and the surrounding country during which time i devote all my attention to the question of we common ancestry that those people be cousin to many of we pennsylvanium german can easily be prove in a variety of way even when we throw aside the traditional and historic evidence which we have that many pennsylvanian have emigrate from the pfalz in time

same i attend the large annual sängerfest at neustadt in which 973 singer from all part of the pfalz participate i procure a catalogue of they name and find that a very large proportion be the same as

she to come to the hotel where a american be wait to meet she and early on Sunday morning she meet I in the coffee-room where we spend the morning one 's partiality to the english language seldom displeased I in europe but as this lady be a native of that part of the pfalz whose people speak a dialect more like the pennsylvanium german than i hear anywhere else i insist upon converse with she in the dialect the landlord who do not understand any english be with we most of the time so that out of respect for he she also feel constrain to speak german when he be present but whenever he leave we she would speak english the language of she new american home she have visit allentown pa and be well acquaint with the resemblance of the pfälzish and the pennsylvanium german dialect i go home to neustadt that forenoon and attend the great pfälzer sängerfest -lrb- the annual concert of the palatinate choir -rrb- the city be splendidly decorate with flag and the fest be a grand success in every respect from neustadt i go to speyer and a day later to heidelberg heidelberg be the only place where i find lady ticket agent at the railway station the station be a very large and important one and the position hold by those lady be of great responsibility in continental europe it be the lady that transact most of the business in almost every city hotel store shop cafe drink stand & c be generally manage by lady heidelberg be the last city in which i feel that i be hourly see the cousin of the pennsylvanium german here still i do occasionally see one who not only favor some of we people in form and feature but whose voice and accent also speak of kinship i have hear person speak in some part of the pfalz and particularly around böchingen -lrb- about 10 mile ssw from neustadt and 25 mile wsw from speyer -rrb- from 50 to 70 per cent of whose word correspond to the pennsylvanium german dürkheim landau -lrb- and some say kaiserslautern too -rrb- be good example the old renowned university of heidelberg have 800 student and a library of 200000 volume and 1800 mss the castle be the most magnificent ruin in germany the tower turret buttress balcony and fine statue still stand there proud and bold even in its ruin and the portcullis of iron in one of its lofty gateway give I the first idea how the balance of the enemy could be shut off after a portion have be admit into the yard of the fortification with a view of slaughter they the iron bar of this portcullis or slide gate be very thick and heavy and have sharp point below a tower stand over the gate into which the portcullis be draw up the defender of castle would sometimes conceal themselves and keep perfectly silent on the approach of a enemy as if the castle have be abandon but as soon as as large a portion of they as they think they could dispose of have enter the portcullis be drop which on account of its immense weight of course make its way to the ground even if it have to pierce the body of a dozen that stand under it hereupon the alarm be sound and all that be inside be barbarously slaughter in some castle there be large pit-fall full of pointed spear stand upwards as soon as a large part of the enemy be upon this pit they would be precipitate into the spear below at other place there be immense roller and only one approach to the castle which lead directly up the hill when the assaulting enemy make its approach by this the hillside be fill with the enemy 's soldier these roller would be loosen upon they and thus the body of many thousand would be mangled in a minute such be the barbarity of the ancient i will not forget the long walk i have all alone through one of the underground passage of the heidelberg castle i see a pale light at the other end when i enter but it be dark in the middle and turn out to be much longer than i have anticipate these passage be about 7 foot high and 10 foot wide and be arch by a brick vault the illumination of this ruin castle on the evening of August 23rd constitute one of my grandest sight in all europe it seem to be envelop with flame of such a intense heat that its wall tower & c appear to be about to melt down as the color of the illuminating light change suddenly from yellowish white to blue green and red the scene be so indescribably beautiful that number of the ten thousand spectator actually go into rapture the tun in the castle of heidelberg the largest of all the tun in the world be 32 foot long 22 foot in diameter at both end and 23 foot in the center its eighteen wooden hoop be 8 inch thick and 15 inch broad and its 127 stave be 91 inch thick the bung-hole be 3 to 4 inch in diameter to build it cost the enormous sum of $ 32000 and its capacity be equal to about 2200 common barrel on top of it be a dancing-floor have the bung-hole in the center what a joy it must be for the dancer to reflect that there be such a flood of wine still beneath they this giant tun erect as a altar to the jovial god bacchus have be fill completely three time -lrb- 1753 1760 1766 -rrb- in heidelberg beim grossen fass da liess sich 's fröhlich sein bei einem vollgefülten glas von edlem pfälzer wein den al die fass kam einst zum stand do war ein jubel in dem land da freut ' sich alle gross und klein denn voll war e mit pfälzer wein in heidelberg the ` grosse fass ' cause merry day to shine when all enjoy the well fill glass of noble pfälzer wine for when this tun first come to light all do in joy combine to see the ` fass ' oh wondrous sight fill have up with pfälzer wine the philosophenweg -lrb- philosopher 's way -rrb- two mile in length command some of the finest prospect on the rhine it wind through charming vineyard and from it may be enjoy splendid view of the town castle valley and of the beautiful outline of the haardt mountain and the cathedral of speyer in the distance from heidelberg i go to stuttgart remarkable for the vast collection of book -lrb- 300000 vol -rrb- in the royal library among these be about 9000 bible in some 80 language the railway station in stuttgart be remarkable both for magnificence and the beauty of its interior its wide and lofty passage and splendid waiting-room be among the grandest in the world from stuttgart i go to carlsruhe famous for the manner in which the street meet at the castle from every point of the compass some thirty street meet here like so many stick of a circular fan near the botanic garden be a large hall of art rich in painting and relic strassburg strassburg the capital of alsace and lorraine be situate on the river ill 2 mile from the rhine and comprise a population of 80000 inhabitant its cathedral cover more than a acre of ground and 216 foot in height be deservedly famous its elegant spire the highest in europe be 465 foot in height to procure a permit from the city authority to ascend to the lantern which be immediately below the extreme summit i walk about the city nearly a hour to find the proper official the view from the platform or roof of the building -lrb- 216 foot high -rrb- afford a fine view of the beautiful plain of alsace but many ascend to the lantern simply for the satisfaction of say that they have do it no one be allow to go higher than the platform except by special permission from the city authority and accompany by a guide and protector for which a extra ticket be require the ascent be quite easy for some distance but by and by the spire become too narrow to have stair on the inside so that we have to climb up on the outside along ladder-like step if one would become giddy in this place he might fall from a hight of over four hundred foot into the street below i can not stop to speak of the world-renowned astronomical clock which be contain in this cathedral the railroad through the black forest be one of the great victory of civil engineering which characterize this age of great undertaking we pass in exactly one hour through 38 tunnel during which time in we ascent of the mountain we pass through one valley three time when we have reach the highest point we see the two other track at different elevation on the mountain side below we here we pass for many hour through pine forest all the tree of which be raise from seed -lrb- some sown and other plant -rrb- many square mile of this mountainous section be cover with pine plant as regularly as we orchard and the scenery of these mountain-side green with dense forest in which the comical tree-top stand with mathematical exactness in the square or quincunx order be among the most beautiful imaginable chapter xv switzerland it be almost impossible to describe the scenery of the alp to one who have never yet ascend mountain above the region of the cloud without so bewilder he imagination that he fancy will call forth and accept more fictitious notion than true one the best description that i have ever hear of the alp be the occasion of my most incorrect conception about they i think the speaker do not misstate or exaggerate anything in a single word but as he could in a hour 's talk tell only one tenth of what one ought to know in order to form a correct notion of what the alp look like my fanciful imagination promptly supply the coloring of the other nine tenth of the picture which he leave untouched and consequently when i come to see the alp i find they entirely different from what i have anticipate the ordinary school map represent the alp as extend along the border of switzerland as if they consist of a single range or possibly of several parallel range and mount blanc as its towering peak with what surprise a scholar who only see these map will look about he when he reach the summit of any high peak in switzerland on the rigus for example one see a extent of territory almost 300 mile in circuit every part of which be stud with ice-capped peak these range not in any one particular direction nor do they number only several dozen but many hundred of they stand around the beholder toward every point of the compass and at variable distance from the pilatus near by to the most distant part of the horizon -- more than 50 mile away the snow-clad crown of many of these rise high above the cloud so that through the parting cloud only the earth can be see far down ` neath the vapor the meadow of green those form of cloud call cumulus -lrb- pg gewitter wolken -rrb- present themselves the appearance of mountain cover with ice often creep around these peak at less than half they height at zurich i first behold the strange sight of mountain and cloud pile upon each other so that i could not well distinguish they it be on a sunny afternoon that i stand on the bank of the _ zuricher see _ -lrb- lake zurich -rrb- and look over its calm water i beheld in the distant southeast a strange phenomenon there stand the high glittering bank of cloud and over they i see the black side of a towering peak whose top be cover with ice and snow i then visit the rigus and look at alpine switzerland from its giddy height this since the railroad have be complete to its top be one of the most famous mountain in switzerland though it stand beneath the line of perpectual snow its top be cover with grass in summer still it command a panoramic view of indescribable grandeur numerous hotel stand around the top where thousand of tourist find shelter during the summer night and among they be one of the finest hotel in the world when fall come all the landlord must take they family and move down from the mountain as it would be impossible to keep the track of the railroad clear during the winter to bring up the necessary provision for they the snow be often from 10 to 20 foot deep on these alp all swiss scenery whether one be on the lake upon the mountain or in the valley and ravine be singularly charming and bear no resemblance to the scenery which one see elsewhere so that for this lack of have something with which to compare it no one can do it justice in any description short of a volume the reader will therefore pardon we haste in this country one who see the rest of europe and not switzerland will not miss any particular link in the historic chain of social religious and political development of the human race but he will not have see the sublime in nature the alp be the poetry of inorganic creation and a week or two spend on they lake in they valley and gorge amid the high waterfall or upon they snowfield and glacier teach one to associate new meaning to the word grand sublime lofty inspiring overawe romantic wild precipitous and bewildering & c it take I two day to ascend as high as the rhone glacier during which time i walk over 30 mile up hill along old military road which the roman construct through switzerland i see the snow and ice on the first day already and it seem as if i be but a little below it but in place of reach the snow line in the afternoon as i judge i might i do not reach it until the next afternoon at 5:00 o'clock the valley be narrow and the mountain rise in some place almost perpendicularly at the side so that the snow and ice which melt near the top of the mountain fall down thousand of foot into the stream below water-fall that be from several hundred to a thousand foot in height be numerous among the alp the giessbach fall which i ascend on the 6th of September descend in a series of seven cascade 1148 foot and the handeck fall which i pass on the 5th precipitate in a unbroken sheet from the height of 250 foot rainbow stand over all the fall of the alp whenever the sun shine on the second day -lrb- sept 4th -rrb- of my ascend of the alp i could look upward and see the eternal snow or look down into the valley and see the people in the meadow and field make hay or cut grain haymaker may drink the water that be a hour before part of the mass of ice and snow which they see hang near the top of the mountain several thousand foot above they head avalanche slide down into the valley every month of the year and i pass through tunnel and bridge that be purposely construct that the snow may thus slide over the road without do harm to any one where the mountain rise too precipitously it be in some place impossible to construct a road along the edge in these case they pierce through the mountain for considerable distance the axenstrasse along lake luzerne have many such tunnel one of which be about one eighth of a mile in length in the grimsel the road avoid a water-fall by pass through a tunnel under it the rhone glacier the only ice-field that i cross be upward of nine mile in length and rise from 5751 foot to 10450 foot in height about the time of sunset on the 4th of September i enter the cavern of ice from which issue the stream that constitute the source of the rhone river this be the rhodanus of the ancient which be say to issue ` from the gate of eternal night at the foot of the pillar of the sun ' i descend through the grimsel pass -lrb- 7103 foot -rrb- and haslithal along the upper water of the aare down to meiringen in one day though there be only a bridle-path through the almost unparalled wildness of this valley still there be a telegraphic wire run up to the hotel at the upper end near the rhone glacier no language can describe the picturesqueness of the bare rocky side of this valley i hear person who think they be alone utter a dozen exclamation of surprise while make a single turn where a new view open the solitary tourist will ejaculate he exclamation without number and it be under such circumstance that the unpoetical soul seek some personification to whom it may do homage it would not require a worshipper of image to kneel down in the grimsel or ober haslithal before any emblem that embody any adequate representation of the crushingly sublime scenery that one behold there i meet a lake whose depths seem as boundless as the blue heaven above I the water of many of the swiss lake be as clear as crystal so that white object at they bottom may be discern at great depths while sail along the lake of geneva one day i could as little see substance in the water below I when i look upon it at a certain distance from the steamer as in the clear sky both seem alike blue and boundless the weather and the temperature change very suddenly among the high alp the climate in the valley of switzerland be as warm as ours in summer while some thousand foot higher lie the everlasting glacier from these avalanche of cold air precipitate into the valley so that the mercury often fall from 20 to 30 degree in ten minute one be in danger of take a cold every day in switzerland besides the alp and the _ lovely lake _ among they the tourist may also see castle museum art gallery pleasure garden & c in switzerland but i will only enumerate a few of the most striking object that i meet and see in this curious country and then pass on to italy one of the bridge of lucerne be adorn with very curious painting represent the dance of death score of skeleton some blow the bugle or play with the triangle other equip with hoe and spade be jubilant over they work one of the finest organ in europe be the far-famed one at freiburg have 67 stop and 7800 pipe some of they 33 foot long this instrument have such a range of volume that it can simulate the roar thunder as well as the faintest echo the portal of the same cathedral which contain the famous organ be also adorn -lrb- -rrb- with a curious representation of the last judgment st peter lead the bless to the door of heaven but half a dozen evil one busy themselves in dispose of the wicked one of they that have a head like a hog carry they from the scale into a large caldron where they be boil other with fork in they hand pitch they into the mouth of the large dragon-devil who be represent as glut they and whose capacious mouth admit of several of they at a time the time have almost arrive when one may no longer describe what he see in the church of europe this remind I of a monster that stand upon a fountain in bern call the kindlifresser -lrb- the ogre -rrb- who be in the act of eat a child while other doom to the same fate protrude from he girdle and pocket berne be a great place for bear besides those connect with the curious machinery of the clock on one of its clock-tower among the dead bear they also keep a large den of live bear at the expense of the government the bear be the heraldic emblem of switzerland as be we eagle of american freedom of the fictitous hero william tell and the nature and character of the swiss republic i can not say more in the compass of this book than that the former be a myth and that the latter be in a great measure the outgrowth of poverty the reader may form a idea of the miserable dwelling of the peasantry on the mountain when he be tell that many be hardly distinguishable from the stable in which the cattle be sheltered when i come into view of guttannen the first village of any considerable extent that i pass after see the rhone glacier and the wildness of the grimsel and haslithal where no house except hotel and in some place not even tree or grass abound i feel glad once more to see a group of human habitation and determine to count they so that i might record they number i pass along the edge of the mountain where i could easily overlook the village but it be in many instance impossible to determine by a survey of they external appearance which be the stable and which the house or hut so i count they all large and small and find they number between 60 and 90 i once intend to count these building only with window as house but i soon discover that some hut have window only on one or several side and look like stable on the other side a question to dairy man : do thunder and lightning affect fresh milk a lady keep a cafe in brienz tell I that if a thunder storm overtake those which be bring the fresh milk from the mountain the milk would suddenly turn sour so that it could no longer be boil for drink it sweet she say _ e thut sie verbolera so das sie gerinnt wen man sie kochen will _ chapter xvi geneva to turin switzerland have two national language the german and the french both of which be recognize by the government geneva be french so i have some trouble in get my information and procure a ticket for italy i leave geneva at 6:40 be September 10th and after pass through a number of tunnel one of which require 5-1\/2 minute of moderate railway speed we arrive at bellegarde on the french border and pass muster from 9:00 to 10:00 o'clock we be detain at culoz and by noon we see the snow-covered alp again at 3:30 pm we arrive at modane and pass muster for italy mont ceni tunnel we enter the mouth of this great tunnel over 8 mile in length at 4:58 -1 \/ 2 pm and be exactly 26 minute in the very bowels of the earth where absolute darkness reign temperature in the middle 59 ° fahrenheit italy we now come to a country which contrast as strangely with the nation of western europe as those do with america or as alpine switzerland do with the rest of the world when i part at pari with my new york friend he bind for rome i for the north we still have we school-boy idea of germany switzerland and italy and i shall never forget the remark which he then make and which embody my notion and anticipation perhaps as well as he own he say i suppose we have now see the brightest side of the picture the trouble be that scene will now become tamer as we advance toward the cradle of humanity i have be pleasantly disappoint almost every time that i enter a new country but now as i be enter italy i expect that i would surely not see much to interest I except she rich store of art and the ancient ruin but less than a day at turin convinced I that i have by no means enter a country whose people be behind hand in civilization and refinement and when on my way from turin to milan i see how much clearer and brighter the blue heaven be how much sweeter the air smell than any i have ever breathe before -lrb- not except that of pari even -rrb- and how much fairer the people be than any other that i have yet see i feel that i must surely be on the border of that charming paradise which the poet make of italy but for which i have never give they due credit italy 's fair son and daughter i now come to a dry subject especially for old people but number of my young friend among they several editor and teacher request I very earnestly to take particular notice which country contain the fairest specimen of the human species why these literary character be so deeply interested in this question i can not tell but my duty be plain enough -- they want a true and impartial statement of the fact which i will endeavor to render they i observe everywhere that _ culture _ and _ personal beauty _ always go together when i come to a city that have clean and beautiful street and house i invariably find good look people there but in the rural district generally and in suburb and wretched town beauty and culture be at a lower ebb i now refer to that form of beauty which be dependent upon personal accomplishment and intellectual endowment and culture -- that beauty which beam from a intellectual countenance and sparkle from eye that glisten with pleasure that be the kind of beauty that render 90 per cent of the individual in all cultivate society acceptable and 20 per cent charming and attractive but which be want to nine tenth of those who can not or do not pay attention to cultivation and refinement there be a very few person whose form and feature please and fascinate even without the aid of accomplishment these may be say to be possess of _ native _ beauty which be meet with very seldom in all country that have a climate unfavorable to health if i have not go to italy i should not have hesitate to give my preference to the mild climate of pari where health and beauty be the natural result of a warm temperature almost semi-tropical in mildness and where the highest art assist to make every grace shine but when i see how nature dote upon italy i feel as if she be only act the step-mother to the rest of the world the loveliest portion of italy be the valley of the po one see fewer sickly or consumptive people in some part of england france and germany than in we section of america but in turin and milan every person look hale healthy happy and beautiful from the tender day of infancy to a ripe old age nothing that i saw in europe surprise I more than to come so suddenly into the midst of a people whose very countenance bear the bloom of youth even until the gray lock of age appear old age even know no wingle here i know that it seem incredible to any one that have never be in warmer clime but the word beauty have a new meaning here the glow which be lambent upon the face of the son and daughter of this section of sunny italy be something that i never see elsewhere and that can not be describe it be a solemn truth that nine tenth of all the lady of turin and milan be perfect beauty and i need not say less for the full round form of the gentleman only after i have observe that several very fair person who happen to pass near I have gray hair do i notice that the bloom of youth still glow upon the face of those who be 35 to 40 year of age when i first come into this paradise of fairy angel -lrb- for a paradise be the valley of the po -rrb- i mistook this bloom of youth and glow of health and vigor for the lambent flame which flash from the countenance of the intellectual -- it seem to I that i must be surround by a halo of literary sage and muse all gifted alike with every grace and charm that nature can bestow or art improve but when i observe the youth at work in the field and the maiden at the garden gate who turn for a moment from they respective task to see we train move along look as happy as gay and as beautiful as the belle of the cafe and the beau of the city i conclude that it must be the healthy state of the body that make every face look rosy and bright in this fair and sunny clime at milan i ask some of my companion how far this _ paradise of beauty _ extend southward in italy to florence be the answer but i do not find that to be quite correct for though florence may have more fair people than any northern city the proportion of beauty to the whole population which be perhaps ninety per cent in turin and milan can not be more than 20 or 30 per cent in florence in order to be able to correct any false impression that i might have imbibe in my first visit to the valley of the po i pay particular attention to the same subject on my return from egypt at milan there be then a immense concourse of people assemble from all part of europe to see emperor william of germany and king victor emanuel of italy parade the street of that elegant city with a retinue of over 20000 soldier the consequence be that the fair people of milan be lose in the multitude but on my return to turin i find that she beautiful son and daughter again present the same dream-like and enchanting scene of a pleasure-garden full of fair and merry being possess of angelic beauty and enjoy they bless existance just as i have see they a month before i meet traveler that say the same thing of nature 's child in other sunny land -- spain for example the truth seem to be that in warm climate only will man attain that perfect healthy and beautiful physical development which have constitute the model of the artist and the theme of the poet in every age i have hear some pronounce the statue of venus de medici the ideal perfection of female form and beauty it be probably as near as sculpture can reach it but who would suppose that a white stone could do justice to the beauty of a pure child of nature the marble may present a most perfect _ form _ but what become of the glow of life and flush of beauty upon the maiden 's cheek the ruby lip and the grace and elegance of she movement and win manners we may speak of ideal beauty in country where the physical development of the inhabitant be blast by the severity of the extreme heat and cold of a inhospitable clime where the blast of winter make every form shiver for many month of the year but the superior beauty of the daughter of northern italy if they be place side by side with venus de medici would laugh that frigid form to scorn as compare with these i think i have see no other that could either _ talk _ or _ laugh _ or _ walk _ the italian live upon a very simple diet when i first saw number of they make meal of dry bread and fruit i suppose poverty impel they to partake of so scant a diet but by the time i come back from egypt i too have learn to sit down and eat dry bread and grape together though i could procure meat as cheap in italy as elsewhere in europe it be not advisable to partake of much meat in any warm country any one may form a idea of what kind of a consumer of food cold be when he reflect how much more flesh we consume in winter than in summer i do not partake of more than half the amount of food in southern italy and egypt that i need in england germany or switzerland and there be little room for doubt that many italian do with one third of the amount of food that we require in the severer climate of the middle state i be always remind of the story of cornaro the italian related in wilson 's fourth reader whenever i see they eat they simple meal it be very singular too that they should all look full healthy and robust and many of we on the contrary lean and sickly twelve ounce of solid food and thirteen ounce of drink seem a very spare supply to a american but i do not believe that it be account very extraordinary in italy milan the praise of the magnificence and splendor of the cathedral of milan be sing all over the world it be nearly 500 foot long and 250 foot wide through the transept cover a area of almost _ two acre and three quarter _ the height of the nave be 150 foot its entire wall and its pinnacle spire and roof be all construct of fine marble the spire be over 350 foot high the marble slab constitute the roof be about three inch thick how enormous the weight of that roof must be each of the 135 pinnacle or smaller spire be crown with a statue and throng of other -lrb- some 4500 -rrb- ornament the outside of this magnificent building the interior of this edifice be one of the most impose in the world as i look at the rich decoration and delicate tracery of its high ceiling 150 foot above I i feel as if no human being could be worthy of enjoy such a magnificent view but unless a language be invent full of lance-headed character and gothic vagary of arch and finial flower and fruit bird and beast the beauty and glory of the temple of italy and she unparalleled gallery of art can never be describe from milan i go to vicenza where i spend a sleepless night in skirmish with the mosquito the number and variety of obnoxious insect multiply fearfully as one approach the topical region thence i go to venice as i be very much disappoint with venice i shall not occupy much time in describe this _ daughter of the sea _ the railway bridge which lead to this city be about two mile long i expect that a city whose street be canal and whose carriage be all boat would present a very unique appearance but when i once see they they be so exactly what i have anticipate that i feel disgusted and leave the city without do justice even to the vast collection of painting in the ducal palace which alone be worth go a great distance to see san marco the church of _ san marco _ be one of the grandest and most wonderful structure in italy and i can only refrain from copying ruskin 's very fine description of it because he account though true in every particular would to one who have never see any of the architectural glory of italy seem more like the attempt of a poet to depict in glowing language the vagary of a dream than like the description of a edifice really in existance on the piazza above the portal of san marco stand the celebrated bronze horse which constantine carry from rome to constantinople whence marino zeno bring they hither in 1205 they be take to pari by napoleon in 1797 but restore by the ally in 1815 chapter xvii venice to bologna in place of spend several day at venice as i now think i should have i leave already in the afternoon at 3:35 o'clock and reach bologna that evening it require between 6 and 7 minute to cross the bridge over two mile long which connect venice with the land the water be not deep and most of this bridge be a mere bank of earth run into the sea it be on account of my be disgust at the general unpretending appearance of venice that i leave she so soon among the object of interest that i see between venice and bologna be a herd of a hundred deer on a hill-side and the merry bell of stage-team jingle like we sleigh-bell but which may be hear in italy and switzerland all the year round when i observe in my satchel guide that bologna have two _ lean tower _ one of they nearly 300 foot high lean 4 foot and the other about half that height and lean 8 foot i determine to go and see they they be massive but plain brick structure and it be difficult to decide which way the higher one lean the inclination of the lower one however be decide but present nothing striking or threatening in its appearance i feel afraid that the lean tower of pisa might possibly also fail to present anything that be remarkable or impose to the beholder when i would come to see it once just as a thousand and one other object do which antiquity and poetry have render sacred and famous and i walk away with down-cast countenance and take passage for firenze -lrb- florence -rrb- florence the cathedral -lrb- il duomo -rrb- begin in 1298 be 554 foot long and 334 foot through the transept the nave be 152 foot high the cupola be 138 foot in diameter or about the same as that of st peter 's in rome for which it also serve michael angelo as a model close by the cathedral be giotto 's campanile 300 foot high the most beautiful of all the tower that i have see in europe the square block of many color marble with which its four side be coated produce a richness of effect that be indescribable decorate from top to bottom with all manner of statue and architectural ornamentation it be like a toy of ivory which some ingenious and pious monk might have spend he life-time in adorn with sculptural design and figure of saint and when it be finish see it so beautiful he pray that it might be miraculously magnify from the size of one foot to that of three hundred the view of this superb structure in connection with the grand edifice -lrb- the cathedral -rrb- to which it belong open so suddenly upon the visitor that he will never forget what feeling of joy and surprise he experience on make the last turn around the corner when these splendid edifice leap upon he so unexpectedly in all they beauty and magesty the church of santa croce whose foundation be lay in 1294 be the pantheon of tuscany it contain the tomb of michael angelo and magnificent monument of dante of alfiero of macchiavellus of galileo and of many other of less fame the house in which be bear michael angelo dante amerigo vespuccus macchiavellus and galileo may be find and identify by the memorial tablet which mark they _ piazza della signoria _ be the business as well as the historic center of florence here stand the old capitol of the republic begin in 1298 it be afterwards the residence of cosmo i near this palace be a magnificent fountain of the time of cosmo i i can not tell positively now whether the sculpture and architecture of florence be so much richer than what i see elsewhere in europe or whether the enchanting beauty of sculpturesque and architectural master-stroke at the cathedral the campanile st croce and the fountain and palace in this magnificent square may not have throw I into the condition of one in a dream but i certainly feel all the time that i spend in florence like one in another world where scene of fascinating beauty be surround I on every side and feeling of ecstatic delight preclude I from any but a dream-like enjoyment of the scenery around i be without any acquaintance or companion the whole day which in connection with the fact that i be thousand of mile away from the familiar scene of home where every object that i contemplate be new and different from what i be wont to see could not fail to make I feel like one in a dream i go along the _ portico deglus uffizus _ adorn with throng of statue of celebrated tuscan and into the famous uffizus gallery found by the medicus and one of the most precious collection in the world in the _ tribune _ the inner sanctuary of the great temple of art -lrb- the richest room in all the world a heart that draw all heart to it -rrb- i see the venus de medici the dancing faun the apollino the wrestler and other masterpiece of ancient sculpture also among the painting some of the best work of raphael angelo titian and other i must however admit that the out-door scenery of florence charm I more than what i saw in its world renowned museum it seem to I that raphael and m angelo deserve more praise for the inventive genius which they evince in translate bible story and poetical imagery into picture than for they mechanical execution to such as understand anything about painting it will seem very absurd of course that i should presume to criticise the painting of these great master but they must admit that a hundred of those who roam the world and come to see the work of the master be ignorant of painting and sculpture as i be to half a dozen that be able to criticise they from the standpoint of one who be himself a artist the hundred unskilled in the fine art have as great a desire to know how they will likely be affect by the sight of those work as the half dozen artist be permit I to speak to the hundred it be true that the painting of raphael and angelo may have fade but whatever they may have be when they be first hang to the wall they now look pale shady and inferior in artistic execution to many of those of ruben and of the master of the dutch school in general that be if we consider nature as the standard and copying it as the only criterion of a master 's talent but for inventive originality of conception the dutch master be no rival even certainly not of the italian need i repeat that wherever one find such a rich store of art as in florence there too will he find lady and gentleman of beauty culture and refinement the same fascinating form and feature which characterize the man and woman of turin and milan be also meet with here but they comprise a much smaller proportion of the whole population it be fair to presume however that a large proportion of those which i saw in florence be native of distant part of the globe which stream thither by the thousand to see that charming city one can nowhere see more intelligent company than in such a place as florence but how the most symmetrical and best look people of all other country contrast with italian beauty none but those few who ever go thither will ever learn to form the least conception of it have become my duty however to record the fact that the most favor of all country when they sail into the society of the fair daughter of sunny italy cast a shadow about they as we may fancy any human would when come into the company of the beautiful angel of a heavenly paradise go reader if you can not visit italy personally and see what the poet say about these people and believe every word they can say in favor of they charm pisa from florence i go to pisa with the special object of see the famous lean tower -lrb- 1174-1350 -rrb- it be circular have 15 pillar in the wall of the first story and 30 in each of the six succeed one on top of these be another one -lrb- the eighth -rrb- much smaller than the rest and probably build upon it after the tower have reach the amount of inclination which it now have the entire structure be 187 foot high and 173 foot 9 inch in circumference -lrb- accord to my own measurement -rrb- the wall be from 5 to 7 foot thick there be a peal of bell at the top the heaviest weigh 6 ton nothing be more evident than that this tower assume its lean position by _ accident _ it be probable that this structure which be the finest in italy except giotto 's campanile at florence be originally design to be a very high one -lrb- perhaps 300 foot -rrb- it be likely that the foundation do not give way until at the seventh story and that after it come to a stand-still again they cap it off abruptly by the odd little story which we now see at the top of it the inclination amount to about 13 foot there be a circular pavement around it about 10 foot wide which have the same angle of inclination that the tower itself have it be sink 3 foot into the ground on one side and 8 foot on the other side upon careful examination and measurement i discover that the diameter of the basin thus form be to the height of the tower as the inclination of pavement constitute the floor of the basin be to the amount of inclination of the tower let it be remember that this tower be not a independent structure but that it stand near the east end of the cathedral as the elegant campanile at florence stand near the cathedral of that city the cathedral the cathedral -lrb- 1063-1118 -rrb- be 311 foot long 106 foot wide and the nave 109 foot high the great bronze lamp which give galileo the hint of the pendulum still hang in its nave the baptistry -lrb- 1153-1278 -rrb- stand a little distance from the west end of the cathedral it be about 120 foot in diameter and its dome be 180 foot high peabody consider it the most faultlessly and exquisitely beautiful building he ever see these three most elegant building the cathedral the baptistry and the campanile or lean tower be a unite in architectural beauty and design and for effect in external appearance be scarcely outvie by anything that i have see of the kind in all italy no one will feel sorry for have travel a hundred mile to see the lean tower and the traveler will observe with pleasure and satisfaction that its two companion be even more elegant than itself on Tuesday noon September 15th i leave pisa for rome it be continually get warmer as i progress southward at london i have receive information that i must by no means go to rome before October as i might not be able to endure the intense heat of summer in central italy the tourist must not always believe all that be say though it be not so pleasant to visit rome in July or August as later in the season still it be quite as safe if one take the necessary precaution against fever no one should eat much meat in italy and egypt i live upon milk bread and fruit principally and dress in flannel and as a consequence never experience much inconvenience from any source -- not from heat even at rome i use a umbrella during the middle of the day and in egypt all of the day but with that to protect I from the effect of the direct ray of the sun i could get along tolerably well at milan a young friend have caution I to be careful at rome as person be often murder there in broad daylight i be not at all alarm by that remark because i have previously receive similarly report in regard to the morality of other city and have discover that they be unfounded as we train be sweep on toward rome i apprehended little danger therefore from these source and after have form the acquaintance of a certain frenchman the professor of mathematics of the university of brest who could speak a very little english i begin to have brighter hope in regard to my visit to rome chapter xviii rome the sun set soon after we have pass orbetello and the moon rise about the same time we have still two hour to civita vecchium and four hour to rome but i shall never forget the happiness and emotional excitement that prevail among we passenger as we be approach the city of the caesar and of the pope on that pleasant moonlight evening the light of the full moon cast a charm about every scene and as we watch the appearance of tropical species of plant and tree under the subdue and enchant light of the moon and star we feel that we be about to enter the celestial city under eminently fascinating circumstance at 10:00 o'clock we be intently look from the window each for the first glimpse of rome will we reach the tiber soon as we train leap upon the bridge and my french companion first see the glassy surface of the historic stream he half distract by solemnity of the occasion exclaim with a forced but feeble effort the tiber _ the tiber _ none be he own and the enraptured professor sink from the effect of a ecstatic swoon grasp hold of I and with labored enunciation speak in a low voice say i feel in-ex-pres-si-ble e-mo-sion at 10:20 we enter the shed of the great railway station it be my good fortune to meet a german porter who conduct I and my new companion to a excellent hotel -lrb- albergo torino e trattoria duetto da abrate -- via principe amedo in prossimita alla stazione -rrb- where we take room together one see a thousand strange and curious thing at rome that my limited space will preclude I from describe or mention even the gable-end of the stazione -lrb- station -rrb- have in base relief a representation of the traditional she-wolf nurse the twin brother romulus and remus the founder of rome emblem unique and obscure in design may be see in almost every street i saw in one place the hand of a clock dial in the form of snake i do more justice to my eye than to my foot during my first day in rome the column of marcus aurelius the post-office castello s angelo st peter the vatican the colosseum _ -lrb- amfiteatro flavium _ or _ coliseo _ -rrb- and the fountain arch and ruin of ancient heathen temple that i pass on my way give I a pretty good practical idea of the rome that i have read about in the book only the approach darkness and the dread of walk alone through the suburb of rome under cover of night could induce I on the evening of the first day to tear myself away from the crumble heap of stone which constitute the ruin of ancient rome so charming and grand to behold it require about three day of close study before i could readily identify on my map of ancient rome the temple of vespasian of saturn of castor and pollux of julius caesar of faustina and of venus and roma the triumphal

several small monument or head stone which be in the form of pyramid here as in catholic burial-grounds generally in europe cross take the place of memorial stone except some of the latest interment be mark by marble slab and monument the catacomb or underground burial-place of rome be not quite as interesting as many suppose who have read large chapter and hear long address upon the subject the passage be almost innumerable intersect each other in every direction and range in some place many story above each other but still as you pass along in the dim light of a little taper it appear much like a subterranean stone-quarry contain pigeon-hole for the dead the temple of vesta the little round temple refer to on page 244 be once suppose to have be the temple of vesta but it be now quite certain that this be a mistake it be 50 foot in diameter and each of its 20 corinthian column which constitute the circular colonnade around it be 32 foot high wherever the temple of vesta may have stand it be evident that from its eternal fire be borrow the custom still extant in catholic church of keep up a perpetual flame by means of taper six vestal virgin swear to perpetual virginity use to watch the sacred flame upon the altar in the temple of vesta and it be a impressive sight to see the same sacred and eternal flame still burn around the high altar in st peter 's from what may still be see in europe in general and at rome in particular it be evident that all or nearly all of the emblem form and ceremony of the _ early _ catholic church be borrow from ancient mythology obelisk and fountain the many magnificent fountain of rome be all adorn with group represent character of ancient mythology as be the case with nearly all the fountain of europe and america even unto this day and the half a dozen or more obelisk of rome be likewise monument of the heathen origin of modern civilization these it seem be first erect and dedicate to the sun as we may infer from the fact that globe represent the sun surmount they since the introduction of the christian religion a figure of st peter with the cross be place upon some of they hence the development of religious idea stand chronologically thus : first sun-worship and afterwards the elevation of st peter and of the cross judge from what we see on ancient monument and in the church it be perhaps a fair question whether st peter the virgin and other saint be not at one time quite as much the ' object of worship as christ himself st peter 's st peter 's stand on the site of the circus of nero where many christian be martyr and where st peter be say to have be bury after he crucifixion a oratory -lrb- chapel -rrb- stand here as early as ad 90 in 309 a basilica half the size of what st peter 's now be be begin by

impose as well as the largest church in the world imagine yourself in the middle of a church occupy over five acre whose high altar stand under a brass canopy 95 foot high and weigh 93 ton and whose _ confessio _ be surround by 89 burning lamp the total cost of the edifice be about $ 85000000 -lrb- it should always be remember that labor have be twice to three time as cheap in europe as it be now in this country -rrb- the expense of erect this church be so heavy that julius ii and leo x resort to the sale of indulgence to raise the money and this lead to the reformation the lateran be the church of the pope as bishop of rome and here he coronation take place it take the precedence even of st peter in ecclesiastical rank be as the inscription on its facade set forth ' _ c ominum urbi et urbis ecclesiarum mater et caput _ ' if st peter 's have not the advantage of a piazza that be unrivaled in magnificence i think the lofty facade of the lateran would present a view of more impose grandeur even than that stately structure the interior of this church be very beautiful it must not be suppose that st peter 's have no rival in beauty even in rome it do not seem to stand alone of the 363 other church in the great city of church there be number that vie with it in the beauty and perfection of some particular portion santa marium maggiore the virgin appear simultaneously to the

the property of tourist from civilized nation go thither for sight-seeing well one do see sight there -- but _ such sight _ we voyage to egypt be a very prosperous and i may say a pleasant one time some eighty hour as first and second class passage be unreasonably high board cost $ 9 -- $ 10 per day i take third class passage and with a special outlay of a few dollar obtain acceptable meal the steamer belong to a english line and it be one of the most pleasant incident of my entire tour to hear a company of sailor chime in one evening and sing kiss I mother kiss you darling i have hear little english speaking for month and now to hear that old familiar tune five thousand mile away from home make I feel as if america could after all not be so very far off there be no storm nor be they any cool night air upon that summer seat i sleep one night on deck without even a awning of canvass over I -- how pleasant it be at night to awake and see the winter constellation of orion as high up already in September as i be wont to see it in america in the month of January we reach alexandrium on the fourth day after leave the coast of italy perhaps i can not give the reader a better idea of what a blank egypt seem to one who have luxuriate for month amid the scene of europe than by leave my chapter on egypt a blank one a great deal too much have be write about egypt and the east already what profitable example can we take from those semi-barbarian a young man who be just return from a tour through egypt and greece have tell I already at rome that go to see the east be do mostly for the name of have do the thing he have be disappointed and so be i why do tourist speak so much about the pyramid after return from egypt because there be little else to be see there or to talk about and these be not half the wonder that many imagine who falsely presume that the building of the entire structure be undertake at once the broad foundation of 13 acre which constitute the base of the greatest be not undertake at one time but only a small pyramid be at first rear and around this as a nucleus be build layer after layer until the structure assume the amazing proportion which now characterize the astounding magnificence of the great pyramid on the plain of geezeh thus at whatever time the sovereign might die he pyramid would be almost complete and would be large or small in proportion to the time spend upon it perhaps succeed generation build at some of the larger pyramid they be monument erect to the memory of king or rule family and contain they tomb such at least be a plausible solution of the problem of pyramid-building cairo at cairo i engage a guide whom i pay three dollar for accompany I as many hour and bargain with he that he must furnish the mule -lrb- or donkey i should have say -rrb- and pay all the contingent expense we visit the mosk of mohamet alus in the citadel the mosk of hassen and other attendant at the door provide we with slipper for no one be allow to tread the fine carpet -lrb- or matting -rrb- of these holy temple with he shoe hat must be keep on however a large mosque generally consist of portico surround a square open court contain a fountain or tank in the center here every mussulman wash he hand and foot before he go to prayer they sometimes would here bathe they whole body in former time it be not at all surprising that wash of foot should have become a part of the religious ceremony in country like egypt where wash be quite as necessary to existence as eating and drinking even i wish they have pure water enough to wash themselves a dozen time a day they would certainly be what we consider very dirty more than half the time even then as it be they must take they untanned goat-skin bag and collect the luke-warm water which they find in dirty pool and take it home for drinking purpose it be impossible for the poor egyptian to keep themselves clean it rain only about three day in a year and the wind take so much dust into the air that one can often neither see or breath for a few seconds this dust collect in such a thick layer upon my body the first day that i could in the evening plow furrow with my finger upon any portion of my skin i protect my eye by hide my face in my shawl during the most dangerous bust but be ignorant of the necessity of put cotton into my ear i lose the hearing of one of they which i only recover quite lately hundred of people in cairo be blind and certainly the majority of they have but poor sight or have very sore eye what wretched house they live in many of the hut in they village consist of but a single apartment large enough for a person to lie down lengthwise in it but not more than 5 foot wide the wall and roof be all mud and so low that a man can not stand erect in some of they these mud-hut have no door even the man as well as the woman wear long flow garment like those represent in we picture bible many of the poor woman have but a single garment to cover they body with this consist of a hood-like cover for the head and a loose flow robe all in one piece have neither shoe nor the other garment to make themselves presentable in any decent or refined society many present picture of indescribable wretchedness i see a woman nurse she child in the car who when present with a apple for she babe return she thanks _ without a smile _ even to the giver these people be in too great misery to know what it be to feel happy i see man and woman speak by the hour in the train without once turn into any pleasant mood how my pity might have turn into joy could i only have see they indulge in a hearty laugh occasionally some of they girl and woman of all age will still ride the donkey after the oriental style the middle and poorer class of egyptian will eat little snail and fish fry with the head scale and all the appurtenance of they internal structure in the east they churn the butter in bag make of untanned goat-skin have the hair inside moreover they bring the butter upon the table without do so much as to comb it even when i have see these thing and be inform that on account of the cholera which be still rage in syrium the surround nation have interpose a quarantine so that if i would venture to go on to joppa -lrb- which i could have reach in a few hour -rrb- i would become a prisoner i soon decide that i would rather not see a people -lrb- the syrian -rrb- that be more miserable than the egyptian even than be in danger of be oblige to partake of food that could scarcely have fail to make I sick cross the desert by rail meeting large caravan of camel and see the palm-tree the minaret the mosk the pyramid the muddy water of the nile and above all the curious style of the oriental costume be interesting enough to one that come to egypt with ordinary expectation and correct information in regard to the country but i do not expect to find the egyptian a black inferior race that would fight with each other on the pavement in the largest city in broad daylight violently tear my property out of my hand in sight of the finest square in alexandrium carry naked child upon they shoulder in they large town and seat themselves around large dish of rice and gravy mix the same with they finger and convey it to they mouth in the palm of they hand number of they will dine without the use of either knife fork or spoon and when dinner be over there be but one dish to be wash each have two hand and ten finger to clean and wash those end the whole matter these be extreme case of course some live decently too some _ few _ of the ruling class in luxury perhaps from cairo i travel by rail to ismalium thence by the suez canal to port say where i spend the Sunday -lrb- October 3rd -rrb- on Tuesday i reach alexandrium again i there put up at a first-class hotel -lrb- for traveler from civilized and refined nation can not enjoy themselves at inferior hotel in egypt -rrb- and stay five day until the next steamer sail for brindisus the hotel contain a excellent cafe where ten intelligent and refined lady and four gentleman all native of austrium be engage to render music every evening for a whole year one evening as i sit in the cafe at my supper a poor boy come in to sell flower for what we must pay in this country for a drink i buy a bouquet almost as large as a bucket and when the next lady come to collect for the music i give she the bouquet as a present to the whole company it be worth more than a introduction to the entire party and for the balance of my stay i be always well entertain and be kindly inform of anything that i ask in regard to the manners and custom of oriental life the people of every nation under the sun travel in egypt in the habit of they own peculiar national costume -- the turk with he turban the greek with he red cap and the arabian east indian russian and all the nation of western europe be represent here all wear they own peculiar style and fashion the money too be a mixture of the coin of a dozen different country none except the poorest woman will come out of they house without have they face cover with thick black veil on the home-stretch i do not know where i be the happiest when i reach the coast of italy and see dear europe again when i reach pari or when i land at new york and be finally again usher into the sweet scene of home but i remember well that i leave no city with so much regret as pari how i watch to see the last glimmering ray of its ten thousand gas-jet as we train move away at the silent midnight hour of October 22nd i have stop at milan to see the grand peagent of emperor william of germany and king victor emanuel of italy with a retinue of some 22000 militia with which they hold a military drill and see the illumination of the cathedral on that memorable occasion besides i have stop a day at rome and two at paris yet i make my return trip from alexandrium to new york in 25 day sleep but 7 night in comfortable bed in all that time sleep in the car and on the ship never amount to much i make this haste on account of the now rapidly approach winter conclusion notwithstanding the influence which the church and the political power of rome in earlier time and which paris and the spirit of progress in later year have exert to the contrary the manners custom and institution of the people be still so different that the people of the western continent can not form correct idea of european life without have first visit portion of it for want of a standard of comparison the reader be often utterly deceive by fine poetical description because he can not properly construe the language a tour of ordinary length and duration can now be make through the western nation of europe with less expense than be generally believe as may be infer from the fact that my entire tour of nearly fourteen thousand mile cost less than seven hundred dollar many traveler lose forty percent of they money by imposition and other be more careless and extravagant than they ought if i could not have speak german it would have cost I several hundred dollar more could i have speak french it might have cost I a hundred dollar less the expense of make the tour of england france and switzerland be from $ 300 to $ 1000 accord to the style in which one wish to travel but a young man who wish to spend $ 1000 in educate himself will make the best investment by spend half of it in travel in foreign land he will there lay such a sure foundation for a correct knowledge of the institution of the world as no amount of reading can ever afford he let the enterprising go west but the student should see eastern country the end end of project gutenberg 's the youthful wanderer by george h heffner
