successive sabbath roger chillingworth scrutinise he patient carefully and accept as the medical adviser determine to know the man before attempt to do he good he strive to go deep into he patient 's bosom delving among he principle and prying into he recollection after a time at a hint from old roger chillingworth the friend of mr dimmesdale effect a arrangement by which the two man be lodge in the same house so that every ebb and flow of the minister 's life-tide might pass under the watchful eye of he anxious physician old roger chillingworth throughout life have be calm in temperament of kindly affection and ever in the world a pure and upright man he have begin a investigation as he imagine with the severe integrity of a judge desirous only of truth but as he proceed a terrible fascination seize the old man within its grip and never set he free again until he have do all its bidding he now dig into the poor clergyman 's heart like a miner search for gold this man the physician would say to himself at time pure as they deem he have inherit a strong animal nature from he father or he mother let we dig a little farther in the direction of this vein henceforth roger chillingworth become not a spectator only but a chief actor in the poor minister 's inner world and mr dimmesdale grow to look with unaccountable horror and hatred at the old physician and still the minister 's fame and reputation for holiness increase even while he be tortured by bodily disease and the black trouble of he soul more than once mr dimmesdale have go into the pulpit with a purpose never to come down until he should have speak the truth of he life and ever he put a cheat upon himself by confess in general term he exceed vileness and sinfulness one night in early may drive by remorse and still indulge in the mockery of repentance the minister seek the scaffold where hester prynne have stand the town be all asleep there be no peril of discovery and yet he vigil be surprise by hester and she daughter return from a death-bed in the town and presently by roger chillingworth himself who be that man gasp mr dimmesdale in terror i shiver at he hester canst thou do nothing for

hope and speak of seek a new life beyond the sea in some rural village in europe oh hester cry arthur dimmesdale i lack the strength and courage to venture out into the wide strange world alone thou shalt not go alone she whisper before mr dimmesdale reach home he be conscious of a change of thought and feeling roger chillingworth observe the change and know that now in the minister 's regard he be no longer a trust friend but he bitterest enemy a new england holiday be at hand the public celebration of the election of a new governor and the rev arthur dimmesdale be to preach the election

past in the way of ancestry and descent which historian so carefully overlook here as in the scarlet letter hawthorne be unsparing in he analysis of the meaning of early american puritanism -- its intolerance and its strength _ i -- the old pyncheon family _ half-way down a by-street of one of we new england town stand a rusty wooden house with seven acutely-peaked gable and a huge cluster

rude hovel of matthew maule -lrb- originally remote from the center of the earlier village -rrb- have become exceedingly desirable in the eye of a prominent personage who assert claim to the land on the strength of a grant from the legislature colonel pyncheon the claimant be a man of iron energy of purpose matthew maule though a obscure man be stubborn in the defense of what he consider he right the dispute remain for year undecided and come to a close only with the death of old matthew maule who be execute for the crime of witchcraft it be remembered afterwards how loudly colonel pyncheon have join in the general cry to purge the land from witchcraft and have seek zealously the condemnation of matthew maule at the moment of execution -- with the halter about he neck and while colonel pyncheon sit on horseback grimly gaze at the scene -- maule have address he from the scaffold and utter a prophecy god say the die man point he finger at the countenance of he enemy god will give he blood to drink when it be understand that colonel pyncheon intend to erect a spacious family mansion on the spot first cover by the log-built hut of matthew maule the village gossip shake they head and hint that he be about to build he house over a unquiet grave but the puritan soldier and magistrate be not a man to be turn aside from he scheme by dread of the reputed wizzard 's ghost he dig he

eye she be startle by the change in judge pyncheon 's face it have become cold hard and immitigable dear I what be to be do now think the country girl to herself he look as if there be nothing softer in he than a rock nor milder than the east wind then all at once it strike phoebe that this very judge pyncheon be the original of a miniature which mr holgrave -- who take portrait and whose acquaintance she have make within a few hour of she arrival -- have show she yesterday there be the same hard stern relentless look on the face in reality the miniature be copy from a old portrait of colonel pyncheon which hang within the house be it that the expression have be transmit down as a precious heirloom from that puritan ancestor in whose picture both the expression and to a singular degree the feature of the modern judge be show as by a kind of prophecy but as it happen scarcely have phoebe 's eye rest again on the judge 's countenance than all its ugly sternness vanish and she find herself almost overpower by the warm benevolence of he look but the fantasy would not quit she that the original puritan of whom she have hear so many sombre tradition have now step into the shop

guest may well startle a innocent young girl you quite puzzle I sir reply phoebe there be no frightful guest in the house but only a poor gentle child-like man whom i believe to be cousin hepzibah 's brother i be afraid that he be not quite in he sound sens but so mild he seem to be that a mother might trust she baby with he he startle I oh no indeed i rejoice to hear so favourable and so ingenious a account of my cousin clifford say the benevolent judge it be possible that you have never hear of clifford pyncheon and know nothing of he history but be clifford in the parlor i will just step in and see he there be no need to announce I i know the house and know my cousin hepzibah and she brother clifford likewise ah there be hepzibah herself such be the case the vibration of the judge 's voice have reach the old gentlewoman in the parlor where clifford sit slumbering in he chair he can not see you say hepzibah with quiver voice he can not see visitor a visitor -- do you call I so cry the judge then let I be clifford 's host and you own likewise come at once to my house i have often invite you before come and we will labor together to make clifford happy clifford have a home here she answer woman break out the judge what be the meaning of all this have you other resource take care hepzibah take care clifford be on the brink of as black a ruin as ever befel he yet from within the parlor sound a tremulous wail voice indicate helpless alarm hepzibah cry the voice entreat he not to come in go down on you knee to he oh let he have mercy on I mercy the judge withdraw and hepzibah deathly white staggered towards phoebe that man have be the horror of my life she murmur shall i never have courage enough to tell he what he be _ iv -- the spell be break _ the shop thrive under phoebe 's management and the acquaintance with mr holgrave ripen into friendship then after some week phoebe go away on a temporary visit to she mother and the old house which have be brighten by she presence be once more dark and gloomy it be during this absence of phoebe 's that judge pyncheon once more call and demand to see clifford you can not see he answer hepzibah clifford have keep he bed since yesterday what clifford ill say the judge start then i must and will see he the judge explain the reason for he urgency he believe that clifford could give the clue to the dead uncle 's wealth of which not more than a half have be mention in he will if clifford refuse to reveal where the miss document be place the judge declare he would have he confine in a public asylum as a lunatic for there be many witness of clifford 's simple childlike way you be stronger than i say hepzibah and you have no pity in you strength clifford be not now insane but the interview which you insist upon may go far to make he so nevertheless i will call clifford hepzibah go in search of she brother and judge pyncheon fling himself down in a old chair in the parlor he take he watch from he pocket and hold it in he hand but clifford be not in he room nor could hepzibah find he she return to the parlor call out to the judge as she come to rise and help find clifford but the judge never move and clifford appear at the door point he finger at the judge and laugh with strange excitement hepzibah he say we can dance now we can sing laugh play do what we will the weight be go hepzibah -- go off this weary old world and we may be as lighthearted as little phoebe herself what a absurd figure the old fellow cut now just when he fancy he have I completely under he thumb then the brother and sister depart hastily from the house and leave judge pyncheon sit in the old house of he forefather phoebe and holgrave be in the house together when the brother and sister return and holgrave have tell she of the judge 's sudden death then in that hour so full of doubt and awe the one miracle be work without which every human existence be a blank and the bliss which make all thing true beautiful and holy shone around this youth and maiden they be conscious of nothing sad or old presently the voice of clifford and hepzibah be hear at the door and when they enter clifford appear the stronger of the two it be we own little phoebe ah and holgrave with she he exclaim i thought of you both as we come down the street and so the flower of eden have bloom even in this old darksome house to-day a week after the judge 's death news come of the death of he son and so hepzibah become rich and so do clifford and so do phoebe and through she holgrave it be far too late for the formal vindication of clifford 's character to be worth the trouble and anguish involve for the truth be that the uncle have die by a sudden stroke and the judge know this have let suspicion and condemnation fall on clifford only because he have himself be busy among the dead man 's papers destroy a later will make out in clifford 's favor and because it be find the papers have be disturb to avert suspicion from the real offender he have let the blame fall on he cousin clifford be content with the love of he sister and phoebe and holgrave the good opinion of society be not worth publicly reclaim it be holgrave who discover the miss document the judge have set he heart on obtain and now my dearest phoebe say holgrave how will it please you to assume the name of maule in this long drama of wrong and retribution i represent the old wizzard and be probably as much of a wizzard as ever my ancestor be then with hepzibah and clifford phoebe and holgrave leave the old house for ever \* \*

girl have not signify that she wish the teacher to come to she nothing she cry i think i could make you come the girl speak in a low tone a kind of half-whisper bernard langdon experience the power of those diamond eye one particular day that summer he have make up he mind to explore the dreaded rattlesnake ledge of the mountain to examine the rock and perhaps to pick up a adventure in the zoological line for he have on a pair of high stout boot and he carry a stick in he hand high up on one of the precipitous wall of rock he see some tuft of flower and know they for flower elsie venner have bring into the school-room presently on a natural platform where he sit down to rest he find a hairpin he rise up from he seat to look round for other sign of a woman 's visit and walk to the mouth of a cavern and look into it he look be meet by the glitter of two diamond eye shine out of the darkness but glide with a smooth steady motion towards the light and himself he stand fix strike dumb stare back into they with dilate pupil and sudden numbness of fear that can not move the two spark of light come forward until they grow to circle of flame and all at once lift themselves up as if in angry surprise then for the first time thrill in mr bernard 's ear the dreadful sound that nothing which breathe can hear unmoved -- the long singing whir as the huge thick-bodied reptile shake he many-jointed rattle he wait as in a trance and while he look straight into the flaming eye it seem to he that they be lose they light and terror that they be grow tame and dull the charm be dissolve the numbness pass away he could move once more he hear a light breathing close to he ear and half turn see the face of elsie venner look motionless into the reptile 's eye which have shrink and fade under the stronger enchantment of she own from that time mr bernard be bring into new relation with elsie he be grateful she have lead he out of danger and perhaps save he from death but he shudder at the recollection of the whole scene he make up he mind that come what might he would solve the mystery of elsie venner sooner or later _ ii -- cousin richard venner _ richard venner have pass several of he early year with he uncle dudley venner at the dudley mansion the playmate of elsie be she cousin two or three year older than herself he mother be a lady of bueno ayre of spanish descent and have die while he be in he cradle a self-willed capricious boy he be a rough playmate for elsie but elsie be the wilder of these two motherless child old sophy -- say to be the granddaughter of a cannibal chief -- who watch they in they play and they quarrel always seem to be more afraid for the boy than the girl massa dick don ' you be too rough wus ' dat girl she scratch you las ' week 'n' some day she bite you 'n' if she bite you massa dick -- old sophy nod she head ominously as if she could say a great deal more elsie 's father whose fault be to indulge she in everything find that it would never do to let these child grow up together a sharper quarrel than usual decide this point master dick forget old sophy 's caution and vex the girl into a paroxysm of wrath in which she spring at he and bite he arm old dr kettredge be send for and come at once when he hear what have happen he have a good deal to say about the danger there be from the tooth of animal or of human being when enraged and he emphasise he remark by the application of a pencil of lunar caustic to each of the mark leave by the sharp white tooth after this master dick go off on he travels which lead he into strange place and stranger company and so the boy grow up to youth and early manhood there come a time when the young gentleman think he would like to see he cousin again and write invite himself to the dudley mansion doctor kettredge could see no harm in the visit when dudley venner consult he she father be never easy about elsie he could not tell the old doctor _ all _ he know in god 's good time he believe he only daughter would come to she true nature she eye would lose that frightful cold glitter and that faint birth-mark which encircle she neck -- she mother swoon when she first see it -- would fade wholly out let she go to the girl ' school by all mean the doctor have say when that be first talk about anything to interest she friendship love religion -- whatever will set she nature to work when dudley venner mention he nephew 's arrival the doctor only say let he stay a while it give she something to think about he think there be no danger of any sudden passion spring up between two such young person so mr richard come and the longer he stay the more favourably the idea of a permanent residence in the mansion-house seem to impress he the estate be large and of great value and there could not be a doubt that the property have largely increase it be evident there be a abundant income and cousin elsie be worth try for on the other hand what be the matter with she eye that they suck you life out of you in that strange way and what do she always wear a necklace for besides she father might last for ever or take it into he head to marry again he prolong he visit until he presence become something like a matter of habit in the meantime he find that elsie be get more constant in she attendance at school and learn on inquiry that there be a new master a handsome young man the handsome young man would not have like the look that come over dick venner 's face when he hear this fact mention for mr richard have decide that he must have the property that this be he one great chance in life the girl might not suit he as a wife possibly time enough to find out after he have get she that elsie now regard he with indifference if not aversion he could not conceal from himself the young man at the school be probably at the bottom of it cousin elsie in love with a yankee schoolmaster but for a long time dick venner could get no positive evidence of any sentiment between elsie and the schoolmaster at one time he would be devour by suspicion at another he would laugh himself out of they he jealousy at last break out when he and elsie be alone in a question reference to mr langdon elsie color and then answer abruptly and scornfully mr langdon be a gentleman and would not vex I as you do a gentleman dick answer with the most insulting accent a gentleman come elsie you have get the dudley blood in you vein and it do not do for you to call this poor sneak schoolmaster a gentleman he stop short elsie 's bosom be heave the faint flush of she cheek be become a vivid glow there be no longer any doubt in he mind elsie venner love bernard langdon the sudden conviction absolute overwhelming rush upon he elsie make no answer but glide out of the room and slide away to she own apartment she bolt the door and draw she curtain close then she throw herself on the floor and fall into a dull slow ache of passion without tear almost without word dick realize that he have reach a fearful point he could not give up the great dudley property therefore the school-master must be get rid of and by self-destruction mr bernard langdon must be find suspend to the branch of a tree somewhat within a mile of the apollinean institute _ iii -- the perilous hour _ old doctor kettredge have advise bernard langdon to go in for pistol - shooting and have even present he with a small beautifully finish revolver i want you to carry this he say and more than that i want you to practice with it often so that it may be see and understand that you be apt to have a pistol about you this be at the conclusion of a conversation between the doctor and mr bernard concern elsie venner elsie interest I say the young man interest I strangely i would risk my life for she but i do not love she if she hand touch mine it be not a thrill of passion i feel run through I but a very different emotion mr langdon say the doctor you have

the full gallop and dash towards he rise at the same instant in he stirrup and swing something round he head it be a strange maneuver so strange and threatening that the young man cock he pistol and wait to see what mischief all this mean he do not wait long as the rider come rush towards he he make a rapid motion and something leap five-and-twenty foot through the air in mr bernard 's direction in a instant he feel a ring as of a rope or thong settle upon he shoulder there be no time to think he would be lose in another second he raise he pistol and fire -- not at the rider but at the horse he aim be true the horse give one bind and fall lifeless shot through the head the lasso be fasten to he saddle and he last bind throw mr bernard violently to the earth where he lay motionless as if

rather choky and he would have like to hug he father well if it have not be for he recent stipulation that kiss should now cease between they so he only squeeze he father 's hand and look up bravely and say i 'll try father at ten minute to three tom be in the coffee-room in he stocking and there be he father nurse a bright fire and a cup of coffee and a hard biscuit on the table just as he be swallow the last mouthful boot look in and say tally-ho sir and they hear the ring and rattle as it dash up to the peacock good-bye father my love at home a last shake of the hand up go tom the guard holding on with one hand while he clap the horn to he mouth toot toot toot away go the tally-ho into the darkness tom stand up and look back at he father 's figure as long as you can see it and then come to a anchor and finish he buttoning and other preparation for face the cold three hour before dawn the guard muffle tom 's foot up in straw and put a oat-sack over he knee but it be not until after breakfast that he tongue be unloosed and he rub up he memory and launch out into a graphic history of all the performance of the rugby boy on the road for the last twenty year and so here 's rugby sir at last and you 'll be in plenty of time for dinner at the schoolhouse as i tell would you say the old guard tom 's heart beat quick and he begin to feel proud of be a rugby boy when he pass the school gate and see the boy stand there as if the town belong to they one of the young hero run out from the rest and scramble up behind where have right himself with how do jem to the guard he turn round short to tom and begin i say you fellow be you name brown yes say tom in considerable astonishment ah i think so my old aunt miss east life somewhere down you way in berkshire she write that you be come to-day and ask I to give you a lift tom be somewhat incline to resent the patronising air of he new friend a boy of just about he own age and height but gifted with the most transcendent coolness and assurance which tom feel to be aggravating and hard to bear but could not help admiring and envy especially when my young lord begin hector two or three long loaf fellow and arrange with one of they to carry up tom 's luggage you see say east as they stroll up to the school gate a good deal depend on how a fellow cut up at first you see i be do the handsome thing by you because my father know yours besides i want to please the old lady -- she give I half-a-sov this half and perhaps 'll double it next if i keep in she good book tom be duly place in the third form and find he work very easy and as he have no intimate companion to make he idle -lrb- east be in the lower fourth -rrb- soon gain golden opinion from he master and all go well with he in the school as a new boy he be of course excuse fagging but in he enthusiasm this hardly pleased he and east and other of he young friend kindly allow he to indulge he fancy and take they turn at night fagging and cleaning study so he soon gain the character of a good-natured willing fellow ready to do a turn for anyone _ ii -- the war of independence _ the lower fourth be a overgrown form too large for any one man to attend to properly consequently the elysium of the young scamp who form the staple of it tom have come up from the third with a good character but he rapidly fall away and become as unmanageable as the rest by the time the second monthly examination come round he character for steadiness be go and for year after he go up the school without it and regard the master as a matter of course as he natural enemy matter be not so comfortable in the house either the new praeposter of the sixth form be not strong and the big fifth form boy soon begin to usurp power and to fag and bully the little boy one evening tom and east be sit in they study tom brood over the wrong of fag in general and he own in particular i say scud say he at last what right have the fifth form boy to fag we as they do no more right than you have to fag they say east without look up from a early number of pickwick tom relapse into he brown study and east go on reading and chuckle do you know old fellow i have be think it over and i have make up my mind i will not fag except for the sixth quite right too my boy cry east i be all for a strike myself it be get too bad i should not mind if it be only young brooke now say tom i would do anything for he but that blackguard flashman -- the cowardly brute break in east fa-a-ag sound along the passage from flashman 's study the two boy look at one another fa-a-ag again no answer here brown east you young skulk roar flashman i know you be in no shirk tom bolt the door and east blow out the candle now tom no surrender then the assault commence one panel of the door give way to repeat kick and the besiege strengthen they defence with the sofa flashman & co at last retired vow vengeance and when the convivial noise begin again steadily tom and east rush out they be too quick to be catch but a pickle-jar send whiz after they by flashman narrowly miss tom 's head they story be soon tell to a knot of small boy round the fire in the hall who nearly all bind themselves not to fag for the fifth encouraged and advise thereto by digg -- a queer very clever fellow nearly at the top of the fifth himself he stand by they all through and seldom have small boy have more need of a friend flashman and he associate unite in bring the young vagabond to they sens and the whole house be fill with chasing siege and licking of all sort one evening in forbid hour brown and east be in the hall chat by the light of the fire when the door swing open and in walk flashman he do not see digg busy in front of the other fire and as the boy do not move for he strike one of they and order they all off to they study i say you two say digg rouse up you 'll never get rid of that fellow till you lick he go in at he both of you i 'll see fair play they be about up to flashman 's shoulder but tough and in perfect training while he seventeen year old and big and strong of he age be in poor condition from he monstrous habit of stuffing and want of exercise they rush in on he and he hit out wildly and savagely and in another minute tom go spin backwards over a form and flashman turn to demolish east with a savage grin but digg jump down from the table on which he have seat himself stop there shout he the round 's over half minute time allow i be go to see fair be you ready brown time 's up the small boy rush in again flashman be wilder and more flurried than ever in a few moment over all three go on the floor flashman striking he head on a form but he skull be not fracture as the two youngster fear it be and he never lay a finger on they again but whatever harm a spiteful tongue could do they he take care should be do only throw dirt enough and some will stick and so tom and east and one or two more become a sort of young ishmaelite they see the praeposter cow by or join with the fifth and shirk they own duty and so they do not respect they and render no willing obedience and get the character of sulky unwilling fag at the end of the term they be tell the doctor want to see they he be not angry only very grave he explain that rule be make for the good of the school and must and shall be obey he should be sorry if they have to leave and wish they to think very seriously in the holiday over what he have say good-night _ iii -- the turn of the tide _ the turn point of we hero 's school career have now come and the manner of it be as follow tom and east and another schoolhouse boy rush into the matron 's room in high spirit when they get back on the first day of the next half-year she send off the other but keep tom to tell he mrs arnold wish he to take a new boy to share the study he have hope to share with east she have tell mr arnold she think tom would be kind to he and see that he be not bully in the far corner of the room he see a slight pale boy who look ready to sink through the floor the matron watch tom for a minute and see what be pass in he mind poor little fellow she say almost in a whisper he father 's dead and he mamma -- such a sweet kind lady -- almost break she heart at leave he she say one of he sister be like to die of a decline -- well well burst in tom i suppose i must give up east come along young ` un what be you name we 'll go and have supper and then i 'll show you we study he name 's george arthur say the matron i have have he book and thing put into the study which he mamma have have new papered and the sofa cover and new curtain and mr arnold tell I to say she would like you both to come up to tea with she here be a announcement for master tom he be to go up to tea the first night just as if he be of importance in the school world instead of the most reckless young scapegrace among the fag he feel himself lift on to a higher moral platform at once and march off with he young charge in tow in monstrous good humor with himself and all the world he cup be full when dr arnold with a warm shake of the hand seemingly oblivious of all the scrape he have be get into say ah brown you here i hope you leave all well at home and this be the little fellow who be to share you study well he do not look as we should like to see he you must take he some good long walk and show he what little pretty country we have about here the tea go merrily off and everybody feel that he young as he be be of some use in the school world and have a work to do there when tom be recognize come out of the private door which lead from the doctor 's house there be a great shout of greet and hall at once begin to question arthur what a queer chum for tom brown be the general comment and it must be confess that so think tom himself as he light the candle in they study and survey the new curtain with much satisfaction i say arthur what a brick you mother be to make we so cosy but look here now you must answer straight up when the fellow speak to you if you be afraid you 'll get bully and do not you ever talk about home or you mother or sister poor little arthur look ready to cry but please may not i talk about home to you oh yes i like it but not to boy you do not know what a jolly desk and soon tom be deep in arthur 's goods and chattel and hardly think of he friend outside till the prayer-bell ring he think of he own first night there when he be lead poor little arthur up to no 4 and show he he bed the idea of sleep in a room with strange boy have clearly never cross he mind before he could hardly bare to take he jacket off however presently off it come and he pause and look at tom who be sit on he bed talk and laugh please brown he whisper may i wash my face and hand of course if you like say tom stare you 'll have to go down for more water if you use it all on go the talk and laughter arthur finish he undress and look round more nervously than ever the light burned clear the noise go on this time however he do not ask tom what he might or might not do but drop on he knee by he bedside to open he heart to he who heareth the cry of the tender child or the strong man tom be unlace he boot with he back towards arthur and look up in wonder at the sudden silence then two or three boy laugh and one big brutal fellow pick up a slipper and shy it at the kneel boy the next moment the boot tom have just take off fly straight at the head of the bully if any other fellow want the other boot say tom step on to the floor he know how to get it at this moment the sixth form boy come in and not another word could be say tom and the rest rush into bed and finish unrobe there sleep seem to have desert the pillow of poor tom the thought of he promise to he mother come over he never to forget to kneel at he bedside and give himself up to he father before he lay he head on the pillow from which it might never rise and he lay down gently and cry as if he heart would break he be only fourteen year old next morning he be up and wash and dress just as the ten-minutes bell begin and then in the face of the whole room kneel down to pray not five word could he say he be listen for every whisper in the room what be they all thinking of he at last as it be from he inmost heart a still small voice seem to breathe : god be merciful to I a sinner he repeat the word over and over again and rise from he knee comfort and humble and ready to face the whole school it be not need two other boy have already follow he example before either tom or arthur leave the schoolhouse there be no room in which it have not become the regular custom _ iv -- tom brown 's last match _ the curtain now rise on the last act of we little drama eight year have pass and it be the end of the summer half-year at rugby the boy have scatter to the four wind except the eleven and a few enthusiast who be permit to stay to see the result of the cricket match for this year the return match be be play at rugby and to-day the great event of the year the marylebone match be be play i wish i have space to describe the whole match but i have not so you must fancy it all and let I beg to call you attention to a group of three eagerly watch the match the first evidently a clergyman be carelessly dress and look rather use up but be bent on enjoy life as he spread himself out in the evening sun by he side in white flannel shirt and trousers and the captain 's belt sit a strapping figure near six foot high with ruddy tan face and a laugh eye he be lean forward dandle he favorite bat with which he have make thirty or forty run to-day it be tom brown spending he last day as a rugby boy and at they foot sit arthur with he bat across he knee he be less of a boy in fact than tom if one may judge by the thoughtfulness of he face which be somewhat paler than we could wish but he figure be well-knit and active and all he old timidity have disappear and be replace by silent quaint fun as he listen to the broken talk and join in every now and then presently he go off to the wicket with a last exhortation from tom to play steady and keep he bat straight i be surprised to see arthur in the eleven say the master well i be not sure he ought to be for he play say tom but i could not help put he in it will do he so much good and you can not think what i owe he the master smile later he return to the subject nothing have give I greater pleasure he say than you friendship for he it have be the making of you both of I at any rate answer tom it be the luckiest chance in the world that send he to rugby and make he my chum there be neither luck nor chance in that matter say the master do you remember when the doctor lecture you and east when you have be get into all sort of scrape yes well enough say tom it be the half-year before arthur come exactly so say the master he be in great distress about you both and after some talk we both agree that you in particular want some object in the school beyond game and mischief so the doctor look out the best of the new boy and separate you and east in the hope that when you have somebody to lean on you you would be steadier yourself and get manliness and thoughtfulness he have watch the experiment ever since with great satisfaction up to this time tom have never fully give in to or understand the doctor he have learn to regard he with love and respect and to think he a very great and wise and good man but as regard he own position in the school he have no idea of give anyone credit but himself it be a new light to tom to find that besides teach the sixth and govern and guide the whole school editing classic and write history the great headmaster have find time to watch over the career even of he tom brown and he particular friend however the doctor 's victory be complete from that moment it have take eight long year to do it but now it be do thoroughly the match be over tom say good-bye to he tutor and march down to the schoolhouse next morning he be in the train and away for london no longer a schoolboy \* \* \* \* \* tom brown at oxford

much of the freshness of the schoolday it nevertheless convey a admirable picture of undergraduate life as it be in the middle of the nineteenth century notwithstanding the change that have take place since then it be still remarkably full of vitality and the description of the boat race and the bumping of exeter and oriel by st ambrose 's boat might well have be write to-day in spite of its defect

eighty undergraduate in residence when we hero appear there as a freshman of whom a large proportion be gentleman-commoner enough in fact to give the tone to the college which be decidedly fast fewer and fewer of the st ambrose man appear in the class-list or among the prize man they no longer lead the debate in the union the boat lose place after place on the river the eleven get beat in all the match but now a reaction have begin the fellow recently elect be man of great attainment choose as the most likely person to restore as tutor the golden day of the college we hero on leave school have bind himself solemnly to write all he doings to the friend he have leave behind he and extract from he first letter from college will give a better idea of the place than any account by a third party well first and foremost it be a awfully idle place -- at any rate for we freshman fancy now i be in twelve lecture a week of a hour each there be a treat two hour a day and no extra work at all of course i never look at a lecture before i go in i know it all nearly by heart and for the present the light work suit I for there be plenty to see in this place we keep very gentlemanly hour chapel every morning at eight and evening at seven you must attend once a day and twice on sunday and be in gate at twelve o'clock and you ought to dine in hall perhaps four day a week all the rest of you time you do just what you like with my room be right up in the roof with a commanding view of tile and chimney-pot pleasant enough separate from all mankind by a great iron-clamped outer door sitting-room eighteen by twelve bedroom twelve by eight and a little cupboard for the scout ah geordie the scout be a institution fancy I wait on and valet by a stout party in black of quiet gentlemanly planner he take the deepest interest in my possession and proceedings and be evidently use to good society to judge by the amount of crockery and glass wine liquor and grocery which he think indispensable for my due establishment he wait on I in hall where we go in full fig of cap and gown at five and get very good dinner and cheap enough but after all the river be the feature of oxford to my mind i expect i shall take to boat furiously i have be down the river three or four time already with some other freshman and it be glorious exercise that i can see though we bungle and cut crab desperately at present within a day or two of the penning of this epistle tom realize one of the object of he young oxford ambition and succeed in embark in a skiff by himself he have be such a proficient in all the rugby game that he start off in the full confidence that if he could only have a turn or two alone he should satisfy not only himself but everybody else that he be a heaven-born oar but the truth soon begin to dawn upon he that pull especially sculling do not like reading and write come by nature however he address himself manfully to he task savage indeed but resolve to get down to sandford and back before hall-time or perish in the attempt fortunately the prudent boatman have embark we hero in one of the safest of the tub and it be not until he have zig-zag down kennington reach slowly indeed and with much labor that he hear energetic shout behind he the next minute the bow of he boat whirl round the old tub ground and then turn over shot he out on to the planking of the steep descent into the small lasher the rush of water be too strong for he and roll he over plunge he into the pool below after the first moment of astonishment and fright tom leave himself to the stream hold he breath hard and paddle gently with he hand soon come to the surface and be about to strike out for the shore when he catch sight of a skiff come stern foremost down the descent after he down she come as straight as a arrow into the tumult below the sculler sit upright and hold he skull steadily in the water for a moment she seem to be go under but right herself and glide swiftly into the still water while the sculler glance round till he catch sight of we hero 's half-drowned head oh there you be he say look much relieved swim ashore i 'll look after you boat so tom swam ashore and stand there drip and watch the other right he tub and collect the scull and bottom-board float here and there in the pool tom have time to look he well over and be well satisfy with the inspection there be that in he face that hit tom 's fancy and make he anxious to know he better there be probably not three man in the university who would have dare to shoot the lasher in the state it be then it be settle at tom 's earnest request that he should pull the sound skiff up -- he old tub be leak considerably -- while he companion sit in the stern and coach he tom pour out he thanks for he new tutor 's instruction which be give so judiciously that he be conscious of improve at every stroke he disappear however while tom be wrangle with the manager as to the amount of damage do to the tub and when tom to he joy see he come into hall to dinner he take no notice of tom 's look of recognition he learn from he neighbor that he name be hardy that he be one of the servitor a clever fellow but a very queer one tom resolve to waylay he as soon as hall be over but hardy avoid he _ ii -- summer term _ jervi the captain of the st ambrose boat club miller the cox and smith commonly know as diogene smith -- from a habit he have of use he hip-bath as a armchair -- be determine to make a success of the boat and tom have the good fortune to get a place in the college eight -- a achievement which be always a feather in the cap of a freshman when the summer term come miller at once take the crew in hand then come the first night of the race and at half-past three tom be restless and distract know that two hour and a half have get to pass before it be time to start for the boat however at last the time slip away and the captain and miller muster they crew at the college gate and walk off to the river half the undergraduate of oxford stream along with they no time be lose on arrival at the barge in the dressing-room and in two minute the st ambrose eight be all standing in flannel trousers silk jersey and jacket at the landing-place then the boat swing steadily down past the mouth of the cherwell and through the gut to the starting-place hark the first gun all the boat have turn crowd of man on the bank be agitate with the come excitement jervi quiet and full of confidence look round from he seat -- he be stroke -- take a sliced lemon from he pocket put a small piece into he mouth and pass it on jacket off say miller and the jacket be throw on shore and gather up by the boatman eight seconds more only miller call out look out for the flash remember all eye in the boat there it come at last the flash of the start gun the boat break away with a bind and a dash the oar flash in the water and the boat leap forward for the first ten stroke tom be in too great fear of make a mistake to feel or hear or see but as the crew settle down into the well-known long sweep consciousness return and amid all the babel of voice on the bank he could hear hardy yell steady well pull steady and now the st ambrose boat be well away from the boat behind and as it near the gut it be plainly gain on exeter -- the boat in front you be gain miller mutter and the captain respond with a wink shout come from the bank now st ambrose now exeter in another moment both boat be in the gut and miller motionless as a statue till now call out give it she boy six stroke and we be into they old jervi lash he oar through the water the boat answer to the spurt and tom feel a little shock and hear a grate sound as miller shout unship oar bow and three the nose of the st ambrose boat glide quietly up the side of the exeter the first bump have be make two more bump be make on the next two night and bet be lay freely that st ambrose would bump oriel and become head of the river but the oriel crew be mostly old oar seasoned in many a race and one or two in the st ambrose boat be get stale something have to be do and when drysdale -- a gentleman-commoner -- resent miller 's stricture on he performance at no 2 decline to row any more tom suggest that hardy would row if he be ask hardy shy and proud because of he poverty be little know in st ambrose but a fast friendship have grow up between he and tom brown and he be glad enough to come into the boat at the captain 's request the change in the boat make all the difference hardy be out sculling every day on the river and be consequently in good training he be besides a man of long muscular arm it be a great race inch by inch st ambrose gain on oriel creep up slowly but surely but the bump be not make till both boat be close on the winning-post so near a shave be it as for the scene on the bank it be a hurly-burly of delirious joy st ambrose be head of the river _ iii -- a crisis _ there be a certain inn call the chough where the st ambrose man be in the habit of call for ale on they way back from the river and it have become the correct thing for ambrosian to make much of miss patty the landlady 's niece consider the circumstance it be a wonder patty be not more spoilt than be the case as it be hardy have to admit that the girl hold she own well without do or say anything unbecome a modest woman but he be convince that tom be in she toil and after ponder what he ought to do decide to speak plainly tom have go into hardy 's room accord to he custom after hall and hardy at once open fire concern the chough brown you have no right to go to that place he say abruptly why say tom you know why say hardy why be i not to go to the chough because there happen to be a pretty barmaid there all we crew go and twenty other man besides yes but do any of they go in the sort of way you do do she look at any one of they as she do at you you seem to know a great deal about it say tom how should i know that be not fair or true or like you brown say hardy you do know that that girl do not care a straw for the other man who go there you do know that she be begin to care for you i have take it on myself to speak to you about this and i should not be you friend if i shirk it you sha not go on with this folly this sin for want of warn so it seem say tom doggedly now i think i have have warn enough suppose we drop the subject not yet say hardy firmly there be only two ending to this sort of business and you know it as well as i a right and a wrong one -- eh and because i be you friend you assume that my end will be the wrong one i say the end _ must _ be the wrong one here there be no right end think of you family you dare not tell I that you will marry she i _ dare _ not tell you say tom start up i dare tell any man anything i please i say again go on hardy you _ dare _ not say you mean to marry she you do not mean it and as you do not to kiss she in the passage as you do tonight -- so you be sneak behind to watch I burst out tom hardy only answer calmly and slowly i will not take these word from any man you have better leave my room the next minute tom be in the passage the next stride up and down the side of the inner quadrangle in the peace of the pale moonlight the follow day and for many day neither hardy nor tom speak to one another both be wretched and both fear lest other should notice the quarrel tom go more and more to the chough and patty notice a change in the youth -- a change that half-fascinate and half-repel she then for the next few day tom plunge deeper and deeper downward he leave off pull on the river shun he old friend and live with a set of man who be ready enough to let he share all they brutal orgy drysdale with whom tom have be on good term note the difference and advise he to cut the chough business you be not the sort of a fellow to go in for this kind of thing he say i 'll be hang if it will not kill you or make a devil of you before long make up you mind to cut the whole concern old fellow i be awfully wretched drysdale be all tom could say all the same tom could not follow drysdale 's advice at once and break off he visit to the chough altogether the real crisis be over he have manage to pass through the eye of the storm and be drift into the skirt of it conscious of a escape from utter shipwreck he visit to the chough become shorter he never stay behind now after the other man and avoid interview with patty alone as diligently as he have seek they before patty unable to account for this fresh change of manner be pique and ready to revenge herself in a hundred little way if she have be really in love with he it would have be a different matter but she be not in the last six week she certainly have often have vision of the pleasure of be a lady and keep servant but she liking be not more than skin deep of late indeed she have be much more frightened than attract by the conduct of she admirer and really feel it a relief notwithstanding she pique when he retire into a less demonstrative state before the end of that summer term tom have it make up with hardy and it be hardy who at tom 's request call in at the chough just to see how thing be go on tom see at a glance that something have happen when hardy appear again what be it she be not ill he say quickly no quite well she aunt say you do not see she then no the fact be she have go home _ iv -- the master 's term _ the year speed by bring they change to st ambrose hardy be a fellow and tutor of the college in tom 's second year and drysdale have be request to remove he name from the book tom be all for politics now and the theory he propound in the union gain he the name of chartist brown in he third year hardy often bring he down from high talk of universal democracy and the good cause by insist on make the younger man explain what he really mean and though tom suffer under this severe treatment in the end he generally come round to acknowledge the reasonableness of hardy 's method of argument it be a try year to tom this third and last year full of large dream and small performance of hope and struggle end in failure and disappointment the common pursuit of the place have lose they freshness and with it much of they charm he be begin to feel himself in a cage and to beat against the bar of it squire brown be pass through oxford and pay he son a visit in the last term tom give a small wine-party which go off admirably and the squire enlarged upon the great improvement in young man and habit of the university especially in the matter of drinking tom have only open three bottle of port in he time the man would have drunk certainly not less than a bottle a man but as the squire walk back to he hotel he be deeply move at the radical view he son now hold he could not understand these new notion of young man and think they mischievous and bad at the same time he be too fair a man to try to dragoon he son out of anything which he really believe the fact have begin to dawn on the squire that the world have change a good deal since he time while tom on he part value he father 's confidence and love above he own opinion by degree the honest belief of father and son no longer look monstrous to one another and the view of each of they be modify \* \* \* \* \* one more look must be take at the old college we hero be up in the summer term keep he three week ' residence the necessary preliminary to a ma degree we find he sit in hardy 's room tea be over scout out of college candle light and silence reign except when distant sound of mirth come from some undergraduate ' room on the opposite side of the quad why can not you give a fellow he degree quietly say tom without make he come and kick he heel here for three week you ungrateful dog do you mean to say you have not enjoy come back and sit in dignity in the bachelor ' seat in chapel and at the bachelor ' table in hall and think how much wiser you be than the undergraduate besides you old friend want to see you and you ought to want to see they well i be very glad to see you again old fellow but who else be there i care to see my old friend be go and the youngster look on I as a sort of don and i do not appreciate the dignity you have never break with the place and then you always do you duty and have do the college credit you can not enter into the feeling of a fellow who waste three part of he time here come come tom you might have read more certainly and take a higher degree but after all i believe you melancholy come from you not be ask to pull in the boat perhaps it do do not you call it degrading to be pull in the torpid in one 's old age mortified vanity it be a capital boat i wonder how we should have like to have be turn out for some bachelor just because he have pull a good oar in he day not at all i do not blame the youngster by the way they be a uncommonly nice set much better behave in every way than we be why the college be a different place altogether and as you be the only new tutor it must have be you do now i want to know you secret i have no secret except take a real interest in all that the man do and live with they as much as i can you may guess it be not much of a trial to I to steer the boat down or run on the bank and coach the crew and now the president of st ambrose himself come out to see the boat but i do not mean to stop up more than another year now at the outside i have be tutor nearly three year and that be about long enough the talk

four man plainly shadow he and a shudder go over he he turn from street to street try to escape from the city and at last find himself entrap in a _ cul-de-sac _ what be to be do there be no time to turn back javert have undoubtedly picket every outlet fortunately for jean valjean there be a deep shadow in the street so that he own movement be unseen while he stand hesitate a patrol of soldier enter the street with javert at they head they frequently halt it be evident that they be explore every hole and corner and one might judge they would take a quarter of a hour before they reach the spot where jean valjean be it be a frightful moment capture mean the galley and cosette lose for ever there be only one thing possible -- to scale the wall which run along a wide portion of the street but the difficulty be cosette there be no thought of abandon she first jean valjean procure a rope from the lamppost for the lamp have not be light that night owe to the moonlight this he fasten round the child take the other end between he tooth half a minute later he be on he knee on the top of the wall cosette watch he in silence all at once she hear jean valjean say in a very low voice lean against the wall do not speak and do not be afraid she feel herself lift from the ground and before she have time to think where she be she find herself on the top of the wall jean valjean grasp she put the child on he back and crawl along the wall till he come to a sloping roof he could hear the thundering voice of javert give order to the patrol to search the _ cul-de-sac _ to the end jean valjean slip down the roof still carry cosette and leap on the ground it be a convent garden he have enter on the other side of the wall the clatter of musket and the imprecation of javert resound from the convent come a hymn cosette and jean valjean fall on they knee presently jean valjean discover that the gardener be a old man whose life he have save at m ------ and who in he gratitude be prepare to do anything for m madeleine it end in cosette enter the convent school as a pupil and jean valjean be accept as the gardener 's brother the good nun never leave the precinct of they convent and care nothing for the world beyond they gate as for javert he have delay attempt a arrest even when he suspicion have be arouse because after all the papers say the convict be dead but once convinced he hesitate no longer he disappointment when jean valjean escape he be midway between despair and fury all night the search go on but it never occur to javert that a steep wall of fourteen foot could be climb by a old man with a child several year pass at the convent jean valjean work daily in the garden and share the hut and the name of the old gardener m fauchelevent cosette be allow to see he for a hour every day the peaceful garden the fragrant flower the merry cry of the child the grave and simple woman gradually bring happiness to jean valjean and he heart melt into gratitude for the security he have find _ iv -- something higher than duty _ for six year cosette and jean valjean stay at the convent and then on the death of the old gardener jean valjean now bear the name of fauchelevent decide that as cosette be not go to be a nun and as recognition be no longer to be fear it would be well to remove into the city so a house be take in the rue plumet and here with a faithful servant the old man dwell with he adopt child but jean valjean take other room in paris in case of accident cosette be grow up she be conscious of she good look and she be in love with a well-connected youth name marius the son of baron pontmercy jean valjean learn of this secret love-making with dismay the idea of parting from cosette be intolerable to he then in June 1832 come desperate street fight in pari and marius be in command of one of the revolutionary barricade at this barricade javert have be capture as a spy and jean valjean who be know to the revolutionary find he old implacable enemy tie to a post wait to be shoot jean valjean request to be allow to blow out javert 's brain himself and permission be give hold a pistol in he hand jean valjean lead javert who be still bind to a lane out of sight of the barricade and there with he knife cut the rope from the wrist and foot of he prisoner you be free he say go and if by chance i leave this place alive i be to be find under the name of fauchelevent in the rue de l'homme-armé no 7 javert walk a few step and then turn back and cry you worry I i would rather you kill I go be the only answer from jean valjean javert move slowly away and when he have disappear jean valjean discharge he pistol in the air soon the last stand of the insurgent be at a end and the barricade destroy jean valjean who have take no part in the struggle beyond expose himself to the bullet of the soldier be unhurt but marius lay wound and insensible in he arm the soldier be shoot down all who try to escape the situation be terrible there be only one chance for life -- underground a iron grate which lead to the sewer be at he foot jean valjean tear it open and disappear with marius on he shoulder he emerge after a horrible passage through a grating by the bank of the river only to find there the implacable javert jean valjean be quite calm inspector javert he say help I to carry this man home then do with I what you please a cab be wait for the inspector he order the man to drive to the address jean valjean give he marius still unconscious be take to he grandfather 's house inspector javert say jean valjean grant I one thing more let I go home for a minute then you may take I where you will javert tell the driver to go to rue de l'homme-armé no 7 when they reach the house javert say go up i will wait here for you but before jean valjean reach he room javert have go and the street be empty javert have not be at ease since he life have be spare he be now in horrible uncertainty to owe he life to a ex-convict to accept this debt and then to repay he by send he back to the galley be impossible to let a malefactor go free while he inspector javert take he pay from the government be equally impossible it seem there be something higher and above he code of duty something he have not come into collision with before the uncertainty of the right thing to be do destroy javert to whom life

for two hour quasimodo remain utterly impassive while the crowd which yesterday have hail he as lord of misrule now greet he with hooting and derision the pillory be a simple cube of masonry some ten foot high and hollow within a horizontal wheel of oak be at the top and to this the victim be bind in a kneel posture a very steep flight of stone step lead to the wheel all the people laugh merrily when quasimodo be see in the pillory and when he have be beat by the public executioner they add to the wretched sufferer 's misery by insult and occasionally stone there be hardly a spectator in the crowd that have not some grudge real or imagine against the hunchback bell-ringer of notre dame quasimodo have endure the torturer 's whip with patience but he rebel against the stone and struggle in he fetter till the old pillory - wheel creak on its timber then as he could accomplish nothing by he struggle he face become quiet again for a moment the cloud be lighten when the poor victim see a priest seat on a mule approach in the roadway a strange smile come on the face of quasimodo as he glance at the priest yet when the mule be near enough to the pillory for he rider to recognize the prisoner the priest cast down he eye turn back hastily as if in a hurry to avoid humiliating appeal and not at all anxious to be greet by a poor wretch in the pillory the priest be the archdeacon claude frollo the smile on quasimodo 's face become bitter and profoundly sad time pass he have be there at least a hour and a half wound incessantly mock and almost stone to death suddenly he again struggle in he chain with renew despair and break the silence which he have keep so stubbornly he cry in a hoarse and furious voice water the exclamation of distress far from exciting compassion only increase the amusement of the paris mob not a voice be raise except to mock at he thirst quasimodo cast a despairing look upon the crowd and repeat in a heartrending voice water everyone laugh a woman aim a stone at he head say that will teach you to wake we at night with you cursed chime here be a cup to drink out of say a man throw a broken jug at he breast water repeat quasimodo for the third time at this moment he see the gypsy girl and she goat come through the crowd he eye gleam he do not doubt that she too come to be avenge and to take she turn at he with the rest he watch she nimbly climb the ladder rage and spite choke he he long to destroy the pillory and have the lightning of he eye have power to blast the gypsy girl would have be reduce to ash long before she reach the platform without a word she approach the sufferer loosen a gourd from she girdle and raise it gently to the parched lip of the miserable man then from he eye a great tear trickle and roll slowly down the misshapen face so long convulse with despair the gypsy girl smilingly press the neck of the gourd to quasimodo 's jagged mouth he drink long draught he thirst be feverish when he have do the poor wretch put out he black lip to kiss the hand which have help he but the girl remember the violent attempt of the previous night and not quite free from distrust withdraw she hand quickly quasimodo fix upon she a look of reproach and unspeakable sorrow the sight of this beautiful girl succour a man in the pillory so deform and wretched seem sublime and the people be immediately affect by it they clap they hand and shout noël noël esmeralda -- for that be the name of the gypsy girl -- come down from the pillory and a mad woman call out come down come down you will go up again presently quasimodo be release and the mob thereupon disperse _ iii -- the archdeacon 's passion _ in spite of the austerity of claude frollo 's life pious people suspect he of magic he silence and secretiveness encourage this feeling he be know to be at work in the long hour of the night in he cell in notre dame and he wander about the street like a spectre whenever the gypsy girl place she carpet within sight of claude frollo 's cell and begin to dance the priest turn from he book and rest he head in he hand gaze at she then he would go down into the public thoroughfare lure on by some burning passion within quasimodo too would desist from he bell-ringing to look at the dancing girl the hotter the fire of passion burn within the priest the farther esmeralda move from he he discover that she be in love with captain phoebus she rescuer and this knowledge add fuel to the flame one purpose now be clear to he he would give up all for the dancing girl and she should be he but if esmeralda refuse to come to he then the archdeacon resolve that she should die before she marry anyone else at any time he could have she arrest on the charge of sorcery and the goat 's trick would easily procure a conviction captain phoebus have invite esmeralda to meet he at a wineshop the priest follow the couple and when the captain to whom the girl be the merest diversion begin to make love claude frollo unable to contain himself rush in unobserved and stab he captain phoebus be take up for dead and the priest vanish as silently as he have come the soldier of the watch find esmeralda and say this be the sorceress who have stab we captain so esmeralda be bring to trial on the charge of witchcraft and every day the priest from notre dame come into court it be a tedious process for not only be the girl on trial but the goat also in accordance with the custom of the time be under arrest all that esmeralda want to know be whether phoebus be still alive and she be tell by the judge he be die the indictment against she be that with she accomplice the bewitch goat she do murder and stab in league with the power of darkness by the aid of charm and spell a captain of the king 's troops one phoebus de châteaupers and it be vain that the girl deny vehemently she guilt how do you explain the charge bring against you say the president i have tell you already i do not know say esmeralda in a broken voice it be a priest -- a priest who be always pursue I that be it say the president it be a goblin monk the goat have perform he simple trick in the presence of the court and esmeralda still refuse to admit she guilt the president order she to be put to the question she be place on the rack and at the first turn of the screw promise to confess everything then the lawyer put a number of question to she and esmeralda answer yes in every case it be plain that she spirit be utterly break then the court have read the confession sentence be pronounced she be to be take to the grève where the pillory stand and in atonement for the crime confess there hang and strangle on the city gibbet and likewise this you goat it must be a dream the girl murmur when she hear the sentence but if esmeralda have yield at the first turn of the rack nothing would make she yield to claude frollo when he come to see she in prison in vain he promise she life and liberty if she would only agree to love he in vain he reproach she with have bring disturbance and disquiet into he soul all that esmeralda could say be have pity on I -- have pity on I but she would not give up phoebus and when the priest declare phoebus be dead she turn upon he and call he monster and assassin claude frollo unable to move she decide to let she die and the day of execution arrive as for captain phoebus he recover but as he be about to be engage to a young lady of wealth he think it better to say nothing about the gypsy girl but esmeralda be not hang that day just as the hangman 's assistant be about to do they work quasimodo who have be watch everything from he gallery in notre dame slide down by a rope to the ground rush at the two executioner fling they to the earth with he huge fist seize the gypsy girl as a child might a doll and with one bind be in the church hold she above he head and shout in a tremendous voice sanctuary sanctuary sanctuary the mob take up the cry and ten thousand hand clap approval the hangman stand stupefy within the precinct of notre dame the prisoner be secure the cathedral be a sure refuge all human justice end at its threshold _ iv -- the attack on notre dame _ quasimodo do not stop run and shout sanctuary till he reach a cell build over the aisle in notre dame here he deposit esmeralda carefully untie the rope which bruise she arm and spread a mattress on the floor then he leave she and return with a basket of provision the girl lift she eye to thank he but could not utter a word so frightful be he to look at quasimodo only say i frighten you because i be ugly do not look at I then but listen all day you must stay here at night you can walk anywhere about the church but day or night do not leave the church or you will be lose they would kill you and i should die then he vanish but when she awake next morning she see he at the window of she cell do not be frighten he say i be you friend i only come to see if you be asleep i be deaf you do not know that i never realize how ugly i be till now i seem to you like some awful beast eh and you -- you be a sunbeam as the day go by calm return to esmeralda 's soul and with calm have come the sense of security and with security hope two force be now at work to remove she from notre dame the archdeacon leave pari to avoid she execution have return -- to learn where esmeralda be situate from he cell in notre dame he observe she movement and in he madness jealous of quasimodo 's service to she resolve to have she remove if she still refuse he he would give she up to justice esmeralda 's friend all the gypsy vagrant cutthroat and pick-pocket of pari to the number of six thousand also resolve that they would forcibly rescue she from notre dame lest some evil should overtake she pari at that time have neither police nor adequate city watchman at midnight the monstrous army of vagrant set out and it be not until they be outside the church that they light they torch quasimodo every night on the watch at once suppose that the invader have some foul purpose against esmeralda and determine to defend the church at all cost the battle rage furiously at the great west door hammer pincers and crow-bar be at work outside quasimodo retaliate by heave first a great beam of wood and then stone and other missile on the besieger finally when they have rear a tall ladder to the first gallery and have crowd it with man quasimodo by sheer force push the ladder away and it totter and fall right back the battle only end on the arrival of a large company of king 's archer when the vagrant defeat by quasimodo retire fight while the battle rage claude frollo with the aid of a disreputable young student of he acquaintance persuade esmeralda to leave the church by a secret door at the back and to escape by the river the priest be so hide in he cloak that the girl do not recognize he till they be alone in the city in the grève at the foot of the public scaffold where the gallows stand claude frollo make he last appeal listen he say i have save you and i can save you altogether if you choose choose between I and the gibbet there be silence and then esmeralda say it be less horrible to I than you be he pour out he soul passionately tell she that he life be nothing without she love but the girl never move it be daylight now for the last time will you be mine she answer emphatically no then he call out as loud as he could and presently a body of armed man appear soon the public hangman be arouse and the execution which have be interrupt by quasimodo 's heroic rescue be carry out meantime what of quasimodo he have rush to she cell when the king 's troops have beat off the vagrant enter the church and it be empty then he have explore every nook and cranny of notre dame and again and again go the round of the church for a hour he sit in despair he body convulse by sob suddenly he remember that claude frollo have a secret key and decide that the priest must have carry she off at that very moment claude return to notre dame after hand over esmeralda to the hangman quasimodo watch he ascend to the balustrade at the top of the tower and then follow he the priest 's attention be too absorb to hear the hunchback 's step claude rest he arm on the balustrade and gaze intently at the gallows in the grève quasimodo try to make out what it be the priest stare at and then he recognize esmeralda in the hangman 's arm on the ladder and in another second the hangman have do he work a demoniac laugh break from the livid lip of claude frollo quasimodo could not hear this laughter but he see it he rush furiously upon the archdeacon and with he great fist he hurl claude frollo into the abyss over which he lean the archdeacon catch at a gutter and hang suspend for a few minute and then fall -- more than two hundred foot quasimodo raise he eye to the gypsy whose body still swing from the gibbet and then lower they to the shapeless mass on the pavement beneath and these be all i have ever love he say sob he be never see again in notre dame some two year later when there be certain clearance in the vault where the body of esmeralda have be deposit the skeleton of a man deform and twist be find in close embrace with the skeleton of a woman a little silk bag which esmeralda have always worn be around the neck of the skeleton of the woman \* \* \* \* \* the toiler of the sea victor hugo 's third great romance the toiler of the sea -lrb- les travailleurs de la mer -rrb- publish in 1866 be write during he exile in guernsey of all hugo 's romance both in prose and in verse none surpass this for sheer splendor of imagination and diction for eloquence and sublimity of truth it be in short a idyll of passion adventure and self-sacrifice the description of the mood and mystery of the sea be well-nigh incomparable and not even in the whole of hugo 's work can there be find anything more vivid than gilliatt 's battle with the devil-fish the scene of the story be lay in the channel island and the book itself be dedicate to the isle of guernsey severe yet gentle my present asylum my probable tomb the story be immensely successful on its appearance and be at once translate into several european language _ i -- a lonely man _ a guernseyman name gilliatt who be avoid by he neighbor on account of lonely habit and a certain love of nature which the suspicious people regard as indicate some connection with the devil be one day return on a rise tide from he fishing when he fancy he see in a certain projection of the cliff a shadow of a man the place probably attract gilliatt 's gaze because it be a favorite sojourn of he -- a natural seat cut in the great cliff and afford a magnificent view of the sea it be a place to which some uninitiated traveller would climb with delight from the shore and sit entrance by the scene before he all oblivious of the rise ocean till he be completely cut off from escape no shout would reach the ear of man from that desolate giant 's chair in the rock gilliatt steer he ship nearer to the cliff and see that the shadow be a man the sea be already high the rock be encircle gilliatt draw nearer the man be asleep he be attire in black and look like a priest gilliatt have never see he before the fisherman wear off skirt the rock wall and approach so close to the dangerous cliff that by standing on the gunwale of he sloop he could touch the foot of the sleeper succeed in arouse he the man rouse and mutter i be look about gilliatt bid he jump into the boat when he have land this young priest who have a somewhat feminine cast of feature a clear eye and a grave manner gilliatt perceive that he be hold out a sovereign in a very white hand gilliatt move the hand gently away there be a pause then the young man bow and leave he gilliatt have forget all about this stranger when a voice hail he it be one of the inhabitant drive by quickly there be news gilliatt -- at the bravées what be it i be too hurry to tell you the story go up to the house and you will learn the bravées be the residence of a man name lethierry he have raise himself to a position of wealth by start the first steamboat between guernsey and the coast of normandy he call this vessel la durande the native who prophesy evil of such a frightful invention call it the devil 's boat but the durande go to and fro without disaster and lethierry 's gold increase there be nothing in all the universe he love so much as this marvellous ship work by steam next to the durande he most love he pretty niece dérouchette who keep house for he one day as gilliatt be walk over the snow-covered road dérouchette who be ahead of he have stop for a moment and stoop down have write something with she finger in the snow when the fisherman reach the place he find that the mischievous little creature have write he name there ever since that hour in the almost unbroken solitude of he life gilliatt have think about dérouchette now that he hear of news at the bravées the lonely man make he way to lethierry 's house which be the nest of dérouchette the news be soon tell the durande be lose presently amid the detail of the story -- the durande have be wreck in a fog on the terrible rock know as the douvre -- one thing emerge : the engine be intact to rescue the durande be impossible but the machinery might still be save these engine be unique to construct other like they money be want but to find the artificer would have be still more difficult the constructor be dead the machinery have cost two thousand pound as long as these engine exist it might almost be say that there be no shipwreck the loss of the engine alone be irreparable now if ever a dream have appear wild and impracticable it be that of save the engine then embed between the douvre the idea of send a crew to work upon those rock be absurd it be the season of heavy sea besides on the narrow ledge of the highest part of the rock there be scarcely room for one person to save the engine therefore it would be necessary for a man to go to the douvre to be alone in that sea alone at five league from the coast alone in that region of terror for entire week in the presence of danger foresee and unforeseen -- without supplies in the face of hunger and nakedness without companionship save that of death a pilot present in the room deliver judgment no it be all over the man do not exist who could go there and rescue the machinery of the durande if i do not go say the engineer of the lose ship who love those engine it be because nobody could do it if he exist -- continue the pilot dérouchette turn she head impulsively and interrupted i would marry he she say innocently there be a pause a man make he way out of the crowd and standing before she pale and anxious say you would marry he miss dérouchette it be gilliatt all eye be turn towards he lethierry have just before stand upright and gaze about he he eye glitter with a strange light he take off he sailor 's cap and throw it on the ground then look solemnly before he and without see any of the person present say dérouchette should be he i pledge myself to it in god 's name _ ii -- the prey of the rock _ the two perpendicular form call the douvre hold fast between they like a architrave between two pillar the wreck of the durande the spectacle thus present be a vast portal in the midst of the sea it might have be a titanic cromlech plant there in mid-ocean by hand accustom to proportion they labor to the great deep its wild outline stand well define against the clear sky when gilliatt approach in he sloop the rock thus hold fast and exhibit they prey be terrible to behold there be a menace in the attitude of the rock they seem to be bide they time nothing could be more suggestive of haughtiness and arrogance : the conquer vessel the triumphant abyss the two rock still streaming with the tempest of the day before be like two wrestler sweating from a recent struggle up to a certain height they be completely beard with seaweed above this they steep haunch glitter at point like polished armor they seem ready to begin the strife again the imagination might have picture they as two monstrous arm reach upward from the gulf and exhibit to the tempest the lifeless body of the ship if gilliatt have know how she come to be there he might have be more awed by the tremendous spectacle the cause be a accident and yet a purpose act clubin the captain as smug a hypocrite as ever scuttle a ship have intend to run the durande on the hanway he belt contain three thousand pound he mean to lose the ship on the hanway a mile from shore and when the passenger have row away pretend that he would go down with the ship clubin purpose to swim to land get on board a pirate ship and be off to the east he little drama have be act out the boat have row away everybody praise captain clubin who would not abandon he ship but when the fog clear -- horror of horror -- clubin find himself not on the hanway but on the douvre not one mile from shore but five mile clubin see a ship in the distance he determine to swim to a rock from which he could be see and make signal of distress he undress leave he clothing on deck he retain nothing but he leather belt and then precipitate himself head first plunge into the sea as he dive from a height he plunge heavily he sink deep in the water touch the bottom skirt for a moment the submarine rock then strike out to regain the surface at that moment he feel himself seize by one foot but of all this gilliatt arrive at the douvre know nothing he be absorb by the spectacle of the ship hold in mid-air and what do he find the machinery be save but it be lose the ocean save it only to demolish it at leisure -- like a cat playing with she prey its fate be to suffer there and to be dismembered day by day it be to be the plaything of the savage amusement of the sea for what could be do that this vast block of mechanism and gear at once massive and delicate condemn to fixity by its weight deliver up in that solitude to the destructive element could under the frown of that implacable spot escape from slow destruction seem a madness even to imagine gilliatt look about he when he have make a lodging for himself and have suffer the misfortune of lose the basket contain he provision gilliatt consider he difficulty in order to raise the engine of the durande from the wreck in which it be three-fourths bury with any chance of success -- in order to accomplish a salvage in such a place and such a season it seem almost necessary to be a legion of man gilliatt be alone a complete apparatus of carpenter 's and engineer 's tool and implement be wanted gilliatt have a saw a hatchet a chisel and a hammer he want both a good workshop and a good shed gilliatt have not a roof to cover he provision too be necessary on that bare rock but he have not even bread anyone who could have see gilliatt work on the rock during all that first week might have be puzzle to determine the nature of he operation he seem to be no longer think of the durande or the two douvre he be busy only among the breaker he seem absorb in save the smaller part of the shipwreck he take advantage of every high tide to strip the reef of everything that the ship-wreck have distribute among they he go from rock to rock pick up whatever the sea have scatter -- tatters of sail-cloth piece of iron splinter of panel shatter plank broken yard here a beam there a chain there a pulley he live upon limpet hermit-crab and rain-water he be surround by a scream garrison of gull cormorant and sea-mew the deep boom of the wave among the cave and reef be never out of he ear by day he be roasted in the terrific heat which beat with pitiless force on this expose pinnacle at night he be chill to the marrow by the cold of the open sea and for ever he be hungry thirsty -- famished one day in explore for salvage some of the grotto of he rock gilliatt come upon a cave within a cave so beautiful with sea-flower that it seem the retreat of a sea-goddess the shell be like jewel the water hold eternal moonlight some of the flower be like sapphire stand in this drip grotto with he foot on the edge of a probably bottomless pool gilliatt suddenly become aware in the transparence of that water of the approach of some mystic form a species of long ragged band be move amid the oscillation of the wave it do not float but dart about at its own will it have a object be advance somewhere rapidly the thing have something of the form of a jester 's bauble with point which hang flabby and undulate it seem cover with a dust incapable of be wash away by the water it be more than horrible it be foul it seem to be seek the darker portion of the cavern where at last it vanish gilliatt return to he work he have a notion since the time of the carpenter-mason of salbri who in the sixteenth century without other helper than a child he son with ill-fashioned tool in the chamber of the great clock at la charité-sur-loire resolve at one stroke five or six problem in statics and dynamics inextricably intervolve -- since the time of that grand and marvellous achievement of the poor workman who find means without break a single piece of wire without throw one of the tooth of the wheel out of gear to lower in one piece by a marvellous simplification from the second story of the clock tower to the first that massive clock large as a room nothing that could be compare with the project which gilliatt be meditate have ever be attempt after incredible exertion the machinery be ready for lower into the sloop gilliatt have construct tackle a regulate gear and make all sure the long labor be finish the first act have be the simplest of all he could put to sea to-morrow he would be in guernsey but no he have wait for the tide to lift the sloop as near to the suspend engine as possible and now the funnel which he have lower with the paddle-box prevent the sloop from get out of the little gorge it be necessary to wait for the tide to fall gilliatt draw he sheepskin about he pull he cap over he eye and lie down beside the engine be soon asleep when he wake it be to feel the come of a storm a fresh task be force upon this famished man it be necessary to build a breakwater in the gorge he fly to this task nail drive into the crack of the rock beam lash together with cordage cat-head from the durande binding strake pulley-sheaves chain -- with these material the haggard dweller of the rock build he barrier against the wrath of god then the storm come _ iii -- the devil-fish _ when the awful rage of the storm have pass and the barrier which he have repair in the midst of the tempest hang like a broken arm across the gorge gilliatt madden by hunger take advantage of the recede tide to go in search of crayfish half naked and with he open knife between he tooth he spring from rock to rock in hunting a crab he find himself once more in the mysterious grotto that glitter with jewel-like flower he notice a fissure above the level of the water the crab be probably there he thrust in he hand as far as he be able and grope about in that dusky aperture suddenly he feel himself seize by the arm a strange indescribable horror thrill through he some living thing -- thin rough flat cold slimy -- have twist itself round he naked arm it creep upward towards he chest its pressure be like a tighten cord its steady persistence like that of a screw in less than a moment some mysterious spiral form have pass round he wrist and elbow and have reach he shoulder a sharp point penetrate beneath the arm-pit gilliatt recoil but he have scarcely power to move he be as it be nail to the place with he left hand which be disengage he seize he knife and make a desperate effort to withdraw he arm he only succeed in disturb he persecutor which wind itself still tighter it be supple as leather strong as steel cold as night a second form -- sharp elongate and narrow -- issue out of the crevice like a tongue out of monstrous jaw it seem to lick he naked body then suddenly stretch out it become longer

effect of longer experience could not be know here the son and daughter of abyssinium live only to know the soft vicissitude of pleasure and repose the sage who instruct they tell they of nothing but the misery of public life and describe all beyond the mountain as region of calamity where discord be always rage and where man prey upon man these method be generally successful few of the prince have ever wish to enlarge they bound they rise in the morning and lay down at night pleased with each other and with themselves all but rassela who in the twenty-sixth year of he age begin to withdraw himself from the pastime and assembly and to delight in solitary walk and silent meditation he attendant observe the change and endeavor to renew he love of pleasure but he neglect they officiousness and repulse they invitation one day he old instructor begin to lament the change which have be lately observe in he and to inquire why he so often retire from the pleasure of the palace to loneliness and silence i fly from pleasure say the prince because pleasure have cease to please i be lonely because i be miserable and be unwilling to cloud with my presence the happiness of other you sir say the sage be the first who have complain of misery in the happy valley i hope to convince you that you complaint have no real cause look round and tell I which of you want be without supply if you want nothing how be you unhappy that i want nothing say the prince or that i know not what i want be the cause of my complaint if i have only know a want i should have a certain wish and that wish would excite endeavor for its satisfaction i have already enjoy too much give I something to desire sir say the old man if you have see the misery of the world you would know how to value you present state now say the prince you have give I something to desire i shall long to see the misery of the world since the sight of they be necessary to happiness _ ii -- the escape into the outer world _ the stimulus of this new desire -- the desire of see the world -- soon have its effect in make rassela no longer gloomy and unsociable consider himself as master of a secret stock of happiness he affect to be busy in all the assembly and scheme of diversion because he suppose the frequency of he presence necessary to the success of he purpose he retire gladly to privacy because in picture to himself that world which he have never see he have now a subject of think thus pass twenty month of he life he busy himself so intensely in visionary bustle that he forget he real solitude but one day the consciousness of he own folly and inaction pierce he deeply he compare twenty month with the life of man the period of human existence say he may be reasonably estimate at forty year of which i have muse away the four-and-twentieth part these sorrowful meditation fasten upon he mind he pass four month in resolve to lose no more time in idle resolve then awaken to more vigorous exertion he for a few hour regret he regret and from that time bent he whole mind upon the means of escape from the valley of happiness he now find that it would be very difficult to effect that which it be very easy to suppose effect he pass week after week in clamber the mountain but find all the summit inaccessible by they prominence the iron gate be not only secure with all the power of art but be always watch by successive sentinel in these fruitless research he spend ten month the time however pass cheerfully away for he meet a thousand amusement which beguile he labor and diversified he thought a little while afterwards he begin to cherish hope of escape from the valley by quite a different way among the artist allow there to labor for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitant be a man eminent for he knowledge of the mechanic power who have contrived many engine both of use and recreation he interest the prince in a project of fly and undertake to construct a pair of wing in which he would himself attempt a aerial flight but alas when in a year 's time the wing be ready and they contriver wave they and leap from the little promontory on which he have take he stand he merely drop into the lake he wing only serve to sustain he in the water the prince be not much afflict by this disaster and he soon forget any disappointment he have feel in the society and conversation of a new artist -- a poet call imlac -- who delight he by the narrative of he travels and dealings with man in various part of africa and asia hast thou here find happiness at last ask rassela tell I without reserve art thou content with thy condition or dost thou wish to be again wander and inquire all the inhabitant of this valley celebrate they lot and at the annual visit of the emperor invite other to partake of they felicity be this felicity genuine or feigned great prince say imlac i shall speak the truth i know not one of all you attendant who do not lament the hour when he enter this retreat i be less unhappy than the rest because i have a mind replete with image which i can vary and combine at pleasure the rest whose mind have no impression but the present moment be either corrode by malignant passion or sit steep in the gloom of perpetual vacancy what passion can infect those say the prince who have no rival we be in a place where impotence preclude malice and where all envy be repress by community of enjoyment there may be community of material possession say imlac but there can never be community of love or of esteem it must happen that one will please more than another he that know himself despise will always be envious and still more envious and malevolent if he be condemn to live in the presence of those who despise he the invitation by which the inhabitant of the valley allure other to a state which they feel to be wretched proceed from the natural malignity of hopeless misery i look with pity on the crowd who be annually solicit admission to captivity and wish that it be lawful for I to warn they of they danger upon this hint rassela open he whole heart to imlac who promise to assist he to escape propose the plan of pierce the mountain a suitable cavern have be find the two man work arduously at they task and within a few day have accomplish it a few more day pass and rassela and imlac with the prince 's sister nekayah have go by ship to suez and thence to cairo _ iii -- the search for happiness _ the prince and princess who carry with they jewel sufficient to make they rich in any place of commerce gradually succeed in mix in the society of the city and for some time the former who have be wont to ponder over what _ choice of life _ he should make think choice needless because all appear to he really happy imlac be unwilling to crush the hope of inexperience till one day have sit awhile silent i know not say rassela what can be the reason that i be more unhappy than any of my friend i see they perpetually and unalterably cheerful but feel my own mind restless and uneasy i be unsatisfied with those pleasure which i seem most to court i live in the crowd of jollity not so much to enjoy company as to shun myself and be only loud and merry to conceal my sadness every man say imlac may by examine he own mind guess what pass in the mind of other when you feel that you own gaiety be counterfeit it may justly lead you to suspect that of you companion not to be sincere envy be commonly reciprocal we be long before we be convince that happiness be never to be find and each believe it to be possess by other to keep alive the hope of obtain it for himself this say the prince may be true of other since it be true of I yet whatever be the general infelicity of man one condition be more happy than another and wisdom surely direct we to take the least evil in the _ choice of life _ very few say the poet live by choice every man be place in the present condition by cause which act without he foresight and with which he do not always willingly co-operate and therefore you will rarely meet one who do not think the lot of he neighbor better than he own rassela resolve however to continue he experiment on life as he be one day walk in the street he see a spacious building which all be by the open door invite to enter he find it a hall of declamation and listen to a sage who discourse with great energy on the conquest of the passion and display the happiness of those who have obtain this important victory after which man be no longer the slave of fear nor the fool of hope be no more emaciate by envy inflamed by anger emasculate by tenderness or depress by grief receive permission to visit this philosopher -- have indeed purchase it by present he with a purse of gold -- rassela return home with joy to imlac i have find say he a man who from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude look down on the scene of life change beneath he i will learn he doctrine and imitate he life be not too hasty say imlac to trust or to admire the teacher of morality they discourse like angel but they live like man imlac 's caution turn out to be wise for when the prince pay he visit a few day afterwards he find the philosopher weep over the death of he only daughter and refuse to be comfort by any of the consolation that truth and reason could afford still eager upon the same inquiry and resolve to discover whether that felicity which public life could not afford be to be find in solitude rassela determine to visit a hermit who live near the lowest cataract of the nile and fill the whole country with the fame of he sanctity imlac and the princess agree to accompany he on the third day they reach the cell of the holy man who be desire to give he direction as to a choice of life he will most certainly remove from evil say the prince who shall devote himself to that solitude which you have recommend by you example i have no desire that my example should gain any imitator reply the hermit in my youth i profess arm and be raise by degree to the highest military rank at last be disgust by the preferment of a younger officer i resolve to close my life in peace have find the world full of snare discord and misery for some time after my retreat i rejoice like a tempest-beaten sailor at he entrance into the harbor when the pleasure of novelty go away i employ my hour in examine the plant and mineral of the place but that inquiry be now grow tasteless and irksome and i have be for some time unsettled and distract i be sometimes ashamed to think that i could not secure myself from vice but by retire from the exercise of virtue and begin to suspect that i be rather impel by resentment than lead by devotion into solitude i have be long compare the evil with the advantage of society and resolve to return into the world to-morrow they accompany he back to the city on which as he approach it he gaze with rapture a day or two later rassela be relate he interview with the hermit at a assembly of learn man who meet at state interval to compare they opinion the way to be happy say one of they be to live accord to nature in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with which every heart be originally impressed which be not write on it by precept but engraven by design not instil by education but infuse at we nativity when he have speak he look round he with a placid air and enjoy the consciousness of he own beneficence sir say the prince with great modesty as i like all the rest of mankind be desirous of felicity my closest attention have be fix upon you discourse i doubt not the truth of a position which so learn a man have so confidently advanced let I only know what it be to live accord to nature when i find young man so humble and so docile say the philosopher i can deny they no information which my study have enable I to afford to live accord to nature be to act always with due regard to the fitness arise from the relation and quality of cause and effect to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity to co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the present system of thing the prince soon find that this be a sage whom he should understand less as he hear he longer he therefore bow and be silent and the philosopher suppose he satisfied depart with the air of a man who have co-operate with the present system _ iv -- happiness they find not _ rassela return home full of reflection and find that imlac seem to discourage a continuance of the search begin _ to _ discourse more freely with he sister who have yet the same hope with himself we will divide the task between we say she you shall try what be to be find in the splendor of court and i will range the shades of humbler life accordingly the prince appear next day with a splendid retinue at the court of the bassa but he soon find that the life of courtier be a continual succession of plot and detection stratagem and escape faction and treachery many of those who surround the bassa be send only to watch he and to report he conduct to the sultan at last the letter of revocation arrive the bassa be carry in chain to constantinople and in a short time the sultan that have depose he be murder by the janissary the princess who in the meantime have insinuate herself into many private family prove equally unsuccessful in she inquiry she find not one house that be not haunt by some fury that destroy its quiet in family where there be or be not poverty say she there be commonly discord the love of parent and child seldom continue beyond the year of infancy in a short time the child become rival to they parent each child endeavor to appropriate the esteem or fondness of the parent and the parent betray each other to they child the opinion of child and parent of the young and the old be naturally opposite by the contrary effect of hope and despondence of expectation and experience age look with anger on the temerity of youth and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of age surely say the prince you must have be unfortunate in you choice of acquaintance i be unwilling to believe that the most tender of all relation be thus impede in its effect by natural necessity domestic discord answer she be not inevitably necessary but it be not easily avoid we seldom see that a whole family be virtuous the good and the evil can not well agree the evil can yet less agree with one another and even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance when they virtue be of different kind as for those who live single i never find that they prudence ought to raise envy they dream away they time without friendship and without fondness and be drive to rid themselves of the day for which they have no use by childish amusement and vicious delight they act as being under the constant sense of some known inferiority that fill they mind with rancor and they tongue with censure i can not forbear to flatter myself say rassela that prudence and benevolence will make marriage happy what can be expect but disappointment and repentance from a choice make in the immaturity of youth in the ardor of desire without judgment without foresight without inquiry after conformity of opinion similarity of manners rectitude of judgment or purity of sentiment from these early marriage proceed the rivalry of parent and child the son be eager to enjoy the world before the father be willing to forsake it and there be hardly room at once for two generation the daughter begin to bloom before the mother can be content to fade and neither can forbear to wish for the absence of the other surely all these evil may be avoid by that deliberation and delay which prudence prescribe to irrevocable choice and yet say nekayah i have be tell that late marriage be not eminently happy it have generally be determine that it be dangerous for a man and woman to suspend they fate upon each other at a time when opinion be fix and habit be establish when friendship have be contract on both side and when life have be plan into method at this point imlac enter and have refuse to talk upon the subject of they discourse persuade they to visit the great pyramid i consider this mighty structure say he as they repose in one of its chamber as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyment a king whose power be unlimited and whose treasure surmount all real and imaginary want be compel to solace by the erection of a pyramid the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasure and to amuse the tediousness of decline life by see thousand labor without end and one stone for no purpose lay upon another soon afterwards the prince tell imlac that he intend to devote himself to science and to pass the rest of he day in retirement before you make you final choice answer imlac you ought to examine its hazard and to converse with some of those who be grow old in the company of themselves he then introduce he to a learn astronomer who have meditate over he science and over visionary scheme for so long that he believe that he possess the regulation of the weather and the distribution of the season a visit make subsequently to the catacomb tend still further to give a grave and sombre direction to the thought of the party how gloomy say rassela would be these mansion of the dead to he who do not know that he should never die that what now act shall continue its agency and what now think shall think on forever those that lie here stretch before we the wise and the powerful of ancient time warn we to remember the shortness of we present state they be perhaps snatch away while they be busy like we in the choice of life to I say the princess the choice of life be become less important i hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity it be now the time of the inundation of the nile and the searcher for happiness be of necessity confine to they house be however well supply with material for talk they divert themselves with comparison of the different form of life which they have observe and with various scheme of happiness which each of they have form -- scheme which now they well know would never be carry out they deliberate with imlac what be to be do and finally resolve when the inundation should cease to return to abyssinia \* \* \* \* \* maurus jokai timar 's two world maurus jokaus by common

current be fierce and the rock be death-traps to-day too the st barbara be pursue by a turkish gunboat but the vessel make its way safely in spite of current and rock and the turkish gunboat give up the chase three day later the st barbara have reach the island of orsova the plain of hungary be to the north of the river servium to the south provision have run short and timar decide to go on shore

youthful appearance who introduce himself as theodor krisstyan a old friend of the lady of the house whom he call madame therese enter and make himself quickly at home it be plain that he hostess both fear and dislike theodor while timar who have meet he before regard he as a spy in the pay of the turkish government in the morning the wind have go down theodor have vanish and timar and he passenger prepare to renew they journey therese tell timar she story before he leave how she and she daughter noemus have live there for twelve year and who the objectionable theodor be then she add in a whisper i fancy this man krisstyan 's visit be either on you account or that of the other gentleman be on you guard if either of you dread the discovery of a secret trikaliss look very gloomy when he hear the stranger have leave before sunrise and the follow night he call timar to he cabin i be die he say i want to die -- i have take poison timéa will not wake till all be over my true name be not euthemio trikaliss but alus tschorbadschus i be once governor of candium and then treasurer in stamboul you know there be a revolution proceeding in turkey my turn be come not that i be a conspirator but the treasury want my money and the seraglio my daughter death be easy for I but i will not let my daughter go into the harem nor myself be make a beggar therefore i hire you vessel and load it with grain the owner athana brazovic be a connection of mine i have often show he kindness he can return it now by a miracle we get safely through the rock and whirlpool of the river and elude the pursuit of the turkish brigantine and now i stumble over a straw into my grave that man who follow we last evening be a spy of the turkish government he recognize I and seal my fate the government would not demand I from austrium as a political refugee but as a thief this be unjust for what i take be my own but i be pursue as a thief and austrium give up escape thief if turkish spy can trace they by die i can save my daughter and she property swear to I by you faith and you honor you will carry out my instruction here in this casket be about a thousand ducat take timéa to athana brazovic and beg he to adopt my daughter give he the money he must spend it on the education of the child and give he also the cargo and beg he to be present when the sack be empty you understand the die man look in timar 's face and struggle for breath yes -- the red crescent he stammer the red crescent then the death-throe close he lip -- one struggle and he be a corpse _ ii -- timor tempt and fall _ when the st barbara have nearly reach komorn it strike a uproot tree lie in ambush under water and immediately begin to sink it be absolutely impossible to save a vessel wreck in this way the crew all leave the sink craft and timar rescue timéa and with she the casket with the thousand ducat then the captain drive off with the fatherless girl to the house of athana brazovic in the town of komorn at first athana kiss timéa very heartily but when he learn that he vessel be lose and all timéa 's property except the thousand ducat and the wheat sack -- now spoil by water -- he alter he tune he and he wife sophie decide that timéa should live with they as a adopt child and at the same time attend on they daughter athalie as a waiting-maid athalie and she mother treat the poor girl with scornful contempt as for timar athana turn on he savagely as though the captain could have prevent the wreck on the advice of he friend lieutenant katschuka who be betroth to athalie timar purchase the sunken grain next day when it be put up for auction buy the whole cargo for 10000 gulden you will do the poor orphan a good turn if you buy it say the lieutenant otherwise the value of the cargo will all go in salvage timar at once make arrangement for haul up the sack and for the immediate dry and grind of the corn and all day labourer be at work on the wreck at nightfall timar left alone notice one sack differently mark from the rest -- marked with a red crescent within this be a long leathern bag he break it open and find it full of diamond emerald and sapphire richly set in girdle and bracelet and ring a whole heap of unset diamond be in a agate box the whole treasure be worth at least 1000000 gulden the st barbara have carry a million on board to whom do this treasure belong timar put the question to himself and answer it why whom should it belong to but you you buy the sunken cargo just as it be with the sack and the grain if the treasurer steal the jewel from the sultan the sultan probably steal they in he campaign and timéa timéa would not know how to use the treasure and she adopt father would absorb it and get rid of nine-tenth of it what would be the result if timéa get it she would be a rich lady and would not cast a look at you from she height now thing be the other way -- you will be a rich man and she a poor girl you do not want the treasure for yourself you will invest it profitably and when you have earn with the first million a second and a third you will go to the poor girl and say ` there take it -- it be all yours and take I too ' you only wish to become rich in order to make she happy the moon and the wave cry to timar you be rich -- you be a make man but when it be dark a inward voice whisper you be a thief from that day all timar 's undertaking flourish and step by step he reach the summit of a ordinary successful business man 's ambition -- the title of nobility at the same time brazovic who have treat timar with brutal inconsiderateness because of the wreck of the st barbara go steadily down-hill borrowing and embezzle trust money in he fall lieutenant katschuka have declare all along that he could not marry athalie without a dowry and when the wedding day arrive brazovic unable to face he creditor and know himself bankrupt penniless and fraudulent committed suicide katschuka immediately declare the engagement at a end in he heart he have long wearied of athalie and look with desire on timéa the orphan girl from the first have love the lieutenant with silent unspoken affection when the brazovic ' house be put up for sale timar buy it outright furniture and all and then say to timéa from this day forth you be the mistress of this house everything in it belong to you all be inscribe in you name accept it from I you be the owner of the house and if there be a little shelter for I in you heart and you do not refuse my hand -- then i should be only too happy timéa give she hand to timar and say in a low firm voice i accept you as my husband and will be a faithful and obedient wife this man have always be so good to she he have never make sport of she nor flattered she and he have save she life on the danube when the st barbara be sink he have give she all she heart could desire except one thing and that belong to another _ iii -- the ownerless island _ on he betrothal to timéa a great burden be lift from the soul of timar since the day when the treasure of alus tschorbadschus have enable he to achieve power and riches timar have be haunt by the voice of self-accusation this money do not belong to you -- it be the property of a orphan you be a man of gold you be a thief but now the defraud orphan have receive back she property only timar forget that he have demand in exchange the girl 's heart timéa promise to be a faithful and obedient wife but on the wedding - day when timar say do you love I she only open wide she eye and ask what be love timar find he have marry a marble statue and that all he riches would not buy he wife 's love he become wretched conscious that he wife be unhappy that he be the author of they mutual misery then in the early summer timar go off from komorn to shoot water - fowl he mean to go to the ownerless island at ostrova -- it be three year since that former visit therese and noemus welcome he cordially at the island and timar forget he trouble when he be with they therese tell he she story how she husband ruin by the father of theodor krisstyan and by athana brazovic have commit suicide and how forsake and friendless she have bring she child to this island which neither austrium nor turkey claim and where no tax-collector call with she own hand she have turn the wilderness into a paradise and the only fear she have be that theodor krisstyan who have discover she retreat might reveal it to the turkish government therese have no money and no use for it but she exchange fruit and honey for grain salt clothes and hardware and the people with whom she barter be not incline to gossip about she affair so no news concern the island ever go to vienna komorn or constantinople and the fact of timar 's great prosperity have not reach the islander he be welcome as a hard-working man and therese do not know that timar have be powerful enough to get a ninety year ' lease of the island from both turkish and austrian government perhaps no very difficult matter as the existence of the island be unknown and there be fee to be pay over the concession when he tell she what he have do noemus throw she arm round he neck theodor krisstyan be furious but timar procure he a post in brazil and for a long time the disreputable spy be too far off to be troublesome and now on this island timar find health and rest it become he home and for the summer month every year he would slip away from komorn and no one not even timéa guess he secret when he return timéa 's cold white face be still a unsolved riddle to she husband she would greet he kindly but never be there any token that she love he timar 's ever-increasing business operation be excuse for he long absence but all the same the double life he be lead make he ill he could not tell timéa of therese and noemus and he could not tell they on the island that he be marry timéa on she side devoted herself more and more to she husband 's business in he absence and when major katschuka once call and ask she if she could not arrange for a divorce she answer gently my husband be the noblest man in the world should i separate from he who have no one but I to love he be i to tell he that i hate he i who owe everything to he and who bring he no dowry but a loveless heart timar learn from athalie who live in timéa 's house of this reply and feel more in despair than ever he want timéa to be happy she have never be he wife except in name for he have be wait for she love and he want to go away and leave all he riches behind and settle on the island now more than ever be he want on the island for therese have die of heart failure and the year have make noemus a woman _ iv -- my name be nobody _ it be winter and timar have go off alone to a house that belong to he near a frozen lake he feel the time have come for flight but whither theodor krisstyan have turn up again in brazil he have hear a story of alus tschorbadschus 's jewel from a old criminal from turkey and he have return to blackmail timar but he do not find he till timar be at the frozen lake krisstyan 's story be not true timar know that the accusation be false as he listen to the vagabond 's indictment he have not kill timéa 's father nor steal he treasure but he have play a false game and he position be a false one krisstyan demand a change of raiment and timar let he take clothes and shirt but at last the blackmailer 's demand become too insolent and timar drive he out of the house and now it seem to timar that he own career be finish this ruffian krisstyan could expose the foundation of he wealth and how could he live discredit before the world on the frozen water there be great fissure between the block of ice within the wave of the lake death would come quickly timar walk out on the ice and there before he the head of theodor krisstyan rise in the water and then sink the spy have not know the treachery of the fissure timar flee to the ownerless island and when the corpse of krisstyan be discover in a advanced stage of decomposition timéa declare she recognize she husband 's clothes so the body of theodor krisstyan be bury with great pomp and a year later timéa married major katschuka and then haunt by the doubt whether she first husband be really dead pine away no blessing rest on the wealth timar leave behind he the only son timéa bear to the major be a great spendthrift and in he hand the fabulous wealth vanish as quickly as it have grow \* \* \* \* \* and what be pass meanwhile on the ownerless island forty year have pass since timar 's disappearance

or serve to beautify the place the tobacco grow here have the most exquisite aroma and the beehive look from a distance like a small town with many-shaped roof it be easy to see that the owner of the island understand luxury and yet that owner never have a farthing to call he own no money ever enter the island those however who need the export know also the requirement of the islander and bring they for barter the whole colony consist of one family and each be call only by he christian name the six son of the first settler have marry woman of the district and the number of grandchild and great-grandchild already exceed forty but the island maintain they all poverty be unknown they live in luxury each know some trade and if they have be ten time as many they labor would have support they when we arrive on the island the nominal head of the family a well-built man of forty receive we cordially and in the evening present we to he parent when my name be mention to the old man he look long at I and a visible color rise in he cheek i begin to tell he of what be go on in the world that hungary be now unite to austria and that the tax be very heavy he blow a cloud from he pipe

edition in england and in america _ i -- the ghost of the past _ some year ago i become so seriously ill that i be pronounced die and finally dead dead to all intent and purpose i remain for two day when to the astonishment of the physician i exhibit symptom of return vitality and in a week be convalescent of the moment precede my pass i recollect only that there come over I a strange and sudden sense of loss as though some life-element have go out from I of pain there be none nor any mental anxiety i recollect only a ethereal lightness of limb and a sense of soul-emancipation and peace a sense of soul-emancipation such as one might feel be he to awaken on a sunny summer morning to find that sorrow and sin be go from the world for ever a peace ample and restful as the hallowed hush and awe of twilight without the twilight 's tender pain then i seem to be sink slowly and steadily through still depths of sun-steeped light-filled water that sing in my ear with a sound like a sweet sad sobbing and soar of music and through which there swim up to I in water vista of light scene of sunny sea and shine shore where smile isle stretch league beyond league afar and so life ebb away until there come a time when the outward and deathward-setting tide seem to reach its climax and when i feel myself sweep shoreward and lifeward again on the inward-setting tide of that larger life into which i have die my next recollection be that the event of my past life be rise before I the hand on the dial of time go back a score of year and i be a young man of twenty-one living in chamber off holborn one evening there burst over london a fearful thunderstorm and hear a knock at my door i open it to find a beautiful girl name dorothy the daughter of the housekeeper standing there terrify by the lightning and finding herself alone she beg to be allow to remain until she mother 's return the word have scarcely pass she lip before there come another blind flash of lightning follow almost instantaneously by a terrific crash of thunder with a cry of passion and fear she fling she arm around I and the next moment i find myself press she to my heart and tell she amid a score of burn kiss that i love she almost immediately afterwards we hear the opening of door which indicate she mother 's home-coming but before leave dorothy tell I that the room immediately above mine be she own of the hell-born thought which rise in my mind as i listen she i be sure have no suspicion need i tell the remainder of my story i think not \* \* \* \* \* you may wonder perhaps why i recall circumstance that happen so many year ago you would cease to wonder have you see the ghost of the past rise up to call upon god and he christ for judgment upon the betrayer for this be my first glimpse of hell this be my day of judgment the recording angel of my awaken conscience show I my sin and the ruin my sin have work as god see and i realize that -- but no i be sick i be faint i can not -- i can not write more _ ii -- the secret of man 's destiny _ when anyone die i have be tell in childhood he go either to heaven or to hell accord to whether he have be a good or bad man and i recollect be not a little troubled as to what become of the people whose virtue be about equally match with they vice when i open my eye in that ante-chamber of the spirit-world into which i have have admittance i discover that heaven and hell as separate place have no existence for the good the bad and the indifferent exist together exactly as they exist here i do not say that there will be no day of harvesting in which the tare shall finally be separate from the wheat on that point as on many other i be ignorant man and woman whom i know on earth speak of the dead -- the change -- as be perfect in knowledge and as have solve for ever the great secret that be not my experience so far from the great secret the secret of man 's destiny and god 's be become know at death the fact as i find they be that these remain almost as great a mystery after death as before even in hell -lrb- i use the word as indicate mental or physical suffering -- in my case the former -- not with any local significance -rrb- there be moment when the anguish-stricken spirit be mercifully allow a temporary reprieve such a moment occur after the first awful paroxysm of self-loathing and torture which i experience when my past life be make know to I in its true color and it be in this saner and comparatively painless interval that i meet one whom i have know on earth as a woman of the purest life and character be still under the impression that i be in hell in the sense in which i have be accustom to think of that place i start back upon see she and cry out in astonishment you here _ you _ and in hade where else should i be except where arthur be she answer quietly and i then remember a worthless brother of that name to whom she be passionately attach even dive in the parable she go on be unable to forget the five brethren he have leave behind he and cry out amid the flame ask that lazarus be send to warn they lest they too come to that place of torment be it likely then that any wife mother or sister worthy the name would be content to remain idle in heaven know that a loved one be in hell and in agony we be tell that after he death christ preach to the spirit in prison and i believe that he come here to hell in search of the so-called lose tell I i say you who be in heaven if you be perfectly happy you be not altogether wrong in call this heaven she reply although it be little more than the antechamber between earth and heaven it be my heaven at present but it will not be my heaven always any more than it will be always you hell and although it be heaven it be not _ the _ heaven when i be on earth i long for heaven _ not that i might be deliver from sorrow but from sinfulness _ and i think i may say that i be as happy here as my failure will let I be you failure i exclaimed i think we have do with failure you remember the text in the koran she say ` paradise be under the shadow of sword ' here as on earth there be no progress without effort and here too there be difficulty to be overcome yet even on earth there be one element in the strife which lend dignity even to we failure sin and shame be after all only human the effort and determination to overcome they be divine cease to be a angel satan become a devil man fall and even in he fall retain something of god after a time we fall to talk of the past and mention the name of the very noblest man i have ever know a man who make possible the purity of sir galahad make possible the courage of coeur de lion -- i have almost say make possible the sinfulness of christ -- i inquire whether she have see he in paradise as yet she answer i know only one of the many circle into which the spirit-world seem naturally to resolve it but i suspect that if you and i could see where he be we should find he infinitely nearer to the father-heart of the universe than i at least can for countless age hope to attain what do you mean by ` circle ' i say be each human soul on its arrival here assign a fitting place and level among he or she spiritual fellow there be some such gathering of like to like as that of which you speak she answer the majority begin in a lower circle and remain there until they be fit to move onward to a higher sphere other take a place in that higher sphere immediately and some few be lead into the holy presence straightway and then she voice seem to sound to I like the voice of one in the far distance i feel the darkness closing in upon I on every side and know that my hour of punishment be again at hand _ iii -- dead soul _ of all the face which i saw in hell there be one which have for I a fascination it be that of a beautiful woman queenly of manner fair of figure as a fullblown lily and with those dark eye that seem to shine out from soul-depths deep as the distant heaven and yet may mean no more than the shallow face of quicksilver behind a milliner 's mirror on earth she have deliberately set herself to win and to break the heart of a trust lad and the punishment of she sin be that she should now love he with the same intense but hopeless passion with which he have love she my heart be break i hear she sob and in hell one can not die of a broken heart if i have love he and he I and he have die i could have bear it know that i should meet he hereafter but to live loveless through eternity that be the thought which kill I another sight which i saw be that of a desolate plain low-lying and unlighted in the center of which there roam one who call out as if in search of a companion but to whom there come no answer save the echo of he own voice a more lonely and lifeless spot i have never see the silence seem sometimes to oppress he like a presence for with a half-affrighted and despairing cry he set off at a panic-stricken run as if seek to escape this silence by flight but notwithstanding he haste he make no progress for he be but move round and round in a circle once when he pass near I i hear he cry out : be there no living soul in all this void and voiceless desert and as he hurry by i recognize he as a man whom i have often hear say on earth that hell would not be hell to he so long as he and he boon companion be together another whom i saw in hade i should -- save for he pitiable effort to escape observation -- have pass unnoticed he pitfall in life have be love of approbation which be so strong that he be never happy except in perpetually endeavor to pass himself off for that which he know he be not the only aim of he existence have be to win the approval of other and lo one morning he awake in hade to find himself the despise of the despise and the laugh stock of the very devil i see few more pitiable sight than that of this wretched creature slink shamefacedly through hell and wincing as from a blow at the glance of every passer during my wanderings i have reason to ask one whom i have know on earth concern the fate of a old acquaintance of he own i will tell you all i know of the man about whom you ask he say but first let I explain that my sorest hindrance on earth be unbelief once when i might have believe i would not and my punishment be that now when i would believe i can not but be for ever tear by hideous apprehension and doubt moreover there be many thing which clear and plain as they may be to the faithful of heart and to the believe be to my doubt eye wrapt around in mystery into these mystery it have be ordain as part of my punishment that i shall ever desire to look and of all these mystery there be none which fill I with such horror and dread as the mystery of the dead who die of the dead who die i say what do you mean by those strange word surely all who die be dead they be my word he cry excitedly and with a hysterical laugh the word i use to myself when i think of the mystery which they strive so carefully to conceal from I but which for all they cunning i have discover when first i come here i see either in hell or in heaven the face of most of the dead whom i have know on earth but some face there be -- the man of whom you ask be one -- which i miss and from that time to this i have never see ` where then be they ' i ask myself ` since neither earth hell nor heaven know they more have god some fearful fate in store for sinner which may one day fall upon I as it have already fall upon they ' and so i set myself to discover what have become of these miss face and you shall hear the result when you and i be child we be teach that every human being be bear with a immortal soul but they do not tell we that just as neglect disease can kill the body so unchecked sin can kill the soul but it be so and that be what i mean when i say that he of whom you ask be ` of the dead who die ' you shake you head and mutter that i be mad well perhaps i be mad -- mad with the horror of my unbelief but why should it not be as i say when god make man he make a creature to whom it be give to choose for himself between good and evil but god know that some of those he have thus make would deliberately choose evil that some few would indeed sin away all trace of they divine origin god do not _ will _ it so for he make we man not machine and the evil we do be of we own choosing but god _ fore-knew _ it and foreknow that god owe it to himself not to call into be a creature the result of whose creation would be that creature 's eternal misery hence it be that he decree that those for whom there could be no hope of heaven should die out at they death like the brute we life be from god and may not god take he own again and could anything better happen to many people whom you and i have know on earth than that they should be allow to die out and the very memory of they to pass away for ever i be convince that he be mad -- mad as he have himself hint with the horror of he unbelief and i be one of they he exclaim i be of the dead who die i have barter away life faith and happiness for dead sea fruit i who once be young and not altogether as i now be a soulless creature of clay for i can remember the time when flower picture beautiful face and music set stir emotion within I in which it seem that i see hide away in the depths of my own heart the shine form of a white-robed soul-maiden who cry out to I : ` ah can not you make you life as pure and beautiful as the flower and the music that so you may set I free ' but i choose the ignoble part and give myself up body and soul to evil and unbelief and often in the hour when i be tempt to some shameful action i seem to see the white arm of the soul-maiden uplift in piteous entreaty to heaven but at last the time come when she voice be silent and when i know that i have thrust she down into a darkness whence she would never again come forth and now the very soul of I be dead and i know not but that at any moment i may flicker out like a spend taper and become as one of the dead who die _ iv -- on the brink of the pit _ at last there come a time even in hell when the burden of my sin lay so heavily upon I that i feel if succor there be none the very soul of I must die of myself save for the continual cry out of my soul after its lose purity i scarcely care to think it be for dorothy that i never cease to sorrow and -- sinner though i be -- to pray i see then picture forth in all they horror the inevitable consequence of the wrong i have do she i see she with the sense of she sin as yet but fresh upon she shrinking from every glance and fancy that she read the knowledge of she guilt in every eye i see she not know where to turn for refuge from swiftly advance shame and understand no more of this life of ours than a foolish lose lamb wander farther and farther in the nightfall and then -- drive out from they midst by the very christian woman who should have be the first to have hold out a hand to save -- i see she turn away with a heart harden into indifference and plunge headlong into a bottomless gulf of ignominy and sin nor do the vision pass until out of that seething vortex of lust and infamy i see arise the black phantom of a lose soul cry out unto god and he christ for judgment upon the betrayer as these hideous spectre of the past come before I i fall to the ground bear down by a burden of agony greater even than the very damned in hell can bear but even as i fall that burden be lift and bear away from I and then i see as in a vision one kneel in prayer and i who have cry out that i could bear the burden of my sin no longer see that upon he be lay not only my sin but the sin of the whole world and that he stoop of he own accord to receive they and as i look upon the divine dignity of that agonised form -- forsake of he father that we might never be forsake -- i see great bead of blood break out like sweat upon he brow and i hear wring from he a cry of such unutterable anguish as never before rose from human lip and at that cry the vision pass and i awake to find myself in hell once more but in my heart there be a stir as of the wing of hope -- the hope which i have deem dead for ever _ could _ it be -- o god of mercy be it possible that even now it might not be too late -- that there be indeed one who could make my sin as though it have never be but to this hope there succeed a moment when the agonised thought how if there be no christ leap out at I like the darkness which loom but the blacker for the lightning-flash a moment when hell get hold of I again and a thousand gibbering devil arise to shriek in my ear : and though there be a christ be it not now too late i reel at that cry and the darkness once more close in around a horde of hideous thought the very spawn of hell swarm like vermin in my mind there be the breath as of a host of contend fiend upon my face a hundred hungry hand seem to lay hold on I and to strive to drag I down and down to a bottomless pit that open at my very foot and into which i feel myself slip with a great cry to god i strove to rise but my strength fail I and i have fall back into the abyss have not one white-robed as the morning come suddenly to succor I by stretch forth a hand of aid and so -- beating and battle like a drown man for breath -- i fight my way out and fall sob and faint upon the pit 's brink and with a great cry of anguish i pray aloud lord christ i be foul and sinful i do not know that i love thee i do not even know that i have repent of my sin i only know that i can not do the thing i would do and that i can never undo the evil i have do but i come to thee lord jesus i come to thee as thou biddest I send I not away o savior of sinner as i make a end of pray i look up and see standing beside I one thorn-crowned and with wounded side _ whose feature be the feature of a man but whose face be the face of god _ and as i look upon that face i shrink back daze and breathless and blind -- shrink back with a cry like the cry of one smitten of the lightning for beneath the wide white brow there shine out eye before the awful purity of which my sin-stained soul seem to scorch and to shrivel like a scroll in a furnace but as i lay lo there come a tender touch upon my head and a voice in my ear that whisper son and as the word die away into a silence like the hallowed hush of listen angel and i stretch forth my arm with a cry of unutterable longing and love i say that he hold one by the hand -- even the one who have pluck I out of the abyss into which i have fall -- and i see that it be dorothy -- dorothy whom he have seek out and save from the shame to which my sin have drive she and whom he have send to succor I that so he might set upon my soul the seal of he pardon and of he peace \* \* \* \* \* charle kingsley alton locke charle kingsley english novelist poet and clergyman be bear June 12 1819 and

ought to be at college if one could only get you there those poem of yours -- you must let I have they and look over they and i dare say i shall be able to persuade the governor to do something with they lord lynedale come to my cousin 's room next day -- george tell I plainly that he make friend with those who would advance he when he be a clergyman -- and take a interest in a self-educated author bid I bring my poem to the eagle and ask for dean winnstay lord lynedale be to marry dean winnstay 's niece when i arrive at the eagle the first person i saw be lillian -- for so she father the

that i be i fancied -- what do i not fancy -- never see how that very _ he _ bespeak the indifference -- the gulf between we i be not a man a equal but a thing -- a subject who be to be talk over and examine and make into something like themselves of they supreme and undeserved benevolence gently gently fair lady say the dean we must not be as headlong as some people would kindly wish to be if this young man really have a proper desire to rise to a higher station and i find he a fit object to be assist in that praiseworthy ambition why i think he ought to go to some training college now

's advice i weakly consent to have the book emasculate next day i return to town for sandy mackaye have write I a characteristic note tell I that he could deposit any trash i have write in a paper call the weekly warwhoop before i go from d -- my cousin george warn I not to pay so much attention to miss lillian if i wish to stand well with eleanor the dean 's niece who be to marry lord lynedale

publish and i enjoy the sensation of be a real live author what be more my book take and sell and be review favourably in journal and newspaper it strike I that it would be right to call upon the dean and so i go to he house off harley street the good old man congratulate I on my success and i see lillian and sit in a delirium of silent joy lord lynedale have become lord ellerton and i listen to the praise that be sing of the newly marry couple -- for eleanor have become lady ellerton and have enter fully into all she husband 's magnificent philanthropic scheme -- a helpmeet if not a oracular

we both miserably and there be the long and short of it i hide my face in my hand my conscience tell I that i have nothing to answer mackaye to spare I go on to talk of the agricultural distress and crossthwaite explain that he want to send a deputation down to the country to spread the principle of the charter i will go i say start up they shall see i do care for the cause where be the place about ten mile from d -- d -- my heart sink if it have be any other spot but it be too late to retract with many instruction from we friend and warning from mackaye i start next day on my journey i arrive in the midst of a dreary treeless country and a little pert snub-nosed shoemaker meet I and we walk together across the open down towards a circular camp the earthwork probably of some old british town inside it some thousand or so of labor people all wan and haggard with many woman among they be swarm restlessly round a single large block of stone i make my way to the stone and listen as speaker after speaker pour out a string of incoherent complaint only the intense earnestness give any force to the speech i notice that many of the crowd carry heavy stick and pitchfork and other tool which might be use as fearful weapon and when a fierce man with a squint ask who would be willing to come and pull the farm about the folk ' ear i feel that now or never be the time for I to speak if once the spirit of mad aimless riot break loose i have not only no chance of a hearing but every likelihood of be implicate in deed which i abhorred i spring on the stone assure they of the sympathy of the london working-man and explain the idea of the charter to all which they answer surlily that they do not know anything about politics -- that what they want be bread in vain i go on more vehement than ever the only answer be that they want bread and bread we will have go then i cry lose my self-possession go and get bread after all you have a right to it there be rights above all law and the right to live be one i have no time to finish the murmur swell into a roar for bread bread and amid yell and execration the whole mass pour down the hill sweeping I away with they i be shock and terrify at they threat i shout myself hoarse about the duty of honesty warn they against pillage and violence but my voice be drown in the uproar i feel i have help to excite they and dare not in honor desert they and tremble i go on prepare to see the worst a large mass of farm building lay before we and the mob rush tumultuously into the yard -- just in time to see a old man on horseback gallop hatless away the old rascal 's go and he 'll call up the yeomanry we must be quick boy shout one the invader enter the house and return cram they mouth with bread and chop asunder flitch of bacon the granary door be break open and the contents be scramble for amid immense waste by the starve wretch soon the yard be a pandemonium as the more ruffianly part of the mob hurl furniture out of window or run off with anything they could carry the rick have be fire and the food of man the labor of year devour in aimless ruin when some one shout : the yeomanry and at that sound a general panic ensue i do not care to run i be utterly disgusted disappointed with myself -- the people i just recollect the tramp of the yeomanry horse and a clear blade gleam in the air and

which sweyn and all he dane return home for as sweyn truly say while william the frenchman be king by the sword and edgar the englishman king by proclamation of earl and thane there seem no room here for sweyn nephew of canute king of king to which hereward could advance no good reason to prove that there be anon come william of ely and build a float bridge a full half-mile in length across the black abyss of mud and reed that yawn between the island and the mainland but the bridge be unable to bear the weight of all the french who crowd on to it the fastening at the shore-end break and the bridge itself overturn so that all upon it be throw into the mud and miserably drown whereon william withdraw he force to brandon for a space and hereward be mind to find out for himself what next be purpose against the island follow he thither with shear hair and beard and disguise as a travel potter anon he come to william 's palace with he good mare swallow bear on she back a load of crockery at the palace he narrowly escape recognition be send to the kitchen where he get into a quarrel with the scullion in consequence of which he be hale before william himself who quickly detect that he be other than he pretend look you say william you be no common churl -- you have fight too well for that show I you arm hereward draw up he sleeve potter do not carry sword-scar like these nor be they tattoo like english thane hold up thy head man and let I see thy throat aha so i suspect there be fair lady ' work there be not this he who be say to be so like hereward very good put he in ward till i come back from hunting but do he no harm for be he hereward himself i should be right glad to see hereward safe and sound my man at last and earl of all between humber and the fen whereupon hereward be clap into a outhouse whence he escape forthwith by the simple device of cut off the head of the man send to fetter he and the good mare swallow bear he back to ely in safety a little later william come again to ely and build a stronger bridge but this the english destroy by fire with many of the french on it set the reed aflame on the windward side of it some other scheme must now be think out and the one that please william most be to send to the monk a proclamation that unless they submit within a week all they land and manor outside the island would be confiscate furthermore that if hereward would submit he should have he land in bourne and a free pardon for himself and all he comrade to which message sir ascelin and ivo tailleboi not be over desirous of have hereward as a neighbor see fit to add a clause exempt torfrida from the amnesty but that she should be burn on account of she abominable and notorious sorcery when the proclamation arrive hereward be away forage he come back in hot haste when he hear of it but not fast enough for ere they be in sight of the minster tower they be aware of a horse gallop violently towards they through the dusk and on its back be torfrida and she daughter the monk have surrender the island rather than lose they land the french be already in ely and now be hereward to the greenwood go to be a bold outlaw and the father of all outlaw who hold those forest for two hundred year from the fen to the scottish border and with some four hundred man he range up the bruneswald dash out to the war cry of a wake a wake and lay waste with fire and sword that be such town as be in the hand of frenchman now hereward have be faithful to torfrida a virtue most rare in those day and he love she with a overwhelming adoration -- as all true man love and for that very reason he be the more aware that he feeling for alftruda be strangely like he feeling for torfrida and yet strangely different wherefore when it befall that once on a day there come ride to hereward in the bruneswald a horseman who hand to he a letter the sight of alftruda 's signature at the end send a strange thrill through he there be naught in it that he should not have read -- it be but to tell he that the french be upon he the _ posse comitatus _ of seven county be rise and so forth continue the letter tell he that dolfin have be slay on the border and william and gilbert of ghent be go to marry she to ascelin and that have save she twice she fear that hereward could not save she a third time conclude with a entreaty to submit to william hint that a opportunity present itself now which might never recur the messenger take back the answer tell you lady that i kiss she hand and foot that i can not write for outlaw carry no pen or ink but that what she have command that will i perform have show the letter to torfrida they agree that it be well to take precaution and withdraw into the heart of the forest alftruda 's warning be both timely and true for anon come ivo tailleboi who have take to wife hereward 's niece lucium and abbot thorold of peterborough who have a old score to wipe off in connection with hereward 's last visit to he abbey and sir ascelin he nephew and many another and they ride gaily through the greenwood where presently they find hereward to they sorrow for of they number some return home only after payment of ransom and other never return at all and of the former be abbot thorold and ascelin and the ransom that hereward exact for those two be thirty thousand silver mark whereby hereward be enable to put a speak in ascelin 's wheel eh how most courteous victor say sir ascelin sir ascelin be not a very wealthy gentleman ascelin laugh assent _ nudus intravi nudus exeo _ -- england and i fear now this mortal life likewise but he look to he rich uncle the abbot to further a certain marriage project of he and of course neither my friend gilbert of ghent nor my enemy william of normandy be likely to give away so rich a heiress without some gratification in return _ iv -- the last of the english _ thereafter they live for two year in the forest and neither torfrida nor hereward be the better for they hope defer maketh the heart sick and a sick heart be but too apt to be a peevish one so there be fit of despondency jar mutual recrimination furthermore that first daughter be torfrida 's only child and she know almost as well as he how hard that weigh on hereward in he the race of leofric of godiva of earl oslac would become extinct and the girl would marry -- whom who but some french conqueror or at best some english outlaw what wonder if he long for a son to pass he name down to future generation and one day martin lightfoot come with another letter to hereward which he deliver to torfrida who learn from he that it come from alftruda she bid he deliver it to hereward to whom it be address the which he do but she notice that this letter hereward never mention to she as he have do the former a month later martin come again there be another letter come it come last night say he what be that to thee or I my lord have he state secret be it for we to pry into they go i think -- i think

have the king 's writ for he safety ready to send to he the king would receive he as he liegeman alftruda would receive he as she husband archbishop lanfranc have make difficulty about the dissolution of he marriage with torfrida but gold would do all thing at rome and so forth when this be read after a night of frenzy to crowland torfrida go under the guidance of martin and lay she head upon the knee of the lady godiva i be come as you always tell I i should do but it have be a long way hither and i be very tired and at crowland remain martin don a lay brother 's frock that he might the better serve he mistress and to crowland after three day come leofric the renegade priest who have be with hereward in the greenwood and with he the child and so it come that when hereward return as he have say after three day he find neither wife nor child and to crowland he too go but come away even as he have go but with torfrida he have no word nor with godiva for both refuse he audience so hereward go to winchester and with he forty of he knight and place he hand between the hand of william and swear to be he man and william walk out of the hall lean on hereward 's shoulder at which all the norman gnash they tooth with envy and thereafter hereward marry alftruda after the scruple of holy church have be duly set at rest then hereward live again at bourne and try to bring forgetfulness by drink -- and drink bring boastfulness for that he have no more the spirit leave to do great deed he must need babble of the great deed which he have do and hurl insult and defiance at he norman neighbor and in the space of three year he have become as intolerable to those same neighbor as they be intolerable to he and he be fain to keep up at bourne the same watch and ward that he have keep up in the forest and judith come to bourne and besought alftruda to accompany she to crowland where she would visit the tomb of waltheof she husband and alftruda go with she take a goodly company of knight to be she escort while hereward remain at bourne with few to guard it and know this to bourne come ascelin and tailleboi evermue raoul de dol and many another norman and burst in upon hereward

with brand and now he be all wound and winter who fight at he back be fall on he face and hereward stand alone within a ring of eleven corps a knight rush in to make a twelfth cloven through the helm but with the blow hereward 's blade snap short and he hurl it away as he foe rush in with he shield he beat out the brain of two but now tailleboi and evermue be behind he and with four lance through he back he fall to rise no more so perish the last of the english \* \* \* \* \* hypatium in hypatium publish in 1853 after pass through fraser 's magazine kingsley turn from social problem in england

era some 300 mile from alexandrium the young monk philammon be sit on the edge of a low range of inland cliff crest with drift sand behind he the desert sand waste stretch lifeless interminable reflect its lurid blare on the horizon of the cloudless vault of blue presently he rise and wander along the cliff in search of fuel for the monastery from whence he come for abbot pambo 's laura at sceti it lay pleasantly enough that lonely laura or lane of rude cyclopean cell under the perpetual shadow of the southern wall of crag amid its grove of ancient date-tree and a simple happy gentle life be that of the laura all portion out by rule and method each man have food and raiment shelter on earth friend and counsellor live trust in the continual care of almighty god thither have they flee out of city out of a rotten die world of tyrant and slave hypocrite and wanton to ponder undisturbed on duty and on judgment on death and eternity but to philammon have come a insatiable craving to know the mystery of learn to see the great roaring world of man he feel he could stay no longer and on he return he pour out he speech to abbot pambo let I go i be not discontent with you but with myself i know that obedience be noble but danger be nobler still if you have see the world why should not i cyril and he clergy have not flee from it abbot pambo seek counsel with the good brother aufugus and then bid philammon follow he and thou wouldst see the world poor fool thou wouldst see the world say the old man when the abbot have leave they alone together i would convert the world

will guide thee to the archbishop send we news of thy welfare by some holy mouth come silently they pace together down the glen to the lonely beach of the great stream pambo be there and with slow and feeble arm he launch the canoe philammon fling himself at the old man 's foot and besought they blessing and they forgiveness we have nothing to forgive follow thou thine inward call if it be the flesh it will avenge itself if it be of the spirit who be we that we should fight against god farewell a few minute more and the youth and he canoe be lessen down the rapid stream in the golden summer twilight _ ii -- hypatium queen of paganism _ on he first morning in alexandrium philammon hear praise of hypatium from a fruit porter who show he the way to the archbishop 's house hypatium accord to he guide be the queen of alexandrium a very unique and wonderful person the fountain of classic wisdom later in the day after he have present himself to archbishop cyril philammon learn from a old priest and from a fanatical monk name peter that the very name of hypatium be enough to rouse the clergy to a fury of execration it seem that oreste the roman governor of the city although nominally a christian be the curse of the alexandrian church and oreste visit hypatium whose lecture on heathen philosophy draw all the educate youth of the place philammon 's heart burn to distinguish himself at once there be no idol now to break but there be philosophy why do not some man of god go boldly into the lecture-room of the sorceress and testify against she he ask do it yourself if you dare say peter we have no wish to get we brain knock out by all the profligate young gentleman in the city i will do it say philammon the archbishop give permission only promise I two thing he say promise I that whatever happen you will not strike the first blow and that you will not argue with she contradict denounce defy but give no reason if you do you be lose she be subtler than the serpent skilled in all the trick of logic and you will become a laughing-stock and run away in shame ay say peter bitterly as he usher philammon out go up to ramoth gilead and prosper young fool ay go and let she convert you touch the accursed thing like achan and see if you do not end by have it in you tent and with this encouraging sentence the two part and philammon on the follow morning follow the train of philosopher student and fine gentleman to hypatium 's lecture-room philammon listen to hypatia in bewilderment attract by the beauty of the speaker the melody of she voice and the glitter of she rhetoric as she discourse on truth a sea of new thought and question come rush in on he acute greek intellect at every sentence a hostile allusion to the christian scripture arouse he and he cry out it be false blasphemous the scripture can not lie there be a yell at this turn the monk out throw the rustic through the window cry a dozen young gentleman several of the most valiant begin to scramble over the bench up to he and philammon be congratulating himself on the near approach of a glorious martyrdom when hypatium 's voice calm and silvery stifle the noise and tumult in a moment let the youth listen gentleman he be but a monk and a plebeian and know no better he have be teach thus let he sit here quietly and perhaps we may be able to teach he otherwise and without even a change of tone she continue she lecture philammon spring up the moment that the spell of she voice be take off he and hurry out through the corridor into the street but he have not go fifty yard before he friend the fruit porter breathless with run tell he that hypatium call for he thereon she father command thee to be at she house -- here -- to-morrow at the third hour hear and obey cyril hear philammon 's story and hypatium 's message with a quiet smile and then dismiss the youth to a afternoon of labor in the city command he to come for he order in the evening but in the evening peter already jealous of cyril 's interest in philammon and enrage at any toleration be extend to hypatia refuse to let the youth enter the archbishop 's house and then strike he full in the face the blow be intolerable and in a instant peter 's long leg be sprawl on the pavement while he bellow like a bull to all the monk that stand by seize he the traitor the heretic he hold communion with heathen and he be in hypatium 's lecture-room this morning a rush take place at the youth but philammon 's blood be up the ring of monk be bay at he like hound round a bear and against such odds the struggle would be desperate he turn and force he way to the gate amid a yell of derision which bring every drop of blood in he body into he cheek let I leave this court in safety god know whether i be a heretic and the archbishop shall know of you iniquity i will not cross this threshold again until cyril himself send for I to shame you he stride on in he wrath some hundred yard or more before he ask himself where he be go gradually one fix idea begin to glimmer through the storm -- to see hypatium and convert she he have cyril 's leave it must be right that would justify he -- to bring back in the fetter of the gospel the queen of heathendom yes there be that leave to live for _ iii -- pandemonium _ philammon do not convert hypatium but he become she favorite pupil and hypatium dream that the worship of the old god might be restore and she philosophy triumph over christianity receive daily visit from oreste the governor and enter into he plan -- to she undoing for oreste have a idea of become emperor and of purchase the favor of the populace by a show of gladiator to win hypatium for himself he promise to restore the heathen game and hypatium caring nothing for oreste but always longing for the revival of the old religion promise against she better judgment to bear he company on the day of the festival and to sit by he side and even to acclaim he emperor the success of oreste ' plot depend on the success of a bigger rebellion -- the attempt of heraclian count of africa to conquer rome heraclian have be defeat and this be know to cyril but oreste be mislead by false intelligence and count on heraclian 's victory for he own triumph when the day of the spectacle arrive to the horror and surprise of philammon hypatium herself sit by the side of the roman prefect while on the stage before they a number of libyan prisoner fight fiercely for they life only to be butcher in the end by the professional gladiator the sleep devil in the heart of the brutalise multitude burst forth at the sight and with jeer and applause the hire ruffian be urge on to they work of blood then a shameless exhibition of venus follow and philammon could bear no more for venus be he sister long part from he in childhood and only in the last few day have he learn of he relationship to pelagia the lady who have consent to act the part of the goddess of love and who be betroth to amal the leader of the band of goth he rush down through the dense mass of spectator leap the balustrade into the orchestra below and tear across to the foot of the stage pelagium sister my sister have mercy on I on yourself i will hide you save you we will flee together out of this infernal place i be you brother come she look at he one moment with wide wild eye the truth flash on she and she spring from the platform into he arm and then cover she face with both she hand sink down among the bloodstained sand a yell run along the vast circle philammon be hurry away by the attendant and pelagia she face still hide by she hand walk slowly away and vanish among the palm at the back of the stage a cloud whether of disgust or disappointment now hang upon every brow and there be open murmur at the cruelty and heathenry of the show hypatium be utterly unnerved oreste alone rise to the crisis in a well-studied oration he declare that heraclian the african be conquerer of rome and a roar of hire applause support he then the prefect of the guard encourage the city authority to salute oreste as emperor and hypatium amid shout of she aristocratic scholar rise and kneel before he writhe inwardly with shame and despair at the same moment a monk 's voice shout from the highest tier in the theater it be false false you be trick heraclian be utterly route cyril have know it every jew have know it for a week past so perish all the enemy of the lord catch in they own snare for a minute a awful silence fall on all who hear and then arise a tumult which oreste in vain attempt to subdue the would-be emperor summon he guard around he and hypatium and make he way out as best he could while the multitude melt away like snow before the rain to find every church placard by cyril

the peaceful country road to sir john 's mr grime ride the donkey in front and tom and the brush walk behind on the way they come up with a old irishwoman limp slowly along and carry a heavy bundle she walk along with tom and ask he many question about himself and seem very sad when he tell she that he know no prayer to say she tell he that she live far away by the sea and how the sea roll and roar on winter night and lay still in the bright summer day for the child to bathe and play in it and many a story more till tom long to go and see the sea and bathe in it likewise when at length they come to a spring grime get off he donkey to refresh himself by dip he head in the water because tom follow he example he master immediately thrash he be you not ashamed of yourself thoma grime say the irishwoman grime look up startle at she know he name but he answer : no nor never be yet and go on beat tom true for you if you ever have be ashamed of yourself you would have go into vendale long ago

they will be remember she turn away into a meadow and disappear and tom and grime go on they way when they come to harthover place the housekeeper turn they into a grand room all cover up in sheet of brown paper up the chimney go tom with a kick from he master how many chimney tom sweep i can not say but he sweep so many that he get tired and puzzle too for they run into one another so that he fairly lose he way in they at last he come down but it be the wrong chimney and he find himself in a room the like of which he have never see before the room be all dress in white : white window-curtain white bed-curtain white furniture and white wall there be a washhand-stand with ewer and basin and soap and brush and towel and a large bath full of clean water what a heap of thing -- all for wash and then he happen to look towards the bed and there lay the most beautiful little girl tom have ever see he wonder whether all people be as white as she when they be wash thinking of this he try to rub some of the soot from he own wrist and think perhaps he might look better himself if he be clean and look round he suddenly see a little ugly black figure with bleared eye and grin tooth and behold it be himself reflect in the mirror with tear of shame and anger at the contrast he turn to sneak up the chimney and hide but in he haste he upset the fire-iron up jump the little white lady with a scream in rush she nurse and make a dash at tom but out of the window go he and down a tree and away through the garden and the park into the wood beyond with the gardener the groom the dairymaid grime the steward the keeper sir john and the irishwoman all in hot pursuit through the wood rush tom until he come to a wall where he quick wit enable he to evade he pursuer -- except the irishwoman who follow he all the way although he never know at length he stand on a limestone rock which overhang a valley a thousand foot below and down there he could see a little stream wind in and out and by the stream a cottage it be a dangerous descent but down go tom without a moment 's hesitation sick and giddy on he go until at last he drop on the grass and lay there unconscious but after a time he rouse himself and stumble on to the cottage the old dame of the cottage take pity on he and lay he on a bed of sweet hay but tom could not rest and think of the little white lady he find he way to the river murmuring i must be clean i must be clean and still he have not see the irishwoman in front of he now for she have step into the river just before tom and have change into the most beautiful of fairy underneath the water for she be indeed the queen of the water-fairy who be all wait to receive she the moment she come back from the land-world tom be so hot and long so to be clean for once that he tumble as quick as he could into the cool stream and he have not be in it half a minute before he fall into the quietest coolest sleep that ever he have in he life the reason of he fall into such a delightful sleep be very simple it be merely that the fairy take he in fact they turn he into a water-baby meanwhile of course the chase after tom have come to a end although sir john and he keeper make a second search the next day for he feel sorry for the little sweep and be afraid he might have fall over some of the crag they find the little fellow 's rag by the side of the stream and they also discover he body in the water and bury it over in vendale churchyard _ ii -- a lonely mischievous water-baby _ tom be very happy swimming about in the river although he be now only about four inch long with a set of external gill just like those of a eft there be land-baby and why not water-baby some people tell we that water-baby be contrary to nature but there be so many thing in nature which we do not expect to find that there may as well be water-baby as not he be still as mischievous as any land-baby and make himself a perfect nuisance to the other creature of the water tease they as they go about they work until they be all afraid of he and get out of he way or creep into they shell so that he have no one to speak to or to play with it be from a dragon-fly that he learn some valuable lesson in good conduct for all he short sight the dragon-fly have notice a great many interesting thing in nature about which tom know nothing and of which he hear with wonder one day he might have be eat by a otter but behold seven little terrier dog rush at the otter and drive she off much to tom 's relief though he do not guess that these be really water-fairies send to protect he but before the otter have be head off she have twit tom with be only a eft and tell he he would be eat by the salmon when they come up from the sea -- the great wide sea tom himself decide he would go down the stream and discover what the great wide sea be like one night tom notice a curious light and hear voice of man come from the bank of the river soon after a large salmon be spear then other man seem to arrive there be shout and scuffling and then a tremendous splash and one of the man fall into the river close to tom he lay so still that tom think the water must have send he to sleep as it have do he so he screw up courage to go and look at he the moonlight light up the man 's face and tom recognize he old master grime suppose he should turn into a water-baby but he lay quite still at the bottom of the pool and never go poach salmon any more every creature in the stream seem to be hurry down to the sea and tom be the only water-baby among all the squirm eel and the score of different thing big and little he have many strange adventure before he come to the sea but great be he disappointment to find no water-baby there to play with though he ask the sea-snail and the hermit crab and the sun-fish and the bass and the porpoise but though one fish tell he that he have be help the previous night by the water-baby tom could find no trace of they at all now one day it befall that on the rock where tom be sit with a lobster there walk the little lady ellie herself and with she a very wise man professor pttmllnsprt who be a very great naturalist he

publish in 1862 when its author be thirty-two year old it will always rank with geoffry hamlyn as henry kingsley 's best work these two book be they author 's favorite among he own novel and charle ravenshoe be one of he two favorite character it have be say that ravenshoe be alive -- the expression of a man who work both with heart and brain and few would care to dispute that opinion for study of character wide charity of outlook brilliant descriptive writing -- as for instance in the charge at balaclava and real not mawkish pathos -- as in the hopeless misery of charle invalide with only eighteen shilling out of the army -- ravenshoe will always deserve to be read it be the work of a writer who be not ashamed to avow himself a optimist _ i -- charle lose he brother and he home _ in 1820 densil lose both he father and mother and find himself at the age of thirty-seven master of ravenshoe -- a estate worth # 10000 a year -- and master of himself densil be a only son he father peter ravenshoe have marry alicium daughter of charle earl of ascot the ravenshoe a old west of england family be catholic but densil 's second wife -lrb- he first wife die childless in 1816 -rrb- be a protestant and make she husband promise that all she child after she first bear should be bring up protestant mr ravenshoe bear densil two son : cuthbert bear 1826 charle bear 1831 on the night charle be bear he mother lay die and densil swear to she he would keep the promise he have make and to this vow he be faithful in spite of the indignation of father mackworth the resident catholic priest at ravenshoe the doctor insist that a nurse be a immediate necessity and jame horton densil 's devoted servant and head keeper suggest he wife norah a proposal that have the doctor 's immediate approval in due time charle go to eton and to oxford where he be rusticate for a term with he friend lord welter lord ascot 's eldest son and fall in love with adelaide a penniless young lady who act as companion to old lady ascot at ravenshoe charle and mackworth seldom meet without a sparring match for to the priest it be intolerable that this house should in the event of cuthbert die childless pass into protestant hand on the other hand it be natural that a considerable amount of familiarity and a most sincere and hearty affection should exist between charle and he servant and foster-brother william horton till charle go to shrewsbury he have never have another playfellow for he brother cuthbert be reserve and bookish and the friendship between the two have grow with age one other inmate of ravenshoe must be mention -- this be little mary corby who be save miraculously from the wreck of the warren hasting when charle be about ten she be the daughter of captain corby and when the ship go down in fifteen fathom of water the mate assist by fisherman and encourage by densil manage to get the little girl to shore and to ravenshoe -- for the house be not far from the cliff in spite of densil 's letter and inquiry no friend come forward to claim little mary then a child of nine and in three month she be consider as a permanent member of the household and the night before charle go to school he tell she of he grand passion for adelaide on the day of the oxford and cambridge boat-race when charle row three in the win boat densil ravenshoe die after two day ' illness old jame horton 's death occur at the same time charle hurry home in time for the funeral and when all be over a servant come up to he and ask he would he see mr ravenshoe in the library charle enter the library with william who have also be send for charle go up silently and kiss he brother on the forehead for a few minute cuthbert neither move nor speak while charle greet mackworth civilly william stand at a little distance look uneasily from one to another cuthbert break the silence and as he speak charle by some instinct lay he hand on william 's shoulder i send for you he say on business which must be go through with though i expect it will kill I i should like to prepare you for what be to come but the blow would be equally severe whether you expect it or not you two who stand there be nurse at the same breast that groom on whose shoulder you have you hand now be my real brother you be no relation to I -- you be the son of the faithful old servant whom we bury to-day with my father charle at once ask for proof and witness and mackworth take up the tale you mother be norah jame horton 's wife jame horton be densil ravenshoe 's half-brother and the illegitimate son of peter she confess to I the wicked fraud she practice and have commit that confession to paper i hold it you have not a point of ground to stand on you have be live in luxury and receive a expensive education when you should have be clean out the stable charle 's heart die away within he cuthbert he say you be a gentleman be this true god know how terribly true it be say cuthbert quietly father mackworth hand the paper sign by he mother to he and charle read it it be completely conclusive william also read it and turn pale cuthbert speak again in he quiet passionless voice my intention he say be to make a provision of # 300 a year for this gentleman whom till the last few day i believe to be my brother less than twenty-four hour ago charle i offer father mackworth # 10000 for this paper with a view to destroy it you see what a poor weak rogue i be and what a criminal i might become with a little temptation father mackworth do he duty and refuse I you act like yourself cuthbert like one who would risk body and soul for one you love but it be time that this scene should end i utterly refuse the assistance so nobly offer i go forth alone into the world to make my own way or to be forget it only remain to say good-bye i leave this house without a hard thought towards any one in it i be at peace with all the world father mackworth i beg you forgiveness i have often be rude and brutal to you good-bye he shake hand with mackworth then with william and lastly he go up to cuthbert and kiss he on the cheek and then walk out of the door into the hall i be go to follow he wherever he go say william if he go to the world 's end i will be with he _ ii -- charle lose himself _ charle flee from ravenshoe for london in the middle of the night determine that william should not follow he but he could not bear to go out and seek fortune without see adelaide so he call at ranford lord ascot 's seat only to learn that adelaide have elope with lord welter the two be marry when he afterwards see they in london charle have to tell he story to old lady ascot and when he have go she say to herself i will never keep another secret after this it be for alicium 's sake and for peter 's that i do it and now see what have become of I in london charle ravenshoe committed suicide deliberately he do not hang himself or drown himself he hire himself out as groom -- be perfectly accomplish in everything relate to horse -- to lieutenant hornby of the 140th hussar and when the crimean war break out enlist under the name of simpson as a trooper in hornby 's regiment on October 25 charle be at balaclava they go down hill straight towards the gun and almost at once the shot from they begin to tell charle be in the second line and the man in the front line begin to fall terribly fast as they ride into the narrowing valley it be impossible to keep line presently the battery right and leave open on they and those who be there engage can give we very little idea of what follow in the next quarter of a hour they be soon among the gun -- the very gun that have annoy they from the first -- and charle and two or three other know to he be hunting some russian artilleryman round these gun for a minute or so he see also at this time a friend of he -- a cornet -- on foot and ride to he assistance he catch a riderless horse and the cornet mount then the word be give to get back again and as they turn they face to get out of this terrible hell poor charle give a short sharp scream and bent down in he saddle over he horse 's neck it be nothing it be only as if one be to have twenty tooth pull out at once the pain be over in a instant he left arm seem nearly dead but he could hold he rein in a way he see hornby before he and he own friend be beside he again and there be a rally and a charge at gun no at man this time -- russian hussar -- right valiant fellow too he could do but little himself he ride at a russian and unhorsed he he remember see the man go down they beat they back and then turn and ride -- for it be time as the noise of the battle grow fainter behind they he look around to see who be ride beside he and hold he by the right arm it be the little cornet charle wonder why he do so you be hard hit simpson say the cornet never mind keep you saddle a little longer we shall be all right directly charle look down and notice that he left arm be hang numb by he side and that a trooper be guide he horse soon they be among english face and english cheer ring out in welcome to they return but it be nothing to he he keep he eye which be grow dim on hornby and when he see he fall off he saddle into the arm of a trooper he dismount too and stagger towards he the world seem to go round and round and he feel about he like a blind man but he find hornby somehow presently a doctor be bend over he later they find hornby dead and cold with he head on charle 's lap charle have be strike by a ball in the bone of he arm and the splinter be drive into the flesh though the arm be not break it be a nasty business say the doctor all sort of thing might happen to he only one thing be certain and that be that charle ravenshoe 's career in the army be over for ever at home they all believe he dead for william have trace he to varna and there have be inform that he foster-brother have die of cholera the change of name be partly responsible for this for among the dead or live there be no sign of charle ravenshoe but he recover after a long spell in the hospital at scutarus and after a time be send home to fort pitt but that

christmas eve in the street with eighteen shilling and ninepence in he pocket wonder blindly what the end would be but no more dream of beg from those who have know he formerly than of leap off waterloo bridge _ iii -- the last eighteen shilling _ charle 's luck seem certainly to have desert he at last he have get to spend he christmas with eighteen shilling and a cripple leave arm and have nothing leave to trust to but he little friend the cornet who have come home invalide and be live with he mother in hyde park garden the cornet welcome he with both hand and hearing from charle of he plight say now i know you be a gentleman and i may offend you but if you be utterly hard up take service with I there i will do so with the deepest gratitude say charle but i can not ride i fear my
