wonder who change you name pedro and how the devil do _ he _ come by you ho ho if you could only talk -- they hear thorpe 's voice inside the tent it be follow by a low girlish peal of laughter and mccready jerk himself erect he face blaze suddenly red and he rise to he foot drop the flask in he coat pocket walk around the fire he tiptoe cautiously to the shadow of a tree close to the tent and stand there for many minute listen he eye burn with a fiery madness when he return to the sledge and kazan it be midnight before he go into he own tent in the warmth of the fire kazan 's eye slowly close he slumber uneasily and he brain be fill with troubled picture at time he be fight and he jaw snap at other he be strain at the end of he chain with mccready or he mistress just out of reach he feel the gentle touch of the girl 's hand again and hear the wonderful sweetness of she voice as she sing to he and he master and he body tremble and twitch with the thrill that have fill he that night and then the picture change he be run at the head of a splendid team -- six dog of the royal northwest mount police -- and he master be call he pedro the scene shift they be in camp he master be young and smooth-faced and he help from the sledge another man whose hand be fasten in front of he by curious black ring again it be later -- and he be lie before a great fire he master be sit opposite he with he back to a tent and as he look there come out of the tent the man with the black ring -- only now the ring be go and he hand be free and in one of they he carry a heavy club he hear the terrible blow of the club as it fall on he master 's head -- and the sound of it arouse he from he restless sleep he spring to he foot he spine stiffen and a snarl in he throat the fire have die down and the camp be in the darker gloom that precede dawn through that gloom kazan see mccready again he be stand close to the tent of he mistress and he know now that this be the man who have wear the black iron ring and that it be he who have beat he with whip and club for many long day after he have kill he master mccready hear the menace in he throat and come back quickly to the fire he begin to whistle and draw the half-burned log together and as the fire blaze up afresh he shout to awaken thorp and isobel in a few minute thorpe appear at the tent-flap and he wife follow he out she loose hair ripple in billow of gold about she shoulder and she sit down on the sledge close to kazan and begin brushing it mccready come up behind she and fumble among the package on the sledge as if by accident one of he hand bury itself for a instant in the rich tress that flow down she back she do not at first feel the caress touch of he finger and thorpe 's back be toward they only kazan see the stealthy movement of the hand the fondle clutch of the finger in she hair and the mad passion burning in the eye of the man quicker than a lynx the dog have leap the length of he chain across the sledge mccready spring back just in time and as kazan reach the end of he chain he be jerk back so that he body strike sidewise against the girl thorpe have turn in time to see the end of the leap he believe that kazan have spring at isobel and in he horror no word or cry escape he lip as he drag she from where she have half fall over the sledge he see that she be not hurt and he reach for he revolver it be in he holster in the tent at he foot be mccready 's whip and in the passion of the moment he seize it and spring upon kazan the dog crouch in the snow he make no move to escape or to attack only once in he life could he remember have receive a beating like that which thorpe inflict upon he now but not a whimper or a growl escape he -lrb- illustration : not another blow -rrb- and then suddenly he mistress run forward and catch the whip poise above thorpe 's head not another blow she cry and something in she voice hold he from striking mccready do not hear what she say then but a strange look come into thorpe 's eye and without a word he follow he wife into they tent kazan do not leap at I she whisper and she be tremble with a sudden excitement she face be deathly white that man be behind I she go on clutch she husband by the arm i feel he touch I -- and then kazan spring he would not bite _ I _ it be the _ man _ there be something -- wrong -- she be almost sob and thorpe draw she close in he arm i have not think before -- but it be strange he say do not mccready say something about know the dog it be possible perhaps he be have kazan before and abuse he in a way that the dog have not forget to-morrow i 'll find out but until i know -- will you promise to keep away from kazan isobel give the promise when they come out from the tent kazan lift he great head the stinging lash have close one of he eye and he mouth be drip blood isobel give a low sob but do not go near he half blind he know that he mistress have stop he punishment and he whine softly and wag he thick tail in the snow never have he feel so miserable as through the long hard hour of the day that follow when he break the trail for he team-mate into the north one of he eye be close and fill with stinging fire and he body be sore from the blow of the caribou lash but it be not physical pain that give the sullen droop to he head and rob he body of that keen quick alertness of the lead-dog -- the commander of he mate it be he spirit for the first time in he life it be break mccready have beat he -- long ago he master have beat he and during all this day they voice be fierce and vengeful in he ear but it be he mistress who hurt he most she hold aloof from he always beyond they reach of he leash and when they stop to rest and again in camp she look at he with strange and wonder eye and do not speak she too be ready to beat he he believe that and so slunk away from she and crouch on he belly in the snow with he a broken spirit mean a broken heart and that night he lurk in one of the deepest shadow about the camp-fire and grieve alone none know that it be grief -- unless it be the girl she do not move toward he she do not speak to he but she watch he closely -- and study he hardest when he be look at mccready later after thorpe and he wife have go into they tent it begin to snow and the effect of the snow upon mccready puzzle kazan the man be restless and he drink frequently from the flask that he have use the night before in the firelight he face grow redder and redder and kazan could see the strange gleam of he tooth as he gaze at the tent in which he mistress be sleep again and again he go close to that tent and listen twice he hear movement the last time it be the sound of thorpe 's deep breathing mccready hurry back to the fire and turn he face straight up to the sky the snow be fall so thickly that when he lower he face he blink and wipe he eye then he go out into the gloom and bent low over the trail they have make a few hour before it be almost obliterate by the fall snow another hour and there would be no trail -- nothing the next day to tell whoever might pass that they have come this way by morning it would cover everything even the fire if he allow it to die down mccready drink again out in the darkness low word of a insane joy burst from he lip he head be hot with a drunken fire he heart beat madly but scarcely more furiously than do kazan 's when the dog see that mccready be return _ with a club _ the club he place on end against a tree then he take a lantern from the sledge and light it he approach thorpe 's tent-flap the lantern in he hand ho thorpe -- thorpe he call there be no answer he could hear thorpe breathing he draw the flap aside a little and raise he voice thorpe still there be no movement inside and he untie the flap string and thrust in he lantern the light flash on isobel 's golden head and mccready stare at it he eye burn like red coal until he see that thorpe be awaken quickly he drop the flap and rustle it from the outside ho thorpe -- thorpe he call again this time thorpe reply hello mccready -- be that you mccready draw the flap back a little and speak in a low voice yes can you come out a minute something 's happen out in the wood do not wake up you wife he draw back and wait a minute later thorpe come quietly out of the tent mccready point into the thick spruce i 'll swear there be some one nose around the camp he say i be certain that i see a man out there a few minute ago when i go for a log it be a good night for steal dog here -- you take the lantern if i be not clean fool we 'll find a trail in the snow he give thorpe the lantern and pick up the heavy club a growl rise in kazan 's throat but he choke it back he want to snarl forth he warn to leap at the end of he leash but he know that if he do that they would return and beat he so he lay still tremble and shiver and whine softly he watch they until they disappear -- and then wait -- listen at last he hear the crunch of snow he be not surprise to see mccready come back alone he have expect he to return alone for he know what a club mean mccready 's face be terrible now it be like a beast 's he be hatless kazan slunk deeper in he shadow at the low horrible laugh that fall from he lip -- for the man still hold the club in a moment he drop that and approach the tent he draw back the flap and peer in thorpe 's wife be sleep and as quietly as a cat he enter and hang the lantern on a nail in the tent-pole he movement do not awaken she and for a few moment he stand there stare -- stare outside crouching in the deep shadow kazan try to fathom the meaning of these strange thing that be happen why have he master and mccready go out into the forest why have not he master return it be he master and not mccready who belong in that tent then why be mccready there he watch mccready as he enter and suddenly the dog be on he foot he back tense and bristle he limb rigid he see mccready 's huge shadow on the canvas and a moment later there come a strange piercing cry in the wild terror of that cry he recognize _ she _ voice -- and he leap toward the tent the leash stop he choke the snarl in he throat he see the shadow struggle now and there come cry after cry she be call to he master and with he master 's name she be call _ he _ _ kazan _ -- _ kazan _ -- he leap again and be throw upon he back a second and a third time he spring the length of the leash into the night and the babiche cord about he neck cut into he flesh like a knife he stop for a instant gasping for breath the shadow be still fight now they be upright now they be crumple down with a fierce snarl he fling he whole weight once more at the end of the chain there be a snap as the thong about he neck give way in half a dozen bound kazan make the tent and rush under the flap with a snarl he be at mccready 's throat the first snap of he powerful jaw be death but he do not know that he know only that he mistress be there and that he be fight for she there come one choke gasping cry that end with a terrible sob it be mccready the man sink from he knee upon he back and kazan thrust he fang deeper into he enemy 's throat he feel the warm blood the dog 's mistress be call to he now she be pull at he shaggy neck but he would not loose he hold -- not for a long time when he do he mistress look down once upon the man and cover she face with she hand then she sink down upon the blanket she be very still she face and hand be cold and kazan muzzle they tenderly she eye be close he snuggle up close against she with he ready jaw turn toward the dead man why be she so still he wonder a long time pass and then she move she eye open she hand touch he then he hear a step outside it be he master and with that old thrill of fear -- fear of the club -- he go swiftly to the door yes there be he master in the firelight -- and in he hand he hold the club he be come slowly almost fall at each step and he face be red with blood but he have _ the club _ he would beat he again -- beat he terribly for hurt mccready so kazan slip quietly under the tent-flap and steal off into the shadow from out the gloom of the thick spruce he look back and a low whine of love and grief rise and die softly in he throat they would beat he always now -- after _ that _ even _ she _ would beat he they would hunt he down and beat he when they find he from out of the glow of the fire he turn he wolfish head to the depths of the forest there be no club or stinging lash out in that gloom they would never find he there for another moment he waver and then as silently as one of the wild creature whose blood be partly he he steal away into the blackness of the night chapter iv free from bond there be a low moaning of the wind in the spruce-top as kazan slink off into the blackness and mystery of the forest for hour he lay near the camp he red and blistered eye gaze steadily at the tent wherein the terrible thing have happen a little while before he know now what death be he could tell it farther than man he could smell it in the air and he know that there be death all about he and that he be the cause of it he lay on he belly in the deep snow and shiver and the three-quarter of he that be dog whine in a grief-stricken way while the quarter that be wolf still reveal itself menacingly in he fang and in the vengeful glare of he eye three time the man -- he master -- come out of the tent and shout loudly kazan -- kazan -- kazan three time the woman come with he in the firelight kazan could see she shine hair streaming about she as he have see it in the tent when he have leap up and kill the other man in she blue eye there be the same wild terror and she face be white as the snow and the second and third time she too call kazan -- kazan -- kazan -- and all that part of he that be dog and not wolf tremble joyously at the sound of she voice and he almost creep in to take he beating but fear of the club be the greater and he hold back hour after hour until now it be silent again in the tent and he could no longer see they shadow and the fire be die down cautiously he creep out from the thick gloom work he way on he belly toward the packed sledge and what remain of the burn log beyond that sledge hide in the darkness of the tree be the body of the man he have kill cover with a blanket thorpe he master have drag it there he lay down with he nose to the warm coal and he eye level between he forepaw straight at the closed tent-flap he mean to keep awake to watch to be ready to slink off into the forest at the first movement there but a warmth be rise from out of the gray ash of the fire-bed and he eye close twice -- three time -- he fight himself back into watchfulness but the last time he eye come only half open and close heavily again and now in he sleep he whine softly and the splendid muscle of he leg and shoulder twitch and sudden shudder ripple run along he tawny spine thorpe who be in the tent if he have see he would have know that he be dream and thorpe 's wife whose golden head lay close against he breast and who shudder and tremble now and then even as kazan be do would have know what he be dream about in he sleep he be leap again at the end of he chain he jaw snap like castanets of steel -- and the sound awaken he and he spring to he foot he spine as stiff as a brush and he snarl fang bare like ivory knife he have awaken just in time there be movement in the tent he master be awake and if he do not escape -- he speed swiftly into the thick spruce and pause flat and hide with only he head show from behind a tree he know that he master would not spare he three time thorpe have beat he for snap at mccready the last time he would have shoot he if the girl have not save he and now he have tear mccready 's throat he have take the life from he and he master would not spare he even the woman could not save he kazan be sorry that he master have return dazed and bleeding after he have tear mccready 's jugular then he would have have she always she would have love he she do love he and he would have follow she and fight for she always and die for she when the time come but thorpe have come in from the forest again and kazan have slink away quickly -- for thorpe mean to he what all man mean to he now : the club the whip and the strange thing that spit fire and death and now -- thorpe have come out from the tent it be approach dawn and in he hand he hold a rifle a moment later the girl come out and she hand catch the man 's arm they look toward the thing cover by the blanket then she speak to thorpe and he suddenly straighten and throw back he head h-o-o-o-o -- kazan -- kazan -- kazan he call a shiver run through kazan the man be try to inveigle he back he have in he hand the thing that kill kazan -- kazan -- ka-a-a-a-zan he shout again kazan sneak cautiously back from the tree he know that distance mean nothing to the cold thing of death that thorpe hold in he hand he turn he head once and whine softly and for a instant a great longing fill he reddened eye as he see the last of the girl he know now that he be leave she forever and there be a ache in he heart that have never be there before a pain that be not of the club or whip of cold or hunger but which be greater than they all and which fill he with a desire to throw back he head and cry out he loneliness to the gray emptiness of the sky back in the camp the girl 's voice quiver he be go the man 's strong voice choke a little yes he be go _ he know _ -- and i do not i would give -- a year of my life -- if i have not whip he yesterday and last night he will not come back isobel thorpe 's hand tighten on he arm he will she cry he will not leave I he love I if he be savage and terrible and he know that i love he he 'll come back -- listen from deep in the forest there come a long wail howl fill with a plaintive sadness it be kazan 's farewell to the woman after that cry kazan sit for a long time on he haunch sniff the new freedom of the air and watch the deep black pit in the forest about he as they fade away before dawn ` now and then since the day the trader have first buy he and put he into sledge-trace away over on the mackenzie he have often think of this freedom longingly the wolf blood in he urge he to take it but he have never quite dare it thrill he now there be no club here no whip none of the man-beast whom he have first learn to distrust and then to hate it be he misfortune -- that quarter-strain of wolf and the club instead of subdue he have add to the savagery that be bear in he man have be he worst enemy they have beat he time and again until he be almost dead they call he bad and step wide of he and never miss the chance to snap a whip over he back he body be cover with scar they have give he he have never feel kindness or love until the first night the woman have put she warm little hand on he head and have snuggle she face close down to he while thorpe -- she husband -- have cry out in horror he have almost bury he fang in she white flesh but in a instant she gentle touch and she sweet voice have send through he that wonderful thrill that be he first knowledge of love and now it be a man who be drive he from she away from the hand that have never hold a club or a whip and he growl as he trot deeper into the forest he come to the edge of a swamp as day break for a time he have be fill with a strange uneasiness and light do not quite dispel it at last he be free of man he could detect nothing that remind he of they hate presence in the air but neither could he smell the presence of other dog of the sledge the fire of companionship and food and so far back as he could remember they have always be a part of he life here it be very quiet the swamp lay in a hollow between two ridge-mountain and the spruce and cedar grow low and thick -- so thick that there be almost no snow under they and day be like twilight two thing he begin to miss more than all other -- food and company both the wolf and the dog that be in he demand the first and that part of he that be dog long for the latter to both desire the wolf blood that be strong in he rise responsively it tell he that somewhere in this silent world between the two ridge there be companionship and that all he have to do to find it be to sit back on he haunch and cry out he loneliness more than once something tremble in he deep chest rise in he throat and end there in a whine it be the wolf howl not yet quite bear food come more easily than voice toward midday he corner a big white rabbit under a log and kill it the warm flesh and blood be better than frozen fish or tallow and bran and the feast he have give he confidence that afternoon he chase many rabbit and kill two more until now he have never know the delight of pursue and kill at will even though he do not eat all he kill but there be no fight in the rabbit they die too easily they be very sweet and tender to eat when he be hungry but the first thrill of kill they pass away after a time he want something bigger he no longer slunk along as if he be afraid or as if he want to remain hidden he hold he head up he back bristle he tail swing free and bushy like a wolf 's every hair in he body quiver with the electric energy of life and action he travel north and west it be the call of early day -- the day away up on the mackenzie the mackenzie be a thousand mile away he come upon many trail in the snow that day and sniff the scent leave by the hoof of moose and caribou and the fur-padded foot of a lynx he follow a fox and the trail lead he to a place shut in by tall spruce where the snow be beat down and redden with blood there be a owl 's head feather wing and entrails lie here and he know that there be other hunter abroad besides himself toward evening he come upon track in the snow that be very much like he own they be quite fresh and there be a warm scent about they that make he whine and fill he again with that desire to fall back upon he haunch and send forth the wolf-cry this desire grow stronger in he as the shadow of night deepen in the forest he have travel all day but he be not tire there be something about night now that there be no man near that exhilarate he strangely the wolf blood in he run swifter and swifter to-night it be clear the sky be fill with star the moon rise and at last he settle back in the snow and turn he head straight up to the spruce-top and the wolf come out of he in a long mournful cry which quiver through the still night for mile for a long time he sit and listen after that howl he have find voice -- a voice with a strange new note in it and it give he still greater confidence he have expect a answer but none come he have travel in the face of the wind and as he howl a bull moose crash through the scrub timber ahead of he he horn rattle against the tree like the tattoo of a clear birch club as he put distance between himself and that cry twice kazan howl before he go on and he find joy in the practice of that new note he come then to the foot of a rough ridge and turn up out of the swamp to the top of it the star and the moon be nearer to he there and on the other side of the ridge he look down upon a great sweeping plain with a frozen lake glisten in the moonlight and a white river lead from it off into timber that be neither so thick nor so black as that in the swamp and then every muscle in he body grow tense and he blood leap from far off in the plain there come a cry it be _ he _ cry -- the wolf-cry he jaw snap he white fang gleam and he growl deep in he throat he want to reply but some strange instinct urge he not to that instinct of the wild be already become master of he in the air in the whispering of the spruce-top in the moon and the star themselves there breathe a spirit which tell he that what he have hear be the wolf-cry but that it be not the wolf _ call _ the other come a hour later clear and distinct that same wail howl at the beginning -- but end in a staccato of quick sharp yelp that stir he blood at once into a fiery excitement that it have never know before the same instinct tell he that this be the call -- the hunt-cry it urge he to come quickly a few moment later it come again and this time there be a reply from close down along the foot of the ridge and another from so far away that kazan could scarcely hear it the hunt-pack be gather for the night chase but kazan sit quiet and tremble he be not afraid but he be not ready to go the ridge seem to split the world for he down there it be new and strange and without man from the other side something seem pull he back and suddenly he turn he head and gaze back through the moonlit space behind he and whine it be the dog-whine now the woman be back there he could hear she voice he could feel the touch of she soft hand he could see the laughter in she face and eye the laughter that have make he warm and happy she be call to he through the forest and he be tear between desire to answer that call and desire to go down into the plain for he could also see many man wait for he with club and he could hear the crack of whip and feel the sting of they lash for a long time he remain on the top of the ridge that divide he world and then at last he turn and go down into the plain all that night he keep close to the hunt-pack but never quite approach it this be fortunate for he he still bear the scent of trace and of man the pack would have tear he into piece the first instinct of the wild be that of self-preservation it may have be this a whisper back through the year of savage forebear that make kazan roll in the snow now and then where the foot of the pack have tread the thickest that night the pack kill a caribou on the edge of the lake and feast until nearly dawn kazan hang in the face of the wind the smell of blood and of warm flesh tickle he nostril and he sharp ear could catch the crack of bone but the instinct be stronger than the temptation not until broad day when the pack have scatter far and wide over the plain do he go boldly to the scene of the kill he find nothing but a area of blood-reddened snow cover with bone entrails and tear bit of tough hide but it be enough and he roll in it and bury he nose in what be leave and remain all that day close to it saturating himself with the scent of it that night when the moon and the star come out again he sit back with fear and hesitation no longer in he and announce himself to he new comrade of the great plain the pack hunt again that night or else it be a new pack that start mile to the south and come up with a doe caribou to the big frozen lake the night be almost as clear as day and from the edge of the forest kazan first see the caribou run out on the lake a third of a mile away the pack be about a dozen strong and have already split into the fatal horseshoe formation the two leader run almost abreast of the kill and slowly close in with a sharp yelp kazan dart out into the moonlight he be directly in the path of the flee doe and bear down upon she with lightning speed two hundred yard away the doe see he and swerve to the right and the leader on that side meet she with open jaw kazan be in with the second leader and leap at the doe 's soft throat in a snarl mass the pack close in from behind and the doe go down with kazan half under she body he fang sink deep in she jugular she lay heavily on he but he do not lose he hold it be he first big kill he blood run like fire he snarl between he clamp tooth not until the last quiver have leave the body over he do he pull himself out from under she chest and foreleg he have kill a rabbit that day and be not hungry so he sit back in the snow and wait while the ravenous pack tear at the dead doe after a little he come nearer nose in between two of they and be nip for he intrusion as kazan draw back still hesitate to mix with he wild brother a big gray form leap out of the pack and drive straight for he throat he have just time to throw he shoulder to the attack and for a moment the two roll over and over in the snow they be up before the excitement of sudden battle have draw the pack from the feast slowly they circle about each other they white fang bare they yellowish back bristle like brush the fatal ring of wolf draw about the fighter it be not new to kazan a dozen time he have sit in ring like this wait for the final moment more than once he have fight for he life within the circle it be the sledge-dog way of fight unless man interrupt with a club or a whip it always end in death only one fighter could come out alive sometimes both die and there be no man here -- only that fatal cordon of wait white-fanged demon ready to leap upon and tear to piece the first of the fighter who be throw upon he side or back kazan be a stranger but he do not fear those that hem he in the one great law of the pack would compel they to be fair he keep he eye only on the big gray leader who have challenge he shoulder to shoulder they continue to circle where a few moment before there have be the snap of jaw and the rending of flesh there be now silence soft-footed and soft-throated mongrel dog from the south would have snarl and growl but kazan and the wolf be still they ear lay forward instead of back they tail free and bushy suddenly the wolf strike in with the swiftness of lightning and he jaw come together with the sharpness of steel striking steel they miss by a inch in that same instant kazan dart in to the side and like knife he tooth gash the wolf 's flank they circle again they eye grow redder they lip draw back until they seem to have disappear and then kazan leap for that death-grip at the throat -- and miss it be only by a inch again and the wolf come back as he have do and lay open kazan 's flank so that the blood run down he leg and redden the snow the burn of that flank-wound tell kazan that he enemy be old in the game of fight he crouch low he head straight out and he throat close to the snow it be a trick kazan have learn in puppyhood -- to shield he throat and wait twice the wolf circle about he and kazan pivot slowly he eye half close a second time the wolf leap and kazan throw up he terrible jaw sure of that fatal grip just in front of the foreleg he tooth snap on empty air with the nimbleness of a cat the wolf have go completely over he back the trick have fail and with a rumble of the dog-snarl in he throat kazan reach the wolf in a single bind they meet breast to breast they fang clash and with the whole weight of he body kazan fling himself against the wolf 's shoulder clear he jaw and strike again for the throat hold it be another miss -- by a hair 's breadth -- and before he could recover the wolf 's tooth be bury in the back of he neck for the first time in he life kazan feel the terror and the pain of the death-grip and with a mighty effort he fling he head a little forward and snapped blindly he powerful jaw close on the wolf 's foreleg close to the body there be a crack of bone and a crunching of flesh and the circle of wait wolf grow tense and alert one or the other of the fighter be sure to go down before the hold be break and they but await that fatal fall as a signal to leap in to the death only the thickness of hair and hide on the back of kazan 's neck and the toughness of he muscle save he from that terrible fate of the vanquish the wolf 's tooth sink deep but not deep enough to reach the vital spot and suddenly kazan put every ounce of strength in he limb to the effort and fling himself up bodily from under he antagonist the grip on he neck relax and with another rear leap he tear himself free as swift as a whip-lash he whirl on the broken-legged leader of the pack and with the full rush and weight of he shoulder strike he fairly in the side more deadly than the throat-grip have kazan sometimes find the lunge when deliver at the right moment it be deadly now the big gray wolf lose he foot roll upon he back for a instant and the pack rush in eager to rend the last of life from the leader whose power have cease to exist from out of that gray snarl bloody-lipped mass kazan draw back pant and bleed he be weak there be a curious sickness in he head he want to lie down in the snow but the old and infallible instinct warn he not to betray that weakness from out of the pack a slim lithe gray she-wolf come up to he and lay down in the snow before he and then rise swiftly and sniff at he wound she be young and strong and beautiful but kazan do not look at she where the fight have be he be look at what little remain of the old leader the pack have return to the feast he hear again the crack of bone and the rending of flesh and something tell he that hereafter all the wilderness would hear and recognize he voice and that when he sit back on he haunch and call to the moon and the star those swift-footed hunter of the big plain would respond to it he circle twice about the caribou and the pack and then trot off to the edge of the black spruce forest when he reach the shadow he look back gray wolf be follow he she be only a few yard behind and now she come up to he a little timidly and she too look back to the dark blotch of life out on the lake and as she stand there close beside he kazan sniff at something in the air that be not the scent of blood nor the perfume of the balsam and spruce it be a thing that seem to come to he from the clear star the cloudless moon the strange and beautiful quiet of the night itself and its presence seem to be a part of gray wolf he look at she and he find gray wolf 's eye alert and question she be young -- so young that she seem scarcely to have pass out of puppyhood she body be strong and slim and beautifully shape in the moonlight the hair under she throat and along she back shone sleek and soft she whine at the red stare light in kazan 's eye and it be not a puppy 's whimper kazan move toward she and stand with he head over she back face the pack he feel she tremble against he chest he look at the moon and the star again the mystery of gray wolf and of the night throb in he blood not much of he life have be spend at the post most of it have be on the trail -- in the trace -- and the spirit of the mating season have only stir he from afar but it be very near now gray wolf lift she head she soft muzzle touch the wound on he neck and in the gentleness of that touch in the low sound in she throat kazan feel and hear again that wonderful something that have come with the caress of the woman 's hand and the sound of she voice he turn whine he back bristle he head high and defiant of the wilderness which he face gray wolf trot close at he side as they enter into the gloom of the forest chapter v the fight in the snow they find shelter that night under thick balsam and when they lay down on the soft carpet of needle which the snow have not cover gray wolf snuggle she warm body close to kazan and lick he wound the day break with a velvety fall of snow so white and thick that they could not see a dozen leap ahead of they in the open it be quite warm and so still that the whole world seem fill with only the flutter and whisper of the snowflake through this day kazan and gray wolf travel side by side time and again he turn he head back to the ridge over which he have come and gray wolf could not understand the strange note that tremble in he throat in the afternoon they return to what be leave of the caribou doe on the lake in the edge of the forest gray wolf hang back she do not yet know the meaning of poison-baits deadfall and trap but the instinct of numberless generation be in she vein and it tell she there be danger in visit a second time a thing that have grow cold in death kazan have see master work about carcass that the wolf have leave he have see they conceal trap cleverly and roll little capsule of strychnine in the fat of the entrails and once he have put a foreleg in a trap and have experience its sting and pain and deadly grip but he do not have gray wolf 's fear he urge she to accompany he to the white hummock on the ice and at last she go with he and sink back restlessly on she haunch while he dig out the bone and piece of flesh that the snow have keep from freezing but she would not eat and at last kazan go and sit on he haunch at she side and with she look at what he have dig out from under the snow he sniff the air he could not smell danger but gray wolf tell he that it might be there she tell he many other thing in the day and night that follow the third night kazan himself gather the hunt-pack and lead in the chase three time that month before the moon leave the sky he lead the chase and each time there be a kill but as the snow begin to grow softer under he foot he find a greater and greater companionship in gray wolf and they hunt alone live on the big white rabbit in all the world he have love but two thing the girl with the shine hair and the hand that have caress he -- and gray wolf he do not leave the big plain and often he take he mate to the top of the ridge and he would try to tell she what he have leave back there with the dark night the call of the woman become so strong upon he that he be fill with a longing to go back and take gray wolf with he something happen very soon after that they be cross the open plain one day when up on the face of the ridge kazan see something that make he heart stand still a man with a dog-sledge and team be come down into they world the wind have not warn they and suddenly kazan saw something glisten in the man 's hand he know what it be it be the thing that spit fire and thunder and kill he give he warn to gray wolf and they be off like the wind side by side and then come the _ sound _ -- and kazan 's hatred of man burst forth in a snarl as he leap there be a queer hum over they head the sound from behind come again and this time gray wolf give a yelp of pain and roll over and over in the snow she be on she foot again in a instant and kazan drop behind she and run there until they reach the shelter of the timber gray wolf lay down and begin lick the wound in she shoulder kazan face the ridge the man be take up they trail he stop where gray wolf have fall and examine the snow then he come on kazan urge gray wolf to she foot and they make for the thick swamp close to the lake all that day they keep in the face of the wind and when gray wolf lay down kazan steal back over they trail watch and sniff the air for day after that gray wolf run lame and when once they come upon the remains of a old camp kazan 's tooth be bare in snarl hatred of the man-scent that have be leave behind grow in he there be a desire for vengeance -- vengeance for he own hurt and for gray wolf 's he try to nose out the man-trail under the cover of fresh snow and gray wolf circle around he anxiously and try to lure he deeper into the forest at last he follow she sullenly there be a savage redness in he eye three day later the new moon come and on the fifth night kazan strike a trail it be fresh -- so fresh that he stop as suddenly as though strike by a bullet when he run upon it and stand with every muscle in he body quiver and he hair on end it be a man-trail there be the mark of the sledge the dog ' foot and the snow-shoeprint of he enemy then he throw up he head to the star and from he throat there roll out over the wide plain the hunt-cry -- the wild and savage call for the pack never have he put the savagery in it that be there to-night again and again he send forth that call and then there come a answer and another and still another until gray wolf herself sit back on she haunch and add she voice to kazan 's and far out on the plain a white and haggard-faced man halt he exhaust dog to listen while a voice say faintly from the sledge : the wolf father be they come -- after we the man be silent he be not young the moon shone in he long white beard and add grotesquely to the height of he tall gaunt figure a girl have raise she head from a bearskin pillow on the sleigh she dark eye be fill beautifully with the starlight she be pale she hair fall in a thick shine braid over she shoulder and she be hug something tightly to she breast they be on the trail of something -- probably a deer say the man look at the breech of he rifle do not worry jo we 'll stop at the next bit of scrub and see if we can not find enough dry stuff for a fire -- wee-ah-h-h-h boy koosh -- koosh -- and he snap he whip over the back of he team from the bundle at the girl 's breast there come a small wail cry and far back in the plain there answer it the scattered voice of the pack at last kazan be on the trail of vengeance he run slowly at first with gray wolf close beside he pause every three or four hundred yard to send forth the cry a gray leap form join they from behind another follow two come in from the side and kazan 's solitary howl give place to the wild tongue of the pack number grow and with increase number the pace become swifter four -- six -- seven -- ten -- fourteen by the time the more open and wind-swept part of the plain be reach it be a strong pack fill with old and fearless hunter gray wolf be the youngest and she keep close to kazan 's shoulder she could see nothing of he red-shot eye and drip jaw and would not have understand if she have see but she could _ feel _ and she be thrill by the spirit of that strange and mysterious savagery that have make kazan forget all thing but hurt and death the pack make no sound there be only the panting of breath and the soft fall of many foot they run swiftly and close and always kazan be a leap ahead with gray wolf nose he shoulder never have he want to kill as he feel the desire in he to kill now for the first time he have no fear of man no fear of the club of the whip or of the thing that blaze forth fire and death he run more swiftly in order to overtake they and give they battle sooner all of the pent-up madness of four year of slavery and abuse at the hand of man break loose in thin red stream of fire in he vein and when at last he see a move blotch far out on the plain ahead of he the cry that come out of he throat be one that gray wolf do not understand three hundred yard beyond that move blotch be the thin line of timber and kazan and he follower bear down swiftly half-way to the timber they be almost upon it and suddenly it stop and become a black and motionless shadow on the snow from out of it there leap that lightning tongue of flame that kazan have always dread and he hear the hissing song of the death-bee over he head he do not mind it now he yelp sharply and the wolf race in until four of they be neck-and-neck with he a second flash -- and the death-bee drive from breast to tail of a huge gray fighter close to gray wolf a third -- a fourth -- a fifth spurt of that fire from the black shadow and kazan himself feel a sudden swift passing of a red-hot thing along he shoulder where the man 's last bullet shave off the hair and sting he flesh three of the pack have go down under the fire of the rifle and half of the other be swing to the right and the left but kazan drive straight ahead faithfully gray wolf follow he the sledge-dog have be free from they trace and before he could reach the man whom he see with he rifle hold like a club in he hand kazan be meet by the fight mass of they he fight like a fiend and there be the strength and the fierceness of two mate in the mad gnashing of gray wolf 's fang two of the wolf rush in and kazan hear the terrific back-breaking thud of the rifle to he it be the _ club _ he want to reach it he want to reach the man who hold it and he free himself from the fight mass of the dog and spring to the sledge for the first time he see that there be something human on the sledge and in a instant he be upon it he bury he jaw deep they sink in something soft and hairy and he open they for another lunge and then he hear the voice it be _ she voice _ every muscle in he body stand still he become suddenly like flesh turn to lifeless stone _ she voice _ the bear rug be throw back and what have be hide under it he see clearly now in the light of the moon and the star in he instinct work more swiftly than human brain could have give birth to reason it be not _ she _ but the voice be the same and the white girlish face so close to he own blood-reddened eye hold in it that same mystery that he have learn to love and he see now that which she be clutch to she breast and there come from it a strange thrilling cry -- and he know that here on the sledge he have find not enmity and death but that from which he have be drive away in the other world beyond the ridge in a flash he turn he snap at gray wolf 's flank and she drop away with a startled yelp it have all happen in a moment but the man be almost down kazan leap under he club rifle and drive into the face of what be leave of the pack he fang cut like knife if he have fight like a demon against the dog he fight like ten demon now and the man -- bleeding and ready to fall -- stagger back to the sledge marveling at what be happen for in gray wolf there be now the instinct of matehood and see kazan tear and right the pack she join he in the struggle which she could not understand when it be over kazan and gray wolf be alone out on the plain the pack have slink away into the night and the same moon and star that have give to kazan the first knowledge of he birthright tell he now that no longer would those wild brother of the plain respond to he call when he howl into the sky he be hurt and gray wolf be hurt but not so badly as kazan he be tear and bleed one of he leg be terribly bite after a time he see a fire in the edge of the forest the old call be strong upon he he want to crawl in to it and feel the girl 's hand on he head as he have feel that other hand in the world beyond the ridge he would have go -- and would have urge gray wolf to go with he -- but the man be there he whine and gray wolf thrust she warm muzzle against he neck something tell they both that they be outcast that the plain and the moon and the star be against they now and they slink into the shelter and the gloom of the forest kazan could not go far he could still smell the camp when he lay down gray wolf snuggle close to he gently she soothe with she soft tongue kazan 's bleeding wound and kazan lift he head whine softly to the star chapter vi joan on the edge of the cedar and spruce forest old pierre radisson build the fire he be bleed from a dozen wound where the fang of the wolf have reach to he flesh and he feel in he breast that old and terrible pain of which no one know the meaning but himself he drag in log after log pile they on the fire until the flame leap tip to the crisp needle of the limb above and heap a supply close at hand for use later in the night from the sledge joan watch he still wild-eyed and fearful still tremble she be hold she baby close to she breast she long heavy hair smother she shoulder and arm in a dark lustrous veil that glisten and ripple in the firelight when she move she young face be scarcely a woman 's to-night though she be a mother she look like a child old pierre laugh as he throw down the last armful of fuel and stand breathing hard it be close _ ma cherus _ he pant through he white beard we be nearer to death out there on the plain than we will ever be again i hope but we be comfortable now and warm eh you be no longer afraid he sit down beside he daughter and gently pull back the soft fur that envelop the bundle she hold in she arm he could see one pink cheek of baby joan the eye of joan the mother be like star it be the baby who save we she whisper the dog be be tear to piece by the wolf

tall and slim in the firelight he fight for we -- and he be terribly hurt she say i see he drag himself away father if he be out there -- die -- pierre radisson stand up he cough in a shudder way try to stifle the sound under he beard the fleck of crimson that come to he lip with the cough joan do not see she have see nothing of it during the six day they have be travel up from the edge of civilization because of that cough and the stain that come with it pierre have make more than ordinary haste i have be think of that he say he be badly hurt and i do not think he go far here -- take little joan and sit close to the fire until i come back the moon and the star be brilliant in the sky when he go out in the plain a short distance from the edge of the timber-line he stand for a moment upon the spot where the wolf have overtake they a hour before not one of he four dog have live the snow be red with they blood and they body lay stiff where they have fall under the pack pierre shudder as he look at they if the wolf have not turn they first mad attack upon the dog what would have become of himself joan and the baby he turn away with another of those hollow cough that bring the blood to he lip a few yard to one side he find in the snow the trail of the strange dog that have come with the wolf and have turn against they in that moment when all seem lose it be not a clean run trail it be more of a furrow in the snow and pierre radisson follow it expect to find the dog dead at the end of it in the sheltered spot to which he have drag himself in the edge of the forest kazan lay for a long time after the fight alert and watchful he feel no very great pain but he have lose the power to stand upon he leg he flank seem paralyzed gray wolf crouch close at he side sniff the air they could smell the camp and kazan could detect the two thing that be there -- _ man _ and _ woman _ he know that the girl be there where he could see the glow of the firelight through the spruce and the cedar he want to go to she he want to drag himself close in to the fire and take gray wolf with he and listen to she voice and feel the touch of she hand but the man be there and to he man have always mean the club the whip pain death gray wolf crouch close to he side and whine softly as she urge kazan to flee deeper with she into the forest at last she understand that he could not move and she run nervously out into the plain and back again until she footprint be thick in the trail she make the instinct of matehood be strong in she it be she who first see pierre radisson come over they trail and she run swiftly back to kazan and give the warning then kazan catch the scent and he see the shadowy figure come through the starlight he try to drag himself back but he could move only by inch the man come rapidly nearer kazan catch the glisten of the rifle in he hand he hear he hollow cough and the tread of he foot in the snow gray wolf crouch shoulder to shoulder with he tremble and show she tooth when pierre have approach within fifty foot of they she slink back into the deeper shadow of the spruce kazan 's fang be bare menacingly when pierre stop and look down at he with a effort he drag himself to he foot but fall back into the snow again the man lean he rifle against a sapling and bent over he fearlessly with a fierce growl kazan snap at he extended hand to he surprise the man do not pick up a stick or a club he hold out he hand again -- cautiously -- and speak in a voice new to kazan the dog snap again and growl the man persist talk to he all the time and once he mittened hand touch kazan 's head and escape before the jaw could reach it again and again the man reach out he hand and three time kazan feel the touch of it and there be neither threat nor hurt in it at last pierre turn away and go back over the trail when he be out of sight and hearing kazan whine and the crest along he spine flatten he look wistfully toward the glow of the fire the man have not hurt he and the three-quarter of he that be dog want to follow gray wolf come back and stand with stiffly plant forefoot at he side she have never be this near to man before except when the pack have overtake the sledge out on the plain she could not understand every instinct that be in she warn she that he be the most dangerous of all thing more to be fear than the strongest beast the storm the flood cold and starvation and yet this man have not harm she mate she sniff at kazan 's back and head where the mittened hand have touch then she trot back into the darkness again for beyond the edge of the forest she once more see move life the man be return and with he be the girl she voice be soft and sweet and there be about she the breath and sweetness of woman the man stand prepared but not threaten be careful joan he warn she drop on she knee in the snow just out of reach come boy -- come she say gently she hold out she hand kazan 's muscle twitch he move a inch -- two

shaggy neck as she hold one end of the blanket they lay he down close to the fire and after a little it be the man again who bring warm water and wash away the blood from the torn leg and then put something on it that be soft and warm and soothing and finally bind a cloth about it all this be strange and new to kazan pierre 's hand as well as the girl 's stroke he head it be the man who bring he a gruel of meal and tallow and urge he to eat while joan sit with she chin in she two hand look at the dog and talk to he after this when he be quite comfortable and no longer afraid he hear a strange small cry from the furry bundle on the sledge that bring he head up with a jerk joan see the movement and hear the low answering whimper in he throat she turn quickly to the bundle talking and coo to it as she take it in she arm and then she pull back the bearskin so that kazan could see he have never see a baby before and joan hold it out before he so that he could look straight at it and see what a wonderful creature it be its little pink face stare steadily at kazan its tiny fist reach out and it make queer little sound at he and then suddenly it kick and scream with delight and laugh at those sound kazan 's whole body relax and he drag himself to the girl 's foot see he like the baby she cry _ mon pre _ we must give he a name what shall it be wait till morning for that reply the father it be late joan go into the tent and sleep we have no dog now and will travel slowly so we must start early with she hand on the tent-flap joan turn he come with the wolf she say let we

toward she he know it already she cry good night _ mon pre _ for a long time after she have go into the tent old pierre radisson sit on the edge of the sledge face the fire with kazan at he foot suddenly the silence be break again by gray wolf 's lonely howl deep in the forest kazan lift he head and whine she be call for you boy say pierre understandingly he cough and clutch a hand to he breast where the pain seem rend he frost-bitten lung he say speak straight at kazan get it early in the winter up at fond du lac hope we 'll get home -- in time -- with the kid in the loneliness and emptiness of the big northern wilderness one fall into the habit of talk to one 's self but kazan 's head be alert and he eye watchful so pierre speak to he we have get to get they home and there be only you and I to do it he say twist he beard suddenly he clench he fist he hollow rack cough convulse he again home he pant clutch he chest it be eighty mile straight north -- to the churchill -- and i pray to god we 'll get there -- with the kid -- before my lung give out he rise to he foot and stagger a little as he walk there be a collar about kazan 's neck and he chained he to the sledge after that he drag three or four small log upon the fire and go quietly into the tent where joan and the baby be already asleep several time that night kazan hear the distant voice of gray wolf call for he but something tell he that he must not answer it now toward dawn gray wolf come close in to the camp and for the first time kazan reply to she he howl awaken the man he come out of the tent peer for a few moment up at the sky build up the fire and begin to prepare breakfast he pat kazan on the head and give he a chunk of meat joan come out a few moment later leave the baby asleep in the tent she run up and kiss pierre and then drop down on she knee beside kazan and talk to he almost as he have hear she talk to the baby when she jump up to help she father kazan follow she and when joan see he stand firmly upon he leg she give a cry of pleasure it be a strange journey that begin into the north that day pierre radisson empty the sledge of everything but the tent blanket food and the furry nest for baby joan then he harness himself in the trace and drag the sledge over the snow he cough incessantly it be a cough i have have half the winter lie pierre careful that joan see no sign of blood on he lip or beard i 'll keep in the cabin for a week when we get home even kazan with that strange beast knowledge which man unable to explain call instinct know that what he say be not the truth perhaps it be largely because he have hear other man cough like this and that for generation he sledge-dog ancestor have hear man cough as radisson cough -- and have learn what follow it more than once he have scented death in tepee and cabin which he have not enter and more than once he have sniff at the mystery of death that be not quite present but near -- just as he have catch at a distance the subtle warning of storm and of fire and that strange thing seem to be very near to he now as he follow at the end of he chain behind the sledge it make he restless and half a dozen time when the sledge stop he sniff at the bit of humanity bury in the bearskin each time that he do this joan be quickly at he side and twice she pat he scar and grizzled head until every drop of blood in he body leap riotously with a joy which he body do not reveal this day the chief thing that he come to understand be that the little creature on the sledge be very precious to the girl who stroke he head and talk to he and that it be very helpless he learn too that joan be most delighted and that she voice be softer and thrill he more deeply when he pay attention to that little warm living thing in the bearskin for a long time after they make camp pierre radisson sit beside the fire to-night he do not smoke he stare straight into the flame when at last he rise to go into the tent with the girl and the baby he bent over kazan and examine he hurt you have get to work in the trace to-morrow boy he say we must make the river by to-morrow night if we do not -- he do not finish he be choke back one of those tear cough when the tent-flap drop behind he kazan lay stiff and alert he eye fill with a strange anxiety he do not like to see radisson enter the tent for stronger than ever there hang that oppressive mystery in the air about he and it seem to be a part of pierre three time that night he hear faithful gray wolf call for he deep in the forest and each time he answer she toward dawn she come in close to camp once he catch the scent of she when she circle around in the wind and he tug and whine at the end of he chain hope that she would come in and lie down at he side but no sooner have radisson move in the tent than gray wolf be go the man 's face be thinner and he eye be redder this morning he cough be not so loud or so rend it be like a wheeze as if something have give way inside and before the girl come out he clutch he hand often at he throat joan 's face whiten when she see he anxiety give way to fear in she eye pierre radisson laugh when she fling she arm about he and cough to prove that what he say be true you see the cough be not so bad my joan he say it be break up you can not have forget _ ma cheri _ it always leave one red-eyed and weak it be a cold bleak dark day that follow and through it kazan and the man tug at the fore of the sledge with joan follow in the trail behind kazan 's wound no longer hurt he he pull steadily with all he splendid strength and the man never lash he once but pat he with he mittened hand on head and back the day grow steadily darker and in the top of the tree there be the low moaning of a storm darkness and the come of the storm do not drive pierre radisson into camp we must reach the river he say to himself over and over again we must reach the river -- we must reach the river -- and he steadily urge kazan on to greater effort while he own strength at the end of the trace grow less it have begin to storm when pierre stop to build a fire at noon the snow fall straight down in a white deluge so thick that it hide the tree trunk fifty yard away pierre laugh when joan shiver and snuggle close up to he with the baby in she arm he wait only a hour and then fasten kazan in the trace again and buckle the strap once more about he own waist in the silent gloom that be almost night pierre carry he compass in he hand and at last late in the afternoon they come to a break in the timber-line and ahead of they lay a plain across which radisson point a exultant hand there be the river joan he say he voice faint and husky we can camp here now and wait for the storm to pass under a thick clump of spruce he put up the tent and then begin gather fire-wood joan help he as soon as they have boil coffee and eat a supper of meat and toast biscuit joan go into the tent and drop exhaust on she thick bed of balsam bough wrap herself and the baby up close in the skin and blanket to-night she have no word for kazan and pierre be glad that she be too tired to sit beside the fire and talk and yet -- kazan 's alert eye see pierre start suddenly he rise from he seat on the sledge and go to the tent he draw back the flap and thrust in he head and shoulder asleep joan he ask almost father will not you please come -- soon after i smoke he say be you comfortable yes i be so tired -- and -- sleepy -- pierre laugh softly in the darkness he be grip at he throat we be almost home joan that be we river out there -- the little beaver if i should run away and leave you to-night you could follow it right to we cabin it be only forty mile do you hear yes -- i know -- forty mile -- straight down the river you could not lose yourself joan only you would have to be careful of air-hole in the ice will not you come to bed father you be tire -- and almost sick yes -- after i smoke he repeat joan will you keep remind I to-morrow of the air-hole i might forget you can always tell they for the snow and the crust over they be whiter than that on the rest of the ice and like a sponge will you remember -- the airhole -- yes-s-s-s -- pierre drop the tent-flap and return to the fire he stagger as he walk good night boy he say guess i would better go in with the kid two day more -- forty mile -- two day -- kazan watch he as he enter the tent he lay he weight against the end of he chain until the collar shut off he wind he leg and back twitch in that tent where radisson have go be joan and the baby he know that pierre would not hurt they but he know also that with pierre radisson something terrible and impending be hover very near to they he want the man outside -- by the fire -- where he could lie still and watch he in the tent there be silence nearer to he than before come gray wolf 's cry each night she be call earlier and come closer to the camp he want she very near to he to-night but he do not even whine in response he dare not break that strange silence in the tent he lay still for a long time tired and lame from the day 's journey but sleepless the fire burn lower the wind in the tree-top die away and the thick gray cloud roll like a massive curtain from under the sky the star begin to glow white and metallic and from far in the north there come faintly a crisp moan sound like steel sleigh-runner run over frosty snow -- the mysterious monotone of the northern light after that it grow steadily and swiftly colder to-night gray wolf do not compass herself by the direction of the wind she follow like a sneak shadow over the trail pierre radisson have make and when kazan hear she again long after midnight he lay with he head erect and he body rigid save for a curious twitching of he muscle there be a new note in gray wolf 's voice a wail note in which there be more than the mate-call it be the message and at the sound of it kazan rise from out of he silence and he fear and with he head turn straight up to the sky he howl as the wild dog of the north howl before the tepee of master who be newly dead pierre radisson be dead chapter vii out of the blizzard it be dawn when the baby snuggle close to joan 's warm breast and awaken she with its cry of hunger she open she eye brush back the thick hair from she face and could see where the shadowy form of she father be lie at the other side of the tent he be very quiet and she be please that he be still sleep she know that the day before he have be very near to exhaustion and so for half a hour longer she lay quiet coo softly to the baby joan then she arise cautiously tuck the baby in the warm blanket and fur put on she heavier garment and go outside by this time it be broad day and she breathe a sigh of relief when she see that the storm have pass it be bitterly cold it seem to she that she have never know it to be so cold in all she life the fire be completely out kazan be huddle in a round ball he nose tuck under he body he raise he head shiver as joan come out with she heavily moccasined foot joan scatter the ash and char stick where the fire have be there be not a spark leave in return to the tent she stop for a moment beside kazan and pat he shaggy head poor wolf she say i wish i have give you one of the bearskin she throw back the tent-flap and enter for the first time she see she father 's face in the light -- and outside kazan hear the terrible moaning cry that break from she lip no one could have look at pierre radisson 's face once -- and not have understand after that one agonizing cry joan fling herself upon she father 's breast sob so softly that even kazan 's sharp ear hear no sound she remain there in she grief until every vital energy of womanhood and motherhood in she girlish body be rouse to action by the wail cry of baby joan then she spring to she foot and run out through the tent opening kazan tug at the end of he chain to meet she but she see nothing of he now the terror of the wilderness be greater than that of death and in a instant it have fall upon joan it be not because of fear for herself it be the baby the wail cry from the tent pierce she like knife-thrust and then all at once there come to she what old pierre have say the night before -- he word about the river the air-hole the home forty mile away _ you could not lose yourself joan _ he have guess what might happen she bundle the baby deep in the fur and return to the fire-bed she one thought now be that they must have fire she make a little pile of birch-bark cover it with half-burned bit of wood and go into the tent for the match pierre radisson carry they in a water-proof box in a pocket of he bearskin coat she sob as she kneel beside he again and obtain the box as the fire flare up she add other bit of wood and then some of the larger piece that pierre have drag into camp the fire give she courage forty mile -- and the river lead to they home she must make that with the baby and wolf for the first time she turn to he and speak he name as she put she hand on he head after that she give he a chunk of meat which she thaw out over the fire and melt the snow for tea she be not hungry but she recall how she father have make she eat four or five time a day so she force herself to make a breakfast of a biscuit a shred of meat and as much hot tea as she could drink the terrible hour she dread follow that she wrap blanket closely about she father 's body and tie they with babiche cord after that she pile all the fur and blanket that remain on the sledge close to the fire and snuggle baby joan deep down in they pull down the tent be a task the rope be stiff and frozen and when she have finish one of she hand be bleed she pile the tent on the sledge and then half cover she face turn and look back pierre radisson lay on he balsam bed with nothing over he now but the gray sky and the spruce-tops kazan stand stiff-legged and sniff the air he spine bristle when joan go back slowly and kneel beside the blanket-wrapped object when she return to he she face be white and tense and now there be a strange and terrible look in she eye as she stare out across the barren she put he in the trace and fasten about she slender waist the strap that pierre have use thus they strike out for the river flounder knee-deep in the freshly fall and drift snow half-way joan stumble in a drift and fall she loose hair fly in a shimmering veil over the snow with a mighty pull kazan be at she side and he cold muzzle touch she face as she draw herself to she foot for a moment joan take he shaggy head between she two hand wolf she moan oh wolf she go on she breath come pantingly now even from she brief exertion the snow be not so deep on the ice of the river but a wind be rise it come from the north and east straight in she face and joan bow she head as she pull with kazan half a mile down the river she stop and no longer could she repress the hopelessness that rise to she lip in a sob choke cry forty mile she clutch she hand at she breast and stand breathing like one who have be beat she back to the wind the baby be quiet joan go back and peer down under the fur and what she see there spur she on again almost fiercely twice she stumble to she knee in the drift during the next quarter of a mile after that there be a stretch of wind-swept ice and kazan pull the sledge alone joan walk at he side there be a pain in she chest a thousand needle seem prick she face and suddenly she remember the thermometer she expose it for a time on the top of the tent when she look at it a few minute later it be thirty degree below zero forty mile and she father have tell she that she could make it -- and could not lose herself but she do not know that even she father would have be afraid to face the north that day with the temperature at thirty below and a moan wind bring the first warning of a blizzard the timber be far behind she now ahead there be nothing but the pitiless barren and the timber beyond that be hide by the gray gloom of the day if there have be tree joan 's heart would not have choke so with terror but there be nothing -- nothing but that gray ghostly gloom with the rim of the sky touch the earth a mile away the snow grow heavy under she foot again always she be watch for those treacherous frost-coated trap in the ice she father have speak of but she find now that all the ice and snow look alike to she and that there be a grow pain back of she eye it be the intense cold the river widen into a small lake and here the wind strike she in the face with such force that she weight be take from the strap and kazan drag the sledge alone a few inch of snow impede she as much as a foot have do before little by little she drop back kazan forge to she side every ounce of he magnificent strength in the trace by the time they be on the river channel again joan be at the back of the sledge follow in the trail make by kazan she be powerless to help he she feel more and more the leaden weight of she leg there be but one hope -- and that be the forest if they do not reach it soon within half a hour she would be able to go no farther over and over again she moan a prayer for she baby as she struggle on she fall in the snow-drifts kazan and the sledge become only a dark blotch to she and then all at once she see that they be leave she they be not more than twenty foot ahead of she -- but the blotch seem to be a vast distance away every bit of life and strength in she body be now bent upon reach the sledge -- and baby joan it seem a interminable time before she gain with the sledge only six foot ahead of she she struggle for what seem to she to be a hour before she could reach out and touch it with a moan she fling herself forward and fall upon it she no longer hear the wail of the storm she no longer feel discomfort with she face in the fur under which baby joan be bury there come to she with swiftness and joy a vision of warmth and home and then the vision fade away and be follow by deep night kazan stop in the trail he come back then and sit down upon he haunch beside she wait for she to move and speak but she be very still he thrust he nose into she loose hair a whine rise in he throat and suddenly he raise he head and sniff in the face of the wind something come to he with that wind he muzzle joan again hut she do not stir then he go forward and stand in he trace ready for the pull and look hack at she still she do not move or speak and kazan 's whine give place to a sharp excited bark the strange thing in the wind come to he stronger for a moment he begin to pull the sledge-runner have freeze to the snow and it take every ounce of he strength to free they twice during the next five minute he stop and sniff the air the third time that he halt in a drift of snow he return to joan 's side again and whine to awaken she then he tug again at the end of he trace and foot by foot he drag the sledge through the drift beyond the drift there be a stretch of clear ice and here kazan rest during a lull in the wind the scent come to he stronger than before at the end of the clear ice be a narrow break in the shore where a creek run into the main stream if joan have be conscious she would have urge he straight ahead but kazan turn into the break and for ten minute he struggle through the snow without a rest whine more and more frequently until at last the whine break into a joyous bark ahead of he close to the creek be a small cabin smoke be rise out of the chimney it be the scent of smoke that have come to he in the wind a hard level slope reach to the cabin door and with the last strength that be in he kazan drag he burden up that then he settle himself back beside joan lift he shaggy head to the dark sky and howl a moment later the door open a man come out kazan 's reddened snow-shot eye follow he watchfully as he run to the sledge he hear he startled exclamation as he bent over joan in another lull of the wind there come from out of the mass of fur on the sledge the wail half-smothered voice of baby joan a deep sigh of relief heave up from kazan 's chest he be exhaust he strength be go he foot be tear and bleeding but the voice of baby joan fill he with a strange happiness and he lay down in he trace while the man carry joan and the baby into the life and warmth of the cabin a few minute later the man reappear he be not old like pierre radisson he come close to kazan and look down at he my god he say and you do that -- _ alone _ he bent down fearlessly unfasten he from the trace and lead he toward the cabin door kazan hesitate but once -- almost on the threshold he turn he head swift and alert from out of the moaning and wail of the storm it seem to he that for a moment he have hear the voice of gray wolf then the cabin door close behind he back in a shadowy corner of the cabin he lay while the man prepare something over a hot stove for joan it be a long time before joan rise from the cot on which the man have place she after that kazan hear she sobbing and then the man make she eat and for a time they talk then the stranger hang up a big blanket in front of the bunk and sit down close to the stove quietly kazan slip along the wall and creep under the bunk for a long time he could hear the sob breath of the girl then all be still the next morning he slip out through the door when the man open it and speed swiftly into the forest half a mile away he find the trail of gray wolf and call to she from the frozen river come she reply and he go to she vainly gray wolf try to lure he back into they old haunt -- away from the cabin and the scent of man late that morning the man harness he dog and from the fringe of the forest kazan see he tuck joan and the baby among the fur on the sledge as old pierre have do all that day he follow in the trail of the team with gray wolf slink behind he they travel until dark and then under the star and the moon that have follow the storm the man still urge on he team it be deep in the night when they come to another cabin and the man beat upon the door a light the opening of the door the joyous welcome of a man 's voice joan 's sob cry -- kazan hear these from the shadow in which he be hide and then slip back to gray wolf in the day and week that follow joan 's home-coming the lure of the cabin and of the woman 's hand hold kazan as he have tolerate pierre so now he tolerate the younger man who live with joan and the baby he know that the man be very dear to joan and that the baby be very dear to he as it be to the girl it be not until the third day that joan succeed in coax he into the cabin -- and that be the day on which the man return with the dead and frozen body of pierre it be joan 's husband who first find the name on the collar he wear and they begin call he kazan half a mile away at the summit of a huge mass of rock which the indian call the sun rock he and gray wolf have find a home and from here they go down to they hunt on the plain and often the girl 's voice reach up to they call _ kazan kazan kazan _ through all the long winter kazan hover thus between the lure of joan and the cabin -- and gray wolf then come spring -- and the great change chapter viii the great change the rock the ridge and the valley be take on a warmer glow the poplar bud be ready to burst the scent of balsam and of spruce grow heavier in the air each day and all through the wilderness in plain and forest there be the ripple murmur of the spring flood find they way to hudson 's bay in that great bay there be the rumble and crash of the ice field thunder down in the early break-up through the roe welcome -- the doorway to the arctic and for that reason there still come with the April wind a occasional sharp breath of winter kazan have sheltered himself against that wind not a breath of air stir in the sunny spot the wolf-dog have choose for himself he be more comfortable than he have be at any time during the six month of terrible winter -- and as he sleep he dream gray wolf he wild mate lay near he flat on she belly she forepaw reach out she eye and nostril as keen and alert as the smell of man could make they for there be that smell of man as well as of balsam and spruce in the warm spring air she gaze anxiously and sometimes steadily at kazan as he sleep she own gray spine stiffen when she see the tawny hair along kazan 's back bristle at some dream vision she whine softly as he upper lip snarl back show he long white fang but for the most part kazan lay quiet save for the muscular twitching of leg shoulder and muzzle which always tell when a dog be dream and as he dream there come to the door of the cabin out on the plain a blue-eyed girl-woman with a big brown braid over she shoulder who call through the cup of she hand kazan kazan kazan the voice reach faintly to the top of the sun rock and gray wolf flatten she ear kazan stir and in another instant he be awake and on he foot he leap to a outcropping ledge sniff the air and look far out over the plain that lay below they over the plain the woman 's voice come to they again and kazan run to the edge of the rock and whine gray wolf step softly to he side and lay she muzzle on he shoulder she have grow to know what the voice mean day and night she fear it more than she fear the scent or sound of man since she have give up the pack and she old life for kazan the voice have become gray wolf 's greatest enemy and she hate it it take kazan from she and wherever it go kazan follow night after night it rob she of she mate and leave she to wander alone under the star and the moon keep faithfully to she loneliness and never once respond with she own tongue to the hunt-call of she wild brother and sister in the forest and out on the plain usually she would snarl at the voice and sometimes nip kazan lightly to show she displeasure but to-day as the voice come a third time she slink back into the darkness of a fissure between two rock and kazan see only the fiery glow of she eye kazan run nervously to the trail they foot have wear up to the top of the sun rock and stand undecided all day and yesterday he have be uneasy and disturbed whatever it be that stir he seem to be in the air for he could not see it or hear it or scent it but he could _ feel _ it he go to the fissure and sniff at gray wolf usually she whine coaxingly but she response to-day be to draw back she lip until he could see she white fang a fourth tune the voice come to they faintly and she snap fiercely at some unseen thing in the darkness between the two rock kazan go again to the trail still hesitate then he begin to go down it be a narrow wind trail wear only by the pad and claw of animal for the sun rock be a huge crag that rise almost sheer up for a hundred foot above the top of the spruce and balsam its bald crest catch the first gleam of the sun in the morning and the last glow of it in the evening gray wolf have first lead kazan to the security of the retreat at the top of the rock when he reach the bottom he no longer hesitate but dart swiftly in the direction of the cabin because of that instinct of the wild that be still in he he always approach the cabin with caution he never give warning and for a moment joan be startle when she look up from she baby and see kazan 's shaggy head and shoulder in the open door the baby struggle and kick in she delight and hold out she two hand with coo cry to kazan joan too hold out a hand kazan she cry softly come in kazan slowly the wild red light in kazan 's eye soften he put a forefoot on the sill and stand there while the girl urge he again suddenly he leg seem to sink a little under he he tail droop and he slink in with that doggish air of have commit a crime the creature he love be in the cabin but the cabin itself he hate he hate all cabin for they all breathe of the club and the whip and bondage like all sledge-dog he prefer the open snow for a bed and the spruce-top for shelter joan drop she hand to he head and at its touch there thrill through he that strange joy that be he reward for leave gray wolf and the wild slowly he raise he head until he black muzzle rest on she lap and he close he eye while that wonderful little creature that mystify he so -- the baby -- prod he with she tiny foot and pull he tawny hair he love these baby-mauling even more than the touch of joan 's hand motionless sphinx-like undemonstrative in every muscle of he body kazan stand scarcely breathe more than once this lack of demonstration have urge joan 's husband to warn she but the wolf that be in kazan he wild aloofness even he mating with gray wolf have make she love he more she understand and have faith in he in the day of the last snow kazan have prove himself a neighbor trapper have run over with he team and the baby joan have toddle up to one of the big husky there be a fierce snap of jaw a scream of horror from joan a shout from the man as they leap toward the pack but kazan be ahead of they all in a gray streak that travel with the speed of a bullet he be at the big husky 's throat when they pull he off the husky be dead joan thought of that now as the baby kick and tousle kazan 's head good old kazan she cry softly put she face down close to he we be glad you come kazan for we be go to be alone to-night -- baby and i daddy 's go to the post and you must care for we while he be away she tickle he nose with the end of she long shine braid this always delighted the baby for in spite of he stoicism kazan have to sniff and sometimes to sneeze and twig he ear and it please he too he love the sweet scent of joan 's hair and you would fight for we if you have to would not you she go on then she rise quietly i must close the door she say i do not want you to go away again to-day kazan you must stay with we kazan go off to he corner and lay down just as there have be some strange thing at the top of the sun rock to disturb he that day so now there be a mystery that disturb he in the cabin he sniff the air try to fathom its secret whatever it be it seem to make he mistress different too and she be digging out all sort of odds and end of thing about the cabin and do they up in package late that night before she go to bed joan come and snuggle she hand close down beside he for a few moment we be go away she whisper and there be a curious tremble that be almost a sob in she voice we be go home kazan we be go away down where he people live -- where they have church and city and music and all the beautiful thing in the world and we be go to take _ you _ kazan kazan do not understand but he be happy at have the woman so near to he and talk to he at these time he forget gray wolf the dog that be in he surge over he quarter-strain of wildness and the woman and the baby alone fill he world but after joan have go to she bed and all be quiet in the cabin he old uneasiness return he rise to he foot and move stealthily about the cabin sniff at the wall the door and the thing he mistress have do into package a low whine rise in he throat joan half asleep hear it and murmur : be quiet kazan go to sleep -- go to sleep -- long after that kazan stand rigid in the center of the room listen tremble and faintly he hear far away the wail cry of gray wolf but to-night it be not the cry of loneliness it send a thrill through he he run to the door and whine but joan be deep in slumber and do not hear he once more he hear the cry and only once then the night grow still he crouch down near the door joan find he there still watchful still listen when she awake in the early morning she come to open the door for he and in a moment he be go he foot seem scarcely to touch the earth as he speed in the direction of the sun rock across the plain he could see the cap of it already paint with a golden glow he come to the narrow wind trail and worm he way up it swiftly gray wolf be not at the top to greet he but he could smell she and the scent of that other thing be strong in the air he muscle tighten he leg grow tense deep down in he chest there begin the low rumble of a growl he know now what that strange thing be that have haunt he and make he uneasy it be _ life _ something that live and breathe have invade the home which he and gray wolf have choose he bare he long fang and a snarl of defiance draw back he lip stiff-legged prepare to spring he neck and head reach out he approach the two rock between which gray wolf have creep the night before she be still there and with she be _ something else _ after a moment the tenseness leave kazan 's body he bristle crest droop until it lay flat he ear shoot forward and he put he head and shoulder between the two rock and whine softly and gray wolf whine slowly kazan back out and face the rise sun then he lay down so that he body shield i the entrance to the chamber between the rock gray wolf be a mother chapter ix the tragedy on sun rock all that day kazan guard the top of the sun rock fate and the fear and brutality of master have heretofore keep he from fatherhood and he be puzzle something tell he now that he belong to the sun rock and not to the cabin the call that come to he from over the plain be not so strong at dusk gray wolf come out from she retreat and slunk to he side whimpering and nip gently at he shaggy neck it be the old instinct of he father that make he respond by caress gray wolf 's face with he tongue then gray wolf 's jaw open and she laugh in short panting breath as if she have be hard run she be happy and as they hear a little snuffle sound from between the rock kazan wag he tail and gray wolf dart back to she young the babyish cry and its effect upon gray wolf teach kazan he first lesson in fatherhood instinct again tell he that gray wolf could not go down to the hunt with he now -- that she must stay at the top of the sun rock so when the moon rise he go down alone and toward dawn return with a big white rabbit between he jaw it be the wild in he that make he do this and gray wolf eat ravenously then he know that each night hereafter he must hunt for gray wolf -- and the little whimpering creature hide between the two rock the next day and still the next he do not go to the cabin though he hear the voice of both the man and the woman call he on the fifth he go down and joan and the baby be so glad that the woman hug he and the baby kick and laugh and scream at he while the man stand by cautiously watch they demonstration with a gleam of disapprobation in he eye i be afraid of he he tell joan for the hundredth time that be the wolf-gleam in he eye he be of a treacherous breed sometimes i wish we have never bring he home if we have not -- where would the baby -- have go joan remind he a little catch in she voice i have almost forget that say she husband kazan you old devil i guess i love you too he lay he hand caressingly on kazan 's head wonder how he 'll take to life down there he ask he have always be use to the forest it 'll seem mighty strange and so -- have i -- always be use to the forest whisper joan i guess that be why i love kazan -- next to you and the baby kazan -- dear old kazan this time kazan feel and scented more of that mysterious change in the cabin joan and she husband talk incessantly of they plan when they be together and when the man be away joan talk to the baby and to he and each time that he come down to the cabin during the week that follow he grow more and more restless until at last the man notice the change in he i believe he know he say to joan one evening i believe he know we be prepare to leave then he add : the river be rise again to-day it will be another week before we can start perhaps longer that same night the moon flood the top of the sun rock with a golden light and out into the glow of it come gray wolf with she three little whelp toddle behind she there be much about these soft little ball that tumble about he and snuggle in he tawny coat that remind kazan of the baby at time they make the same queer soft little sound and they stagger about on they four little leg just as helplessly as baby joan make she way about on two he do not fondle they as gray wolf do but the touch of they and they babyish whimpering fill he with a kind of pleasure that he have never experience before the moon be straight above they and the night be almost as bright as day when he go down again to hunt for gray wolf at the foot of the rock a big white rabbit pop up ahead of he and he give chase for half a mile he pursue until the wolf instinct in he rise over the dog and he give up the futile race a deer he might have overtake but small game the wolf must hunt as the fox hunt it and he begin to slip through the thicket slowly and as quietly as a shadow he be a mile from the sun rock when two quick leap put gray wolf 's supper between he jaw he trot back slowly drop the big seven-pound snow-shoe hare now and then to rest when he come to the narrow trail that lead to the top of the sun rock he stop in that trail be the warm scent of strange foot the rabbit fall from he jaw every hair in he body be suddenly electrify into life what he scented be not the scent of a rabbit a marten or a porcupine fang and claw have climb the path ahead of he and then come faintly to he from the top of the rock he hear sound which send he up with a terrible whining cry when he reach the summit he see in the white moonlight a scene that stop he for a single moment close to the edge of the sheer fall to the rock fifty foot below gray wolf be engage in a death-struggle with a huge gray lynx she be down -- and under and from she there come a sudden sharp terrible cry of pain kazan fly across the rock he attack be the swift silent assault of the wolf combine with the greater courage the fury and the strategy of the husky another husky would have die in that first attack but the lynx be not a dog or a wolf it be mow-lee the swift as the sarcee have name it -- the quickest creature in the wilderness kazan 's inch-long fang should have sink deep in its jugular but in a fractional part of a second the lynx have throw itself back like a huge soft ball and kazan 's tooth bury themselves in the flesh of its neck instead of the jugular and kazan be not now fight the fang of a wolf in the pack or of another husky he be fight claw -- claw that rip like twenty razor-edged knife and which even a jugular hold could not stop once he have fight a lynx in a trap and he have not forget the lesson the battle have teach he he fight to pull the lynx _ down _ instead of force it on its back as he would have do with another dog or a wolf he know that when on its back the fierce cat be most dangerous one rip of its powerful hindfeet could disembowel he behind he he hear gray wolf sobbing and cry and he know that she be terribly hurt he be fill with the rage and strength of two dog and he tooth meet through the flesh and hide of the cat 's throat but the big lynx escape death by half a inch it would take a fresh grip to reach the jugular and suddenly kazan make the deadly lunge there be a instant 's freedom for the lynx and in that moment it fling itself back and kazan grip at its throat -- _ on top _ the cat 's claw rip through he flesh cut open he side -- a little too high to kill another stroke and they would have cut to he vitals but they have struggle close to the edge of the rock wall and suddenly without a snarl or a cry they roll over it be fifty or sixty foot to the rock of the ledge below and even as they pitch over and over in the fall kazan 's tooth sink deeper they strike with terrific force kazan uppermost the shock send he half a dozen foot from he enemy he be up like a flash dizzy snarl on the defensive the lynx lay limp and motionless where it have fall kazan come nearer still prepared and sniff cautiously something tell he that the fight be over he turn and drag himself slowly along the ledge to the trail and return to gray wolf gray wolf be no longer in the moonlight close to the two rock lay the limp and lifeless little body of the three pup the lynx have tear they to piece with a whine of grief kazan approach the two boulder and thrust he head between they gray wolf be there cry to herself in that terrible sob way he go in and begin to lick she bleeding shoulder and head all the rest of that night she whimper with pain with dawn she drag herself out to the lifeless little body on the rock and then kazan see the terrible work of the lynx for gray wolf be blind -- not for a day or a night but blind for all time a gloom that no sun could break have become she shroud and perhaps again it be that instinct of animal creation which often be more wonderful than man 's reason that tell kazan what have happen for he know now that she be helpless -- more helpless than the little creature that have gambol in the moonlight a few hour before he remain close beside she all that day -lrb- illustration : kazan grip at its throat -rrb- vainly that day do joan call for kazan she voice rise to the sun rock and gray wolf 's head snuggle closer to kazan and kazan 's ear drop back and he lick she wound late in the afternoon kazan leave gray wolf long enough to run to the bottom of the trail and bring up the snow-shoe rabbit gray wolf muzzle the fur and flesh but would not eat still a little later kazan urge she to follow he to the trail he no longer want to stay at the top of the sun rock and he no longer want gray wolf to stay there step by step he draw she down the wind path away from she dead puppy she would move only when he be very near she -- so near that she could touch he scar flank with she nose they come at last to the point in the trail where they have to leap down a distance of three or four foot from the edge of a rock and here kazan see how utterly helpless gray wolf have become she whine and crouch twenty time before she dare make the spring and then she jump stiff-legged and fall in a heap at kazan 's foot after this kazan do not have to urge she so hard for the fall impinge on she the fact that she be safe only when she muzzle touch she mate 's flank she follow he obediently when they reach the plain trot with she foreshoulder to he hip kazan be head for a thicket in the creek bottom half a mile away and a dozen time in that short distance gray wolf stumble and fall and each time that she fall kazan learn a little more of the limitation of blindness once he spring off in pursuit of a rabbit but he have not take twenty leap when he stop and look back gray wolf have not move a inch she stand motionless sniff the air -- wait for he for a full minute kazan stand also wait then he return to she ever after this he return to the point where he have leave gray wolf know that he would find she there all that day they remain in the thicket in the afternoon he visit the cabin joan and she husband be there and both see at once kazan 's torn side and he lacerated head and shoulder pretty near a finish fight for he say the man after he have examine he it be either a lynx or a bear another wolf could not do that for half a hour joan work over he talk to he all the time and fondle he with she soft hand she bath he wound in warm water and then cover they with a healing salve and kazan be fill again with that old restful desire to remain with she always and never to go back into the forest for a hour she let he lie on the edge of she dress with he nose touch she foot while she work on baby thing then she rise to prepare supper and kazan get up -- a little wearily -- and go to the door gray wolf and the gloom of the night be call he and he answer that call with a slouch of he shoulder and a drooping head its old thrill be go he watch he chance and go out through the door the moon have rise when he rejoin gray wolf she greet he return with a low whine of joy and muzzle he with she blind face in she helplessness she look happier than kazan in all he strength from now on during the day that follow it be a last great fight between blind and faithful gray wolf and the woman if joan have know of what lay in the thicket if she could once have see the poor creature to whom kazan be now all life -- the sun the star the moon and food -- she would have help gray wolf but as it be she try to lure kazan more and more to the cabin and slowly she win at last the great day come eight day after the fight on the sun rock kazan have take gray wolf to a wooded point on the river two day before and there he have leave she the precede night when he go to the cabin this time a stout babiche thong be tie to the collar round he neck and he be fasten to a staple in the log wall joan and she husband be up before it be light next day the sun be just rise when they all go out the man carry the baby and joan lead he joan turn and lock the cabin door and kazan hear a sob in she throat as they follow the man down to the river the big canoe be pack and wait joan get in first with the baby then still hold the babiche thong she draw kazan up close to she so that he lay with he weight against she the sun fall warmly on kazan 's back as they shove off and he close he eye and rest he head on joan 's lap she hand fall softly on he shoulder he hear again that sound which the man could not hear the broken sob in she throat as the canoe move slowly down to the wooded point joan wave she hand back at the cabin just disappear behind the tree good-by she cry sadly good-by -- and then she bury she face close down to kazan and the baby and sob the man stop paddle you be not sorry -- joan he ask they be drift past the point now and the scent of gray wolf come to kazan 's nostril rouse he and bring a low whine from he throat you be not sorry -- we be go joan shake she head no she reply only i have -- always live here -- in the forest -- and they be -- home the point with its white finger of sand be behind they now and kazan be stand rigid face it the man call to he and joan lift she head she too see the point and suddenly the babiche leash slip from she finger and a strange light leap into she blue eye as she see what stand at the end of that white tip of sand it be gray wolf she blind eye be turn toward kazan at last gray wolf the faithful understand scent tell she what she eye could not see kazan and the man-smell be together and they be go -- go -- go -- look whisper joan the man turn gray wolf 's forefoot be in the water and now as the canoe drift farther and farther away she settle back on she haunch raise she head to the sun which she could not see and give she last long wail cry for kazan the canoe lurch a tawny body shoot through the air -- and kazan be go the man reach forward for he rifle joan 's hand stop he she face be white let he go back to she let he go -- let he go she cry it be he place -- with she and kazan reach the shore shake the water from he shaggy hair and look for the last time toward the woman the canoe be drift slowly around the first bend a moment more and it have disappear gray wolf have win chapter x the day of fire from the night of the terrible fight with the big gray lynx on the top of the sun rock kazan remember less and less vividly the old day when he have be a sledge-dog and the leader of a pack he would never quite forget they and always there would stand out certain memory from among the rest like fire cut the blackness of night but as man date event from he birth he marriage he freedom from a bondage or some foundation-step in he career so all thing seem to kazan to begin with two tragedy which have follow one fast upon the other after the birth of gray wolf 's pup the first be the fight on the sun rock when the big gray lynx have blind he beautiful wolf mate for all time and have tear she pup into piece he in turn have kill the lynx but gray wolf be still blind vengeance have not be able to give she sight she could no longer hunt with he as they have hunt with the wild wolf-pack out on the plain and in the dark forest so at thought of that night he always snarl and he lip curl back to reveal he inch-long fang the other tragedy be the going of joan she baby and she husband something more infallible than reason tell kazan that they would not come back brightest of all the picture that remain with he be that of the sunny morning when the woman and the baby he love and the man he endure because of they have go away in the canoe and often he would go to the point and gaze longingly down-stream where he have leap from the canoe to return to he blind mate so kazan 's life seem now to be make up chiefly of three thing : he hatred of everything that bear the scent or mark of the lynx he grieve for joan and the baby and gray wolf it be natural that the strongest passion in he should be he hatred of the lynx for not only gray wolf 's blindness and the death of the pup but even the loss of the woman and the baby he lay to that fatal struggle on the sun rock from that hour he become the deadliest enemy of the lynx tribe wherever he strike the scent of the big gray cat he be turn into a snarl demon and he hatred grow day by day as he become more completely a part of the wild he find that gray wolf be more necessary to he now than she have ever be since the day she have leave the wolf-pack for he he be three-quarter dog and the dog-part of he demand companionship there be only gray wolf to give he that now they be alone civilization be four hundred mile south of they the nearest hudson 's bay post be sixty mile to the west often in the day of the woman and the baby gray wolf have spend she night alone out in the forest wait and call for kazan now it be kazan who be lonely and uneasy when he be away from she side in she blindness gray wolf could no longer hunt with she mate but gradually a new code of understand grow up between they and through she blindness they learn many thing that they have not know before by early summer gray wolf could travel with kazan if he do not move too swiftly she run at he flank with she shoulder or muzzle touch he and kazan learn not to leap but to trot very quickly he find that he must choose the easiest trail for gray wolf 's foot when they come to a space to be bridge by a leap he would muzzle gray wolf and whine and she would stand with ear alert -- listen then kazan would take the leap and she understand the distance she have to cover she always over-leap which be a good fault in another way and one that be destine to serve they many time in the future she become of greater help than ever to kazan scent and hearing entirely take the place of sight each day develop these sens more and more and at the same time there develop between they the dumb language whereby she could impress upon kazan what she have discover by scent or sound it become a curious habit of kazan 's always to look at gray wolf when they stop to listen or to scent the air after the fight on the sun rock kazan have take he blind mate to a thick clump of spruce and balsam in the river-bottom where they remain until early summer every day for week kazan go to the cabin where joan and the baby -- and the man -- have be for a long time he go hopefully look each day or night to see some sign of life there but the door be never open the board and sapling at the window always remain never a spiral of smoke rise from the clay chimney grass and vine begin to grow in the path and fainter and fainter grow that scent which kazan could still find about it -- the scent of man of the woman the baby one day he find a little baby moccasin under one of the closed window it be old and worn out and blacken by snow and rain but he lay down beside it and remain there for a long time while the baby joan -- a thousand mile away -- be play with the strange toy of civilization then he return to gray wolf among the spruce and balsam the cabin be the one place to which gray wolf would not follow he at all other time she be at he side now that she have become accustomed to blindness she even accompany he on he hunt until he strike game and begin the chase then she would wait for he kazan usually hunt the big snow-shoe rabbit but one night he run down and kill a young doe the kill be too heavy to drag to gray wolf so he return to where she be wait for he and guide she to the feast in many way they become more and more inseparable as the summer lengthen until at last through all the wilderness they footprint be always two by two and never one by one then come the great fire gray wolf catch the scent of it when it be still two day to the west the sun that night go down in a lurid cloud the moon drift into the west become blood red when it drop behind the wilderness in this manner the indian call it the bleeding moon and the air be fill with omen all the next day gray wolf be nervous and toward noon kazan catch in the air the warning that she have sense many hour ahead of he steadily the scent grow stronger and by the middle of the afternoon the sun be veil by a film of smoke the flight of the wild thing from the triangle of forest between the junction of the pipestone and cree river would have begin then but the wind shift it be a fatal shift the fire be rage from the west and south then the wind sweep straight eastward carry the smoke with it and during this breathing spell all the wild creature in the triangle between the two river wait this give the fire time to sweep completely across the base of the forest triangle cut off the last trail of escape then the wind shift again and the fire sweep north the head of the triangle become a death-trap all through the night the southern sky be fill with a lurid glow and by morning the heat and smoke and ash be suffocate panic-striken kazan search vainly for a means of escape not for a instant do he leave gray wolf it would have be easy for he to swim across either of the two stream for he be three-quarter dog but at the first touch of water on she paw gray wolf draw back shrink like all she breed she would face fire and death before water kazan urge a dozen time he leap in and swim out into the stream but gray wolf would come no farther than she could wade they could hear the distant murmur roar of the fire now ahead of it come the wild thing moose caribou and deer plunge into the water of the stream and swam to the safety of the opposite side out upon a white finger of sand lumber a big black bear with two cub and even the cub take to the water and swam across easily kazan watch they and whine to gray wolf and then out upon that white finger of sand come other thing that dread the water as gray wolf dread it : a big fat porcupine a sleek little marten a fisher-cat that sniff the air and wail like a child those thing that could not or would not swim outnumber the other three to one hundred of little ermine scurry along the shore like rat they squeak little voice sound incessantly fox run swiftly along the bank seek a tree or a windfall that might bridge the water for they the lynx snarl and face the fire and gray wolf 's own tribe -- the wolf -- dare take no deeper step than she drip and pant and half choke by heat and smoke kazan come to gray wolf 's side there be but one refuge leave near they and that be the sand-bar it reach out for fifty foot into the stream quickly he lead he blind mate toward it as they come through the low bush to the river-bed something stop they both to they nostril have come the scent of a deadlier enemy than fire a lynx have take possession of the sand-bar and be crouch at the end of it three porcupine have drag themselves into the edge of the water and lay there like ball they quill alert and quiver a fisher-cat be snarl at the lynx and the lynx with ear lay back watch kazan and gray wolf as they begin the invasion of the sand-bar faithful gray wolf be full of fight and she spring shoulder to shoulder with kazan she fang bare with a angry snap kazan drive she back and she stand quiver and whine while he advance light-footed he pointed ear forward no menace or threat in he attitude he advance it be the deadly advance of the husky train in battle skilled in the art of kill a man from civilization would have say that the dog be approach the lynx with friendly intention but the lynx understand it be the old feud of many generation -- make deadlier now by kazan 's memory of that night at the top of the sun rock instinct tell the fisher-cat what be come and it crouch low and flat the porcupine scold like little child at the presence of enemy and the thicken cloud of smoke thrust they quill still more erect the lynx lay on its belly like a cat its hindquarter twitch and gather for the spring kazan 's foot seem scarcely to touch the sand as he circle lightly around it the lynx pivot as he circle and then it shoot in a round snarl ball over the eight foot of space that separate they kazan do not leap aside he make no effort to escape the attack but meet it fairly with the full force of he shoulder as sledge-dog meet sledge-dog he be ten pound heavier than the lynx and for a moment the big loose-jointed cat with its twenty knife-like claw be throw on its side like a flash kazan take advantage of the moment and drive for the back of the cat 's neck in that same moment blind gray wolf leap in with a snarling cry and fight under kazan 's belly she fasten she jaw in one of the cat 's hindleg the bone snap the lynx twice outweigh leap backward drag both kazan and gray wolf it fall back down on one of the porcupine and a hundred quill drive into its body another leap and it be free -- flee into the face of the smoke kazan do not pursue gray wolf come to he side and lick he neck where fresh blood be crimson he tawny hide the fisher-cat lay as if dead watch they with fierce little black eye the porcupine continue to chatter as if beg for mercy and then a thick black suffocating pall of smoke drive low over the sand-bar and with it come air that be furnace-hot at the uttermost end of the sand-bar kazan and gray wolf roll themselves into ball and thrust they head under they body the fire be very near now the roar of it be like that of a great cataract with now and then a louder crash of fall tree the air be fill with ash and burning spark and twice kazan draw forth he head to snap at blaze ember that fall upon and sear he like hot iron close along the edge of the stream grow thick green bush and when the fire reach this it burn more slowly and the heat grow less still it be a long time before kazan and gray wolf could draw forth they head and breathe more freely then they find that the finger of sand reach out into the river have save they everywhere in that triangle between the two river the world have turn black and be hot underfoot the smoke clear away the wind change again and swing down cool and fresh from the west and north the fisher-cat be the first to move cautiously back to the forest that have be but the porcupine be still roll into ball when gray wolf and kazan leave the sand-bar they begin to travel up-stream and before night come they foot be sore from hot ash and burn ember the moon be strange and foreboding that night like a spatter of blood in the sky and through the long silent hour there be not even the hoot of a owl to give a sign that life still exist where yesterday have be a paradise of wild thing kazan know that there be nothing to hunt and they continue to travel all that night with dawn they strike a narrow swamp along the edge of the stream here beaver have build a dam and they be able to cross over into the green country on the opposite side for another day and another night they travel westward and this bring they into the thick country of swamp and timber along the waterfound and as kazan and gray wolf come from the west there come from the hudson 's bay post to the east a slim dark-faced french half-breed by the name of henrus lotus the most famous lynx hunter in all the hudson 's bay country he be prospect for sign and he find they in abundance along the waterfound it be a game paradise and the snow-shoe rabbit abound in thousand as a consequence the lynx be thick and henrus build he trapping shack and then return to the post to wait until the first snow fall when he would come back with he team supplies and trap and up from the south at this same time there be slowly work he way by canoe and trail a young university zoologist who be gather material for a book on _ the reasoning of the wild _ he name be paul weyman and he have make arrangement to spend a part of the winter with henrus lotus the half-breed he bring with he plenty of paper a camera and the photograph of a girl he only weapon be a pocket-knife and meanwhile kazan and gray wolf find the home they be seek in a thick swamp five or six mile from the cabin that henri lotus have build chapter xi always two by two it be January when a guide from the post bring paul weyman to henrus lotus 's cabin on the waterfound he be a man of thirty-two or three full of the red-blooded life that make henrus like he at once if this have not be the case the first few day in the cabin might have be unpleasant for henrus be in bad humor he tell weyman about it they first night as they be smoke pipe alongside the redly glowing box stove it be damn strange say henrus i have lose seven lynx in the trap tear to piece like they be no more than rabbit that the fox have kill no thing -- not even bear -- have ever tackle lynx in a trap before it be the first time i ever see it and they be tear up so bad they be not worth one half dollar at the post seven -- that be over two hundred dollar i have lose there be two wolf who do it two -- i know it by the track -- always two -- a ' -- never one they follow my trap-line a ' eat the rabbit i catch they leave the fisher-cat a ' the mink a ' the ermine a ' the marten but the lynx -- _ sacr _ a ' damn -- they jump on he a ' pull the fur from he like you pull the wild cotton ball from the burn-bush i have try strychnine in deer fat a ' i have set trap and deadfall but i can not catch they they will drive I out unless i get they for i have take only five good lynx a ' they have destroy seven this rouse weyman he be one of that grow number of thoughtful man who believe that man 's egoism as a race blind he to many of the more wonderful fact of creation he have throw down the gantlet and with a logic that have gain he a nation-wide hearing to those who believe that man be the only living creature who could reason and that common sense and cleverness when display by any other breathing thing be merely instinct the fact behind henrus 's tale of woe strike he as important and until midnight they talk about the two strange wolf there be one big wolf a ' one smaller say henrus a ' it be always the big wolf who go in a ' fight the lynx i see that by the snow while he be fight the smaller wolf make many track in the snow just out of reach a ' then when the lynx be down or dead it jump in a ' help tear it into piece all that i know by the snow only once have i see where the smaller one go in a ' fight with the other a ' then there be blood all about that be not lynx blood i trail the devil a mile by the drip during the two week that follow weyman find much to add to the material of he book not a day pass that somewhere along henrus 's trap-line they do not see the trail of the two wolf and weyman observe that -- as henrus have tell he -- the footprint be always two by two and never one by one on the third day they come to a trap that have hold a lynx and at sight of what remain henrus curse in both french and english until he be purple in the face the lynx have be tear until its pelt be practically worthless weyman see where the smaller wolf have wait on its haunch while its companion have kill the lynx he do not tell henrus all he think but the day that follow convinced he more and more that he have find the most dramatic exemplification of he theory back of this mysterious tragedy of the trap-line there be a _ reason _ why do the two wolf not destroy the fisher-cat the ermine and the marten why be they feud with the lynx alone weyman be strangely thrill he be a lover of wild thing and for that reason he never carry a gun and when he see henrus place poison-bait for the two marauder he shudder and when day after day he see that these poison-bait be untouched he rejoice something in he own nature go out in sympathy to the heroic outlaw of the trap-line who never fail to give battle to the lynx night in the cabin he write down he thought and discovery of the day one night he turn suddenly on henrus henrus do not it ever make you sorry to kill so many wild thing he ask henri stare and shake he head i kill t ` ousand a ' t ` ousand he say i kill t ` ousand more and there be twenty thousand other just like you in this northern quarter of the continent -- all kill killing for hundred of year back and yet you can not kill out wild life the war of man and the beast you might call it and if you could return five hundred year from now henri you would still find wild life here nearly all the rest of the world be change but you can not change these almost impenetrable thousand of square mile of ridge and swamp and forest the railroad will not come here and i for one thank god for that take all the great prairie to the west for instance why the old buffalo trail be still there plain as day -- and yet town and city be grow up everywhere do you ever hear of north battleford be she near montreal or quebec henrus ask weyman smile and draw a photograph from he pocket it be the picture of a girl no it be far to the west in saskatchewan seven year ago i use to go up there every year to shoot prairie chicken coyote and elk there be not any north battleford then -- just the glorious prairie hundred and hundred of square mile of it there be a single shack on the saskatchewan river where north battleford now stand and i use to stay there in that shack there be a little girl twelve year old we use to go out hunting together -- for i use to kill thing in those day and the little girl would cry sometimes when i kill and i would laugh at she then a railroad come and then another and they join near the shack and all at once a town spring up seven year ago there be only the shack there henri two year ago there be eighteen hundred people this year when i come through there be five thousand and two year from now there 'll be ten thousand on the ground where that shack stand be three bank with a capital of forty million dollar you can see the glow of the electric light of the city twenty mile away it have a hundred-thousand dollar college a high school the provincial asylum a fire department two club a board of trade and it be go to have a street-car line within two year think of that -- all where the coyote howl a few year ago people be come in so fast that they can not keep a census five year from now there 'll be a city of twenty thousand where the old shack stand and the little girl in that shack henrus -- she be a young lady now and she people be -- well rich i do not care about that the chief thing be that she be go to marry I in the spring because of she i stop kill thing when she be only sixteen the last thing i kill be a prairie wolf and it have young eileen keep the little puppy she be get it now -- tame that be why above all other wild thing i love the wolf and i hope these two leave you trap-line safe henrus be stare at he weyman give he the picture it be of a sweet-faced girl with deep pure eye and there come a twitch at the corner of henrus 's mouth as he look at it my iowaka die t ` ree year ago he say she too love the wild thing but they wolf -- damn they drive I out if i can not kill they he put fresh fuel into the stove and prepare for bed one day the big idea come to henri weyman be with he when they strike fresh sign of lynx there be a great windfall ten or fifteen foot high and in one place the log have form a sort of cavern with almost solid wall on three side the snow be beat down by track and the fur of rabbit be scatter about henrus be jubilant we get heem -- sure he say he build the bait-house set a trap and look about he shrewdly then he explain he scheme to weyman if the lynx be catch and the two wolf come to destroy it the fight would take place in that shelter under the windfall and the marauder would have to pass through the opening so henri set five smaller trap conceal they skilfully under leaf and moss and snow and all be far enough away from the bait-house so that the trap lynx could not spring they in he struggle when they fight wolf jump this way a ' that -- a ' sure get in say henrus he miss one two t ` ree -- but he sure get in trap somewhere that same morning a light snow fall make the work more complete for it cover up all footprint and bury the telltale scent of man that night kazan and gray wolf pass within a hundred foot of the windfall and gray wolf 's keen scent detect something strange and disquieting in the air she inform kazan by press she shoulder against he and they swing off at right angle keep to windward of the trap-line for two day and three cold starlit night nothing happen at the windfall henrus understand and explain to weyman the lynx be a hunter like himself and also have its hunt-line which it cover about once a week on the fifth night the lynx return go to the windfall be lure straight to the bait and the sharp-toothed steel trap close relentlessly over its right hindfoot kazan and gray wolf be travel a quarter of a mile deeper in the forest when they hear the clanking of the steel chain as the lynx fight to free itself ten minute later they stand in the door of the windfall cavern it be a white clear night so fill with brilliant star that henri himself could have hunt by the light of they the lynx have exhaust itself and lay crouch on its belly as kazan and gray wolf appear as usual gray wolf hold back while kazan begin the battle in the first or second of these fight on the trap-line kazan would probably have be disembowel or have he jugular vein cut open have the fierce cat be free they be more than he match in open fight though the biggest of they fall ten pound under he weight chance have save he on the sun rock gray wolf and the porcupine have both add to the defeat of the lynx on the sand-bar and along henrus 's hunting line it be the trap that be he ally even with he enemy thus shackle he take big chance and he take bigger chance than ever with the lynx under the windfall the cat be a old warrior six or seven year old he claw be a inch and a quarter long and curve like simitar he forefoot and he left hindfoot be free and as kazan advance he draw back so that the trap-chain be slack under he body here kazan could not follow he old tactic of circle about he trapped foe until it have become tangled in the chain or have so shorten and twist it that there be no chance for a leap he have to attack face to face and suddenly he lunge in they meet shoulder to shoulder kazan 's fang snap at the other 's throat and miss before he could strike again the lynx fling out its free hindfoot and even gray wolf hear the rip sound that it make with a snarl kazan be fling back he shoulder tear to the bone then it be that one of henrus 's hidden trap save he from a second attack -- and death steel jaw snap over one of he forefoot and when he leap the chain stop he once or twice before blind gray wolf have leap in when she know that kazan be in great danger for a instant she forget she caution now and as she hear kazan 's snarl of pain she spring in under the windfall five trap henrus have hide in the space in front of the bait-house and gray wolf 's foot find two of these she fall on she side snap and snarl in he struggle kazan spring the remain two trap one of they miss the fifth and last catch he by a hindfoot this be a little past midnight from then until morning the earth and snow under the windfall be tear up by the struggle of the wolf the dog and the lynx to regain they freedom and when morning come all three be exhaust and lay on they side pant and with bleed jaw wait for the come of man -- and death henrus and weyman be out early when they strike off the main line toward the windfall henrus point to the track of kazan and gray wolf and he dark face light up with pleasure and excitement when they reach the shelter under the mass of fall timber both stand speechless for a moment astounded by what they see even henrus have see nothing like this before -- two wolf and a lynx all in trap and almost within reach of one another 's fang but surprise could not long delay the business of henrus 's hunter 's instinct the wolf lay first in he path and he be raise he rifle to put a steel-capped bullet through the base of kazan 's brain when weyman catch he eagerly by the arm weyman be stare he finger dig into henrus 's flesh he eye have catch a glimpse of the steel-studded collar about kazan 's neck wait he cry it be not a wolf it be a dog henrus lower he rifle stare at the collar weyman 's eye shoot to gray wolf she be face they snarl she white fang bare to the foe she could not see she blind eye be close where there should have be eye there be only hair and a exclamation break from weyman 's lip look he command of henrus what in the name of heaven -- one be dog -- wild dog that have run to the wolf say henrus and the other be -- wolf and _ blind _ gasp weyman _ ouus _ blind m ` sieur add henrus fall partly into french in he amazement he be raise he rifle again weyman seize it firmly -lrb- illustration : wait it be not a wolf -rrb- do not kill they henri he say give they to I -- alive figure up the value of the lynx they have destroy and add to that the wolf bounty and i will pay alive they be worth to I a great deal my god a dog -- and a blind wolf -- _ mate _ he still hold henri 's rifle and henrus be stare at he as if he do not yet quite understand weyman continue speak he eye and face blaze a dog -- and a blind wolf -- _ mate _ he repeat it be wonderful henrus down there they will say i have go beyond _ reason _ when my book come out but i shall have proof i shall take twenty photograph here before you kill the lynx i shall keep the dog and the wolf alive and i shall pay you henri a hundred dollar apiece for the two may i have they henri nod he hold he rifle in readiness while weyman unpack he camera and get to work snarl fang greet the click of the camera-shutter -- the fang of wolf and lynx but kazan lay cringe not through fear but because he still recognize the mastery of man and when he have finish with he picture weyman approach almost within reach of he and speak even more kindly to he than the man who have live back in the desert cabin henrus shoot the lynx and when kazan understand this he tear at the end of he trap-chain and snarl at the writhe body of he forest enemy by means of a pole and a babiche noose kazan be bring out from under the windfall and take to henrus 's cabin the two man then return with a thick sack and more babiche and blind gray wolf still fetter by the trap be make prisoner all the rest of that day weyman and henrus work to build a stout cage of sapling and when it be finish the two prisoner be place in it before the dog be put in with gray wolf weyman closely examine the worn and tooth-marked collar about he neck on the brass plate he find engrave the one word kazan and with a strange thrill make note of it in he diary after this weyman often remain at the cabin when henrus go out on the trap-line after the second day he dare to put he hand between the sapling bar and touch kazan and the next day kazan accept a piece of raw moose meat from he hand but at he approach gray wolf would always hide under the pile of balsam in the corner of they prison the instinct of generation and perhaps of century have teach she that man be she deadliest enemy and yet this man do not hurt she and kazan be not afraid of he she be frighten at first then puzzle and a grow curiosity follow that occasionally after the third day she would thrust she blind face out of the balsam and sniff the air when weyman be at the cage make friend with kazan but she would not eat weyman note that and each day he tempt she with the choicest morsel of deer and moose fat five day -- six -- seven pass and she have not take a mouthful weyman could count she rib she die henrus tell he on the seventh night she starve before she eat in that cage she want the forest the wild kill the fresh blood she two -- t ` ree year old -- too old to make civilize henrus go to bed at the usual hour but weyman be trouble and sit up late he write a long letter to the sweet-faced girl at north battleford and then he turn out the light and paint vision of she in the red glow of the fire he see she again for that first time when he camp in the little shack where the fifth city of saskatchewan now stand -- with she blue eye the big shine braid and the fresh glow of the prairie in she cheek she have hate he -- yes actually hate he because he love to kill he laugh softly as he think of that she have change he -- wonderfully he rise open the door softly and go out instinctively he eye turn westward the sky be a blaze of star in they light he could see the cage and he stand watch and listen a sound come to he it be gray wolf gnawing at the sapling bar of she prison a moment later there come a low sob whine and he know that it be kazan cry for he freedom lean against the side of the cabin be a ax weyman seize it and he lip smile silently he be thrill by a strange happiness and a thousand mile away in that city on the saskatchewan he could feel another spirit rejoice with he he move toward the cage a dozen blow and two of the sapling bar be knock out then weyman draw back gray wolf find the opening first and she slip out into the starlight like a shadow but she do not flee out in the open space she wait for kazan and for a moment the two stand there look at the cabin then they set off into freedom gray wolf 's shoulder at kazan 's flank weyman breathe deeply two by two -- always two by two until death find one of they he whisper chapter xii the red death kazan and gray wolf wander northward into the fond du lac country and be there when jacque a hudson bay company 's runner come up to the post from the south with the first authentic news of the dread plague -- the smallpox for week there have be rumor on all side and rumor grow into rumor from the east the south and the west they multiply until on all side the paul revere of the wilderness be carry word that _ la mort rouge _ -- the red death -- be at they heel and the chill of a great fear sweep like a shiver wind from the edge of civilization to the bay nineteen year before these same rumor have come up from the south and the red terror have follow the horror of it still remain with the forest people for a thousand unmarked grave shun like a pestilence and scatter from the lower water of jame bay to the lake country of the athabasca give evidence of the toll it demand now and then in they wanderings kazan and gray wolf have come upon the little mound that cover the dead instinct -- something that be infinitely beyond the comprehension of man -- make they _ feel _ the presence of death about they perhaps smell it in the air gray wolf 's wild blood and she blindness give she a immense advantage over kazan when it come to detect those mystery of the air and the earth which the eye be not make to see each day that have follow that terrible moonlit night on the sun rock when the lynx have blind she have add to the infallibility of she two chief sens -- hearing and scent and it be she who discover the presence of the plague first just as she have scented the great forest fire hour before kazan have find it in the air kazan have lure she back to a trap-line the trail they find be old it have not be travel for many day in a trap they find a rabbit but it have be dead a long time in another there be the carcass of a fox tear into bit by the owl most of the trap be spring other be cover with snow kazan with he three-quarter strain of dog run over the trail from trap to trap intent only on something alive -- meat to devour gray wolf in she blindness scented _ death _ it shiver in the tree-top above she she find it in every trap-house they come to -- death -- _ man death _ it grow stronger and stronger and she whine and nip kazan 's flank and kazan go on gray wolf follow he to the edge of the clearing in which lotus 's cabin stand and then she sit back on she haunch raise she blind face to the gray sky and give a long and wail cry in that moment the bristle begin to stand up along kazan 's spine once long ago he have howl before the tepee of a master who be newly dead and he settle back on he haunch and give the death-cry with gray wolf he too scented it now death be in the cabin and over the cabin there stand a sapling pole and at the end of the pole there flutter a strip of red cotton rag -- the warning flag of the plague from athabasca to the bay this man like a hundred other hero of the north have run up the warning before he lay himself down to die and that same night in the cold light of the moon kazan and gray wolf swing northward into the country of the fond du lac there precede they a messenger from the post on reindeer lake who be pass up the warning that have come from nelson house and the country to the southeast there be smallpox on the nelson the messenger inform william at fond du lac and it have strike the cree on wollaston lake god only know what it be do to the bay indian but we hear it be wipe out the chippewa between the albany and the churchill he leave the same day with he winded dog i be off to carry word to the reveillon people to the west he explain three day later word come from churchill that all of the company 's servant and he majesty 's subject west of the bay should prepare themselves for the come of the red terror william ' thin face turn as white as the paper he hold as he read the word of the churchill factor it mean dig grave he say that be the only preparation we can make he read the paper aloud to the man at fond du lac and every available man be detail to spread the warning throughout the post 's territory there be a quick harnessing of dog and on each sledge that go out be a roll of red cotton cloth -- roll that be ominous of death lurid signal of pestilence and horror whose touch send shudder chill through the man who be about to scatter they among the forest people kazan and gray wolf strike the trail of one of these sledge on the gray beaver and follow it for half a mile the next day farther to the west they strike another and on the fourth day still a third the last trail be fresh and gray wolf draw back from it as if sting she fang snarl on the wind there come to they the pungent odor of smoke they cut at right angle to the trail gray wolf leap clear of the mark in the snow and climb to the cap of a ridge to windward of they and down in the plain a cabin be burn a team of husky and a man be disappear in the spruce forest deep down in he throat kazan give a rumble whine gray wolf stand as rigid as a rock in the cabin a plague-dead man be burn it be the law of the north and the mystery of the funeral pyre come again to kazan and gray wolf this time they do not howl but slink down into the farther plain and do not stop that day until they have bury themselves deep in a dry and sheltered swamp ten mile to the north after this they follow the day and week which mark the winter of nineteen hundred and ten as one of the most terrible in all the history of the northland -- a single month in which wild life as well as human hung in the balance and when cold starvation and plague write a chapter in the life of the forest people which will not be forget for generation to come in the swamp kazan and gray wolf find a home under a windfall it be a small comfortable nest shut in entirely from the snow and wind gray wolf take possession of it immediately she flatten herself out on she belly and pant to show kazan she contentment and satisfaction nature again keep kazan close at she side a vision come to he unreal and dream-like of that wonderful night under the star -- age and age ago it seem -- when he have fight the leader of the wolf-pack and young gray wolf have creep to he side after he victory and have give herself to he for mate but this mating season there be no run after the doe or the caribou or mingle with the wild pack they live chiefly on rabbit and spruce partridge because of gray wolf 's blindness kazan could hunt those alone the hair have now grow over gray wolf 's sightless eye she have cease to grieve to rub she eye with she paw to whine for the sunlight the golden moon and the star slowly she begin to forget that she have ever see those thing she could now run more swiftly at kazan 's flank scent and hearing have become wonderfully keen she could wind a caribou two mile distant and the presence of man she could pick up at a even greater distance on a still night she have hear the splash of a trout half a mile away and as these two thing -- scent and hearing -- become more and more develop in she those same sens become less active in kazan he begin to depend upon gray wolf she would point out the hiding-place of a partridge fifty yard from they trail in they hunt she become the leader -- until game be find and as kazan learn to trust to she in the hunt so he begin just as instinctively to heed she warning if gray wolf reason it be to the effect that without kazan she would die she have try hard now and then to catch a partridge or a rabbit but she have always fail kazan mean life to she and -- if she reason -- it be to make herself indispensable to she mate blindness have make she different than she would otherwise have be again nature promise motherhood to she but she do not -- as she would have do in the open and with sight -- hold more and more aloof from kazan as the day pass it be she habit spring summer and winter to snuggle close to kazan and lie with she beautiful head rest on he neck or back if kazan snarl at she she do not snap back but slink down as though strike a blow with she warm tongue she would lick away the ice that freeze to the long hair between kazan 's toe for day after he have run a sliver in he paw she nurse he foot blindness have make kazan absolutely necessary to she existence -- and now in a different way she become more and more necessary to kazan they be happy in they swamp home there be plenty of small game about they and it be warm under the windfall rarely do they go beyond the limit of the swamp to hunt out on the more distant plain and the barren ridge they occasionally hear the cry of the wolf-pack on the trail of meat but it no longer thrill they with a desire to join in the chase one day they strike farther than usual to the west they leave the swamp cross a plain over which a fire have sweep the preceding year climb a ridge and descend into a second plain at the bottom gray wolf stop and sniff the air at these time kazan always watch she waiting eagerly and nervously if the scent be too faint for he to catch but to-day he catch the edge of it and he know why gray wolf 's ear flatten and she hindquarter droop the scent of game would have make she rigid and alert but it be not the game smell it be human and gray wolf slunk behind kazan and whine for several minute they stand without move or make a sound and then kazan lead the way on less than three hundred yard away they come to a thick clump of scrub spruce and almost run into a snow-smothered tepee it be abandon life and fire have not be there for a long time but from the tepee have come the man-smell with leg rigid and he spine quiver kazan approach the open to the tepee he look in in the middle of the tepee lie on the char ember of a fire lay a ragged blanket -- and in the blanket be wrap the body of a little indian child kazan could see the tiny moccasined foot but so long have death be there that he could scarcely smell the presence of it he draw back and see gray wolf cautiously nose about a long and peculiarly shaped hummock in the snow she have travel about it three time but never approach nearer than a man could have reach with a rifle barrel at the end of she third circle she sit down on she haunch and kazan go close to the hummock and sniff under that bulge in the snow as well as in the tepee there be death they slink away they ear flatten and they tail droop until they trail the snow and do not stop until they reach they swamp home even there gray wolf still sniff the horror of the plague and she muscle twitch and shiver as she lay close at kazan 's side that night the big white moon have around its edge a crimson rim it mean cold -- intense cold always the plague come in the day of greatest cold -- the lower the temperature the more terrible its havoc it grow steadily colder that night and the increase chill penetrate to the heart of the windfall and draw kazan and gray wolf closer together with dawn which come at about eight o'clock kazan and he blind mate sally forth into the day it be fifty degree below zero about they the tree crack with report like pistol-shot in the thickest spruce the partridge be hump into round ball of feather the snow-shoe rabbit have burrow deep under the snow or to the heart of the heaviest windfall kazan and gray wolf find few fresh trail and after a hour of fruitless hunting they return to they lair kazan dog-like have bury the half of a rabbit two or three day before and they dig this out of the snow and eat the frozen flesh all that day it grow colder -- steadily colder the night that follow be cloudless with a white moon and brilliant star the temperature have fall another ten degree and nothing be move trap be never spring on such night for even the furred thing -- the mink and the ermine and the lynx -- lay snug in the hole and the nest they have find for themselves a increase hunger be not strong enough to drive kazan and gray wolf from they windfall the next day there be no break in the terrible cold and toward noon kazan set out on a hunt for meat leave gray wolf in the windfall be three-quarter dog food be more necessary to kazan than to he mate nature have fit the wolf-breed for famine and in ordinary temperature gray wolf could have live for a fortnight without food at sixty degree below zero she could exist a week perhaps ten day only thirty hour have pass sinee they have devour the last of the frozen rabbit and she be quite satisfied to remain in they snug retreat but kazan be hungry he begin to hunt in the face of the wind travel toward the burned plain he nose about every windfall that he come to and investigate the thicket a thin shot-like snow have fall and in this -- from the windfall to the burn -- he find but a single trail and that be the trail of a ermine under a windfall he catch the warm scent of a rabbit but the rabbit be as safe from he there as be the partridge in the tree and after a hour of futile digging and gnawing he give up he effort to reach it for three hour he have hunt when he return to gray wolf he be exhaust while gray wolf with the instinct of the wild have save she own strength and energy kazan have be burn up he reserve force and be hungrier than ever the moon rise clear and brilliant in the sky again that night and kazan set out once more on the hunt he urge gray wolf to accompany he whine for she outside the windfall -- return for she twice -- but gray wolf lay she ear aslant and refuse to move the temperature have now fall to sixty-five or seventy degree below zero and with it there come from the north a increase wind make the night one in which human life could not have exist for a hour by midnight kazan be back under the windfall the wind grow stronger it begin to wail in mournful dirge over the swamp and then it burst in fierce shriek volley with interval of quiet between these be the first warning from the great barren that lay between the last line of timber and the arctic with morning the storm burst in all its fury from out of the north and gray wolf and kazan lay close together and shiver as they listen to the roar of it over the windfall once kazan thrust he head and shoulder out from the shelter of the fall tree but the storm drive he back everything that possess life have seek shelter accord to its way and instinct the furred creature like the mink and the ermine be safest for during the warmer hunting day they be of the kind that cache meat the wolf and the fox have seek out the windfall and the rock wing thing with the exception of the owl who be a tenth part body and nine-tenth feather burrow under snow-drift or find shelter in thick spruce to the hoof and horn animal the storm mean greatest havoc the deer the caribou and the moose could not crawl under windfall or creep between rock the best they could do be to lie down in the lee of a drift and allow themselves to be cover deep with the protect snow even then they could not keep they shelter long for they have to _ eat _ for eighteen hour out of the twenty-four the moose have to feed to keep himself alive during the winter he big stomach demand quantity and it take he most of he time to nibble from the top of bush the two or three bushel he need a day the caribou require almost as much -- the deer least of the three and the storm keep up that day and the next and still a third -- three day and three night -- and the third day and night there come with it a stinging shot-like snow that fall two foot deep on the level and in drift of eight and ten it be the heavy snow of the indian -- the snow that lay like lead on the earth and under which partridge and rabbit be smother in thousand on the fourth day after the beginning of the storm kazan and gray wolf issue forth from the windfall there be no longer a wind -- no more fall snow the whole world lay under a blanket of unbroken white and it be intensely cold the plague have work its havoc with man now have come the day of famine and death for the wild thing chapter xiii the trail of hunger kazan and gray wolf have be a hundred and forty hour without food to gray wolf this mean acute discomfort a grow weakness to kazan it be starvation six day and six night of fasting have draw in they rib and put deep hollow in front of they hindquarter kazan 's eye be red and they narrow to slit as he look forth into the day gray wolf follow he this time when he go out on the hard snow eagerly and hopefully they begin the hunt in the bitter cold they swing around the edge of the windfall where there have always be rabbit there be no track now and no scent they continue in a horseshoe circle through the swamp and the only scent they catch be that of a snow-owl perch up in a spruce they come to the burn and turn back hunting the opposite side of the swamp on this side there be a ridge they climb the ridge and from the cap of it look out over a world that be barren of life ceaselessly gray wolf sniff the air but she give no signal to kazan on the top of the ridge kazan stand pant he endurance be go on they return through the swamp he stumble over a obstacle which he try to clear with a jump hungrier and weaker they return to the windfall the night that follow be clear and brilliant with star they hunt the swamp again nothing be move -- save one other creature and that be a fox instinct tell they that it be futile to follow he it be then that the old thought of the cabin return to kazan two thing the cabin have always mean to he -- warmth and food and far beyond the ridge be the cabin where he and gray wolf have howl at the scent of death he do not think of man -- or of that mystery which he have howl at he think only of the cabin and the cabin have always mean food he set off in a straight line for the ridge and gray wolf follow they cross the ridge and the burn beyond and enter the edge of a second swamp kazan be hunting listlessly now he head hang low he bushy tail drag in the snow he be intent on the cabin -- only the cabin it be he last hope but gray wolf be still alert take in the wind and lift she head whenever kazan stop to snuffle he chill nose in the snow at last it come -- the scent kazan have move on but he stop when he find that gray wolf be not follow all the strength that be in he starve body reveal itself in a sudden rigid tenseness as he look at he mate she forefoot be plant firmly to the east she slim gray head be reach out for the scent she body tremble then -- suddenly -- they hear a sound and with a whining cry kazan set out in its direction with gray wolf at he flank the scent grow stronger and stronger in gray wolf 's nostril and soon it come to kazan it be not the scent of a rabbit or a partridge it be big game they approach cautiously keep full in the wind the swamp grow thicker the spruce more dense and now -- from a hundred yard ahead of they -- there come a crash of lock and battle horn ten seconds more they climb over a snowdrift and kazan stop and drop flat on he belly gray wolf crouch close at he side she blind eye turn to what she could smell but could not see fifty yard from they a number of moose have gather for shelter in the thick spruce they have eat clear a space a acre in extent the tree be crop bare as high as they could reach and the snow be beat hard under they foot there be six animal in the acre two of they bull -- and these bull be fight while three cow and a yearling be huddle in a group watch the mighty duel just before the storm a young bull sleek three-quarter grow and with the small compact antler of a four-year-old have lead the three cow and the yearling to this sheltered spot among the spruce until last night he have be master of the herd during the night the older bull have invade he dominion the invader be four time as old as the young bull he be half again as heavy he huge palmate horn knot and irregular -- but massive -- speak of age a warrior of a hundred fight he have not hesitate to give battle in he effort to rob the younger bull of he home and family three time they have fight since dawn and the hard-trodden snow be red with blood the smell of it come to kazan 's and gray wolf 's nostril kazan sniff hungrily queer sound roll up and down in gray wolf 's throat and she lick she jaw for a moment the two fighter draw a few yard apart and stand with lowered head the old bull have not yet win victory the younger bull represent youth and endurance in the older bull those thing be pit against craft greater weight maturer strength -- and a head and horn that be like a batter ram but in that great hulk of the older bull there be one other thing -- age he huge side be pant he nostril be as wide as bell then as if some invisible spirit of the arena have give the signal the animal come together again the crash of they horn could have be hear half a mile away and under twelve hundred pound of flesh and bone the younger hull go plunge back upon he haunch then be when youth display itself in a instant he be up and lock horn with he adversary twenty time he have do this and each attack have seem fill with increase strength and now as if realize that the last moment of the last fight have come he twist the old bull 's neck and fight as he have never fight before kazan and gray wolf both hear the sharp crack that follow -- as if a dry stick have be step upon and break it be February and the hoofed animal be already begin to shed they horn -- especially the older bull whose palmate growth drop first this fact give victory to the younger bull in the blood-stained arena a few yard from gray wolf and kazan from its socket in the old bull 's skull one of he huge antler break with that sharp snap sound and in another moment four inch of stiletto-like horn bury itself back of he foreleg in a instant all hope and courage leave he and he swing backward yard by yard with the younger bull prod he neck and shoulder until blood drip from he in little stream at the edge of the clearing he fling himself free and crash off into the forest the younger bull do not pursue he toss he head and stand for a few moment with heave side and dilated nostril face in the direction he vanquished foe have take then he turn and trot back to the still motionless cow and yearling kazan and gray wolf be quiver gray wolf slink back from the edge of the clearing and kazan follow no longer be they interested in the cow and the young bull from that clearing they have see meat drive forth -- meat that be beat in fight and bleeding every instinct of the wild pack return to gray wolf now -- and in kazan the mad desire to taste the blood he smell swiftly they turn toward the blood-stained trail of the old bull and when they come to it they find it spatter red kazan 's jaw drip as the hot scent drive the blood like vein of fire through he weakened body he eye be redden by starvation and in they there be a light now that they have never know even in the day of the wolf-pack he set off swiftly almost forgetful of gray wolf but he mate no longer require he flank for guidance with she nose close to the trail she run -- run as she have run in the long and thrilling hunt before blindness come half a mile from the spruce thicket they come upon the old bull he have seek shelter behind a clump of balsam and he stand over a grow pool of blood in the snow he be still breathe hard he massive head grotesque now with its one antler be droop fleck of blood drop from he distended nostril even then with the old bull weaken by starvation exhaustion and loss of blood a wolf-pack would have hang back before attack where they would have hesitate kazan leap in with a snarling cry for a instant he fang sink into the thick hide of the bull 's throat then he be fling back -- twenty foot hunger gnawing at he vitals rob he of all caution and he spring to the attack again -- full at the bull 's front -- while gray wolf creep up unseen behind seek in she blindness the vulnerable part which nature have not teach kazan to find this time kazan be catch fairly on the broad palmate leaf of the bull 's antler and he be fling back again half stunned in that same moment gray wolf 's long white tooth cut like knife through one of the bull 's rope-like hamstring for thirty seconds she keep the hold while the bull plunge wildly in he effort to trample she underfoot kazan be quick to learn still quicker to be guide by gray wolf and he leap in again snap for a hold on the bulge cord just above the knee he miss and as he lunge forward on he shoulder gray wolf be fling off but she have accomplish she purpose beat in open battle with one of he kind and now attack by a still deadlier foe the old bull begin to retreat as he go one hip sink under he at every step the tendon of he left leg be bitten half through without be able to see gray wolf seem to realize what have happen again she be the pack-wolf -- with all the old wolf strategy twice fling back by the old bull 's horn kazan know better than to attack openly again gray wolf trot after the bull but he remain behind for a moment to lick up hungrily mouthful of the blood-soaked snow then he follow and run close against gray wolf 's side fifty yard behind the bull there be more blood in the trail now -- a thin red ribbon of it fifteen minute later the bull stop again and face about he great head lower he eye be red there be a droop to he neck and shoulder that speak no longer of the unconquerable fighting spirit that have be a part of he for nearly a score of year no longer be he lord of the wilderness about he no longer be there defiance in the poise of he splendid head or the flash of eager fire in he bloodshot eye he breath come with a gasp sound that be grow more and more distinct a hunter would have know what it mean the stiletto-point of the younger bull 's antler have go home and the old bull 's lung be fail he more than once gray wolf have hear that sound in the early day of she hunting with the pack and she understand slowly she begin to circle about the wounded monarch at a distance of about twenty yard kazan keep at she side once -- twice -- twenty time they make that slow circle and with each turn they make the old bull turn and he breath grow heavier and he head droop lower noon come and be follow by the more intense cold of the last half of the day twenty circle become a hundred -- two hundred -- and more under gray wolf 's and kazan 's foot the snow grow hard in the path they make under the old bull 's widespread hoof the snow be no longer white -- but red a thousand time before this unseen tragedy of the wilderness have be enact it be a epoch of that life where life itself mean the survival of the fittest where to live means to kill and to die means to perpetuate life at last in that steady and deadly circling of gray wolf and kazan there come a time when the old bull do not turn -- then a second a third and a fourth time and gray wolf seem to know with kazan she draw back from the hard-beaten trail and they flatten themselves on they belly under a dwarf spruce -- and wait for many minute the bull stand motionless he hamstrung quarter sink lower and lower and then with a deep blood-choked gasp he sink down for a long time kazan and gray wolf do not move and when at last they return to the beaten trail the bull 's heavy head be rest on the snow again they begin to circle and now the circle narrow foot by foot until only ten yard -- then nine -- then eight -- separated they from they prey the bull attempt to rise and fail gray wolf hear the effort she hear he sink back and suddenly she leap in swiftly and silently from behind she sharp fang bury themselves in the bull 's nostril and with the first instinct of the husky kazan spring for a throat hold this time he be not fling off it be gray wolf 's terrible hold that give he time to tear through the half-inch hide and to bury he tooth deeper and deeper until at last they reach the jugular a gush of warm blood spurt into he face but he do not let go just as he have hold to the jugular of he first buck on that moonlight night a long time ago so he hold to the old bull now it be gray wolf who unclamp he jaw she draw back sniff the air listen then slowly she raise she head and through the frozen and starving wilderness there go she wail triumphant cry -- the call to meat for they the day of famine have pass chapter xiv the right of fang after the fight kazan lay down exhaust in the blood-stained snow while faithful gray wolf still fill with the endurance of she wild wolf breed tear fiercely at the thick skin on the bull 's neck to lay open the red flesh when she have do this she do not eat but run to kazan 's side and whine softly as she muzzle he with she nose after that they feast crouching side by side at the bull 's neck and tear at the warm sweet flesh the last pale light of the northern day be fading swiftly into night when they draw back gorge until there be no longer hollow in they side the faint wind die away the cloud that have hang in the sky during the day drift eastward and the moon shine brilliant and clear for a hour the night continue to grow lighter to the brilliance of the moon and the star there be add now the pale fire of the aurora boreali shiver and flash over the pole its hissing crackle monotone like the creaking of steel sledge-runner on frost-filled snow come faintly to the ear of kazan and gray wolf as yet they have not go a hundred yard from the dead bull and at the first sound of that strange mystery in the northern sky they stop and listen to it alert and suspicious then they lay they ear aslant and trot slowly back to the meat they have kill instinct tell they that it be theirs only by right of fang they have fight to kill it and it be in the law of the wild that they would have to fight to keep it in good hunting day they would have go on and wander under the moon and the star but long day and night of starvation have teach they something different now on that clear and stormless night follow the day of plague and famine a hundred thousand hungry creature come out from they retreat to hunt for food for eighteen hundred mile east and west and a thousand mile north and south slim gaunt-bellied creature hunt under the moon and the star something tell kazan and gray wolf that this hunt be on and never for a instant do they cease they vigilance at last they lay down at the edge of the spruce thicket and wait gray wolf muzzle kazan gently with she blind face the uneasy whine in she throat be a warn to he then she sniff the air and listen -- sniff and listen suddenly every muscle in they body grow rigid something living have pass near they something that they could not see or hear and scarcely scent it come again as mysterious as a shadow and then out of the air there float down as silently as a huge snowflake a great white owl kazan see the hungry winged creature settle on the bull 's shoulder like a flash he be out from he cover gray wolf a yard behind he with a angry snarl he lunge at the white robber and he jaw snap on empty air he leap carry he clean over the bull he turn but the owl be go nearly all of he old strength have return to he now he trot about the bull the hair along he spine bristle like a brush he eye wide and menacing he snarl at the still air he jaw click and he sit back on he haunch and face the blood-stained trail that the moose have leave before he die again that instinct as infallible as reason tell he that danger would come from there like a red ribbon the trail run back through the wilderness the little swift-moving ermine be everywhere this night look like white rat as they dodge about in the moonlight they be first to find the trail and with all the ferocity of they blood-eating nature follow it with quick exciting leap a fox catch the scent of it a quarter of a mile to windward and come nearer from out of a deep windfall a beady-eyed thin-bellied fisher-cat come forth and stop with he foot in the crimson ribbon it be the fisher-cat that bring kazan out from under he cover of spruce again in the moonlight there be a sharp quick fight a snarl and scratch a cat-like yowl of pain and the fisher forget he hunger in flight kazan return to gray wolf with a lacerated and bleeding nose gray wolf lick it sympathetically while kazan stand rigid and listen the fox swing swiftly away with the wind warn by the sound of conflict he be not a fighter but a murderer who kill from behind and a little later he leap upon a owl and tear it into bit for the half-pound of flesh within the mass of feather but nothing could drive back those little white outlaw of the wilderness -- the ermine they would have steal between the foot of man to get at the warm flesh and blood of the freshly kill bull kazan hunt they savagely they be too quick for he more like elusive flash in the moonlight than thing of life they burrow under the old bull 's body and fed while he rave and fill he mouth with snow gray wolf sit placidly on she haunch the little ermine do not trouble she and after a time kazan realize this and fling himself down beside she panting and exhaust for a long time after that the night be almost unbroken by sound once in the far distance there come the cry of a wolf and now and then to punctuate the deathly silence the snow owl hoot in blood-curdling protest from he home in the spruce-top the moon be straight above the old bull when gray wolf scented the first real danger instantly she give the warn to kazan and face the bloody trail she lithe body quiver she fang gleam in the starlight a snarl whine in she throat only in the face of they deadliest enemy the lynx -- the terrible fighter who have blind she long ago in that battle on the sun rock -- do she give such warning as this to kazan he spring ahead of she ready for battle even before he catch the scent of the gray beautiful creature of death steal over the trail then come the interruption from a mile away there burst forth a single fierce long-drawn howl after all that be the cry of the true master of the wilderness -- the wolf it be the cry of hunger it be the cry that send man 's blood run more swiftly through they vein that bring the moose and the deer to they foot shiver in every limb -- the cry that wail like a note of death through swamp and forest and over the snow-smothered ridge until its faintest echo reach for mile into the starlit night there be silence and in that awesome stillness kazan and gray wolf stand shoulder to shoulder face the cry and in response to that cry there work within they a strange and mystic change for what they have hear be not a warning or a menace but the call of brotherhood away off there -- beyond the lynx and the fox and the fisher-cat be the creature of they kind the wild-wolf pack to which the right to all flesh and blood be common -- in which exist that savage socialism of the wilderness the brotherhood of the wolf and gray wolf set back on she haunch send forth the response to that cry -- a wail triumphant note that tell she hungry brethren there be feast at the end of the trail and the lynx between those two cry sneak off into the wide and moonlit space of the forest chapter xv a fight under the star on they haunch kazan and gray wolf wait five minute pass ten -- fifteen -- and gray wolf become uneasy no response have follow she call again she howl with kazan quiver and listen beside she and again there follow that dead stillness of the night this be not the way of the pack she know that it have not go beyond the reach of she voice and its silence puzzle she and then in a flash it come to they both that the pack or the single wolf whose cry they have hear be very near they the scent be warm a few moment later kazan see a move object in the moonlight it be follow by another and still another until there be five slouching in a half-circle about they seventy yard away then they lay themselves flat in the snow and be motionless a snarl turn kazan 's eye to gray wolf he blind mate have draw back she white fang gleam menacingly in the starlight she ear be flat kazan be puzzle why be she signal danger to he when it be the wolf and not the lynx out there in the snow and why do the wolf not come in and feast slowly he move toward they and gray wolf call to he with she whine he pay no attention to she but go on step lightly he head high in the air he spine bristle in the scent of the stranger kazan be catch something now that be strangely familiar it draw he toward they more swiftly and when at last he stop twenty yard from where the little group lay flatten in the snow he thick brush wave slightly one of the animal spring up and approach the other follow and in another moment kazan be in the midst of they smell and smell and wag he tail they be dog and not wolf in some lonely cabin in the wilderness they master have die and they have take to the forest they still bear sign of the sledge-trace about they neck be moose-hide collar the hair be worn short at they flank and one still drag after he three foot of cord babiche trace they eye gleam red and hungry in the glow of the moon and the star they be thin and gaunt and starve and kazan suddenly turn and trot ahead of they to the side of the dead bull then he fall back and sit proudly on he haunch beside gray wolf listen to the snap of jaw and the rending of flesh as the starve pack feast gray wolf slunk closer to kazan she muzzle he neck and kazan give she a swift dog-like caress of he tongue assure she that all be well she flatten herself in the snow when the dog have finish and come up in they dog way to sniff at she and make closer acquaintance with kazan kazan tower over she guard she one huge red-eyed dog who still drag the bit of babiche trace muzzle gray wolf 's soft neck for a fraction of a second too long and kazan utter a savage snarl of warn the dog draw back and for a moment they fang gleam over gray wolf 's blind face it be the challenge of the breed the big husky be the leader of the pack and if one of the other dog have snarl at he as kazan snarl he would have leap at he throat but in kazan standing fierce and half wild over gray wolf he recognize none of the serfdom of the sledge-dog it be master face master in kazan it be more than that for he be gray wolf 's mate in a instant more he would have leap over she body to have fight for she more than for the right of leadership but the big husky turn away sullenly growl still snarl and vent he rage by nipping fiercely at the flank of one of he sledge-mates gray wolf understand what have happen though she could not see she shrink closer to kazan she know that the moon and the star have look down on that thing that always mean death -- the challenge to the right of mate with she lure coyness whining and softly muzzling he shoulder and neck she try to draw kazan away from the pad-beaten circle in which the bull lay kazan 's answer be a ominous rolling of smother thunder deep down in he throat he lay down beside she lick she blind face swiftly and face the stranger dog the moon sink lower and lower and at last drop behind the western forest the star grow paler one by one they fade from the sky and after a time there follow the cold gray dawn of the north in that dawn the big husky leader rise from the hole he have make in the snow and return to the bull kazan alert be on he foot in a instant and stand also close to the bull the two circle ominously they head lower they crest bristle the husky draw away and kazan crouch at the bull 's neck and begin tear at the frozen flesh he be not hungry but in this way he show he right to the flesh he defiance of the right of the big husky for a few seconds he forget gray wolf the husky have slip back like a shadow and now he stand again over gray wolf sniff she neck and body then he whine in that whine be the passion the invitation the demand of the wild so quickly that the eye could scarcely follow she movement faithful gray wolf sink she gleaming fang in the husky 's shoulder a gray streak -- nothing more tangible than a streak of gray silent and terrible shot through the dawn-gloom it be kazan he come without a snarl without a cry and in a moment he and the husky be in the throe of terrific battle the four other husky run in quickly and stand wait a dozen pace from the combatant gray wolf lay crouch on she belly the giant husky and the quarter-strain wolf-dog be not fight like sledge-dog or wolf for a few moment rage and hatred make they fight like mongrel both have hold now one be down and now the other and so swiftly do they change they position that the four wait sledge-dog be puzzle and stand motionless under other condition they would have leap upon the first of the fighter to be throw upon he back and tear he to piece that be the way of the wolf and the wolf-dog but now they stand back hesitate and fearful the big husky have never be beat in battle great dane ancestor have give he a huge bulk and a jaw that could crush a ordinary dog 's head but in kazan he be meet not only the dog and the wolf but all that be best in the two and kazan have the advantage of a few hour of rest and a full stomach more than that he be fight for gray wolf he fang have sink deep in the husky 's shoulder and the husky 's long tooth meet through the hide and flesh of he neck a inch deeper and they would have pierce he jugular kazan know this as he crunch he enemy 's shoulder-bone and every instant -- even in they fiercest struggle -- he be guard against a second and more successful lunge of those powerful jaw at last the lunge come and quicker than the wolf itself kazan free himself and leap back he chest drip blood but he do not feel the hurt they begin slowly to circle and now the watch sledge-dog draw a step or two nearer and they jaw drool nervously and they red eye glare as they wait for the fatal moment they eye be on the big husky he become the pivot of kazan 's wider circle now and he limp as he turn he shoulder be break he ear be flatten as he watch kazan kazan 's ear be erect and he foot touch the snow lightly all he fight cleverness and all he caution have return to he the blind rage of a few moment be go and he fight now as he have fight he deadliest enemy the long-clawed lynx five time he circle around the husky and then like a shot he be in send he whole weight against the husky 's shoulder with the momentum of a ten-foot leap behind it this time he do not try for a hold but slash at the husky 's jaw it be the deadliest of all attack when that merciless tribunal of death stand wait for the first fall of the vanquish the huge dog be throw from he foot for a fatal moment he roll upon he side and in the moment he four sledge-mate be upon he all of they hatred of the week and month in which the long-fanged leader have bully they in the trace be concentrate upon he now and he be literally tear into piece kazan prance to gray wolf 's side and with a joyful whine she lay she head over he neck twice he have fight the fight of death for she twice he have win and in she blindness gray wolf 's soul -- if soul she have -- rise in exultation to the cold gray sky and she breast pant against kazan 's shoulder as she listen to the crunching of fang in the flesh and bone of the foe she lord and master have overthrow chapter xvi the call follow day of feast on the frozen flesh of the old bull in vain gray wolf try to lure kazan off into the forest and the swamp day by day the temperature rise there be hunting now and gray wolf want to be alone -- with kazan but with kazan as with most man leadership and power rouse new sensation and he be the leader of the dog-pack as he have once be a leader among the wolf not only gray wolf follow at he flank now but the four husky trail behind he once more he be experience that triumph and strange thrill that he have almost forget and only gray wolf in that eternal night of she blindness feel with dread foreboding the danger into which he newly achieve czarship might lead he for three day and three night they remain in the neighborhood of the dead moose ready to defend it against other and yet each day and each night grow less vigilant in they guard then come the fourth night on which they kill a young doe kazan lead in that chase and for the first time in the excitement of have the pack at he back he leave he blind mate behind when they come to the kill he be the first to leap at its soft throat and not until he have begin to tear at the doe 's flesh do the other dare to eat he be master he could send they back with a snarl at the gleam of he fang they crouch quiver on they belly in the snow kazan 's blood be foment with brute exultation and the excitement and fascination that come in the possession of new power take the place of gray wolf each day a little more she come in half a hour after the kill and there be no longer the lithesome alertness to she slender leg or gladness in the tilt of she ear or the poise of she head she do not eat much of the doe she blind face be turn always in kazan 's direction wherever he move she follow with she unseeing eye as if expect each moment he old signal to she -- that low throat-note that have call to she so often when they be alone in the wilderness in kazan as leader of the pack there be work a curious change if he mate have be wolf it would not have be difficult for gray wolf to have lure he away but kazan be among he own kind he be a dog and they be dog fire that have burn down and cease to warm he flame up in he anew in he life with gray wolf one thing have oppress he as it could not oppress she and that thing be loneliness nature have create he of that kind which require companionship -- not of one but of many it have give he birth that he might listen to and obey the command of the voice of man he have grow to hate man but of the dog -- he kind -- he be a part he have be happy with gray wolf happier than he have ever be in the companionship of man and he blood-brother but he have be a long time separate from the life that have once be he and the call of blood make he for a time forget and only gray wolf with that wonderful super-instinct which nature be give she in place of she lose sight foresee the end to which it be lead he each day the temperature continue to rise until when the sun be warmest the snow begin to thaw a little this be two week after the fight near the bull gradually the pack have swing eastward until it be now fifty mile east and twenty mile south of the old home under the windfall more than ever gray wolf begin to long for they old nest under the fall tree again with those first promise of spring in sunshine and air there be come also for the second time in she life the promise of approach motherhood but she effort to draw kazan back be unavailing and in spite of she protest he wander each day a little farther east and south at the head of he pack instinct impel the four husky to move in that direction they have not yet be long enough a part of the wild to forget the necessity of man and in that direction there be man in that direction and not far from they now be the hudson bay company 's post to which they and they dead master owe they allegiance kazan do not know this but one day something happen to bring back vision and desire that widen still more the gulf between he and gray wolf they have come to the cap of a ridge when something stop they it be a man 's voice cry shrilly that word of long ago that have so often stir the blood in kazan 's own vein -- _ m ` hoosh m ` hoosh m ` hoosh _ -- and from the ridge they look down upon the open space of the plain where a team of six dog be trot ahead of a sledge with a man run behind they urge they on at every other step with that cry of _ m ` hoosh m ` hoosh m ` hoosh _ tremble and undecided the four husky and the wolf-dog stand on the ridge with gray wolf cringe behind they not until man and dog and sledge have disappear do they move and then they trot down to the trail and sniff at it whiningly and excitedly for a mile or two they follow it kazan and he mate go fearlessly in the trail gray wolf hang back travel twenty yard to the right of they with the hot man-scent drive the blood feverishly through she brain only she love for kazan -- and the faith she still have in he -- keep she that near at the edge of a swamp kazan halted and turn away from the trail with the desire that be grow in he there be still that old suspicion which nothing could quite wipe out -- the suspicion that be a inheritance of he quarter-strain of wolf gray wolf whine joyfully when he turn into the forest and draw so close to he that she shoulder rub against kazan 's as they travel side by side the slush snow follow fast after this and the slush snow mean spring -- and the emptying of the wilderness of human life kazan and he mate soon begin to scent the presence and the movement of this life they be now within thirty mile of the post for a hundred mile on all side of they the trapper be move in with they late winter 's catch of fur from east and west south and north all trail lead to the post the pack be catch in the mesh of they for a week not a day pass that they do not cross a fresh trail and sometimes two or three gray wolf be haunt by constant fear in she blindness she know that they be surround by the menace of man to kazan what be come to pass have more and more cease to fill he with fear and caution three time that week he hear the shout of man -- and once he hear a white man 's laughter and the bark of dog as they master toss they they daily feed of fish in the air he catch the pungent scent of camp-fire and one night in the far distance he hear a wild snatch of song follow by the yelping and bark of a dog-pack slowly and surely the lure of man draw he nearer to the post -- a mile to-night two mile to-morrow but always nearer and gray wolf fight she lose fight to the end sense in the danger-filled air the nearness of that hour when he would respond to the final call and she would be leave alone these be day of activity and excitement at the fur company 's post the day of accounting of profit and of pleasure -- the day when the wilderness pour in its treasure of fur to be send a little later to london and pari and the capital of europe and this year there be more than the usual interest in the foregathering of the forest people the plague have work its terrible havoc and not until the fur-hunter have come to answer to the spring roll-call would it be know accurately who have live and who have die the chippewan and half-breed from the south begin to arrive first with they team of mongrel cur pick up along the border of civilization close after they come the hunter from the western barren land bring with they load of white fox and caribou skin and a army of big-footed long-legged mackenzie hound that pull like horse and wail like whip puppy when the husky and eskimo dog set upon they pack of fierce labrador dog never vanquish except by death come from close to hudson 's bay team after team of little yellow and gray eskimo dog as quick with they fang as be they black and swift-running master with they hand and foot meet the much larger and dark-colored malemute from the athabasca enemy of all these pack of fierce husky trail in from all side fight snap and snarl with the lust of kill deep bear in they from they wolf progenitor there be no cessation in the battle of the fang it begin with the first brute arrival it continue from dawn through the day and around the camp-fire at night there be never a end to the strife between the dog and between the man and the dog the snow be trail and stain with blood and the scent of it add greater fierceness to the wolf-breed half a dozen battle be fight to the death each day and night those that die be chiefly the south-bred cur -- mixture of mastiff great dane and sheep-dog -- and the fatally slow mackenzie hound about the post rise the smoke of a hundred camp-fire and about these fire gather the woman and the child of the hunter when the snow be no longer fit for sledge william the factor note that there be many who have not come and the account of these he later scratch out of he ledger know that they be victim of the plague at last come the night of the big carnival for week and month woman and child and man have be look forward to this in score of forest cabin in smoke-blackened tepee and even in the frozen home of the little eskimo anticipation of this wild night of pleasure have give a add zest to life it be the big circus -- the good time give twice each year by the company to its people this year to offset the memory of plague and death the factor have put forth unusual exertion he hunter have kill four fat caribou in the clearing there be great pile of dry log and in the center of all there rise eight ten-foot tree-butt crotch at the top and from crotch to crotch there rest a stout sapling strip of bark and on each sapling be spit the carcass of a caribou to be roasted whole by the heat of the fire beneath the fire be light at dusk and william himself start the first of those wild song of the northland -- the song of the caribou as the flame leap up into the dark night oh ze cariboo-oo-oo ze cariboo-oo-oo he roa ' on high je ' under ze sky air-hole beeg white cariboo-oo-oo now he yell now -- all together and carry away by he enthusiasm the forest people awaken from they silence of month and the song burst forth in a savage frenzy that reach to the sky \* \* \* \* \* two mile to the south and west that first thunder of human voice reach the ear of kazan and gray wolf and the masterless husky and with the voice of man they hear now the excited howling of dog the husky face the direction of the sound move restlessly and whine for a few moment kazan stand as though carven of rock then he turn he head and he first look be to gray wolf she have slink back a dozen foot and lay crouch under the thick cover of a balsam shrub she body leg and neck be flatten in the snow she make no sound but she lip be draw back and she tooth shine white kazan trot back to she sniff at she blind face and whine gray wolf still do not move he return to the dog and he jaw open and close with a snap still more clearly come the wild voice of the carnival and no longer to be hold back by kazan 's leadership the four husky drop they head and slunk like shadow in its direction kazan hesitate urge gray wolf but not a muscle of gray wolf 's body move she would have follow he in face of fire but not in face of man not a sound escape she ear she hear the quick fall of kazan 's foot as he leave she in another moment she know that he be go then -- and not until then -- do she lift she head and from she soft throat there break a whimpering cry it be she last call to kazan but stronger than that there be run through kazan 's excite blood the call of man and of dog the husky be far in advance of he now and for a few moment he race madly to overtake they then he slow down until he be trot and a hundred yard farther on he stop less than a mile away he could see where the flame of the great fire be redden the sky he gaze back to see if gray wolf be follow and then go on until he strike a open and hard travel trail it be beat with the footprint of man and dog and over it two of the caribou have be drag a day or two before at last he come to the thin out strip of timber that surround the clearing and the flare of the flame be in he eye the bedlam of sound that come to he now be like fire in he brain he hear the song and the laughter of man the shrill cry of woman and child the bark and snarl and fight of a hundred dog he want to rush out and join they to become again a part of what he have once be yard by yard he sneak through the thin timber until he reach the edge of the clearing there he stand in the shadow of a spruce and look out upon life as he have once live it tremble wistful and yet hesitate in that final moment a hundred yard away be the savage circle of man and dog and fire he nostril be fill with the rich aroma of the roast caribou and as he crouch down still with that wolfish caution that gray wolf have teach he man with long pole bring the huge carcass crash down upon the melting snow about the fire in one great rush the horde of wild reveler crowd in with bared knife and a snarl mass of dog close in behind they in another moment he have forget gray wolf have forget all that man and the wild have teach he and like a gray streak be across the open the dog be surge back when he reach they with half a dozen of the factor 's man lash they in the face with long caribou-gut whip the sting of a lash fall in a fierce cut over a eskimo dog 's shoulder and in snap at the lash he fang strike kazan 's rump with lightning swiftness kazan return the cut and in a instant the jaw of the dog have meet in another instant they be down and kazan have the eskimo dog by the throat with shout the man rush in again and again they whip cut like knife through the air they blow fall on kazan who be uppermost and as he feel the burning pain of the scourging whip there flood through he all at once the fierce memory of the day of old -- the day of the club and the lash he snarl slowly he loosen he hold of the eskimo dog 's throat and then out of the mle of dog and man there spring another man -- _ with a club _ it fall on kazan 's back and the force of it send he flat into the snow it be raise again behind the club there be a face -- a brutal fire-reddened face it be such a face that have drive kazan into the wild and as the club fall again he evade the full weight of its blow and he fang gleam like ivory knive a third time the club be raise and this time kazan meet it in mid-air and he tooth rip the length of the man 's forearm good god shriek the man in pain and kazan catch the gleam of a rifle barrel as he speed toward the forest a shot follow something like a red-hot coal run the length of kazan 's hip and deep in the forest he stop to lick at the burning furrow where the bullet have go just deep enough to take the skin and hair from he flesh \* \* \* \* \* gray wolf be still wait under the balsam shrub when kazan return to she joyously she spring forth to meet he once more the man have send back the old kazan to she he muzzle she neck and face and stand for a few moment with he head rest across she back listen to the distant sound then with ear lay flat he set out straight into the north and west and now gray wolf run shoulder to shoulder with he like the gray wolf of the day before the dog-pack come for that wonderful thing that lay beyond the realm of reason tell she that once more she be comrade and mate and that they trail that night be lead to they old home under the windfall chapter xvii he son it happen that kazan be to remember three thing above all other he could never quite forget he old day in the trace though they be grow more shadowy and indistinct in he memory as the summer and the winter pass like a dream there come to he a memory of the time he have go down to civilization like dream be the vision that rise before he now and then of the face of the first woman and of the face of master who -- to he -- have live age ago and never would he quite forget the fire and he fight with man and beast and he long chase in the moonlight but two thing be always with he as if they have be but yesterday rise clear and unforgetable above all other like the two star in the north that never lose they brilliance one be woman the other be the terrible fight of that night on the top of the sun rock when the lynx have blind forever he wild mate gray wolf certain event remain indelibly fix in the mind of man and so in a not very different way they remain in the mind of beast it take neither brain nor reason to measure the depths of sorrow or of happiness and kazan in he unreasoning way know that contentment and peace a full stomach and caress and kind word instead of blow have come to he through woman and that comradeship in the wilderness -- faith loyalty and devotion -- be a part of gray wolf the third unforgetable thing be about to occur in the home they have find for themselves under the swamp windfall during the day of cold and famine they have leave the swamp over a month before when it be smother deep in snow on the day they return to it the sun be shine warmly in the first glorious day of spring warmth everywhere big and small there be the rush torrent of melting snow and the crackle of crumble ice the die cry of thaw rock and earth and tree and each night for many night past the cold pale glow of the aurora boreali have creep farther and farther toward the pole in fading glory so early as this the poplar bud have begin to swell and the air be fill with the sweet odor of balsam spruce and cedar where there have be famine and death and stillness six week before kazan and gray wolf now stand at the edge of the swamp and breathe the earthy smell of spring and listen to the sound of life over they head a pair of newly-mated moose-bird flutter and scold at they a big jay sit plume himself in the sunshine farther in they hear the crack of a stick break under a heavy hoof from the ridge behind they they catch the raw scent of a mother bear busy pull down the tender poplar bud for she six-weeks-old cub bear while she be still deep in she winter sleep in the warmth of the sun and the sweetness of the air there breathe to gray wolf the mystery of matehood and of motherhood she whine softly and rub she blind face against kazan for day in she way she try to tell he more than ever she want to curl herself up in that warm dry nest under the windfall she have no desire to hunt the crack of the dry stick under a cloven hoof and the warm scent of the she-bear and she cub rouse none of the old instinct in she she want to curl herself up in the old windfall -- and wait and she try hard to make kazan understand she desire now that the snow be go they find that a narrow creek lay between they and the knoll on which the windfall be situate gray wolf pick up she ear at the tumult of the little torrent since the day of the fire when kazan and she have save themselves on the sand-bar she have cease to have the inherent wolf horror of water she follow fearlessly even eagerly behind kazan as he seek a place where they could ford the rush little stream on the other side kazan could see the big windfall gray wolf could _ smell _ it and she whine joyously with she blind face turn toward it a hundred yard up the stream a big cedar have fall over it and kazan begin to cross for a moment gray wolf hesitate and then follow side by side they trot to the windfall with they head and shoulder in the dark opening to they nest they scented the air long and cautiously then they enter kazan hear gray wolf as she fling herself down on the dry floor of the snug cavern she be pant not from exhaustion but because she be fill with a sensation of contentment and happiness in the darkness kazan 's own jaw fall apart he too be glad to get back to they old home he go to gray wolf and panting still harder she lick he face it have but one meaning and kazan understand for a moment he lay down beside she listening and eye the open to they nest then he begin to sniff about the log wall he be close to the opening when a sudden fresh scent come to he and he grow rigid and he bristle stand up the scent be follow by a whimper babyish chatter a porcupine enter the opening and proceed to advance in its foolish fashion still chatter in that babyish way that have make its life inviolable at the hand of man kazan have hear that sound before and like all other beast have learn to ignore the presence of the innocuous creature that make it but just now he do not stop to consider that what he see be a porcupine and that at he first snarl the good-humored little creature would waddle away as fast as it could still chatter baby talk to itself he first reasoning be that it be a live thing invade the home to which gray wolf and he have just return a day later or perhaps a hour later he would have drive it back with a growl now he leap upon it a wild chatter intermingle with pig-like squeak and then a rise staccato of howl follow the attack gray wolf spring to the open the porcupine be roll up in a thousand-spiked ball a dozen foot away and she could hear kazan tear about in the throe of the direst agony that can befall a beast of the forest he face and nose be a mat of quill for a few moment he roll and dig in the wet mold and earth paw madly at the thing that pierce he flesh then he set off like all dog will who have come into contact with the friendly porcupine and race again and again around the windfall howl at every jump gray wolf take the matter coolly it be possible that at time there be moment of humor in the life of animal if so she see this one she scented the porcupine and she know that kazan be full of quill as there be nothing to do and nothing to fight she sit back on she haunch and wait prick up she ear every time kazan pass she in he mad circuit around the windfall at he fourth or fifth heat the porcupine smooth itself down a little and continue the interrupted thread of its chatter waddle to a near-by poplar climb it and begin to gnaw the tender bark from a limb at last kazan halt before gray wolf the first agony of a hundred little needle pierce he flesh have deaden into a steady burning pain gray wolf go over to he and investigate he cautiously with she tooth she seize the end of two or three of the quill and pull they out kazan be very much dog now he give a yelp and whimper as gray wolf jerk out a second bunch of quill then he flatten himself on he belly stretch out he foreleg close he eye and without any other sound except a occasional yelp of pain allow gray wolf to go on with the operation fortunately he have escape get any of the quill in he mouth and tongue but he nose and jaw be soon red with blood for a hour gray wolf keep faithfully at she task and by the end of that time have succeed in pull out most of the quill a few still remain too short and too deeply inbedded for she to extract with she tooth after this kazan go down to the creek and bury he burning muzzle in the cold water this give he some relief but only for a short time the quill that remain work they way deeper and deeper into he flesh like live thing nose and lip begin to swell blood and saliva drip from he mouth and he eye grow red two hour after gray wolf have retire to she nest under the windfall a quill have completely pierce he lip and begin to prick he tongue in desperation kazan chew viciously upon a piece of wood this break and crumple the quill and destroy its power to do further harm nature have tell he the one thing to do to save himself most of that day he spend in gnawing at wood and crunch mouthful of earth and mold between he jaw in this way the barb-toothed point of the quill be dull and break as they come through at dusk he crawl under the windfall and gray wolf gently lick he muzzle with she soft cool tongue frequently during the night kazan go to the creek and find relief in its ice-cold water the next day he have what the forest people call porcupine mumps he face be swollen until gray wolf would have laugh if she have be human and not blind he chop bulge like cushion he eye be mere slit when he go out into the day he blink for he could see scarcely better than he sightless mate but the pain be mostly go the night that follow he begin to think of hunting and the next morning before it be yet dawn he bring a rabbit into they den a few hour later he would have bring a spruce partridge to gray wolf but just as he be about to spring upon he feathered prey the soft chatter of a porcupine a few yard away bring he to a sudden stop few thing could make kazan drop he tail but that inane and incoherent prattle of the little spiked beast send he off at double-quick with he tail between he leg as man abhor and evade the creep serpent so kazan would hereafter evade this little creature of the forest that never in animal history have be know to lose its good-humor or pick a quarrel two week of lengthen day of increase warmth of sunshine and hunting follow kazan 's adventure with the porcupine the last of the snow go rapidly out of the earth begin to spring tip of green the _ bakneesh _ vine glisten redder each day the poplar bud begin to split and in the sunniest spot between the rock of the ridge the little white snow-flower begin to give a final proof that spring have come for the first of those two week gray wolf hunt frequently with kazan they do not go far the swamp be alive with small game and each day or night they kill fresh meat after the first week gray wolf hunt less then come the soft and balmy night glorious in the radiance of a full spring moon when she refuse to leave the windfall kazan do not urge she instinct make he understand and he do not go far from the windfall that night in he hunt when he return he bring a rabbit come then the night when from the darkest corner of the windfall gray wolf warn he back with a low snarl he stand in the open a rabbit between he jaw he take no offense at the snarl but stand for a moment gaze into the gloom where gray wolf have hide herself then he drop the rabbit and lay down squarely in the opening after a little he rise restlessly and go outside but he do not leave the windfall it be day when he reenter he sniff as he have sniff once before a long time ago between the boulder at the top of the sun rock that which be in the air be no longer a mystery to he he come nearer and gray wolf do not snarl she whine coaxingly as he touch she then he muzzle find something else it be soft and warm and make a queer little sniffle sound there be a responsive whine in he throat and in the darkness come the quick soft caress of gray wolf 's tongue kazan return to the sunshine and stretch himself out before the door of the windfall he jaw drop open for he be fill with a strange contentment chapter xviii the education of ba-ree rob once of the joy of parenthood by the murder on the sun rock both gray wolf and kazan be different from what they would have be have the big gray lynx not come into they life at that time as if it be but yesterday they remember the moonlit night when the lynx bring blindness to gray wolf and destroy she young and when kazan have avenge himself and he mate in he terrible fight to the death with they enemy and now with that soft little handful of life snuggle close up against she gray wolf see through she blind eye the tragic picture of that night more vividly than ever and she quiver at every sound ready to leap in the face of a unseen foe to rend all flesh that be not the flesh of kazan and ceaselessly the slightest sound bring he to he foot kazan watch and guard he mistrust the move shadow the snap of a twig draw back he upper lip he fang gleam menacingly when the soft air bring a strange scent in he too the memory of the sun rock the death of they first young and the blind of gray wolf have give birth to a new instinct not for a instant be he off he guard as surely as one expect the sun to rise so do he expect that sooner or later they deadly enemy would creep on they from out of the forest in another hour such as this the lynx have bring death the lynx have bring blindness and so day and night he wait and watch for the lynx to come again and woe unto any other creature of flesh and blood that dare approach the windfall in these first day of gray wolf 's motherhood but peace have spread its wing of sunshine and plenty over the swamp there be no intruder unless the noisy whisky-jack the big-eyed moose-bird the chatter bush sparrow and the wood-mouse and ermine could be call such after the first day or two kazan go more frequently into the windfall and though more than once he nose searchingly about gray wolf he could find only the one little pup a little farther west the dog-rib would have call the pup ba-ree for two reason -- because he have no brother or sister and because he be a mixture of dog and wolf he be a sleek and lively little fellow from the beginning for there be no division of mother strength and attention he develop with the true swiftness of the wolf-whelp and not with the slowness of the dog-pup for three day he be satisfy to cuddle close against he mother feed when he be hungry sleep a great deal and preen and launder almost constantly by gray wolf 's affectionate tongue from the fourth day he grow busier and more inquisitive with every hour he find he mother 's blind face with tremendous effort he tumble over she paw and once he lose himself completely and sniffle for help when he roll fifteen or eighteen inch away from she it be not long after this that he begin to recognize kazan as a part of he mother and he be scarcely more than a week old when he roll himself up contentedly between kazan 's foreleg and go to sleep kazan be puzzle then with a deep sigh gray wolf lay she head across one of she mate 's foreleg with she nose touch she runaway baby and seem vastly contented for half a hour kazan do not move when he be ten day old ba-ree discover there be great sport in tussle with a bit of rabbit fur it be a little later when he make he second exciting discovery -- light and sunshine the sun have now reach a point where in the middle of the afternoon a bright gleam of it find its way through a overhead opening in the windfall at first ba-ree would only stare at the golden streak then come the time when he try to play with it as he play with the rabbit fur each day thereafter he go a little nearer the opening through which kazan pass from the windfall into the big world outside finally come the time when he reach the opening and crouch there blinking and frighten at what he see and now gray wolf no longer try to hold he back but go out into the sunshine and try to call he to she it be three day before he weak eye have grow strong enough to permit he follow she and very quickly after that ba-ree learn to love the sun the warm air and the sweetness of life and to dread the darkness of the closed-in den where he have be bear that this world be not altogether so nice as it at first appear he be very soon to learn at the darken sign of a approach storm one day gray wolf try to lure he back under the windfall it be she first warning to ba-ree and he do not understand where gray wolf fail nature come to teach a first lesson ba-ree be catch in a sudden deluge of rain it flatten he out in pure terror and he be drench and half drown before gray wolf catch he between she jaw and carry he into shelter one by one after this the first strange experience of life come to he and one by one he instinct receive they birth greatest for he of the day to follow be that on which he inquisitive nose touch the raw flesh of a freshly kill and bleed rabbit it be he first taste of blood it be sweet it fill he with a strange excitement and thereafter he know what it mean when kazan bring in something between he jaw he soon begin to battle with stick in place of the soft fur and he tooth grow as hard and as sharp as little needle the great mystery be bare to he at last when kazan bring in between he jaw a big rabbit that be still alive but so badly crushed that it could not run when drop to the ground ba-ree have learn to know what rabbit and partridge mean -- the sweet warm blood that he love better even than he have ever love he mother 's milk but they have come to he dead he have never see one of the monster alive and now the rabbit that kazan drop to the ground kick and struggle with a break back send ba-ree back appal for a few moment he wonderingly watch the die throe of kazan 's prey both kazan and gray wolf seem to understand that this be to be ba-ree 's first lesson in he education as a slaying and flesh-eating creature and they stand close over the rabbit make no effort to end its struggle half a dozen time gray wolf sniff at the rabbit and then turn she blind face toward ba-ree after the third or fourth time kazan stretch himself out on he belly a few foot away and watch the proceedings attentively each time that gray wolf lower she head to muzzle the rabbit ba-ree 's little ear shoot up expectantly when he see that nothing happen and that he mother be not hurt he come a little nearer soon he could reach out stiff-legged and cautious and touch the furry thing that be not yet dead in a last spasmodic convulsion the big rabbit double up its rear leg and give a kick that send ba-ree sprawl back yelp in terror he regain he foot and then for the first time anger and the desire to retaliate take possession of he the kick have complete he first education he come back with less caution but stiffer-legged and a moment later have dig he tiny tooth in the rabbit 's neck he could feel the throb of life in the soft body the muscle of the die rabbit twitch convulsively under he and he hang with he tooth until there be no longer a tremor of life in he first kill gray wolf be delighted she caress ba-ree with she tongue and even kazan condescend to sniff approvingly of he son when he return to the rabbit and never before have warm sweet blood taste so good to ba-ree as it do to-day swiftly ba-ree develop from a blood-tasting into a flesh-eating animal one by one the mystery of life be unfold to he -- the mating-night chortle of the gray owl the crash of a fall tree the roll of thunder the rush of run water the scream of a fisher-cat the mooing of the cow moose and the distant call of he tribe but chief of all these mystery that be already become a part of he instinct be the mystery of scent one day he wander fifty yard away from the windfall and he little nose touch the warm scent of a rabbit instantly without reasoning or further process of education he know that to get at the sweet flesh and blood which he love he must follow the scent he wriggle slowly along the trail until he come to a big log over which the rabbit have vault in a long leap and from this log he turn back each day after this he go on adventure of he own at first he be like a explorer without a compass in a vast and unknown world each day he encounter something new always wonderful frequently terrifying but he terror grow less and less and he confidence correspondingly greater as he find that none of the thing he fear do he any harm he become more and more bold in he investigation and he appearance be change as well as he view of thing he round roly-poly body be take a different form he become lithe and quick the yellow of he coat darken and there be a whitish-gray streak along he back like that along kazan 's he have he mother 's under-throat and she beautiful grace of head otherwise he be a true son of kazan he limb give sign of future strength and massiveness he be broad across the chest he eye be wide apart with a little red in the lower corner the forest people know what to expect of husky pup who early develop that drop of red it be a warning that they be bear of the wild and that they mother or father be of the savage hunt-pack in ba-ree that tinge of red be so pronounced that it could mean but one thing while he be almost half dog the wild have claim he forever not until the day of he first real battle with a living creature do ba-ree come fully into he inheritance he have go farther than usual from the windfall -- fully a hundred yard here he find a new wonder it be the creek he have hear it before and he have look down on it from afar -- from a distance of fifty yard at least but to-day he venture go to the edge of it and there he stand for a long time with the water ripple and singing at he foot gaze across it into the new world that he see then he move cautiously along the stream he have not go a dozen step when there be a furious flutter close to he and one of the fierce big-eyed jay of the northland be directly in he path it could not fly one of its wing drag probably break in a struggle with some one of the smaller preying beast but for a instant it be a most startling and defiant bit of life to ba-ree then the grayish crest along he back stiffen and he advance the wound jay remain motionless until ba-ree be within three foot of it in short quick hop it begin to retreat instantly ba-ree 's indecision have fly to the four wind with one sharp excited yelp he fly at the defiant bird for a few moment there be a thrilling race and ba-ree 's sharp little tooth bury themselves in the jay 's feather swift as a flash the bird 's beak begin to strike the jay be the king of the smaller bird in nesting season it kill the brush sparrow the mild-eyed moose-bird and the tree-sapper again and again it strike ba-ree with its powerful beak but the son of kazan have now reach the age of battle and the pain of the blow only make he own tooth sink deeper at last he find the flesh and a puppyish snarl rise in he throat fortunately he have gain a hold under the wing and after the first dozen blow the jay 's resistance grow weaker five minute later ba-ree loosen he tooth and draw back a step to look at the crumpled and motionless creature before he the jay be dead he have win he first battle and with victory come the wonderful dawn of that greatest instinct of all which tell he that no longer be he a drone in the marvelous mechanism of wilderness life -- but a part of it from this time forth _ for he have kill _ half a hour later gray wolf come down over he trail the jay be tear into bit its feather be scatter about and ba-ree 's little nose be bloody ba-ree be lie in triumph beside he victim swiftly gray wolf understand and caress he joyously when they return to the windfall ba-ree carry in he jaw what be leave of the jay from that hour of he first kill hunting become the chief passion of ba-ree 's life when he be not sleep in the sun or under the windfall at night he be seek life that he could destroy he slaughter a entire family of wood-mice moose-bird be at first the easiest for he to stalk and he kill three then he encounter a ermine and the fierce little white outlaw of the forest give he he first defeat defeat cool he ardor for a few day but teach he the great lesson that there be other fanged and flesh-eating animal besides himself and that nature have so schemed thing that fang must not prey upon fang -- _ for food _ many thing have be bear in he instinctively he shun the porcupine without experience the torture of its quill he come face to face with a fisher-cat one day a fortnight after he fight with the ermine both be seek food and as there be no food between they to fight over each go he own way farther and farther ba-ree venture from the windfall always follow the creek sometimes he be go for hour at first gray wolf be restless when he be away but she seldom go with he and after a time she restlessness leave she nature be work swiftly it be kazan who be restless now moonlight night have come and the wanderlust be grow more and more insistent in he vein and gray wolf too be fill with the strange longing to roam at large out into the big world come then the afternoon when ba-ree go on he longest hunt half a mile away he kill he first rabbit he remain beside it until dusk the moon rise big and golden flooding the forest and plain and ridge with a light almost like that of day it be a glorious night and ba-ree find the moon and leave he kill and the direction in which he travel _ be away from the windfall _ all that night gray wolf watch and wait and when at last the moon be sink into the south and west she settle back on she haunch turn she blind face to the sky and send forth she first howl since the day ba-ree be bear nature have come into she own far away ba-ree hear but he do not answer a new world be he he have say good-by to the windfall -- and home chapter xix the usurper it be that glorious season between spring and summer when the northern night be brilliant with moon and star that kazan and gray wolf set up the valley between the two ridge on a long hunt it be the beginning of that _ wanderlust _ which always come to the furred and padded creature of the wilderness immediately after the young-born of early spring have leave they mother to find they own way in the big world they strike west from they winter home under the windfall in the swamp they hunt mostly at night and behind they they leave a trail mark by the partly eat carcass of rabbit and partridge it be the season of slaughter and not of hunger ten mile west of the swamp they kill a fawn this too they leave after a single meal they appetite become satiated with warm flesh and blood they grow sleek and fat and each day they bask longer in the warm sunshine they have few rival the lynx be in the heavier timber to the south there be no wolf fisher-cat marten and mink be numerous along the creek but these be neither swift-hunting nor long-fanged one day they come upon a old otter he be a giant of he kind turn a whitish gray with the approach of summer kazan grow fat and lazy watch he idly blind gray wolf sniff at the fishy smell of he in the air to they he be no more than a float stick a creature out of they element along with the fish and they continue on they way not know that this uncanny creature with the coal-like flapper be soon to become they ally in one of the strange and deadly feud of the wilderness which be as sanguinary to animal life as the deadliest feud of man be to human life the day follow they meeting with the otter gray wolf and kazan continue three mile farther westward still follow the stream here they encounter the interruption to they progress which turn they over the northward ridge the obstacle be a huge beaver dam the dam be two hundred yard in width and flood a mile of swamp and timber above it neither gray wolf nor kazan be deeply interested in beaver they also move out of they element along with the fish and the otter and swift-winged bird so they turn into the north not know that nature have already scheme that they four -- the dog wolf otter and beaver -- should soon be engage in one of those merciless struggle of the wild which keep animal life down to the survival of the fittest and whose tragic history be keep secret under the star and the moon and the wind that tell no tale for many year no man have come into this valley between the two ridge to molest the beaver if a sarcee trapper have follow down the nameless creek and have catch the patriarch and chief of the colony he would at once have judge he to be very old and he indian tongue would have give he a name he would have call he broken tooth because one of the four long tooth with which he fell tree and build dam be break off six year before broken tooth have lead a few beaver of he own age down the stream and they have build they first small dam and they first lodge the follow April broken tooth 's mate have four little baby beaver and each of the other mother in the colony increase the population by two or three or four at the end of the fourth year this first generation of child have they follow the usual law of nature would have mate and leave the colony to build a dam and lodge of they own they mate but do not emigrate the next year the second generation of child now four year old mate but do not leave so that in this early summer of the sixth year the colony be very much like a great city that have be long besiege by a enemy it number fifteen lodge and over a hundred beaver not count the fourth baby which have be bear during march and April the dam have be lengthen until it be fully two hundred yard in length water have be make to flood large area of birch and poplar and tangled swamp of tender willow and elder even with this food be grow scarce and the lodge be overcrowded this be because beaver be almost human in they love for home broken tooth 's lodge be fully nine foot long by seven wide inside and there be now live in it child and grandchild to the number of twenty-seven for this reason broken tooth be prepare to break the precedent of he tribe when kazan and gray wolf sniff carelessly at the strong scent of the beaver city broken tooth be marshal he family and two of he son and they family for the exodus as yet break tooth be the recognize leader in the colony no other beaver have grow to he size and strength he thick body be fully three foot long he weigh at least sixty pound he tail be fourteen inch in length and five in width and on a still night he could strike the water a blow that could be hear a quarter of a mile away he webbed hindfeet be twice as large as he mate 's and he be easily the swiftest swimmer in the colony follow the afternoon when gray wolf and kazan strike into the north come the clear still night when break tooth climb to the top of the dam shake himself and look down to see that he army be behind he the starlit water of the big pond ripple and flash with the movement of many body a few of the older beaver clamber up after broken tooth and the old patriarch plunge down into the narrow stream on the other side of the dam now the shine silken body of the emigrant follow he in the starlight in one and two and three they climb over the dam and with they go a dozen child bear three month before easily and swiftly they begin the journey down-stream the youngster swim furiously to keep up with they parent in all they number forty broken tooth swam well in the lead with he older worker and battler behind he in the rear follow mother and child all of that night the journey continue the otter they deadliest enemy -- deadlier even than man -- hide himself in a thick clump of willow as they pass nature which sometimes see beyond the vision of man have make he the enemy of these creature that be pass he hiding-place in the night a fish-feeder he be bear to be a conserver as well as a destroyer of the creature on which he feed perhaps nature tell he that too many beaver dam stop the run of spawn fish and that where there be many beaver there be always few fish maybe he reason as to why fish-hunting be poor and he go hungry so unable to cope singly with whole tribe of he enemy he work to destroy they dam how this in turn destroy the beaver will be see in the feud in which nature have already scheme that he should play a part with kazan and gray wolf a dozen time during this night broken tooth halt to investigate the food supplies along the bank but in the two or three place where he find plenty of the bark on which they live it would have be difficult to have construct a dam he wonderful engineering instinct rise even above food instinct and when each time he move onward no beaver question he judgment by remain behind in the early dawn they cross the burn and come to the edge of the swamp domain of kazan and gray wolf by right of discovery and possession that swamp belong to the dog and the wolf in every part of it they have leave they mark of ownership but broken tooth be a creature of the water and the scent of he tribe be not keen he lead on travel more slowly when they enter the timber just below the windfall home of kazan and gray wolf he halt and clamber ashore balanced himself upright on he webbed hindfeet and broad four-pound tail here he have find ideal condition a dam could be construct easily across the narrow stream and the water could be make to flood a big supply of poplar birch willow and alder also the place be sheltered by heavy timber so that the winter would be warm broken tooth quickly give he follower to understand that this be to be they new home on both side of the stream they swarm into the near-by timber the baby begin at once to nibble hungrily at the tender bark of willow and alder the older one every one of they now a work engineer investigate excitedly breakfast by nibble off a mouthful of bark now and then that day the work of home-building begin broken tooth himself select a big birch that lean over the stream and begin the work of cut through the ten-inch butt with he three long tooth though the old patriarch have lose one tooth the three that remain have not deteriorate with age the outer edge of they be form of the hardest enamel the inner side be of soft ivory they be like the finest steel chisel the enamel never wear away and the softer ivory replace itself year by year as it be consume sit on he hindleg with he forepaw rest against the tree and with he heavy tail give he a firm balance broken tooth begin gnawing a narrow ring entirely around the tree he work tirelessly for several hour and when at last he stop to rest another workman take up the task meanwhile a dozen beaver be hard at work cut timber long before broken tooth 's tree be ready to fall across the stream a smaller poplar crash into the water the cut on the big birch be in the shape of a hour-glass in twenty hour it fall straight across the creek while the beaver prefer to do most of he work at night he be a day-laborer as well and break tooth give he tribe but little rest during the day that follow with almost human intelligence the little engineer keep at they task smaller tree be fell and these be cut into four or five foot length one by one these length be roll to the stream the beaver push they with they head and forepaw and by means of brush and small limb they be fasten securely against the birch when the framework be complete the wonderful cement construction be begin in this the beaver be the master of man dynamite be the only force that could hereafter break up what they be build now under they cup-like chin the beaver bring from the bank a mixture of mud and fine twig carry from half a pound to a pound at a load and begin fill up the framework with it they task seem tremendous and yet broken tooth 's engineer could carry a ton of this mud and twig mixture during a day and night in three day the water be begin to back until it rise about the butt of a dozen or more tree and be flood a small area of brush this make work easier from now on material could be cut in the water and easily float while a part of the beaver colony be take advantage of the water other be fell tree end to end with the birch lay the work frame of a dam a hundred foot in width they have nearly accomplish this work when one morning kazan and gray wolf return to the swamp chapter xx a feud in the wilderness a soft wind blow from the south and east bring the scent of the invader to gray wolf 's nose when they be still half a mile away she give the warn to kazan and he too find the strange scent in the air it grow stronger as they advance when two hundred yard from the windfall they hear the sudden crash of a fall tree and stop for a full minute they stand tense and listen then the silence be break by a squeak cry follow by a splash gray wolf 's alert ear fall back and she turn she blind face understandingly toward kazan they trot ahead slowly approach the windfall from behind not until they have reach the top of the knoll on which it be situate do kazan begin to see the wonderful change that have take place during they absence astounded they stand while he stare there be no longer a little creek below they where it have be be a pond that reach almost to the foot of the knoll it be fully a hundred foot in width and the backwater have flood the tree and bush for five or six time that distance toward the burn they have come up quietly and break tooth 's dull-scented worker be unaware of they presence not fifty foot away break tooth himself be gnawing at the butt of a tree a equal distance to the right of he four or five of the baby beaver be at play build a miniature dam of mud and tiny twig on the opposite side of the pond be a steep bank six or seven foot high and here a few of the older child -- two year old but still not workman -- be have great fun climb the bank and use it as a toboggan-slide it be they splashing that kazan and gray wolf have hear in a dozen different place the older beaver be at work a few week before kazan have look upon a similar scene when he have return into the north from broken tooth 's old home it have not interested he then but a quick and thrilling change sweep through he now the beaver have cease to be mere water animal uneatable and with a odor that displeased he they be invader -- and enemy he fang bare silently he crest stiffen like the hair of a brush and the muscle of he foreleg and shoulder stand out like whipcord not a sound come from he as he rush down upon broken tooth the old beaver be oblivious of danger until kazan be within twenty foot of he naturally slow of movement on land he stand for a instant stupefied then he swing down from the tree as kazan leap upon he over and over they roll to the edge of the bank carry on by the dog 's momentum in another moment the thick heavy body of the beaver have slip like oil from under kazan and broken tooth be safe in he element two hole bite clean through he fleshy tail baffle in he effort to get a death-hold on broken tooth kazan swing like a flash to the right the young beaver have not move astonished and frightened at what they have see they stand as if stupefy not until they see kazan tear toward they do they awaken to action three of they reach the water the fourth and fifth -- baby beaver not more than three month old -- be too late with a single snap of he jaw kazan break the hack of one the other he pin down by the throat and shake as a terrier shake a rat when gray wolf trot down to he both of the little beaver be dead she sniff at they soft little body and whine perhaps the baby creature remind she of runaway ba-ree she own baby for there be a note of longing in she whine as she nose they it be the mother whine but if gray wolf have vision of she own kazan understand nothing of they he have kill two of the creature that have dare to invade they home to the little beaver he have be as merciless as the gray lynx that have murder gray wolf 's first child on the top of the sun rock now that he have sink he tooth into the flesh of he enemy he blood be fill with a frenzied desire to kill he rave along the edge of the pond snarl at the uneasy water under which broken tooth have disappear all of the beaver have take refuge in the pond and its surface be heave with the passing of many body beneath kazan come to the end of the dam this be new instinctively he know that it be the work of broken tooth and he tribe and for a few moment he tear fiercely at the mat stick and limb suddenly there be a upheaval of water close to the dam fifty foot out from the bank and broken tooth 's big gray head appear for a tense half minute broken tooth and kazan measure each other at that distance then broken tooth draw he wet shine body out of the water to the top of the dam and squat flat face kazan the old patriarch be alone not another beaver have show himself the surface of the pond have now become quiet vainly kazan try to discover a footing that would allow he to reach the watchful invader but between the solid wall of the dam and the bank there be a tangled framework through which the water rush with some violence three time kazan fight to work he way through that tangle and three time he effort end in sudden plunge into the water all this time broken tooth do not move when at last kazan give up the attack the old engineer slip over the edge of the dam and disappear under the water he have learn that kazan like the lynx could not fight water and he spread the news among the member of he colony gray wolf and kazan return to the windfall and lay down in the warm sun half a hour later broken tooth draw himself out on the opposite shore of the pond he be follow by other beaver across the water they resume they work as if nothing have happen the tree-cutter return to they tree half a dozen work in the water carry load of cement and twig the middle of the pond be they dead-line across this not one of they pass a dozen time during the hour that follow one of the beaver swim up to the dead-line and rest there look at the shine little body of the baby that kazan have kill perhaps it be the mother and perhaps some finer instinct unknown to kazan tell this to gray wolf for gray wolf go down twice to sniff at the dead body and each time -- without see -- she go when the mother beaver have come to the dead-line the first fierce animus have worn itself from kazan 's blood and he now watch the beaver closely he have learn that they be not fighter they be many to one and yet they run from he like a lot of rabbit break tooth have not even strike at he and slowly it grow upon he that these invade creature that use both the water and land would have to be hunt as he stalk the rabbit and the partridge early in the afternoon he slip off into the bush follow by gray wolf he have often begin the stalk of a rabbit by move _ away _ from it and he employ this wolf trick now with the beaver beyond the windfall he turn and begin trot up the creek with the wind for a quarter of a mile the creek be deeper than it have ever be one of they old fording place be completely submerge and at last kazan plunge in and swim across leave gray wolf to wait for he on the windfall side of the stream alone he make he way quickly in the direction of the dam travel two hundred yard back from the creek twenty yard below the dam a dense thicket of alder and willow grow close to the creek and kazan take advantage of this he approach within a leap or two of the dam without be see and crouch close to the ground ready to spring forth when the opportunity come most of the beaver be now work in the water the four or five still on shore be close to the water and some distance up-stream after a wait of several minute kazan be almost on the point of stake everything on a wild rush upon he enemy when a movement on the dam attract he attention half-way out two or three beaver be at work strengthen the central structure with cement swift as a flash kazan dart from he cover to the shelter behind the dam here the water be very shallow the main portion of the stream find a passage close to the opposite shore nowhere do it reach to he belly as he wade out he be completely hide from the beaver and the wind be in he favor the noise of run water drown what little sound he make soon he hear the beaver workman over he the branch of the fall birch give he a footing and he clamber up a moment later he head and shoulder appear above the top of the dam scarce a arm 's length away broken tooth be force into place a three-foot length of poplar as big around as a man 's arm he be so busy that he do not hear or see kazan another beaver give the warning as he plunge into the pond broken tooth look up and he eye meet kazan 's bared fang there be no time to turn he throw himself back but it be a moment too late kazan be upon he he long fang sink deep into broken tooth 's neck but the old beaver have throw himself enough back to make kazan lose he footing at the same moment he chisel-like tooth get a firm hold of the loose skin at kazan 's throat thus clinch with kazan 's long tooth bury almost to the beaver 's jugular they plunge down into the deep water of the pond broken tooth weigh sixty pound the instant he strike the water he be in he element and hold tenaciously to the grip he have obtain on kazan 's neck he sink like a chunk of iron kazan be pull completely under the water rush into he mouth he ear eye and nose he be blind and he sens be a roaring tumult but instead of struggle to free himself he hold he breath and bury he tooth deeper they touch the soft bottom and for a moment flounder in the mud then kazan loosen he hold he be fight for he own life now -- and not for broken tooth 's with all of the strength of he powerful limb he struggle to break loose -- to rise to the surface to fresh air to life he clamp he jaw shut know that to breathe be to die on land he could have free himself from break tooth 's hold without a effort but under water the old beaver 's grip be more deadly than would have be the fang of a lynx ashore there be a sudden swirl of water as a second beaver circle close about the struggle pair have he close in with broken tooth kazan 's struggle would quickly have cease but nature have not foresee the day when break tooth would be fight with fang the old patriarch have no particular reason now for hold kazan down he be not vengeful he do not thirst for blood or death finding that he be free and that this strange enemy that have twice leap upon he could do he no harm he loose he hold it be not a moment too soon for kazan he be struggle weakly when he rise to the surface of the water three-quarter drown he succeed in raise he forepaw over a slender branch that project from the dam this give he time to fill he lung with air and to cough forth the water that have almost end he existence for ten minute he cling to the branch before he dare attempt the short swim ashore when he reach the bank he drag himself up weakly all the strength be go from he body he limb shake he jaw hang loose he be beat -- completely beat and a creature without a fang have worst he he feel the abasement of it drench and slink he go to the windfall lay down in the sun and wait for gray wolf day follow in which kazan 's desire to destroy he beaver enemy become the consuming passion of he life each day the dam become more formidable cement work in the water be carry on by the beaver swiftly and safely the water in the pond rise higher each twenty-four hour and the pond grow steadily wider the water have now be turn into the depression that encircle the windfall and in another week or two if the beaver continue they work kazan 's and gray wolf 's home would be nothing more than a small island in the center of a wide area of submerged swamp kazan hunt only for food now and not for pleasure ceaselessly he watch he opportunity to leap upon incautious member of broken tooth 's tribe the third day after the struggle under the water he kill a big beaver that approach too close to the willow thicket the fifth day two of the young beaver wander into the flood depression back of the windfall and kazan catch they in shallow water and tear they into piece after these successful assault the beaver begin to work mostly at night this be to kazan 's advantage for he be a night-hunter on each of two consecutive night he kill a beaver count the young he have kill seven when the otter come never have break tooth be place between two deadlier or more ferocious enemy than the two that now assail he on shore kazan be he master because of he swiftness keener scent and fight trickery in the water the otter be a still greater menace he be swifter than the fish that he catch for food he tooth be like steel needle he be so sleek and slippery that it would have be impossible for they to hold he with they chisel-like tooth could they have catch he the otter like the beaver possess no hunger for blood yet in all the northland he be the greatest destroyer of they kind -- a even greater destroyer than man he come and pass like a plague and it be in the coldest day of winter that greatest destruction come with he in those day he do not assault the beaver in they snug house he do what man could do only with dynamite -- make a embrasure through they dam swiftly the water would fall the surface ice would crash down and the beaver house would be leave out of water then follow death for the beaver -- starvation and cold with the protect water go from about they house the drain pond a chaotic mass of broken ice and the temperature forty or fifty degree below zero they would die within a few hour for the beaver with he thick coat of fur can stand less cold than man through all the long winter the water about he home be as necessary to he as fire to a child but it be summer now and break tooth and he colony have no very great fear of the otter it would cost they some labor to repair the damage he do but there be plenty of food and it be warm for two day the otter frisk about the dam and the deep water of the pond kazan take he for a beaver and try vainly to stalk he the otter regard kazan suspiciously and keep well out of he way neither know that the other be a ally meanwhile the beaver continue they work with greater caution the water in the pond have now rise to a point where the engineer have begin the construction of three lodge on the third day the destructive instinct of the otter begin its work he begin to examine the dam close down to the foundation it be not long before he find a weak spot to begin work on and with he sharp tooth and small bullet-like head he commence he drilling operation inch by inch he work he way through the dam burrowing and gnawing over and under the timber and always through the cement the round hole he make be fully seven inch in diameter in six hour he have cut it through the five-foot base of the dam a torrent of water begin to rush from the pond as if force out by a hydraulic pump kazan and gray wolf be hide in the willow on the south side of the pond when this happen they hear the roar of the stream tear through the embrasure and kazan see the otter crawl up to the top of the dam and shake himself like a huge water-rat within thirty minute the water in the pond have fall perceptibly and the force of the water pour through the hole be constantly increase the outlet in another half hour the foundation of the three lodge which have be lay in about ten inch of water stand on mud not until broken tooth discover that the water be recede from the house do he take alarm he be throw into a panic and very soon every beaver in the colony tear excitedly about the pond they swim swiftly from shore to shore pay no attention to the dead-line now broken tooth and the older workman make for the dam and with a snarling cry the otter plunge down among they and out like a flash for the creek above the pond swiftly the water continue to fall and as it fall the excitement of the beaver increase they forget kazan and gray wolf several of the younger member of the colony draw themselves ashore on the windfall side of the pond and whine softly kazan be about to slip back through the willow when one of the older beaver waddle up through the deepen mud close on he ambush in two leap kazan be upon he with gray wolf a leap behind he the short fierce struggle in the mud be see by the other beaver and they cross swiftly to the opposite side of the pond the water have recede to a half of its greatest width before broken tooth and he workman discover the breach in the wall of the dam the work of repair be begin at once for this work stick and brush of considerable size be necessary and to reach this material the beaver be compel to drag they heavy body through the ten or fifteen yard of soft mud leave by the fall water peril of fang no longer keep they back instinct tell they that they be fight for they existence -- that if the embrasure be not fill up and the water keep in the pond they would very soon be completely expose to they enemy it be a day of slaughter for gray wolf and kazan they kill two more beaver in the mud close to the willow then they cross the creek below the dam and cut off three beaver in the depression behind the windfall there be no escape for these three they be tear into piece farther up the creek kazan catch a young beaver and kill it late in the afternoon the slaughter end broken tooth and he courageous engineer have at last repair the breach and the water in the pond begin to rise half a mile up the creek the big otter be squat on a log bask in the last glow of the setting sun to-morrow he would go and do over again he work of destruction that be he method for he it be play but that strange and unseen arbiter of the forest call o-ee-ki the spirit by those who speak the wild tongue look down at last with mercy upon broken tooth and he death-stricken tribe for in that last glow of sunset kazan and gray wolf slip stealthily up the creek -- to find the otter bask half asleep on the log the day 's work a full stomach and the pool of warm sunlight in which he lay have all combine to make the otter sleepy he be as motionless as the log on which he have stretch himself he be big and gray and old for ten year he have live to prove he cunning superior to that of man vainly trap have be set for he wily trapper have build narrow sluice-way of rock and tree in small stream for he but the old otter have foiled they cunning and escape the steel jaw wait at the lower end of each sluice the trail he leave in soft mud tell of he size a few trapper have see he he soft pelt would long ago have find its way to london pari or berlin have it not be for he cunning he be fit for a princess a duke or a emperor for ten year he have live and escape the demand of the rich but this be summer no trapper would have kill he now for he pelt be worthless nature and instinct both tell he this at this season he do not dread man for there be no man to dread so he lay asleep on the log oblivious to everything but the comfort of sleep and the warmth of the sun soft-footed search still for sign of the furry enemy who have invade they domain kazan slip along the creek gray wolf run close at he shoulder they make no sound and the wind be in they favor -- bring scent toward they it bring the otter smell to kazan and gray wolf it be the scent of a water animal rank and fishy and they take it for the beaver they advance still more cautiously then kazan see the big otter asleep on the log and he give the warn to gray wolf she stop stand with she head throw up while kazan make he stealthy advance the otter stir uneasily it be grow dusk the golden pool of sunlight have fade away back in the darkening timber a owl greet night with its first-low call the otter breathe deeply he whiskered muzzle twitch he be awaken -- stir -- when kazan leap upon he face to face in fair fight the old otter could have give a good account of himself but there be no chance now the wild itself have for the first time in he life become he deadliest enemy it be not man now -- but o-ee-ki the spirit that have lay its hand upon he and from the spirit there be no escape kazan 's fang sink into he soft jugular perhaps he die without know what it be that have leap upon he for he die -- quickly and kazan and gray wolf go on they way hunting still for enemy to slaughter and not know that in the otter they have kill the one ally who would have drive the beaver from they swamp home the day that follow grow more and more hopeless for kazan and gray wolf with the otter go broken tooth and he tribe hold the win hand each day the water back a little farther into the depression surround the windfall by the middle of July only a narrow strip of land connect the windfall hummock with the dry land of the swamp in deep water the beaver now work unmolested inch by inch the water rise until there come the day when it begin to overflow the connect strip for the last time kazan and gray wolf pass from they windfall home and travel up the stream between the two ridge the creek hold a new meaning for they now and as they travel they sniff its odor and listen to its sound with a interest they have never know before it be a interest mingle a little with fear for something in the manner in which the beaver have beat they remind kazan and gray wolf of _ man _ and that night when in the radiance of the big white moon they come within scent of the beaver colony that break tooth have leave they turn quickly northward into the plain thus have brave old broken tooth teach they to respect the flesh and blood and handiwork of he tribe chapter xxi a shot on the sand-bar July and August of 1911 be month of great fire in the northland the swamp home of kazan and gray wolf and the green valley between the two ridge have escape the sea of devastate flame but now as they set forth on they wander adventure again it be not long before they padded foot come in contact with the sear and blacken desolation that have follow so closely after the plague and starvation of the precede winter in he humiliation and defeat after be drive from he swamp home by the beaver kazan lead he blind mate first into the south twenty mile beyond the ridge they strike the fire-killed forest wind from hudson 's bay have drive the flame in a unbroken sea into the west and they have leave not a vestige of life or a patch of green blind gray wolf could not see the blacken world but she _ sense _ it it recall to she memory of that other fire after the battle on the sun rock and all of she wonderful instinct sharpen and develop by she blindness tell she that to the north -- and not south -- lay the hunting-grounds they be seek the strain of dog that be in kazan still pull he south it be not because he seek man for to man he have now become as deadly a enemy as gray wolf herself it be simply dog instinct to travel southward in the face of fire it be wolf instinct to travel northward at the end of the third day gray wolf win they recross the little valley between the two ridge and swing north and west into the athabasca country strike a course that would ultimately bring they to the headwater of the mcfarlane river late in the precede autumn a prospector have come up to fort smith on the slave river with a pickle bottle fill with gold dust and nugget he have make the find on the mcfarlane the first mail have take the news to the outside world and by midwinter the earliest member of a treasure-hunting horde be rush into the country by snow-shoe and dog-sledge other find come thick and fast the mcfarlane be rich in free gold and miner by the score stake out they claim along it and begin work latecomer swing to new field farther north and east and to fort smith come rumor of find richer than those of the yukon a score of man at first -- then a hundred five hundred a thousand -- rush into the new country most of these be from the prairie country to the south and from the placer bed of the saskatchewan and the frazer from the far north travel by way of the mackenzie and the liard come a smaller number of seasoned prospector and adventurer from the yukon -- man who know what it mean to starve and freeze and die by inch one of these late comer be sandy mctrigger there be several reason why sandy have leave the yukon he be in bad with the police who patrol the country west of dawson and he be break in spite of these fact he be one of the best prospector that have ever follow the shore of the klondike he have make discovery run up to a million or two and have promptly lose they through gambling and drink he have no conscience and little fear brutality be the chief thing write in he face he undershot jaw he wide eye low forehead and grizzly mop of red hair proclaim he at once as a man not to be trust beyond one 's own vision or the reach of a bullet it be suspect that he have kill a couple of man and rob other but as yet the police have fail to get anything on he but along with this bad side of he sandy mctrigger possess a coolness and a courage which even he worst enemy could not but admire and also certain mental depths which he unpleasant feature do not proclaim inside of six month red gold city have spring up on the mcfarlane a hundred and fifty mile from fort smith and fort smith be five hundred mile from civilization when sandy come he look over the crude collection of shack gamble house and saloon in the new town and make up he mind that the time be not ripe for any of he inside scheme just yet he gamble a little and win sufficient to buy himself grub and half a outfit a feature of this outfit be a old muzzle-loading rifle sandy who always carry the latest savage on the market laugh at it but it be the best he finances would allow of he start south -- up the mcfarlane beyond a certain point on the river prospector have find no gold sandy push confidently _ beyond _ this point not until he be in new country do he begin he search slowly he work he way up a small tributary whose headwater be fifty or sixty mile to the south and east here and there he find fairly good placer gold he might have pan six or eight dollar ' worth a day with this much he be disgusted week after week he continue to work he way up-stream and the farther he go the poorer he pan become at last only occasionally do he find color after such disgusting week as these sandy be dangerous -- when in the company of other alone he be harmless one afternoon he run he canoe ashore on a white strip of sand this be at a bend where the stream have widen and give promise of at least a few color he have bent down close to the edge of the water when something catch he attention on the wet sand what he see be the footprint of animal two have come down to drink they have stand side by side and the footprint be fresh -- make not more than a hour or two before a gleam of interest shot into sandy 's eye he look behind he and up and down the stream wolf he grunt wish i could ` a ' shoot at 'em with that old minute-gun back there gawd -- listen to that and in broad daylight too he jump to he foot stare off into the bush a quarter of a mile away gray wolf have catch the dreaded scent of man in the wind and be give voice to she warning it be a long wail howl and not until its last echo have die away do sandy mctrigger move then he return to the canoe take out he old gun put a fresh cap on the nipple and disappear quickly over the edge of the bank for a week kazan and gray wolf have be wander about the headwater of the mcfarlane and this be the first time since the precede winter that gray wolf have catch the scent of man in the air when the wind bring the danger-signal to she she be alone two or three minute before the scent come to she kazan have leave she side in swift pursuit of a snow-shoe rabbit and she lay flat on she belly under a bush wait for he in these moment when she be alone gray wolf be constantly sniff the air blindness have develop she scent and hearing until they be next to infallible first she have hear the rattle of sandy mctrigger 's paddle against the side of he canoe a quarter of a mile away scent have follow swiftly five minute after she warning howl kazan stand at she side he head fling up he jaw open and panting sandy have hunt arctic fox and he be use the eskimo tactic now swing in a half-circle until he should come up in the face of the wind kazan catch a single whiff of the man-tainted air and he spine grow stiff but blind gray wolf be keener than the little red-eyed fox of the north she pointed nose slowly follow sandy 's progress she hear a dry stick crack under he foot three hundred yard away she catch the metallic click of he gun-barrel as it strike a birch saple the moment she lose sandy in the wind she whine and rub herself against kazan and trot a few step to the southwest at time such as this kazan seldom refuse to take guidance from she they trot away side by side and by the time sandy be creep up snake-like with the wind in he face kazan be peer from the fringe of river brush down upon the canoe on the white strip of sand when sandy return after a hour of futile stalk two fresh track lead straight down to the canoe he look at they in amazement and then a sinister grin wrinkle he ugly face he chuckle as he go to he kit and dig out a small rubber bag from this he draw a tightly cork bottle fill with gelatine capsule in each little capsule be five grain of strychnine there be dark hint that once upon a time sandy mctrigger have try one of these capsule by drop it in a cup of coffee and give it to a man but the police have never prove it he be expert in the use of poison probably he have kill a thousand fox in he time and he chuckle again as he count out a dozen of the capsule and think how easy it would be to get this inquisitive pair of wolf two or three day before he have kill a caribou and each of the capsule he now roll up in a little ball of deer fat do the work with short stick in place of he finger so that there would be no man-smell cling to the death-bait before sundown sandy set out at right-angle over the plain plant the bait most of they he hang to low bush other he drop in worn rabbit and caribou trail then he return to the creek and cook he supper then next morning he be up early and off to the poison bait the first bait be untouched the second be as he have plant it the third be go a thrill shot through sandy as he look about he somewhere within a radius of two or three hundred yard he would find he game then he glance fall to the ground under the bush where he have hang the poison capsule and a oath break from he lip the bait have not be eat the caribou fat lay scatter under the bush and still imbed in the largest portion of it be the little white capsule -- unbroken it be sandy 's first experience with a wild creature whose instinct be sharpen by blindness and he be puzzle he have never know this to happen before if a fox or a wolf could be lure to the point of touch a bait it follow that the bait be eat sandy go on to the fourth and the fifth bait they be untouched the sixth be tear to piece like the third in this instance the capsule be break and the white powder scatter two more poison bait sandy find pull down in this manner he know that kazan and gray wolf have do the work for he find the mark of they foot in a dozen different place the accumulate bad humor of week of futile labor find vent in he disappointment and anger at last he have find something tangible to curse the failure of he poison bait he accept as a sort of climax to he general bad luck everything be against he he believe and he make up he mind to return to red gold city early in the afternoon he launch he canoe and drift down-stream with the current he be content to let the current do all of the work to-day and he use he paddle just enough to keep he slender craft head on he lean back comfortably and smoke he pipe with the old rifle between he knee the wind be in he face and he keep a sharp watch for game it be late in the afternoon when kazan and gray wolf come out on a sand-bar five or six mile down-stream kazan be lap up the cool water when sandy drift quietly around a bend a hundred yard above they if the wind have be right or if sandy have be use he paddle gray wolf would have detect danger it be the metallic click-click of the old-fashioned lock of sandy 's rifle that awaken she to a sense of peril instantly she be thrill by the nearness of it kazan hear the sound and stop drink to face it in that moment sandy press the trigger a belch of smoke a roar of gunpowder and kazan feel a red-hot stream of fire pass with the swiftness of a lightning-flash through he brain he stumble back he leg give way under he and he crumple down in a limp heap gray wolf dart like a streak off into the bush blind she have not see kazan wilt down upon the white sand not until she be a quarter of a mile away from the terrifying thunder of the white man 's rifle do she stop and wait for he sandy mctrigger ground he canoe on the sand-bar with a exultant yell get you you old devil do not i he cry i would ` a ' get the other too if i would ` a ' have something besides this damned old relic he turn kazan 's head over with the butt of he gun and the leer of satisfaction in he face give place to a sudden look of amazement for the first time he see the collar about kazan 's neck my gawd it be not a wolf he gasp it be a dog sandy mctrigger -- _ a dog _ chapter xxii sandy 's method mctrigger drop on he knee in the sand the look of exultation be go from he face he twist the collar about the dog 's limp neck until he come to the worn plate on which he could make out the faintly engraved letter _ k-a-z-a-n _ he spell the letter out one by one and the look in he face be of one who still disbelieve what he have see and hear a dog he exclaim again a dog sandy mctrigger a ' a -- a beauty he rise to he foot and look down on he victim a pool of blood lay in the white sand at the end of kazan 's nose after a moment sandy bent over to see where he bullet have strike he inspection fill he with a new and greater interest the heavy ball from the muzzle-loader have strike kazan fairly on top of the head it be a glance blow that have not even break the skull and like a flash sandy understand the quiver and twitch of kazan 's shoulder and leg he have think that they be the last muscular throe of death but kazan be not die he be only stunned and would be on he foot again in a few minute sandy be a connoisseur of dog -- of dog that have worn sledge trace he have live among they two-third of he life he could tell they age they value and a part of they history at a glance in the snow he could tell the trail of a mackenzie hound from that of a malemute and the track of a eskimo dog from that of a yukon husky he look at kazan 's foot they be wolf foot and he chuckle kazan be part wild he be big and powerful and sandy thought of the come winter and of the high price that dog would bring at red gold city he go to the canoe and return with a roll of stout moose-hide babiche then he sit down cross-legged in front of kazan and begin make a muzzle he do this by plait babiche thong in the same manner that one do in make the web of a snow-shoe in ten minute he have the muzzle over kazan 's nose and fasten securely about he neck to the dog 's collar he then fasten a ten-foot rope of babiche after that he sit back and wait for kazan to come to life when kazan first lift he head he could not see there be a red film before he eye but this pass away swiftly and he see the man he first instinct be to rise to he foot three time he fall back before he could stand up sandy be squat six foot from he hold the end of the babiche and grin kazan 's fang gleam back he growl and the crest along he spine rise menacingly sandy jump to he foot guess i know what you be figger on he say i have have _ you _ kind before the dam ' wolf have turn you bad a ' you 'll need a whole lot of club before you be right again now look here sandy have take the precaution of bring a thick club along with the babiche he pick it up from where he have drop it in the sand kazan 's strength have fairly return to he now he be no longer dizzy the mist have clear away from he eye before he he see once more he old enemy man -- man and the club all of the wild ferocity of he nature be rouse in a instant without reasoning he know that gray wolf be go and that this man be accountable for she go he know that this man have also bring he he own hurt and what he ascribe to the man he also attribute to the club in he newer undertaking of thing bear of freedom and gray wolf man and club be one and inseparable with a snarl he leap at sandy the man be not expect a direct assault and before he could raise he club or spring aside kazan have land full on he chest the muzzle about kazan 's jaw save he fang that would have tear he throat open snapped harmlessly under the weight of the dog 's body he fall back as if strike down by a catapult as quick as a cat he be on he foot again with the end of the babiche twist several time about he hand kazan leap again and this time he be meet by a furious swing of the club it smash against he shoulder and send he down in the sand before he could recover sandy be upon he with all the fury of a man go mad he shorten the babiche by twist it again and again about he hand and the club rise and fall with the skill and strength of one long accustomed to its use the first blow serve only to add to kazan 's hatred of man and the ferocity and fearlessness of he attack again and again he leap in and each time the club fall upon he with a force that threaten to break he bone there be a tense hard look about sandy 's cruel mouth he have never know a dog like this before and he be a bit nervous even with kazan muzzle three time kazan 's fang would have sink deep in he flesh have it not be for the babiche and if the thong about he jaw should slip or break -- sandy follow up the think with a smashing blow that land on kazan 's head and once more the old battler fall limp upon the sand mctrigger 's breath be come in quick gasp he be almost wind not until the club slip from he hand do he realize how desperate the fight have be before kazan recover from the blow that have stunned he sandy examine the muzzle and strengthen it by add another babiche thong then he drag kazan to a log that high water have throw up on the shore a few yard away and make the end of the babiche rope fast to a dead snag after that he pull he canoe higher up on the sand and begin to prepare camp for the night for some minute after kazan 's stunned sens have become normal he lay motionless watch sandy mctrigger every bone in he body give he pain he jaw be sore and bleed he upper lip be smash where the club have fall one eye be almost close several time sandy come near much pleased at what he regard as the good result of the beat each time he bring the club the third time he prod kazan with it and the dog snarl and snap savagely at the end of it that be what sandy want -- it be a old trick of the dog-slaver instantly he be use the club again until with a whining cry kazan slunk under the protection of the snag to which he be fasten he could scarcely drag himself he right forepaw be smash he hindquarter sink under he for a time after this second beating he could not have escape have he be free sandy be in unusually good humor i 'll take the devil out of you all right he tell kazan for the twentieth time there be nothin ' like beatin 's to make dog a ' wimmin live up to the mark a month from now you 'll be worth two hundred dollar or i 'll skin you alive three or four time before dusk sandy work to rouse kazan 's animosity but there be no longer any desire leave in kazan to fight he two terrific beating and the crush blow of the bullet against he skull have make he sick he lay with he head between he forepaw he eye close and do not see mctrigger he pay no attention to the meat that be throw under he nose he do not know when the last of the sun sink behind the western forest or when the darkness come but at last something

smithsonian lad i be go to need a couple of four-footed friend of you moral caliber and no one know why kazan and the dane draw nearer to the little scientist 's side of the cage as he pull out a big roll of bill and count out six hundred dollar for harker and sandy mctrigger chapter xxiv alone in darkness never have the terror and loneliness of blindness fall upon gray wolf as in the day that follow the shooting of kazan and he capture by sandy mctrigger for hour after the shot she crouch in the bush back from the river wait for he to come to she she have faith that he would come as he have come a thousand time before and she lay close on she belly sniff the air and whine when it bring no scent of she mate day and night be alike a endless chaos of darkness to she now but she know when the sun go down she sense the first deepen shadow of evening and she know that the star be out and that the river lay in moonlight it be a night to roam and after a time she move restlessly about in a small circle on the plain and send out she first inquire call for kazan up from the river come the pungent odor of smoke and instinctively she know that it be this smoke and the nearness of man that be keep kazan from she but she go no nearer than that first circle make by she padded foot blindness have teach she to wait since the day of the battle on the sun rock when the lynx have destroy she eye kazan have never fail she three time she call for he in the early night then she make herself a nest under a _ banskian _ shrub and wait until dawn just how she know when night blot out the last glow of the sun so without see she know when day come not until she feel the warmth of the sun on she back do she anxiety overcome she caution slowly she move toward the river sniff the air and whine there be no longer the smell of smoke in the air and she could not catch the scent of man she follow she own trail back to the sand-bar and in the fringe of thick bush overhang the white shore of the stream she stop and listen after a little she scramble down and go straight to the spot where she and kazan be drink when the shot come and there she nose strike the sand still wet and thick with kazan 's blood she know it be the blood of she mate for the scent of he be all about she in the sand mingle with the man-smell of sandy mctrigger she sniff the trail of he body to the edge of the stream where sandy have drag he to the canoe she find the fall tree to which he have be tie and then she come upon one of the two club that sandy have use to beat wounded kazan into submissiveness it be cover with blood and hair and all at once gray wolf lay back on she haunch and turn she blind face to the sky and there rise from she throat a cry for kazan that drift for mile on the wing of the south wind never have gray wolf give quite that cry before it be not the call that come with the moonlit night and neither be it the hunt-cry nor the she-wolf 's yearning for matehood it carry with it the lament of death and after that one cry gray wolf slink back to the fringe of bush over the river and lay with she face turn to the stream a strange terror fall upon she she have grow accustomed to darkness but never before have she be _ alone _ in that darkness always there have be the guardianship of kazan 's presence she hear the cluck sound of a spruce hen in the bush a few yard away and now that sound come to she as if from out of another world a ground-mouse rustle through the grass close to she forepaw and she snap at it and close she tooth on a rock the muscle of she shoulder twitch tremulously and she shiver as if stricken by intense cold she be terrify by the darkness that shut out the world from she and she paw at she closed eye as if she might open they to light early in the afternoon she wander back on the plain it be different it frighten she and soon she return to the beach and snuggle down under the tree where kazan have lie she be not so frightened here the smell of kazan be strong about she for a hour she lay motionless with she head rest on the club clot with he hair and blood night find she still there and when the moon and the star come out she crawl back into the pit in the white sand that kazan 's body have make under the tree with dawn she go down to the edge of the stream to drink she could not see that the day be almost as dark as night and that the gray-black sky be a chaos of slumber storm but she could smell the presence of it in the thick air and could _ feel _ the fork flash of lightning that roll up with the dense pall from the south and west the distant rumble of thunder grow louder and she huddle herself again under the tree for hour the storm crash over she and the rain fall in a deluge when it have finish she slink out from she shelter like a thing beat vainly she seek for one last scent of kazan the club be wash clean again the sand be white where kazan 's blood have redden it even under the tree there be no sign of he leave until now only the terror of be alone in the pit of darkness that envelop she have oppress gray wolf with afternoon come hunger it be this hunger that draw she from the sand-bar and she wander back into the plain a dozen time she scented game and each time it evade she even a ground-mouse that she corner under a root and dig out with she paw escape she fang thirty-six hour before this kazan and gray wolf have leave a half of they last kill a mile of two farther back on the plain the kill be one of the big barren rabbit and gray wolf turn in its direction she do not require sight to find it in she be develop to its finest point that sixth sense of the animal kingdom the sense of orientation and as straight as a pigeon might have wing its flight she cut through the bush to the spot where they have cache the rabbit a white fox have be there ahead of she and she find only scatter bit of hair and fur what the fox have leave the moose-bird and bush-jay have carry away hungrily gray wolf turn back to the river that night she sleep again where kazan have lie and three time she call for he without answer a heavy dew fall and it drench the last vestige of she mate 's scent out of the sand but still through the day that follow and the day that follow that blind gray wolf cling to the narrow rim of white sand on the fourth day she hunger reach a point where she gnaw the bark from willow bush it be on this day that she make a discovery she be drink when she sensitive nose touch something in the water 's edge that be smooth and bear a faint odor of flesh it be one of the big northern river clam she paw it ashore sniff at the hard shell then she crunch it between she tooth she have never taste sweeter meat than that which she find inside and she begin hunting for other clam she find many of they and eat until she be no longer hungry for three day more she remain on the bar and then one night the call come to she it set she quiver with a strange new excitement -- something that may have be a new hope and in the moonlight she trot nervously up and down the shine strip of sand face now the north and now the south and then the east and the west -- she head fling up listen as if in the soft wind of the night she be try to locate the whispering lure of a wonderful voice and whatever it be that come to she come from out of the south and east off there -- across the barren far beyond the outer edge of the northern timber-line -- be _ home _ and off there in she brute way she reason that she must find kazan the call do not come from they old windfall home in the swamp it come from beyond that and in a flash vision there rise through she blindness a picture of the towering sun rock of the wind trail that lead to it and the cabin on the plain it be there that blindness have come to she it be there that day have end and eternal night have begin and it be there that she have mother she first-born nature have register these thing so that they could never be wipe out of she memory and when the call come it be from the sunlit world where she have last known light and life and have last see the moon and the star in the blue night of the sky and to that call she respond leave the river and its food behind she -- straight out into the face of darkness and starvation no longer fear death or the emptiness of the world she could not see for ahead of she two hundred mile away she could see the sun rock the wind trail the nest of she first-born between the two big rock -- _ and kazan _ chapter xxv the last of mctrigger sixty mile farther north kazan lay at the end of he fine steel chain watch little professor mcgill mix a pail of tallow and bran a dozen yard from he lay the big dane he huge jaw drool in anticipation of the unusual feast which mcgill be prepare he show sign of pleasure when mcgill approach he with a quart of the mixture and he gulp it between he huge jaw the little man with the cold blue eye and the gray-blond hair stroke he back without fear he attitude be different when he turn to kazan he movement be fill with caution and yet he eye and he lip be smile and he give the wolf-dog no evidence of he fear if it could be call fear the little professor who be up in the north country for the smithsonian institution have spend a third of he life among dog he love they and understand they he have write a number of magazine article on dog intellect that have attract wide attention among naturalist it be largely because he love dog and understand they more than most man that he have buy kazan and the big dane on the night when sandy mctrigger and he partner have try to get they to fight to the death in the red gold city saloon the refusal of the two splendid beast to kill each other for the pleasure of the three hundred man who have assemble to witness the fight delight he he have already plan a paper on the incident sandy have tell he the story of kazan 's capture and of he wild mate gray wolf and the professor have ask he a thousand question but each day kazan puzzle he more no amount of kindness on he part could bring a responsive gleam in kazan 's eye not once do kazan signify a willingness to become friend and yet he do not snarl at mcgill or snap at he hand when they come within reach quite frequently sandy mctrigger come over to the little cabin where mcgill be stay and three time kazan leap at the end of he chain to get at he and he white fang gleam as long as sandy be in sight alone with mcgill he become quiet something tell he that mcgill have come as a friend that night when he and the big dane stand shoulder to shoulder in the cage that have be build for a slaughter pen away down in he brute heart he hold mcgill apart from other man he have no desire to harm he he tolerate he but show none of the grow affection of the huge dane it be this fact that puzzle mcgill he have never before know a dog that he could not make love he to-day he place the tallow and bran before kazan and the smile in he face give way to a look of perplexity kazan 's lip have draw suddenly back a fierce snarl roll deep in he throat the hair along he spine stand up he muscle twitch instinctively the professor turn sandy mctrigger have come up quietly behind he he brutal face wear a grin as he look at kazan it be a fool job -- tryin ' to make friend with _ he _ he say then he add with a sudden interested gleam in he eye when you startin ' with first frost reply mcgill it ought to come soon i be go to join sergeant conroy and he party at fond du lac by the first of October and you be go up to fond du lac -- alone query sandy why do not you take a man the little professor laugh softly why he ask i have be through the athabasca waterway a dozen time and know the trail as well as i know broadway besides i like to be alone and the work be not too hard with the current all flow to the north and east sandy be look at the dane with he back to mcgill a exultant gleam shot for a instant into he eye you be take the dog yes sandy light he pipe and speak like one strangely curious must cost a heap to take these trip o ' yourn do not it my last cost about seven thousand dollar this will cost five say mcgill gawd breathe sandy a ' you carry all that along with you be not you afraid -- something might happen -- the little professor be look the other way now the carelessness in he face and manner change he blue eye grow a shade darker a hard smile which sandy do not see hover about he lip for a instant then he turn laugh i be a very light sleeper he say a footstep at night rouse I even a man 's breathing awakes I when i make up my mind that i must be on my guard and besides -- he draw from he pocket a blue-steeled savage automatic -- i know how to use _ this _ he point to a knot in the wall of the cabin observe he say five time he fire at twenty pace and when sandy go up to look at the knot he give a gasp there be one jagged hole where the knot have be pretty good he grin most man could not do better 'n that with a rifle when sandy left mcgill follow he with a suspicious gleam in he eye and a curious smile on he lip then he turn to kazan guess you have get he figger out about right old man he laugh softly i do not blame you very much for want to get he by the throat perhaps -- he shove he hand deep in he pocket and go into the cabin kazan drop he head between he forepaw and lay still with wide-open eye it be late afternoon early in September and each night bring now the first chill breath of autumn kazan watch the last glow of the sun as it fade out of the southern sky darkness always follow swiftly after that and with darkness come more fiercely he wild longing for freedom night after night he have gnaw at he steel chain night after night he have watch the star and the moon and have listen for gray wolf 's call while the big dane lay sleep to-night it be colder than usual and the keen tang of the wind that come fresh from the west stir he strangely it set he blood afire with what the indian call the frost hunger lethargic summer be go and the day and night of hunting be at hand he want to leap out into freedom and run until he be exhaust with gray wolf at he side he know that gray wolf be off there -- where the star hang low in the clear sky and that she be wait he strain at the end of he chain and whine all that night he be restless -- more restless than he have be at any time before once in the far distance he hear a cry that he think be the cry of gray wolf and he answer rouse mcgill from deep sleep it be dawn and the little professor dress himself and come out of the cabin with satisfaction he note the exhilarating snap in the air he wet he finger and hold they above he head chuckle when he find the wind have swing into the north he go to kazan and talk to he among other thing he say this 'll put the black fly to sleep kazan a day or two more of it and we 'll start five day later mcgill lead first the dane and then kazan to a packed canoe sandy mctrigger see they off and kazan watch for a chance to leap at he sandy keep he distance and mcgill watch the two with a thought that set the blood run swiftly behind the mask of he careless smile they have slip a mile down-stream when he lean over and lay a fearless hand on kazan 's head something in the touch of that hand and in the professor 's voice keep kazan from a desire to snap at he he tolerate the friendship with expressionless eye and a motionless body i be begin to fear i would not have much sleep old boy chuckle mcgill ambiguously but i guess i can take a nap now and then with _ you _ along he make camp that night fifteen mile up the lake shore the big dane he fasten to a sapling twenty yard from he small silk tent but kazan 's chain he make fast to the butt of a stunt birch that hold down the tent-flap before he go into the tent for the night mcgill pull out he automatic and examine it with care for three day the journey continue without a mishap along the shore of lake athabasca on the fourth night mcgill pitch he tent in a clump of _ banskian _ pine a hundred yard back from the water all that day the wind have come steadily from behind they and for at least a half of the day the professor have be watch kazan closely from the west there have now and then come a scent that stir he uneasily since noon he have sniff that wind twice mcgill have hear he growling deep in he throat and once when the scent have come stronger than usual he have bare he fang and the bristle stand up along he spine for a hour after striking camp the little professor do not build a fire but sit look up the shore of the lake through he hunting glass it be dusk when he return to where he have put up he tent and chained the dog for a few moment he stand unobserved look at the wolf-dog kazan be still uneasy he lay _ face _ the west mcgill make note of this for the big dane lay behind kazan -- to the east under ordinary condition kazan would have face he he be sure now that there be something in the west wind a little shiver run up he back as he think of what it might be behind a rock he build a very small fire and prepared supper after this he go into the tent and when he come out he carry a blanket under he arm he chuckle as he stand for a moment over kazan we be not go to sleep in there to-night old hoy he say i do not like what you have find in the west wind it may he a -- _ thunder-storm _ he laugh at he joke and bury himself in a clump of stunt _ banskian _ thirty pace from the tent here he roll himself in he blanket and go to sleep it be a quiet starlit night and hour afterward kazan drop he nose between he forepaw and drowse it be the snap of a twig that rouse he the sound do not awaken the sluggish dane but instantly kazan 's head be alert he keen nostril sniff the air what he have smell all day be heavy about he now he lay still and quiver slowly from out of the _ banskian _ behind the tent there come a figure it be not the little professor it approach cautiously with lowered head and hunch shoulder and the starlight reveal the murderous face of sandy mctrigger kazan crouch low he lay he head flat between he forepaw he long fang gleam but he make no sound that betray he concealment under a thick _ banskian _ shrub step by step sandy approach and at last he reach the flap of the tent he do not carry a club or a whip in he hand now in the place of either of those be the glitter of steel at the door to the tent he pause and peer in he back to kazan silently swiftly -- the wolf now in every movement kazan come to he foot he forget the chain that hold he ten foot away stand the enemy he hate above all other he have ever know every ounce of strength in he splendid body gather itself for the spring and then he leap this time the chain do not pull he back almost neck-broken age and the element have weaken the leather collar he have worn since the day of he slavery in the trace and it give way with a snap sandy turn and in a second leap kazan 's fang sink into the flesh of he arm with a startled cry the man fall and as they roll over on the ground the big dane 's deep voice roll out in thunderous alarm as he tug at he leash in the fall kazan 's hold be break in a instant he be on he foot ready for another attack and then the change come he be _ free _ the collar be go from he neck the forest the star the whispering wind be all about he _ here _ be man and off there be -- gray wolf he ear drop and he turn swiftly and slip like a shadow back into the glorious freedom of he world a hundred yard away something stop he for a instant it be not the big dane 's voice but the sharp _ crack -- crack -- crack _ of the little professor 's automatic and above that sound there rise the voice of sandy mctrigger in a weird and terrible cry chapter xxvi a empty world mile after mile kazan go on for a time he be oppress by the shiver note of death that have come to he in sandy mctrigger 's cry and he slip through the _ banskian _ like a shadow he ear flatten he tail trail he hindquarter betray that curious slink quality of the wolf and dog steal away from danger then he come out upon a plain and the stillness the billion star in the clear vault of the sky and the keen air that carry with it a breath of the arctic barren make he alert and question he face the direction of the wind somewhere off there far to the south and west be gray wolf for the first time in many week he sit back on he haunch and give the deep and vibrant call that echo weirdly for mile about he back in the _ banskian _ the big dane hear it and whine from over the still body of sandy mctrigger the little professor look up with a white tense face and listen for a second cry but instinct tell kazan that to that first call there would be no answer and now he strike out swiftly gallop mile after mile as a dog follow the trail of its master home he do not turn hack to the lake nor be he direction toward red gold city as straight as he might have follow a road blaze by the hand of man he cut across the forty mile of plain and swamp and forest and rocky ridge that lay between he and the mcfarlane all that night he do not call again for gray wolf with he reasoning be a process bring about by habit -- by precedent -- and as gray wolf have wait for he many time before he know that she would be wait for he now near the sand-bar by dawn he have reach the river within three mile of the sand-bar scarcely be the sun up when he stand on the white strip of sand where he and gray wolf have come down to drink expectantly and confidently he look about he for gray wolf whine softly and wag he tail he begin to search for she scent but rain have wash even she footprint from the clean sand all that day he search for she along the river and out on the plain he go to where they have kill they last rabbit he sniff at the bush where the poison bait have hang again and again he sit back on he haunch and send out he mating cry to she and slowly as he do these thing nature be work in he that miracle of the wild which the cree have name the spirit call as it have work in gray wolf so now it stir the blood of kazan with the going of the sun and the sweeping about he of shadowy night he turn more and more to the south and east he whole world be make up of the trail over which he have hunt beyond those place he do not know that there be such a thing as existence and in that world small in he understanding of thing be gray wolf he could not miss she that world in he comprehension of it run from the mcfarlane in a narrow trail through the forest and over the plain to the little valley from which the beaver have drive they if gray wolf be not here -- she be there and tirelessly he resume he quest of she not until the star be fading out of the sky again and gray day be give place to night do exhaustion and hunger stop he he kill a rabbit and for hour after he have feast he lay close to he kill and sleep then he go on the fourth night he come to the little valley between the two ridge and under the star more brilliant now in the chill clearness of the early autumn night he follow the creek down into they old swamp home it be broad day when he reach the edge of the great beaver pond that now completely surround the windfall under which gray-wolf 's second-born have come into the world broken tooth and the other beaver have work a big change in what have once be he home and gray wolf 's and for many minute kazan stand silent and motionless at the edge of the pond sniff the air heavy with the unpleasant odor of the usurper until now he spirit have remain unbroken footsore with thin side and gaunt head he circle slowly through the swamp all that
