he of they unreal and unsatisfying nature ever strive to believe that complete satisfaction be to be find in material thing he be conscious of a inward and persistent revolt against this belief which revolt be at once a refutation of he essential mortality and a inherent and imperishable proof that only in the immortal the eternal the infinite can he find abide satisfaction and unbroken peace and

blinded eye and god alone can see the form of god i seek to solve this hidden mystery vainly by path of blindness and of pain but when i find the way of love and peace concealment cease and i be blind no more : then see i god e ` en with the eye of god saint sage and savior : the law of service the spirit of love which be manifest as a perfect and round life be the crown of be and the supreme end of knowledge upon this earth the measure of a man 's truth be the measure of he love and truth be far remove from he whose life be not govern by love the intolerant and condemnatory even though they profess the highest religion have the smallest measure of truth while those who exercise patience and who listen calmly and dispassionately to all side and both arrive themselves at and incline other to thoughtful and unbiased conclusion upon all problem and issue have truth in fullest measure the final test of wisdom be this -- how do a man live what spirit do he manifest how do he act under trial and temptation many man boast of be in possession of truth who be continually sway by grief disappointment and passion and who sink under the first little trial that come along truth be nothing if not unchangeable and in so far as a man take he stand upon truth do he become steadfast in virtue do he rise superior to he passion and emotion and changeable personality man formulate perishable dogma and call they truth truth can not be formulate it be ineffable and ever beyond the reach of intellect it can only be experience by practice it can only be manifest as a stainless heart and a perfect life who then in the midst of the ceaseless pandemonium of school and creed and party have the truth he who live it he who practice it he who have rise above that pandemonium by overcome himself no longer engage in it but sit apart quiet subdue calm and self-possessed free from all strife all bias all condemnation and bestow upon all the glad and unselfish love of the divinity within he he who be patient calm gentle and forgiving under all circumstance manifest the truth truth will never be prove by wordy argument and learn treatise for if man do not perceive the truth in infinite patience undying forgiveness and all-embracing compassion no word can ever prove it to they it be a easy matter for the passionate to be calm and patient when they be alone or be in the midst of calmness it be equally easy for the uncharitable to be gentle and kind when they be deal kindly with but he who retain he patience and calmness under all trial who remain sublimely meek and gentle under the most try circumstance he and he alone be possess of the spotless truth and this be so because such lofty virtue belong to the divine and can only be manifest by one who have attain to the highest wisdom who have relinquish he passionate and self-seeking nature who have realize the supreme and unchangeable law and have bring himself into harmony with it let man therefore cease from vain and passionate argument about truth and let they think and say and do those thing which make for harmony peace love and good-will let they practice heart-virtue and search humbly and diligently for the truth which free the soul from all error and sin from all that blight the human heart and that darken as with unending night the pathway of the wander soul of earth there be one great all-embracing law which be the foundation and cause of the universe the law of love it have be call by many name in various country and at various time but behind all its name the same unalterable law may be discover by the eye of truth name religion personality pass away but the law of love remain to become possess of a knowledge of this law to enter into conscious harmony with it be to become immortal invincible indestructible it be because of the effort of the soul to realize this law that man come again and again to live to suffer and to die and when realize suffer cease personality be disperse and the fleshly life and death be destroy for consciousness become one with the eternal the law be absolutely impersonal and its highest manifest expression be that of service when the purify heart have realize truth it be then call upon to make the last the greatest and holiest sacrifice the sacrifice of the well-earned enjoyment of truth it be by virtue of this sacrifice that the divinely-emancipated soul come to dwell among man clothe with a body of flesh content to dwell among the lowliest and least and to be esteem the servant of all mankind that sublime humility which be manifest by the world 's savior be the seal of godhead and he who have annihilate the personality and have become a living visible manifestation of the impersonal eternal boundless spirit of love be alone single out as worthy to receive the unstinted worship of posterity he only who succeed in humbling himself with that divine humility which be not only the extinction of self but be also the pour

manifestation of the great impersonal law and be such be free from passion and prejudice and have no opinion and no special letter of doctrine to preach and defend they never seek to convert and to proselytize living in the highest goodness the supreme perfection they sole object be to uplift mankind by manifest that goodness in think word and deed they stand between man the personal and god the impersonal and serve as exemplary type for the salvation of self-enslaved mankind man who be immerse in self and who can not comprehend the goodness that be absolutely impersonal deny divinity to all savior except they own and thus introduce personal hatred and doctrinal controversy and while defend they own particular view with passion look upon each other as be heathen or infidel and so render null and void as far as they life be concern the unselfish beauty and holy grandeur of the life and teaching of they own master truth can not be limit it can never be the special prerogative of any man school or nation and when personality step in truth be lose the glory alike of the saint the sage and the savior be this -- that he have realize the most profound lowliness the most sublime unselfishness have give up all even he own personality all he work be holy and endure for they be free from every taint of self he give yet never think of receive he work without regret the past or

element and wait patiently for the course of time to bring about the harvest and that no amount of expectancy on he part will affect the result even so he who have realize truth go forth as a sower of the seed of goodness purity love and peace without expectancy and never look for result know that there be the great over-ruling law which bring about its own harvest in due time and which be alike the source of preservation and destruction man not understand the divine simplicity of a profoundly unselfish heart look upon they particular savior as the manifestation of a special miracle as be
