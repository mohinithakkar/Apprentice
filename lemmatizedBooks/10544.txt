the first to start the scandal about ann and jeffry and lose no time in convey it to the ear of the hon michael with profuse embellishment at the croquet party the hon michael have be particularly sweet on ann he ardor find vent in such demonstration as throw kiss at she slyly hold up print lozenge for she inspection or toss stick at she and dodge behind a tree and when mr ladle go to ann 's room next day for a good square scold she find she out now mr ladle be a mother-in-law and consequently a pretty old fowl in ferret out thing of this sort she determine to discover the why and wherefore of ann 's departure if she could confront the hon michael with proof of ann 's indiscretion it would be the loudest kind of feather in she cap she examine everybody in the house and everybody that go by the house but without the smallest result she be out in the front yard wait for a fresh victim when she see hersey deathbury come up the road she sign to she to come in she come in hersey deathbury be a extraordinary woman a woman of genius sir what if she make-up _ be _ limited what if when she be bear nature _ be _ economize and give she only one eye and she be lame and hump-backed and have not get any eyebrow and wear a wig what of that it be to she credit _ i _ say you see she just as she be no air _ there _ and in this lay the great charm of h deathbury 's character look at she closely you would see a fix and stony eye and a chronic scowl and you would say : disposition a little morose some man have sour on she look at she more closely you would see under she right arm a common blackboard such as be use in school and over she shoulder a canvas bag contain lump of chalk and you would say : a little eccentric likes to write on the blackboard instead of talk would make a nice wife look on the whole like a country schoolma'am whom the boy have stone out of town with the fixture of the school-house tie to she but she have talent what be she a authoress yes she be but like other authoress she be not appreciate and have return to she legitimate occupation the wash-tub but still doth she itch for fame and so between time she write verbose essay on female suffrage compose during the process know as wringing and when there be a woman 's rights convention in that locality she sit on the platform and applaud all the red-hot resolution with

by any possibility become much leaner without pine entirely away nevertheless it have be the only hotel that spunkville could boast all within a short period of this write like most western hotel it have be ably support by a large float population know as new york drummer and many a time have its old wall re-echoed with they guileless hilarity and moral tale and if the ancient and time-honored spittoon in the bar-room could speak it could relate wonderful story concern the sample gentry relate perhaps to a spunkville merchant who have retreat precipitately down he cellar stair several tune during the day to avoid they confound drummer with they everlasting sample be while plod he lonely way homeward seize upon by these commercial freebooter convey forthwith to the half-way house and there deluge with such a perfect torrent of brow-beating eloquence as to reduce he to a imbecile state in which condition he would willingly order large bill of goods a custom still somewhat in vogue and know as commanding trade at other time it be refresh to see a drummer emerge from a week 's carousal take a drink of plain soda and write a long letter to he employer concern the extreme dulness of trade but since the new hotel have be build the half-way house have wane and its quiet be only invade by a occasional straggle traveller or a runaway couple and its wall resound with nothing more

load to the muzzle with beautiful moral essay which they try to cram down everybody 's throat but never practice themselves she formerly keep a boarding-house in the city where at table regularly after soup she would regale those present with long dissertation on the shocking immorality of the present day vary the monotony perhaps by allusion to the boarder who have just leave mr simpson be a

grub after stump in a ten-acre lot dentist make capital philologist -- : they be so much accustomed to digging for root it be rather dull work to shovel around in the anglo-saxon stratum but as soon as you strike the sanscrit then you be off and if you do not find big nugget it be because -- well it be because there be none there sometimes you dig down to about the time when noah go on he little sailing excursion and strike what seem to be a first-class sockdolager of root but what be the use unfortunately the philology business be overdo it be chock full of first-class break down pedagogue and unsuccessful ink-slinger and as soon as you offer a curious specimen in the way of root they write a book to prove that the root do not exist or if it do that it should not however there be a advantage in know the root of word and the use to which they be put in former year everybody you know be very anxious to read chaucer and spenser now after you have study this subject about forty-two year you will be able to read chaucer with the aid of a old english dictionary and a anglo-saxon grammar many so-called philologist who have precede I have ignorantly derive word from improper source thus the compound word shoofly have be trace by some to the irish word _ shoe _ mean a hoof-covering and the french word _ fly _ mean a insect when it be apparent to even the casual observer that it come from the guinea word _ shoo _ mean get out and the english word _ fly _ mean a tripe destroyer i propose therefore to show you the origin of a few word in order that you may use they properly and in order that you may subscribe freely for my book on this subject which will shortly be place before a admiring public _ theater _ when the player be servant of the king they be compel to be proficient in read rite rithmetic rhyming riddle recite rehearse and romp these accomplishment be group together and call _ the 8 r 's _ which name naturally enough be soon apply to the play-house this example show how simple the whole subject be and how easily the philology business could he run by a child six year of age _ country _ the origin of this word be to say the least odd city people be accustom to visit the rural district at about the time when rye be ripe and they be generally amuse by the farmer 's peregination around he rye farmer always count rye-stack in the morning in order to discover whether any of they have be lift during the night when upon they return to the city the visitor be ask where they have be they facetiously reply to count rye this soon become a favorite expression the e be drop for euphony and the rural district be call country _ spittoon _ -- this word come from the greek word _ spit _ mean to slobber and the scotch word _ tune _ mean the noise make by the bag-pipe as the saliva strike the receptacle it make a noise delightful to the ear of the smoker and resemble the note of the national instrument of scotland hence the receptacle be call the spittoon _ politics _ -- quack philologist who evidently be insane have go back to the classic for the root of this word when it be well know that immediately after the termination of the revolution when the government of this country be about to be settle the word come into existence a woman call polly keep a corner grocery in new york and all the fellow who want office be accustom to go to polly 's for they beer because she trust here they usually divulge they idea of the manner in which the government machine should be run when ask why they go to that store they always answer polly tick outsider when ask what be go on in polly 's store always answer with a wise look polly tick the word soon spread and talk about the government be facetiously call polly tick the expression be finally use in earnest and by euphoric change reach its present shape _ cheese-it _ -- this compound word have by some silly person be trace to the saxon _ cyse _ meaning condensed cow and the celtic _ it _ mean it now every way-faring man even though _ non compo menti _ know that when he be invite to come in and cut a cheese come in and take a drop of whiskey be mean this word then be derive from the sanscrit _ cheese _ mean drop and the english _ it _ mean whatever you may happen to be say and the whole expression may be properly translate drop that yarn i might go on straight through the dictionary but i refrain desire only to show you what a light and entertaining subject philology be and what quantity of fun you can get out of it on winter evening if any one should desire to pursue this subject further let he go through chaucer spenser shakspeare and milton with a fine-tooth comb and a pair of spectacles look for root and then try my book on word and they use he have better not

be to a handsome gallant young fellow such as mr lester wallack impersonate in _ ours _ or _ school _ to which she reply what be roomy eye dear -lrb- be she fourth cousin by marriage i be a sort of maiden aunt to she -- whence this respectful familiarity -rrb- eye in which there be room for the honest glance that never show themselves ' i sternly remark that nice girl never pun yes she reply punning like beer and other vice be the peculiar prerogative of man i suppose but you need not be afraid i read punchinello sometimes and it be a terrible warning to people who be tempt to pun i could give you frightful instance of the appalling depth to which the man who make pun in punchinello occasionally sink i hastily close the discussion by invite she to come to wallack 's and see a old comedy so we find ourselves on the follow evening in the only theater in the country where that rather important adjunct of a theater -- a company -- be to be find there be quantity of elegant dress in the house -- the lady have a idea that a old comedy be one of those thing which every fashionable person ought to see there be also number of nice young man who be the burning and shine light of fashionable society -lrb- after they day 's work behind the counter be end -rrb- come to be bore by the old comedy with a heroism which prove how immeasurably superior to the influence of tape and calico be they youthful soul by the by it be one of the unavoidable _ désagréments _ of new york society that the wearer of the elegant dress be often conscious that she partner in the waltz know precisely how many yard of material compose she skirt and exactly how much it cost per yard for the excellent reason that he himself measure it with he professional yard-stick and cut it with he private scissors this however be a subject that belong not to old comedy but to the extremely modern comedy of new york society the two resemble each other only so far as they be fashionable and dull but to we wallackian old comedy the curtain rise upon the veteran gilbert and the handsome rockwell they converse in the following style : gilbert -- well you young dog ha ha so you have decide to make you old uncle happy by marry my neighbor 's daughter gad i remember my own wedding-day well well we will not talk about that now but hark ye you young villain if you do not marry the girl i cut you off with a shill rockwell -- my dear uncle i can have no greater pleasure than to fulfil you wish but suppose we adorable young neighbor have the ill-breeding to refuse I gilbert -- refuse you refuse my nephew gad i would like to see thoma oldboy permit he daughter to refuse my nephew i would -- d -- e i would -- -lrb- choke and stamp with rage -rrb- further on we meet with miss oldboy and she mother -- the latter a stout old lady addict to smell salt and yellow silk lydium oldboy -- to-day i be expect the arrival of young wildoat who come to pay he address to I i wonder if he be like that dear delightful thaddeus of warsaw mr oldboy -- now miss remember that you honor father insist upon this match i expect you to be a dutiful daughter and accede to he wish here come the young man himself rockwell -- my dear mrs oldboy i be charm to see you you be look positively younger than you ravishingly beautiful daughter fair lydium i come to lay my heart at you foot ` tis the wish of my uncle and you honor father that we should unite we respective house let I touch that exquisite hand unseal those ruby lip and tell I that i be the happiest of man here the uncle and oldboy enter they

the wheelbarrow my wife and all the above line be write when the author be quite advance in year when he have solve in he humble way the great problem of life and discover the futility of mundane thing generally and t undesirableness of a unsuccessful or unfortunate existence when he could look back through a long vista of year and see the folly of he youth and the mistake of he manhood it should have be place at the end of he book with only the word finis after it but somehow either by mistake of the author or of the publisher it be place among the record of the simple event of the village and thus lose half its force however let the history place as it be be a warn to rash young man who contemplate matrimony and let they give heed to it lest they also have cause to repent of they doings and exclaim with the poet : -- the deuce take it observe how pathetic and touch he reminiscence of he lose youth and the priceless boon of liberty he commence in a quiet descriptive way leave one at a loss to know whether it be to be a joyful lyric a dirge he intend singing when i be a bachelor i live by myself all the bread and cheese i have i lay upon the shelf here we have he

of bread and cheese in tell we he lay he bread and cheese upon the shelf he at once show he have leave he parental abode and the ministering and watchful care of he maternal parent there must of course have be a cause for such a step some reason why the gentle be should have be work up to that pitch when he daringly throw off all restraint and step into the world to act and think for himself it may have be the want of sympathy that drive he to the act they be plain folk and do not appreciate he peculiar turn of mind and so only laugh at he and ridicule he pretension that there be a quarrel there be no manner of doubt and it be probably cause by the mortifying act of he mother in faint when he read she the poetry he have write at she request that in itself be enough to break all tie between they she be horrify and overwhelm with dismay that a child of hers could be guilty of such atrocious rhyme and he in turn be disgust that a mother of he should be so unappreciative and earthly and so by mutual consent they separate that account for he bachelor habit of lay he bread and cheese on the shelf that he might have it handy and not forget where he have place it but as the rat and mouse make such a strife he find that would never do something else must be think of and be a inventive genius he try put it in he trunk but it scented he Sunday jacket and trousers and the girl all turn up they nose at the odd perfume so drive to extremity he in a evil hour decide as many another have since do that the remedy for he ill be matrimony and that it be not well for man to live alone a prophet be without honor in he own country and so ofttime be a poet to he bashful supplication of wilt thou the young maiden if he village unhesitatingly refuse to wilt and thus it be that circumstance force he to go to london to buy himself a wife how fortunate that he should give we inadvertently as it be the information so necessary to the unlucky young man of this later day the

to suit pay the price and bag the article it can all be do in a day and save time wonderfully he buy he wife -- a cheap one undoubtedly -- and give he promise to pay then start homeward feel he importance as a married man and chuckle over the idea of the astonishment and dismay of the rat and mouse when he should set he wife after they and thereby deprive they of they daily ration but while muse thus he discover he wile show sign of fatigue as the road be bad and the lane be narrow and not wish to have she exhaust before commence business he gallantly determine to give she a ride well know she would need all she strength for the battle he intend she should win so borrow a wheelbarrow of a trust neighbor he seat she therein and amid great rejoice at he extraordinary luck he set

that each may picture it to suit themselves after the excitement occasion by the catastrophe be somewhat abate he pick up the piece and try to put the wheelbarrow together again but it be too far go

the rest of he trouble be a little too much and after fumble over the piece a while i tell you so ring in he ear he completely lose he temper and vent he passion in the word : -- the deuce take the wheelbarrow -- and then in a low voice cautiously turn he head aside he add : -- my wife and all together they trudge homeward fearful misgiving as to the wisdom of he step come swoop down upon he and he almost wish he have not try to mend matter but have patiently bear with the rat when suddenly -- the vision of a _ cat _ sweep athwart he mind and he groan aloud in bitterness of spirit not even

decline then it be offer to col cannonayde who decline it because he mother-in-law declare that she would go along too if he go and he think it would be better not to let she have a change of air as she be in a fair way to wind up pretty soon by remain near those swamp cannonayde want the place keep open till after the funeral but this be not grant the next offer be make to gen brayleigh but _ he _ refuse it on the ground that he have make arrangement for go into the coal trade and he could not be sure of hold the place more than a few week anyway he think it would not pay to give up the coalition he have enter into with another party in fact old brayleigh treat the whole matter very coldly it be next tender to the hon theophilus skinner but peremptorily decline because skinner 's district have become democratic since he be elect and he know that if he resign a infamous cannibal copperhead would be send to congress in he stead skinner consult all the leader of he party and they unanimously agree that it would be better to let every court in europe be without a american representative than risk the loss of that district everybody know why the rev dr bangwell of chicago do not accept it the doctor expect he divorce case to come on in a few day and could not neglect that and besides he have make all the arrangement for he other marriage and send out the invitation if the president have just make some inquiry before appoint dr bangwell he could have find out that the doctor 's engagement would not permit he to leave chicago on any account the offer that be make to col kampstuhl be decline solely because the colonel have a old score to settle with gen grant for something in the way of a court-martial that happen near tricksburg he swear that he would get square with the author of that business sometime and when the mission be offer to he -lrb- by accident for gen grant have forget all about the court-martial -rrb- he get up a sepulchral voice and say ha ha r-e-e-e-vendge at last and then write a bitter letter to washington on the subject after that it be peddle all round the country in a promiscuous way and offer in succession to a blacksmith who use to shoe horse for gen grant a conductor who refuse to take fare from a well-known presidential excursion party a dealer in hide who have confer some high obligation when a certain official be in the tanning business a grocery-keeper a family shoemaker a manufacturer of match and such a multitude of people in fact that it finally get to be look upon as the greatest missionary undertaking of modern time the only really prominent man that the place be not tender to be george francis train but i would not say that it will not get around to he somewhere in asia before the circle be complete all these thing be very well know to I before the office be place at my disposal but i do not care to wind the fine sensibility of the president by say anything about they in my note my reason for decline in favor of mr greeley have be state -- i put the whole matter frankly to gen grant -- but i can not say whether the suggestion i offer have be act upon or not the only thing i be certain about on this point be that if the offer should be make to horace it will not get around to george francis afterwards there have be so much talk about this business that i have consider it a sacred duty to state the fact and let some flood of light shine upon the whole thing the duty be now conscientiously discharge darby dodd \* \* \* \* \* the truth in a nut-shell chancellor crosby in he inaugural address have we may say bored right to the root of the whole vexed question of education and extract it as will be see from this extract : it need hardly be urge say the new chancellor and we hope all the discontented will take the full force of the remark it need hardly be urge that the didaskalo should be didaktito and yet perhaps emphasis on so plain a truth may be sometimes necessary let we
